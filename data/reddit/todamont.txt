I'm a computer engineer who writes parallel algorithms and big-data processing routines for a living. Scalability needs to be addressed before the pipes are too small and the hard-drives get too expensive. You don't wait for your code to break before you try to fix it.

Sure, but designing a microchip to do what an FPGA does would be very very time consuming and expensive. FPGAs really are ideally suited to elliptic curve cryptocraphy because they can be made into nearly completely parallel multipliers, so benefits from such a ground-up ASIC chip would be minimal unless they used some super-modern architectures and power distribution schemes. I don't see a custom ASIC chip like that hitting the market until bitcoin has a market cap of at least a billion, until then it would be easier to just spoof the market to hurt stability.

You are wrong. Anyone can just start a new wallet at any time, or generate a new receiving address directly at an exchange. Governments trying to flag "tainted" addresses will have no effect on usage. Bitcoin can be used completely anonymously, but it does take some effort. 


You mean to convert bitcoin back into fiat currency, through government-affiliated banking networks, right?

This article makes an interesting point. If exchanges start suing or implicating private foreign bucket-houses for fraud, as in the recent Bitcoinica scandal for example, there is a serious risk that bitcoin could be formally outlawed in a large group of countries and exchanges could become more risky and difficult to access and/or run. We should push the idea that bitcoin is a commodity, since it already exists (mathematical keypairs just waiting to be found) and is mined using actual energy, and is rare / limited in quantity. This demarcation between commodity and currency will become more important in a legal sense as bitcoin becomes a larger economy and grows in recognition.

ati card? use aticonfig --odgt to monitor the temp. Make sure your fan setting is high enough while mining to stay under your desired temp range, no higher than 70C for sure. Oh yeah, this assumes you can manually control the fan / that it wasn't on 100% before...

So what happens when two "conflict resolution services" disagree? They battle? So what you are advocating is a market for force. There is no such thing as a market for force, force distorts markets. To say there could be a market for force is to equate the use of force to the voluntary exchange of value for value. Anyhow, why can't a government judiciary systems be provided by voluntary funding sources? I think contract insurance and tariffs / voluntary excise taxes could do just fine to fund a single central government judiciary system. The alternative is to advocate for "splitting" of judiciary systems, why is that better? It leads to more violent conflict...
@_date: 2012-07-17 13:12:49
Probably hedged investors trying to liquidate each other... Actually this indicates the market is too shallow to be stable yet. We need to get more people into bitcoin, the distribution phase is not over yet. As developers, we need to write secure applications and value-added services to attract new users. Also, wasn't there a huge bitcoin theft from bitcoinica last week? It could be those stolen coins being liquidated.
@_date: 2012-11-12 17:35:36

This is the cost assuming mining on CPUs on Blue Gene Q supercomputers, to have a 51% chance at successfully getting away with a double-spend, for 1 block. You would probably be better off just buying Butterfly Labs out and going ASIC. The ramp-up time and inflexible market for Sequoia computers would mean ASICs would be out before you ramp up, and the difficulty is going to rise very fast once that happens. It would be easier to inject instability into the markets by doing massive buys and dumps at unpredictable times, or to do cyberwarfare against the exchanges themselves...

I respectefully disagree. Anarchy is not utopian, it is nothing but an extension of the ethics of moral relativism applied to the political realm. Anarchy is an explicit critique of justice systems *per se* because anarchists don't believe in justice or right and wrong, they think such terms are subjective to each individual. Thats why no anarchist will attempt to defend their political beliefs past a certain point in the argument, because they know the only possible justification is moral relativism and they know they would get destroyed if they offered that justification.

... which they can't, because encryption technology is illegal for export to Iran, and because no one would buy Iranian Rials for bitcoin. They would have to mine them, and high-end GPUs and ASICs with encryption technology are also illegal to export to Iran. If someone sent an Iranian a bitcoin, they could use that smaller currency base as a type of currency by sub-dividing it, but it would be unstable to price shock whenever a new coin was added to this smaller pool...

I just don't even think we are there yet, and if we go in for that kind of negotiation too early, it could backfire. We should wait until we have better apps and a larger market cap, basically. Everyone acts like the internet just popped up out of nowhere in the 90's, but in fact it took decades of methodical advancements for it to become what it is. Bitcoin will be the same. Cryptocurrency *will* change the world, but it really is still in it's infancy, just the seeds of an industry.

I suppose you are right, loans could never have less than 0% interest and still be profitable over holding reserves. Presumably, this would be factored into the opportunity cost of consumables then, resulting in a deflationary pressure to continually lower the cost. This could be likened to the continual inflationary pressure on employers today, but with the same net effect that prices will continually go in either one direction or the other under either an inflationary or deflationary system. Either your wages need to constantly be adjusted to the new currency value or consumables do, either way there will be some lag and you will be very slightly overpaying what you could theoretical pay in a continually-adjusted monetary base. I'd rather have deflation because it cuts off the ability of government to artificially inflate the currency, and thereby rob the citizens or use currency as a means of enslavement.
[edit] Actually you could probably get below 0%, because the loan-holder then assumes the risk of holding bitcoins... Maybe worth a percent on a larger bitcoin amount.

That doesn't make sense. The people betting against the operator in this case are the people being liquidated.

It needs more complete descriptions and diagrams of the data structures and algorithms, and it should be broken into abstract, intro, sections, methods.

ACH transactions are processed by clearing houses, which are a separate entity from banks. I used to work for a check processing company that also ran a clearing house... I believe there is some expensive certification process before your business would be allowed to directly interface with the ACH system. Don't know much about the legal regulations here, but I'm assuming bitinstant probably has at least one CPA and probably a business lawyer as council or even on retainer. Setting up a deposit-only account at a national bank should be the easy part. I'd love to see you succeed though. 4% is a HUGE cut, seems like a competitor could bring that down significantly and still turn a profit.

Depreciation cannot be incentive on a loan, because you have the same incentive if you don't make the loan and just hold the commodity in that case. The problem is when loan interest rate is lower than the depreciation rate, the bank would be losing money on such a loan. Thus, lending via secondary linked assets becomes a necessity...

I like this argument, but it could backfire. If you are paying to access a specific portion of information stored in the public record via a key, then the key could be classified as a commodity and not a currency, and would be subject to heavier taxation.

This is true, but as I said, it discourages lending because it makes loans more expensive when priced in the deflationary currency as opposed to a commodity with a stable price and slowly growing supply, like gold.

From what I understand, bucket houses allow members to trade against each other on leveraged derivatives without actually participating in the market directly. This means that if all their customers positions were unraveled at once, or worse, successively, the net effect on the BTC market would be higher volatility, but little to no net change in value. Plus there is no one that can "bail them out", so the market will quickly restabilize.

I'm sorry but this is simple logic. Once the future value of money starts going up, bank lenders have an incentive to hold instead of lend. If a currency is expected to deflate by 3% a year, then banks would have to charge 3% *plus* whatever actual interest they wanted to make a loan, anything less and it's a losing value proposition. Loans would become more expensive and scarce as the currency deflation compounds over time. The only solution is to make loans in commodities which are holding value or even inflating (in supply) slightly over time, like gold.

Ah, but you are talking about only M1 currency. M2 is larger, and M3 is probably bigger than both put together, no one knows because they won't publish the number anymore. Actually, lets see about those stats on wealth distribution in the USA, because the 1% is [just the beginning]( According to [stats from Forbes]( there are 403 billionaires in the US. Thats... 0.000001%, and these people control almost half of the amount of money that is circulation, so there you go.
The real problem is the FED. They print money and just create it out of thin air onto their balance sheets via bond and treasury auctions. These people control *everything* and *everyone*, it's rule by fiat, it's usury. Bitcoin is the only thing that can stop them, besides complete financial collapse, which *will* happen unless we veer off the current course.

It should support iPhone or Android at least. Basically, it's the type of thing that should be undertaken as a business venture by a group of people interested in forming a label, not by a single coder with a few friends who play in a band.

No borrowers would be paying back the loan with less valuable dollars, so they would be paying back at 6% in real terms on their dollars in this case. To match this, bitcoin lenders would have to loan at 3% because the buyer is then paying back in more valuable coins and thus paying the same 6%... You're right though it may not be a problem as long as the loan interest rate is lower than the deflation rate.

Actually, I'd much prefer if the coins were lost, that means the remaining coins would become more valuable. As it is, all those people who put in their value for coins just had that effort erased / that value transferred to a thief. The thief is much more likely to spend them or cash them in in the short term, as opposed to a significant fraction of the coins which would have been held as investment otherwise, so there will be a short run on the market basically... Sure 25K coins is not much, but how much did pirate steal? How much was stolen from bitcoinica?

To do what? Find a block? Depends on your hashing power. If you are mining alone, probably many months. If mining in a pool, then you get paid out when the pool finds a block, which is dependent on the size of the pool, but you will also get less bitcoin per block found on bigger pools because you represent a smaller part of the total hashing power.

I'm talking about the long term stages of bitcoin, when volatility has settled down and it has been accepted as the world standard currency, like in 50 or 100 years. In a stable deflationary currency, to pay back the purchasing power that 100 btc had, you would only have to pay back 97 btc, assuming 3% deflation. But the bank has no incentive to make that loan, it would do better by just holding the coins. You are offering an example where a 100 btc loan is paid off in one month with 67 btc, again, why would a bank make such a loan? They would lose 33 btc.

CPU is still way, way worse than GPU. I still mine with my GPU, just not profitable to *buy* one for the purpose of mining anymore. If you have spare CPU cycles, I highly recommend checking out [WorldCommunityGrid]( and donating them via the [BOINC]( client to help all the worthy research projects they support. Scientific progress goes BOINC!

Theoretically, this "sinkhole" is a huge botnet just waiting for someone to inject a new update and peer list into, and thus take control of again? This is the best legal method they could use to stop this thing?

@_date: 2012-01-13 07:40:54
We could simply tattoo 2D barcodes of bitcoin addresses, assigned to individuals at birth, onto the wrist of every citizen and newborn baby. Then all we have to do is prohibit non-wrist based bitcoin transactions by penalty of death. This way the government could track all bitcoin transactions and identify them all with their senders and recipients. Problem solved.

Sorry, but this is pretty bad. It is overly simplified and lacks most of the interesting details about bitcoin. It is very poorly written, rambling, and uses hypotheticals and rhetorical questions to try and make persuasive arguments, which is bad style.

Your technical writing proficiency is just not enough right now for you to be an effective advocate through this medium. Don't mean to be a downer, just honest.

I agree that shared valuation is what gives commodities *or* currencies their market value. We should just point out that no currency today is actually "backed" by anything, either, except for the faith that people have in the future ability for a government to extract value by *force* from their constituents. So bitcoin is not backed by the threat of violence, whereas dollars are.

Yes, the person who takes out the loan assumes the risk for holding actual bitcoins during the period of the loan, basically.

The more I think about this, I think that the difficulty in accessing the bitcoin network without a functional internet could actually be argued as a strength for the system. It prevents bank runs. In a fractured network, bitcoins represent an economic link between any groups which can get up and running and link their networks back together. It is only a *system* of accounting, which can be rebuilt if necessary, but by it's nature prevents government corruption of the monetary supply.

I don't think there is any way to calculate this. There is no way to tell whether the key to a block containing coins has been lost or not.

@_date: 2012-09-21 02:54:51
I disagree with this. The worldwide network of miners is what prevents counterfeiting and secures the blockchain. It is a system which guarantees *rarity*, and the value is dependent on that rarity. With GoldMoney, or any commodity-based COD, the only guarantee of rarity we have is the issuer's promise and reputation...

Create the wallet, put the coins in it, transfer it to an encrypted USB drive, delete / scrub the local copy of the wallet, then destroy the computer. Put the USB drive into a safe in a 24-hour secured facility in a nearby city. Make sure you use a fake name and ID that matches your diguise, and only pay cash. Use a rental or unreported stolen car to drive there, then have the car crushed. Kill any witnesses. Then assume a third, new identity in yet another city. Then comes the plastic surgery. Its best if you can choose a target to kill and assume their identity in the new city, then try to get plastic surgery to look just like them, try to find a someone agoraphobic so that their neighbors won't notice. 
 
[EDIT] *practical* huh? I didn't see that part. Well just do the encrypted USB drive thing without all the disguises, killing, and assumed identities. Less fun that way, however.

No, I would say the US economy is suffering because the US government steals everyone's money through inflation and then spends it on things which are not productive, like socialised healthcare, giant amounts of government employees and overgenerous pensions for them, picking winners in the solar power industry, and bailouts for corrupt bankers. The international bonds markets aren't going through the roof because of such tight fiscal policy that currencies are *deflating*, I'll tell you that much.

1) Bitcoin is *not* anonymous by default, but it can be used anonymously by a skilled user.
2) Bitcoin is *not* fiat, it is the theoretical opposite of a fiat currency. It is not "backed by nothing" as it's critics claim, it is backed by thousands of miners who run one of the strongest computers on Earth, all just to secure the transactions.

@_date: 2012-02-11 20:14:56
Ah, but therein lies the problem. If a country wanted to maintain a 1-to-1 currency convertability to bitcoin, that means they would only be able to inflate their currency at the same rate that bitcoins are being printed, i.e. 50 every 10 minutes (assuming equal size currency bases). Otherwise the conversion rate would quickly slip to 2-to-1, then 4-to-1, and people would see in very clear terms how much currrency the government is printing.

This is why I really advocate calling it a commodity rather than a currency. Bitcoin really is an end in itself, not a certificate of deposit for something else. It is mined using work. It has a hard limit on the quantity. It really is a commodity, with some currency-like aspects. It doesn't *need* to be backed by anything, commodities have value in themselves. 
[edit] actually that last statement needs qualification, commodities have value in relation to living entities...

I don't think the problem is that they are "unable to process" the return. The problem is that they are required by law to identify the funds' owner before doing any more transactions with it once it becomes flagged. At least that's my understanding.

@_date: 2012-04-11 14:26:05
In calculating the inflation rate, one must also estimate the increasing scale of economy for the currency. That is to say, surely 30% more bitcoins may exist at the end of the year, but if there are also 30% more people willing to accept those coins for their product / service, then the effective inflation rate is 0%. This is why they government spends so much time calculating average costs and then lying to us about them, so they can justify printing a lot more money. Eventually bitcoin should become a *deflationary* currency, meaning that you could actually see things like negative-interest bearing accounts for bitcoins which would still be a good value. This is something that Keynesians insist is unsustainable, while Austrians laugh at them and call them evil.

One thing I have always questioned is how bank lending could occur in a deflationary currency. If deflation was 3%, then just by paying back a loan with no interest, you would effectively be paying 3% interest. This means loans would be very expensive...

This still doesn't seem like a really satisfactory explanation. If you take risk by owning coins, betting that they won't go down in value, then how does loaning it out shelter you from that risk? You would just get paid back in lesser-valuable coins over time... When you started talking about a market crash, I thought you meant the fiat markets. I'm not worried about the btc market crashing.

[edit] Actually. Is this even possible? I guess they would have to be within around 1 astronomical unit from Earth to have a chance at competition within the blockchain. Or maybe not. New block reported from the third moon of Jupiter? What happens when the bitcoin network starts to span more than 10 light-minutes in radius? Gotta wait for more confirmations I guess, hahaha.

Since bitcoin can't be printed by governments, their central banks can't use it as a tool to buy hard assets, influence markets, finance wars, or redistribute wealth. The rise of cryptocurrency would mean the end of the political era of nation-states.

Singapore is nice, but very conformist. I hear people hire private security to protect them from the police. Belize is freaking beautiful but has essentially a tiny corrupt govermnent that will likely try to shake you down at some point if you have any significant holdings. If you lived in Singapore, and bought USD for BTC on an international market, I don't see how the US gov't could come after you for taxes on that, but possibly the country in which the exchange is based could come after you for VAT or sales taxes if they really tried...

I fully expect the powers that be to try to fight cryptocurrency at some point, when they realize that it is a real existential threat to their ability to control society through fiat. I expect that they will slow down the transition to bitcoin as the world reserve currency and hold on kicking and screaming to their precious system of control. Given a few decades or a century or two though, the era of nation-states will end and cryptocurrency will have changed humanity for the better, releasing men from the bonds of their masters, the central "bankers".

Just tell them you want to deposit / transfer funds to the account number that bitfloor provides you, no need to mention what it is being used for. 
Yes, you could use a website called Dwolla to do this ACH transfer online, they will delay it for about a week in order to try to convince you to sign up for their instant deposit product, and they will require you to verify your identity, including your SSN, and wait a month after you sign up for a Dwolla account to use this service. In short, just do it at the bank or convenience store in cash. Bitfloor does offer ACH withdrawals, though, so thats nice.

Won't work. Soon all the coins will be tainted. We'll see to that. The first thing I would do is send all my coins to a non-approved address and refuse to send my coins to any addresses that are "blessed". Most small businesses could run through the undernet just fine, and just fudge their books so it looks like their brick-and-mortar store is losing money. Oops! Half my inventory was stolen and someone sold it on the undernet! My business lost a ton of money, so I now need tax breaks! Bitcoin makes tax evasion easier, not harder.

And all I'm saying is that if we position bitcoin as a commodity, it will have a better legal footing going into the international court of opinion. 
[edit] Actually, I really think that bitcoin is, by a strict definition of the word, a *commodity*, and not as much a currency. Currencies are deposit notes on a basket of commodities or the bonds (and future ability to use force to extract value from citizens) of a country. Bitcoin *is* the commodity, it is not a deposit note, it is not a bond, it is not tied to any future actions of any government. It is not a currency by any standard definition; the fact that it can be *exchanged* for currencies does not make it a currency. I may still be persuaded that it is a currency though, if you have a good argument for why it is.

I spent a year in door-to-door sales in my early twenties. I could see turning a profit if you had nice fliers, but you would have to sell a lot of coins per day or sell them at a significant markup.

Well, to the first point: that's why bitcoin is infinitely divisible. The coins will float against the value according to their relative scarcity at any time, it's a tautology of economics. Aquiring 1M BTC would be an absolutely *monumental* achievement, and whoever does that deserves to pass on their coins to their ancestors, via attic storage if that is their prerogative. To do that would mean that they contributed 1M coins worth of value at an earlier time and didn't cash it out, so the net affect on the economy integrated over all time would still be positive.
On the second point: right now 1% of Americans hold 50%+ of all the wealth in America. Do we not have a "real" economy?

Not bad! You obviously have enthusiasm for bitcoin, we need more people informing and advocating just like you. Constructive criticism: try starting off with how bitcoin differs *philosophically* from fiat currency systems, emphasize that there is *no central bank* which could freeze or control your account, and that no entity can arbitrarily print more coins. Point out that bitcoins can be exchanged for over 90 other currencies on many different exchanges. The details of transactions will just confuse newcomers, you need to get them excited about bitcoin and its implications first. Great work though, keep it up~
@_date: 2012-01-02 00:52:21
The amount of electrical usage is mainly dependent on the amount of GPU miners out there, so if BTC becomes more valuable and mining becomes more competitive, electrical usage will go up. Cost per transaction may go down but it doesn't really matter if the net amount of watt-hours needed by the system each month continually increases, and it is already the strongest computer on Earth by orders of magnitude larger than its nearest competitors.

"Inherent value" is a philosophical fairy-tale. All objects are valuable only in relation to a living entity for a specific purpose. Just because gold has other uses besides being a currency, that doesn't make it "inherently" or "intrinsically" valuable. Cryto-blockchains have other uses besides currency too, namecoin distributed DNS for example. It has also been demonstrated that bitcoin could be used to store data in the blockchain or as incentive or anti-piracy measures in gaming. 
I definitely think bitcoin could be viewed as a commoditization of both time and energy, and in fact as a *multiplier* of the value of energy.  
@_date: 2012-11-13 17:55:33
So you agree with the idea that there is no objective way to define right and wrong, good or evil? I believe in definitions of good and evil which are independent of any person's opinion. Anyhow, it's only tangentially related. I believe that there is always a *de facto* single government over any geographical region, any anarchist claims to the contrary notwithstanding. All these are points not addressed in the first youtube video linked, though. The original commenter thought he could offer some piddling commentary on competing judicial systems while completely disregarding my claim that such a thing is fundamentally the same as might-makes-right, rule by the richest, vigilante justice for all. To say that I should be able to start a competing judicial system and police force in my country and that it is *right* is to say that no existing judicial system can ever claim final authority over a given region, and to say that I should be able to act out aggressions against any perceived wrong-doer outside of existing judicial systems. Anarchy is a fundamental denial of judicial systems *per se*. It amounts to advocating for governments without courts or police, and it would lead to more conflict, not less.

The major challenge is that commodities markets are heavily regulated to make sure all the investors are paying their capital gains taxes, that another Enron or Lehman Brothers situation doesn't happen, that people with options due must actually settle, by law.

This new definition allows countries to conceptually sidestep the fact that their currencies were once based on holding of commodities and are now based on private debts on which the taxpayers pay *interest*. Bitcoin is backed by the consensus that it has value, and by the computer network that supports it. Fiat currencies are backed by the faith that a governing body will, at some time in the future, be able to extract value from its citizens by the initiation of force.

Scalability actually is a very valid concern for bitcoin, it *needs* to be addressed, sooner than later, or bitcoin could die. I don't think a government crackdown on using bitcoins would accomplish much, but if they went after the money-changers, they could keep bitcoin from being easily converted into USD or back, so there is an issue of liquidity there. If we really get BTC cards in Walmart, though, I could see it taking off in a *big* way.

It's interesting that almost the entire world financial system allows third-party processors to track and reverse transactions arbitrarily.

AFAIK there is a still bug in the client so that when it uses tor, it can leak some data back out to the network. I'll try to find the source, it was one of the stories in a while back. Basically you can just start tons of servers all over the world using VPNs and monitor the IRC command channels and glean a lot of data from that, apparently.

Just because the members are trading against each other, it is still a bucketshop.

It's like a bank account with negative interest. This is required when you have a deflationary currency. Your money still gains value at a specified rate, but since the currency itself is going up in value, the total amount of currency goes down even while the net buying power in increasing.

Thanks for this detail. Also, [this]( explanation is relevant. So I give them a public key, they return me a private key, and I add that to my own private key bitwise to get the new private key for the resulting public key with vanity address. Am I summarizing this right? I guess I never realized that the sum of private keys has this relationship to the sum of public keys. Seems like this could be used for group addresses or something, like you send to the group address and each person in the group only has one piece of the private key required to access the coins. Would that work? 
What if the two private keys roll over the last digit on the left? I suppose I could only use this address for public transactions...

You could give people a public key from your wallet to encrypt messages with and then use the private key to decrypt. That could be a handy feature in the client, but it's really just feature creep I think. I don't know about trying to put more data in the blockchain, that's probably a bad idea.

Selling bitcoins directly for ACH transactions would be a mistake. You should look into BitPay or the merchant API from MtGox, though, they would allow you to accept payment in bitcoin with a variety of options for cashing out. There may be a way to sell bitcoins through those interfaces and place the burden of ACH reversal risk onto the third party, not sure about that. You would still have to report the sale quantities on your returns though, and charge tax for internet purchases if that is required by your state laws.

Sure, but you are talking about money in an abstract sense, while I'm referring to the legal definition of a *currency*. Currency notes are accepted as being a deposit note for a good, service, or commodity, while the actual value of the note is much less than that, such as a printed piece of paper or a stamped zinc penny. Since bitcoins aren't backed by any government, they really aren't a deposit note guaranteed for the payment of any debt, but instead they are an end in themselves. Bitcoins are a mathematical keypair that is stored in a blockchain, and they would still exist even if people stopped using them, you could apply this same argument to gold and many other commodities...

Really, the more I think about it, wheat and sugar and bitcoins are alike in many ways. You can gain them by doing work, they can expire and never come back, and they are a good in themselves as opposed to a deposit for a good or service. They also have the quality of being much more rare than gold, in terms of bitcoin / ounces of gold in existence, and also retain the properties of divisibility and interchangeability. The lack of actual physical presence may even serve as a strength of bitcoin, as a safegaurd against attempts at counterfeit or "monetary easing". It's interesting that you could make a note for it, but then transfer the "coin" to another note, and the old one becomes worthless!

Great, now we can have IP lawsuits about bitcoin-derivative gaming credit systems. Anyhow, I wouldn't bank on this idea. GPU mining is *unprofitable* for most people. From the comments:
estimation is avg gamer can pull in 60 MH/s.  Sounds realistic.  At 24/7 mining that is $6.00 per month.  Say avg gamer is more like 10-12 hours a day "most" days.   That is ~$2.50 per month.  Your post seems to indicate half will be taken as profit.  That leaves $1.25 per month.

The US government has altered the way they calculate inflation 20 times in the last 2 decades, every time to exclude products for which the price was rising. They under-report inflation so they can give a lower increase on cost-of-living expense to SS retirees. This essentially raids Social Security, defaulting on those who paid in for their entire life, so that large derivatives funds won't go down a point. If you include the cost of food, gas, healthcare, then inflation is well over 10%.

I don't think you are looking at the necessary timeframes for the bitcoin "predictions" about phases to come true. We are supposed to be in the distribution phase for at least another 5 years, so really a low cost of bitcoins helps this purpose. Mining will quickly move to FPGAs and vendor payment solutions / exchanges / and fledgling markets will mature over this period. Merged mining is online, and distributed DNS could very well become a component of the internet of the future. I think people are sad that they weren't "early adopters" and cannot make a fortune from the popularization of bitcoin as some did. They don't realize that if they are still buying / mining coins right now, they are *still* early adopters, but it may take another 20 years before those coins can make them real money as speculators again.

The proof-of-work doesn't have to be submitted to the p2p network first, it could be submitted directly to the central authority first by protocol. It would definitely have to be done with fold processes done on individual computers, or with some mechanism to prevent pool folders from stealing group work. Anyhow, I think it could be made to work with a little creativity. I actually didn't really want this story to be a focus on how proteinCoin might work, just to suggest that the "bitcoin" network could eventually grow into something much larger, more transformative, and more valuable than just bitcoins.

@_date: 2011-08-17 20:58:28
Yes, I think it will happen. I see a future for ProteinCoin. Research labs could set a higher value on a group of proteins they needed folded, or just put a certain amount of value into a protein "block" which would then be distributed inversely to lowest energy state. The value of a solution for any given protein could eventually go down if a lower state was found, leading to incentive to continue grinding proteins down for lower states. The crypto-block system would then only hold the ledgers of how much each protein block was worth, and the current lowest energy states / which wallets they belong to.
@_date: 2011-08-04 05:13:55
I suppose you could say there is an inverse relationship going on, and eventually NMC and BTC will reach an equilibrium and then start to move together, but this doesn't explain the current undervaluation of NMC in terms of mining difficulty, or why it hasn't moved significantly upwards while BTC has tumbled recently. So then... No, it hasn't followed BTC price very closely at all. It's kind of mind-boggling, actually, since NMC seems to have a built-in advantage (i.e. the bitDNS protocol).
@_date: 2011-08-07 09:45:46
You won't make electricity costs on a CPU, or any number of them. It's getting hard enough on a GPU with the current values and difficulty. G4s don't even support OpenCL, at all, so they get particularly shitty hashing speeds. I couldn't even find a way to do it on my G4 besides solo mining from the client or javascript mining from a browser, 8 cores -&gt; 4MH/s :/

Free shipping might make it worth it. I applaud your ingenuity and I think there is a market here. I'm tempted, but the price has to come down a little. ETF for BTC/silver and I'm in. You buy it and store it, and sell shares (get rid of shipping charges), and this could be the first real commodity market for BTC. This could actually partially TIE the BTC price to silver/gold, which is an interesting prospect...

I guess, but we're not talking about a trivial amount of electricity. I calculate the power for those machines at around $50-60/month where I live, and you are talking about generating a lot of heat and noise for a measly ~1BTC/month. If the machines are already on all the time, then it could be worth it.
@_date: 2011-07-08 03:54:07
Thats fine too. I thought it was a smaller device, obviously. Maybe I'll take a look at it, I actually do have a degree in computer engineering. If the price point is too high though, the ROI will take too long for a great majority of potential customers...

Set it up on a test MTGOX account with 0.5 BTC to start. It succesfully placed an extreme order, at $5 above the market value... Waiting to see how it performs. The website seems to have some weirdness going on with the image menu at the top. Graphs would be nice. Market arbitrage options would be awesome. Cheers!
[EDIT] Succesfully placing buy orders, a little outside the market for now. I guess I need to tweak it a little... Setting commisions to 0.3% helped get it closer to the market...
[EDIT] Well it has sold off a little of the btc. It has set some competitive sell orders so far, but the buy orders only show one extreme so far for some reason. I actually appear down about 1% over just holding BTC, but I think that is just an effect of the price rising over the last few hours and not falling again to make those low buy orders and complete the cycle. The bottom of the page where it says "stats" seems stuck at 0 botcalls, 0 ms for everything, no listing for "extreme". Actually this site could be really really good. No Yubikey...
[EDIT] It stopped making orders about 24 hours ago. I'm down a tiny amount if I transfer it all back to BTC... Not so impressive. I would have made a lot more by just manually trading I think.

actually this is a rather enlightened comment. I did my undergrad work with FPGAs so I think that a custom circuit board could actually be competitive still. Moore's law predicts that FPGAs will increase exponentially in size efficiency, so this is not an avenue to be brushed off lightly. FPGAs represent a unique method in computer architecture, that exhibit scalability to small, even molecular or quantum systems. I could imagine nanoscale motes that draw energy from the environment and hash bitcoins ;)

Point taken. I think paying friends for gas in BTC may actually be better than being able to buy gas at a some single gas station location anyhow, for the time being. This way I can still basically pay for services in BTC, but the "vendors" are also new converts to the economy who will actually hold them instead of just transfer right back for dollars. It's a way to sort of help kick off the distribution phase until we can get major vendors.

Actually, the way I understand it, you pretty much have to be running a keylogger when someone types their password. The wallet doesn't become vulnerable just by being run, unless the files are stored in RAM unencrypted. I guess we can only speculate on that right now.

@_date: 2011-11-08 17:04:50
Yes, I understand this. My point is that I could do an offline transaction with you, then restore a backed-up wallet file that doesn't contain this transaction and spend all the coins from it before you go an broadcast your offline transaction. By the time your offline transaction is broadcast, those coins no longer exist in my wallet, and your offline transaction is now viewed as a double-spend on my side and rejected by the blockchain. It seems very similar to "floating" a check to someone.
Maybe I'm not understanding it fully and this is not possible?
@_date: 2011-08-24 17:56:54

This is interesting, because it's not actually illegal for US players to use gambling sites, it is only illegal for the banks to transfer funds for that purpose.

Sort of true. Pieces of the key could be stored across several places in RAM, encrypted, and then be decrypted and piped to output in sequence when the key val needs to be sent. In that case only a portion of the plaintext key would need to be in RAM at any time. This could be as small as a single digit of the key being in RAM at a time. It is also possible to have the address location of that digit change after every digit. The only true weakness is the ports.

Well it is just a command you send on the command line to namecoind... We would need to build some type of stripped-down namecoind daemon into firefox to connect to the NMC network, make these calls, and override the default DNS mechanisms. I kind of thought this was the entire point of NMC, and it's entire utility over bitcoin. NMC has the potential to revolutionize DNS be making it decentralized, thus taking away a government's ability to "seize" domains by redirecting the DNS entries. I really don't understand why no-one has taken this final step which I feel would be massively important for NMC and for internet freedom. We collectively run the largest grid supercomputer in the world, and this is the obvious purpose for it.

@_date: 2011-08-09 17:07:49
To gauge the rate of inflation, you need an accurate measure not only of the increasing amount of bitcoins, but also of the increasing amount of goods and services being traded for bitcoins. This is  reflected by the constantly changing market value of bitcoins, as people try to gauge their real-world buying power.

Merged mining will submit your hashes to both the namecoin and the bitcoin chains, so you can earn both at once with no noticeable decrease in hashing speed on either side. The namecoin network will be particularly useful because it supports bitDNS, which has the potential to be as gamechanging for DNS as bitcoin is for currency. It is a huge step forward towards a more free and robust DNS system, and it should help bitcoin get a credibility boost. All good stuff!
@_date: 2011-07-01 07:08:42
well, yes... I see it as theft. Some people might not see that as so crazy, like, say, Alan Greenspan: 
"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. [...] The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves. This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard."

Well I think the processing power is *already* being expanded to being more useful, as the namecoin merged mining system is gearing up to come online. Also, I disagree that all systems based on this technology must have the same security rigour. For a pure currency system like bitcoin, that level of security is required, but it is not strictly necessary for any coin system. Like I said above, ProteinCoin could have a central server and still be popular, while not as secure as bitcoin.

Sure, many other sites which confirm your BTC transactions with only one blockchain confirmation, which is to say: no other sites. I don't think you know what you are talking about. I actually design websites and know a little about web security, and I think you are talking out your ass.
@_date: 2011-09-20 20:03:45
FTA: "...you also have to ensure that as soon as the transaction takes place you convert your BTC back into USD"
This is one of the major problems right here. We need vendors who are willing to sell in bitcoins and the use the bitcoins to buy other stuff, like supplies or groceries. Until we reach a certain tipping point where people actually want to sell for bitcoins and HOLD bitcoins, the volatility of BTC will be crazy. 
Another issue this article misses is scalability. This, in my mind, is the *primary* challenge for the bitcoin dev team.

This is not a really informed comment. The going rate for NMC to BTC is 0.03, not 0.3, and the difficulties of the two blockchains are very different, meaning you don't earn 1 NMC in the same time it takes to mine 1 BTC.

Do you accept that mining being very profitable attracts more miners, increasing the difficulty?
I haven't seen any evidence that pool operators are refusing to hash transactions selectively, or even a method for implementing that. I might be convinced if I saw that evidence.

FTA: "The fact that every 2016 blocks (about 11 days), 100,800 new BTC are minted. That means that, to maintain the CURRENT price of $13.50, we'd need $1,360,000 of NEW MONEY entering the system every 11 days."
I've been thinking about this statement and I don't believe that it is true. Firstly, it assumes that all new coins generated are being spent for actual goods every week. Second, it's not really MONEY at all that needs to enter the system, but goods and services OR money. Also, even if all coins *were* being spent every week, considering there are 6 billion people on earth, this means that only 0.0166667% of all people have to put in the effort of a single dollars' worth (or buy $1 worth of bitcoins) every two weeks to keep it solvent.

Lower fees. No interest payments on a floating debt balance or reporting to credit agencies. Deflation of the currency you hold. No government authority can freeze your account. Better digital security. Ability to make transactions without financial recording by the IRS for taxation. Ability to pay person-to-person without a third-party processor. Ability to make anonymous* transactions.

Power and cooling are interesting topics that I might have some advice about, from the plasma-fusion lab perspective. I'm interested more in motherboards, recently.

from his website: "A proprietary system accepts Bitcoin payment, converts those Bitcoins to USD, and withdraws the dollars to Coinabul’s terrestrial bank account while simultaneously allocating and disbursing your gold..." 
A much more direct system would be a bitcoin to gold ETF fund. This would actually set up an independent spot price of gold in bitcoins. All Coinabul does is sell you gold for bitcoins, with fees that you could avoid if you just exchanged your bitoins to USD and then bought a gold ETF. It's the step of conversion from BTC-&gt;USD-&gt;Au that is unnecessary. It should go directly from BTC-&gt;Au.
[EDIT] Actually, this is pretty interesting the more I think about it. Basically this website is almost like a buyer in the BTC market that is always buying at some spot price? That could be doable within certain limits... Good for him for taking on the volatility risk, I guess... 
@_date: 2011-08-05 15:24:10
transaction fees: expected to stay at less than 1% forever, not a "gimmick" as you say. 
Interest fees: My point is that most people pay for things with credit even though they have bank accounts with fund in them. The interest rate you pay on your spent credit is much higher than the interest rate you receive on your funds. Also, you would not even need to use a credit payment system if you had bitcoins, unless you live off your credit cards, which only a fool would do.
Deflation: Once the limit of 21M coins is reached, deflation will continue to drive the value up as the currency represents a larger and larger economy, as it becomes adopted by more people. If you own bitcoins now, you *are* an early adopter.  21M bitcoins to represent all of the worlds wealth would mean that each coin would be worth millions of current USD.
No central authority / IRS: So if I'm not doing anything wrong, then I should have nothing to worry about? Really? I guess the fact that they cannot lock your accounts is actually much less important than the fact that they cannot print more currency. In any sense, the government is not in control of the "distribution of income" anymore. This means the government will have to be your servant instead of your master, you know, like how it was envisioned by America's forefathers?
3rd party processors: A distributed processing network is not really a 3rd-party processor in the sense that there is no central authority which can selectively block or reverse transactions. This is why bitcoins could be paid to wikileaks when US processors cut them off. 
Security: So which encryption algorithms does your bank website use? And no one else could access your account at that bank, right? Does your bank have servers running all over the globe and comprising the strongest computing network on Earth? No? So then bitcoin is more secure.
Anonymity: Go to a public wifi spot so your transactions cannot be linked to your home IP address. Launder your money through online wallets (and even online bitcoin laundering services), and how should someone track where your coins end up and who holds that address?
In short: Go ahead and keep buying your Starbucks lattes with your Mastercard, and trying to shit all over bitcoin, and being a willing victim of the fiat currency scams and archaic US ACH system. You're wrong, though, and I don't think you really understand why bitcoin exists or what its advantages really are. Cheers~

"If someone uses a credit card without permission, the owner of the card can dispute the charges, and usually get their money back."

Wrong. How would any government collect sales tax on a pure bitcoin transaction? It's impossible, there is no paper trail. Same with jobs paid wages in pure bitcoin, there's no way to collect "income" tax (whatever that means). 
Active monitoring of your communications in real-time may allow investigators to track transactions by IP, which is the only current weakness I see in bitcoin (which could open up bitcoin users to prosecution if bitcoin becomes outlawed), however bitcoin through encrypted transactions should be able to solve that within a few years of development.

Paypal specifically prohibits transactions for digital currency transactions in their statement of terms, and allows buyers to charge-back transactions, which is why bitcoiners generally avoid it. You can find people to trade with for Paypal money on IRC bitcoin-otc, on freenode.

Interesting points. Scalability is definitely a problem, but there *is* a core dev team to deal with that as time goes on. 50x the current GPU power for a "supernode" may not actually be that impressive by 2030, when bitcoin is expected to reach it's final "phase".

I'm wondering if there could be some sorted of "trusted" block chain forking method, with occasional reconciliation between forked chains...

It's true that protein folding wouldn't work the same way as random number hashing, but that doesn't mean it is completely incompatible. It doesn't really matter that some people might have better folding algorithms. Proof-of-work doesn't have to be random and uniform, and you could have a central server like the worldcommunitygrid keep track of points and transactions. Sure, it would have that weakness of the central control point that bitcoin doesn't have, but it would also serve a useful *purpose*, so it could get lots of support anyhow.

But the miners don't set the fees. They have no control over that. I still fail to see any causation, or even to understand the point you are trying to make, so apparently you haven't explained it very clearly.

When a currency "inflates" that means that the value decreases because of an increasing supply of the currency or a decreasing supply of the goods it can buy. Neither of those has happened with bitcoin. Maybe by "inflationary" you actually meant "deflationary".

AFAIK litecoin is made so that it is supposed to be run on the CPU, with GPU adding little to no benefit to mining them. IMHO it makes them much more of a target for XSS and worm attacks. 
@_date: 2011-07-14 09:24:52
I suppose that is "inflation", but if the supply of currency is being increased at a slower or nearly equivalent rate as the amount of value in the system, then the currency is not losing value. As long as there are enough people actually willing to pay USD or other currencies for bitcoin, or actually contributing services or products for bitcoin, in order to prop up the price against the new coin generation, then the currency isn't really "inflating" by most people's standards. 
I don't really get your point about the price of bitcoins determining the mining difficulty. It's linked directly to the total hashing speed of the network and the difficulty curve. You could argue that the speed would likely go down if the price of bitcoins dropped, but it is not really a direct relationship there...
@_date: 2011-11-03 21:46:34
So the price has to move 13% just to beat your fees? Thats a pretty steep margin. Basically with the ~2.25% spread on the price, I'm paying more than I would on the actual stock market for capital gains. Maybe you guys should consider a per-transaction surcharge instead.

Exchange operators don't want to be liable for chargebacks, which can happen through the American ACH system up to 6 months after a deposit. This is why exchanges force you to buy in through payment systems which are difficult or impossible to reverse transactions through. There is simply no way to run an exchange in America using ACH (check or credit card) to bitcoin transactions without exposing the operator to direct risk. This is not the "fault" of the exchange operators, it is just how things have to be done to protect them and allow them to run a business under the current American banking system.

True enough, but keyloggers and rootkits can be detected. You can scan for those before you open your wallet, if you think your machine is compromised.

The way domain registrations are done now seems backwards to me. Shouldn't registrations take lots of namecoins at the beginning, and less over time, not vice-versa?

I question this logic. Mining will be *more* profitable in areas with less expensive electricity, sure, but as long as you don't live in Hawaii or the middle of nowhere, the electricity rates near any major dam system don't vary that much, at around $0.11 to $0.13 per kWhr. Plus I can probably get away with running my smart coffee heater in my office at work and dodge the electricity costs. Anyhow, if I don't foresee an ROI because the ASIC vendor delayed too long, I'll just request a refund before delivery and they will be holding the bag, so they better not squelch on us.

I'm trying to wrap my head around the macro-economic implications of this. Could a cypriot bitcoin economy thrive, and what would it's affects have on the political situation? What would it mean if Cypriots started exchanging their banknotes for bitcoin and using that as a preferred currency? It seems that local prices in EURO would be artificially raised, forcing the local bureaucrats to fork more of the EUROs back to the the merchants in exchange for local goods, and the price increase rate would escalate not only with inflation, but now also with the bitcoin to EURO exchange rate. By trading our bitcoins to Cypriots in exchange for EURO, are we importing the fiscal insolvency of the EURO from Cyprus into other European Union economies?

Anarcho-capitalism is based on the idea that there can be a market for police and court systems, but this is a fundamentally flawed concept. Force distorts markets, because the use of force is fundamentally different than the productive use of the mind or the trade of value for value, while anarcho-capitalism equates the two. Anarchism relies on the tenet that there can be multiple overlapping police and judicial jurisdictions, but in reality there is always a single *de-facto* final legal authority over any territory, any delusions of power-sharing notwithstanding.

The advantage to owning a .bit domain is that no government or third-party can have your DNS interrupted, it is truly a P2P DNS system with no possibility of censorship.

So, great idea, lacking implementation so far. I honestly was more excited about Namecoin than Bitcoin when I first learned about it, because of the implications it has for free speech and a free internet.

So you think it is impossible to fund a police force voluntarily? The only way men can implement legal protection in their communities is by enacting institutionalized slavery and a legalized protection racket? I challenge those assertions. Police is a tiny expenditure and could easily be covered by voluntary excise fees on businesses with a stake in the safety of the communities they operate in, by voluntary fees for the government recognition of large-value contracts, and by tarriffs. As Ron Paul has pointed out, we could immediately get rid of income tax just by rolling our government back to 2000 levels of spending.

I have studied AI, in vision technology only. Things like recognizing spatial patterns and calculating statistical quatities over time, in a high-powered laser lab, no less. I would classify such research as abstraction from perception, like seeing a hard edge or recognizing a physical object, calculating velocity or a hessian of a field or any such quantity is derivative of that. What we need is the ability to have code that does abstraction from abstraction. Not knowing the colors but recognizing the concept of *color*. It's elusive, neural nets still seem stupid.

The main benefit from more exchanges seems to be if they are spread out among legal jurisdictions.

They can't seem to give a straight answer about what is happening with the Little Singles and Singles. Josh says "shipping tomorrow" and then Jody indicates no devices shipped the next day... If there is a real problem with the Singles, they have a responsibility to tell the customers. Shipping devices out-of-order is going to *eradicate* any future sales from large pre-order customers. Also, loose Avalon chips are about to start coming out in HUGE batches, and if they can't get these Singles out the door ASAP, they are facing a mass exodus of cancelled orders.

Well, if the US government is going after bitcoin exchange accounts for being "money transmitters", then apparently bitcoin is a real currency, or at least a commodity, in the eyes of the US government. It's a two-sided coin, they can't prosecute bitcoin users for tax evasion unless they admit that bitcoin is a commodity. Otherwise it falls under the purview of "virtual good", like an imaginary sword in WoW, which has a much shadier legal footing and probably wouldn't be considered a crime to steal, since that is allowed by the rules of WoW.

Essentially, no. Such a change would never be in the interest of those who run the bitcoin network, financially, so you would never convince them to adopt such a new ruleset.

I respectfully disagree. The problem is that VISA and MC and the banks generally are hostile to bitcoin, and they don't recognize it as a real good.

You are still describing a system where individuals were directly subjugated and enslaved. Taxes were collect in person and paid in coin. If they had to do that today, the modern notion of a state would collapse, because it is infeasible. The point is clearly demonstrated by African countries who repeatedly spiral their currencies and revalue them to keep their populations enslaved to groups of regional despots. The government is already teetering on insolvency as the Fed continues printing ever-larger sums and throwing them into mortgage securities, borrowing and printing at a breakneck pace. A few percentage points of buying power lost means the USD is less able to finance deficit spending without incurring inflation domestically. It means less power for central bankers and their crony puppet governments to make citizens do their bidding and fight their wars.

I maintain this code, it runs on linux, apache, mysql, python, and c++... It will be available at github soon. It requires an active mysql database and a set of scripts to maintain integrity to the Gox database and do the charting. I recently rewrote it so that it is in-memory rather than file-based, and I'm getting ready to parallelize it.  It currently updates the 5-minute chart every 2 minutes, which makes it the most up-to-date density chart, if I'm correct. It also updates the other charts periodically, with less frequency as the duration increases. It uses approximately 1 hour of CPU time per day on my server, not too bad.

Eventually, though, they will spend themselves out.

I doubt we will see any sort of redundant blockchain splitting to deal with increased transaction volume, or that this would even offer any advantage. I don't see how a centralized network has *any* advantage in processing a billion transactions versus a global peer-to-peer network, I believe the bitcoin network will grow to handle it's load.

The CPI is a joke. It has been revised 20 times in the last 30 years, every time to exclude things for which the price is going up. Yeah, food, gas, rent, electricity, all those things are going up 15% per year but core inflation is still 2%, *rrrrrrrrrrright*. Maybe you live in a magical fantasy land where inflation is 2% but I live in the actual real world.

Regulation eh? Why would I want to lend in a deflationary currency, when I could lend in one that is not deflationary? I would have to charge a higher interest rate just to beat deflation, or there would be no incentive to make that loan. The borrower would also be better off taking the loan in an inflationary currency because they would get a better interest rate and end up paying back less in real terms over the duration of the loan. So, then, I doubt that btc lending will ever be a large market.

I just stuck an aftermarket Gelid fan on my 5850, she purrs at 40C now, overclocked to the limit :) Not *quite* 420 MH/s though...

@_date: 2013-01-29 03:29:00
Lets just check those numbers... Lets say you buy Radeon 7970's in bulk, with no limit on quantity, somehow. We'll say you pay $350 per, which is below the going market rate for new devices, and you have them fully cooled with abundant power in nice racks on decent motherboards with USB stick OS, adding say another $125 per, at least. Thats $475 and your running at around the reported max from the hardware mining chart, 800MH/s per, pulling probably around 300W each for running that hot, and another 30W or so each for fans, water chilling and pumping power. Looks like network hashrate is somewhat stable at 2.2TH/s right now, so you'll need about 2.2e12/800e6 =&gt; 2,650 devices to try a 51% attack, at a cost of 2.65e3\*350 = $927,500 almost a million dollars for the GPUs, or 2.65e3\*475 = $1,258,750 for a full rig setup. That's assuming Radeon can handle your order for 2,650 GPUs or you can scratch them up on the market at a discount. And that you can get it done in the next month before ASICs make the network hash speed go up by an order of magnitude or three. Also, the operating cost for doing this attack? 330Wx2.65e3 = 874.5KW, at lets say a good electricity cost of $0.12/kWhr, thats gonna run you about $7,300 per hour. A government could theoretically pull it off, I guess. But if they failed, it would only make the network that much stronger! It would be easier to just manipulate the currency or go after the money changers first, I think.

Not sure bitcoin needs "saving". It's currently the most valuable currency in the world... In response to your question: will the dev team raise the *default* transaction fee? I'd say almost definitely not. The ability to make free transactions should always be supported, they will just get deprioritized over transactions with fees, which could mean a significant difference if a lot of miners start rejecting fee-less transactions...

This explanation makes little sense, but I'll grant you that by averaging chains of primes, difficulty might be tuned based on the theory that the distribution of primes is logarithmic.

This has absolutely nothing to do with fractional reserve lending as a tool of banking. Elizabeth Warren is a radical socialist, her proposed answer to the problem of unfair low-interest loans to the banks is to extend those low-interest loans to an *even wider audience*, using the force of government to do so. It's literally the stupidest idea I've ever heard a politician argue for, it would *explode* the student-loan bubble. The answer is to get rid of the Fed so that *no-one* gets 0% interest loans, especially not [foreign banks, to the tune of $1T](

Of course a banker thinks they can provide a service to bitcoin users. Of course you would say that because your entire industry is about to become a useless dinosaur. Lets analyze the points you make:


Not with bitcoins. If the bank loses all it's bitcoins, do you think a government is going to come in an replace those lost funds? How? By printing more bitcoins? It's a ridiculous fantasy. My coins are *not* safe if someone else holds the key, by definition.


Yeah, thats a problem in a deflationary currency. There is no incentive for the bank to loan bitcoins out because they would make more money by just holding them, unless they charge the borrower a much higher interest rate than they could get if they took the loan in a non-deflationary specie. So, no incentive for the bank and no incentive for the borrower. Sorry, lending in bitcoins will never be an industry. 


You are grasping at straws here. I can run local software to do that, no bank needed. 
Bitcoin doesn't need banks, or bankers. Good luck out there.

Well, I think a lot of people are already out there proselytizing. BFL has over 10,000 pre-orders so I think the word is starting to get out now. The best thing we can do is just avoid using fiat as much as possible, mine bitcoins directly and spend them directly on goods and services, never transfer for fiat. We only need to reduce the buying power of the USD by a few percent to have a drastic effect on the ability of the FED to do deficit spending without affecting their bond ratings and domestic inflation numbers.

Rand absolutely opposed taxation, she was a voluntarist and objectivism is a voluntarist philosophy. Anarcho_capitalism holds that there can be a market for force, which is impossible since force distorts markets. To say that you can have a market for force is to equate the use of force to the productive use of the mind. A state monopoly on retaliatory force is necessary to maintain rule of law, anarcho-capitalism is just vigilante justice for all. Rand defined an ethical system of minarchism, Rothbard was a small mind compared to her. 
The fact that you focus on Rand herself and not the philosophy of objectivism, and that you make false claims about very basic premises of objectivism, shows me that you are baselessly attacking something you don't understand.

Because it is not a monopoly on coercion, it is a monopoly on *retaliatory force*, which means it can never be used to *initiate force*, and thus has no conflict with the NAP.

I completely agree that namecoin has been languishing in the dust, but it is still a valuable gem under all that dust. There is some movement from the devs recently, on a [browser bundle]( which I think could finally give nmc a real chance to unlock the potential of actual p2p dns. Onion dns is intentionally obfuscated, so it takes longer than a really working nmc dns system might take, right? I also like the fact that coins get destroyed during .bit domain registrations, makes nmc as a currency even more deflationary than other alts, which I love because I am philosophically opposed to aritificial inflation of any monetary base.

Interesting. I'd probably just end up in federal prison if I tried that, though. So much easier to just spend my coins directly for goods and services. I'll just bypass fiat completely as much as possible, and sell coins directly for cash when I need it.
@_date: 2013-04-27 14:14:27
Gold is a great buy right now. Gold is a *lot* easier for people to take from you by force, though. I'd be very careful letting other people hold your gold for you, lest they decide they don't want to give it back, like the Swiss Bank [recently started doing to it's customers]( I'd also be very wary of holding or moving it yourself, lest some regime decide it has an excuse to seize it, like the Italian police who seized 1 *ton* of gold at it's border [recently]( Oh yeah, I hope you like paying VAT / sales taxes when you buy gold, also. Be a good citizen and give 35% of your already-taxed money to the government, they've got you coming and going! Oh yeah, capital gains if you want to sell it also. So as long as you think you'll make 50% or more on a rise in price, just to cover taxes, then gold is a *great* buy.

Ok, but if it costs more and more to run a mining operation, then over time there will be fewer and fewer, public or government-run.

Hmmm lets see. The M2050 advertised there does 80MH/s... and you get two of them per compute node... at around $2.1 per hour. You would need 2.2e12/80e6 = 27,500 of them, so $57,750 per hour. Could happen, I guess.

Thats the goal. To make p2p exchange "for everyone" by building local networks of trust within our communities and avoiding any system that is linked to the central banking network. Not being able to hold large quantities of cash safely is a fiat currency problem, not a bitcoin problem. Eventually, we should all aim to use bitcoins for everything besides paying taxes on our salaries, properties, and on-the-books capital gains.

No, as I said, I'm a voluntaryist. I think that men can work together voluntarily to provide social services and defense in their communities, as funded by stakeholders through voluntary excise payments, tolls, tariffs, and other mechanisms. I would say that a government structure with a monopoly on retaliatory force is necessary to maintain rule of law and prevent people from hiring their own private armies to settle personal scores, because "fuck laws!".

Gold is compatible with libertarian ideals? I would disagree, there are no ideals associated with libertarianism, only political philosophy backed by any moral system anyone wants to try and justify it with. The whole movement is hypocritical, capitalism can only be ideologically defended by a certain specific ethical system, the ethics of egoism.

I would suggest that the need for localbitcoins.com is not on the bitcoin side, but on the fiat side, where cash is becoming contraband and all transactions are subject to oversight. The best possible thing you could do for the bitcoin economy is to buy bitcoins IRL for cash (or mine them yourself) and use them online to buy goods and services *directly*, bypassing fiat banking networks completely. This is the intended usage case, one that will support both the economy and the ideology of bitcoin.

It's interesting. They are driving volume, surely, but I'm not sure they are actually providing stability. In fact, purchases on the bitcoin market that get filled all the way to a specific dollar amount on *either* the buy or sell side *do* actually affect the price of bitcoin, and you see short spikes in the price because of it. It also means that whoever is receiving dollars in leui of coins on that transaction just got raped at the market because their order was auto-filled to a dollar amount...

Typo is theirs, not mine... This could actually be a safe way to cash in for bitcoins. We'll see how the customer service works out. I don't know if I would buy twenties in the mail for bitcoin here, though, that's a setup unless the reputation system works well and you see the buyer's stats. It would probably work better for them to have a buy-in required to have a trading account, to help keep out scammers, and each order would show the associated account and their historical volume and reputation stats...

Making it easier for people to pay taxes on bitcoin transactions may be a service to some individual users who don't care about the purpose of bitcoin, but it is a disservice to the ideological movement that supports weakening the fiat banking system by subverting it.

Charity, philanthropy, micro-loans. Poor kids in India attend private schools which cost like $0.01 per day.

Do you admit that it is immoral to steal people's money, but then want to argue about the *practicality* of a moral system? You would be free to help them yourselves, but I don't believe that morality consists of sacrifice for the sake of need, and especially not by proxy through a government agent with a gun.

Becuase it generates tons and tons of microtransactions and the network cannot currently handle the volume, basically, and we don't feel like storing gambling records in the blockchain, or that it is a proper use of the blockchain. So, essentially, yes, they are not paying high-enough transaction fees. Since they are generating over half the volume of communications and storage costs, they should be contributing at least the blocksize (25btc currently) in transaction fees on every block before I'd willingly support them, I guess.

Thanks for clearing up my confusion, there Ferroh. That's an insane amount of money for a pool operator to be handling though, ~$100,000 at a time. It seems pool operators could limit their liability by setting a lower payout limit, or paying out directly to miners' wallets. It may make a small increase in fee-less transactions, but hey, it's the miners paying themselves so seems acceptable.

Altruism is not a system of morality, it is a criterion on the benefactor. Altruism states that actions are only moral if they are done for the sake of another, not yourself. Altruism does not, however, actually define what is good or evil, only sets that criterion. It is not an ethical code, it sets no value-standards. Also, it is evil. Altruism, in practise, consists of taking more from those who are productive in society, the more productive the more gets taken, and of rewarding those with *need* of any kind. Altruism punishes virtue and productivity and rewards vice and sloth. It is anti-life, notably because altruism is a method of asceticism, giving up Earthly pleasures for a reward beyond the grave. If you don't believe in the supernatural or an afterlife, there is absolutely no reason you should buy into altruism, it's not about compassion, it's about sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice.

This is not some random tiny tech-market issue, what's at stake is control of peoples lives, at last they finally have a chance to take back some individual rights and force the government to reform, and the government will fight it with every last ounce until one or the other is completely dead.

Slushes pool only has partial support for namecoin mining. It is only actually merged-mining for people using the older, non-json communication protocal, so they don't block very often. Another avenue you could take is to set up p2pool as your lost mining host, then do merged-mining of btc and nmc through that. In that case, you would be solo-mining the namecoin chain, though, so unlikely to get any for a long, long time. I've found that the p2pool payout is better, but it requires you to have a fully-synced bitcoin client or daemon running, and it takes up a little cpu load.

Actually it does affect us. If the majority or even a large percentage of bitcoin users are going through AML exchanges, then the government can affect the volatility and valuation of bitcoin by shutting down those exchanges any time they want. It also completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin to pay a fiat government taxes on bitcoin transactions, it allows the fiat government to live on and be a parasite off of the bitcoin economy.

I would so much rather see namecoin come back than LTC, PPCoin, or Terracoin, whatever that is. Namecoin has the potential to revolutionize control of data on the internet. The fact that it sits on the shelf languishing makes me think that bitcoin is not really a philosophical or cultural movement at all, it will never have any impact on changing fiat currency structures in funding nation-states if it becomes a completely controlled sandbox. Yet total integration with fiat currencies and the investment banking community is what bitcoiners seem bent on achieving, rather than actually providing legitimate services, capturing emerging markets, converting existing retailers, or providing good point-of-sale systems that would allow bitcoin to stand on it's own rather than continue to be just an exotic high-volatility bond. TL;DR: Until Namecoin starts to get real attention, I'll be skeptical that bitcoin will ever be anything more than a get-rich-quick scheme and a fad.

I don't think that is actually a requirement for merged mining... I honestly don't know what happens to nmc once they are used to register a domain, I wondered about that too. In retrospect, after some of the conversations in this thread, I suppose NMC is not that important, since there are already browser plugins that negate DNS blacklists. I do think p2p DNS is a good idea though, so many implementations have been tried and failed...

If you can't make even a single local friend who sells coins, then I'd build a reputation and network of trust and probably prefer Moneygram because it leaves less paper-trail than a bank deposit.

Free markets can only function when the rights of the property-holders are protected. I argue that anarchism doesn't protect property rights, it implements a system that is inimical to property rights. Anarchism is a system where people can hire private armies and take out their personal scores by force, with no recourse for their victims. I don't believe competiting court systems are a solution, because there is always a single *de facto* final authority, and delusions of power-sharing notwithstanding. Anarchists are opposed to any justice system with final authority that they must conform to because they are moral relativists who argue that there is no such thing as justice. It's a fantasy though, their will always be a final legal authority over any territory, no matter how many times you split the terrritory. They just want to split authority as many times as possible and have the smallest territories possible or even overlapping justice systems, which are unstable at best and mob warfare at worst. I would argue that anarchism is reductionist, we live in an anarchist world and the gangs called USA and China have taken over.

And if you register your bitcoin transactions, they can know exactly how much you bought and calculate the gains you owe, unless you also report selling it or spending it. See where this is going? Much better to just avoid the fiat system altogether. Everything about it is evil, and nothing can be gained by interfacing with it. They'll fight bitcoin eventually, no need to bow down for them.

Ridiculous. In the late 1990's the dollar had swings of 30% against real goods in a single day, and it kept on going as the world reserve currency. I'll take bitcoins over fiat "junk currency" dollars anytime, though. Did you know [the Federal Reserve printed a trillion dollars and put it onto foreign bank balance sheets this year](

I'm not sure I understand the critique here. I think a mechanism for consensus over who holds any quantity of a currency needs to be a feature for a currency to be viable. This is the function of the blockchain. The currency is actually p2p, in the sense that when you transmit a transaction, it propagates through the nodes as a meshnet, not through any central point of failure.

You could start accepting bitcoins for your goods and services, or try mining up some coins. You could do IRL/mail cash exchange for coins. The best way would likely be to woo the tourist traps, hotels and local restaurants around them.

With bitcoin, transparency would be easier than with gold or silver, it seems. Basically you could just let the mutual fund trade with a certain percentage of your portfolio at vircurex or btc-e, with an API key. You could pay like a yearly fee to get in, instead of letting the portfolio manager hold all the funds and take his percentage directly out of profits. It's an interesting idea anyhow. I think the fund would have to have a proven track record before it would get many customers...

So you are talking about putting an ETF fund into your 401K, for a deflationary currency. That's a brilliant market strategy right there, it's so genius it's retarded. You would lose compounding gains against just buying bitcoin directly. Even if it was in an IRA, 15% on capital gains plus a cap at $6K worth per year? Whats the point? Just invest in hardware and electricity instead, or try to sell your goods or personal services directly in bitcoin at that point. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 16:32:08
You should use the localbitcoins until you accept the counterparty into your personal network of trust. The seller should always fund the transfer with coins in their account at localbitcoins *before* the IRL transaction is scheduled, or else you'll be stuck waiting for confirmations.

Probably approximately 10-12% higher than the legal exchange rate, since that this just below the capital gains tax rate, and leaves a little room for middlemen. It will still be a better investment though, because that 15% capital gains tax is on compounding gains over time...

This demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of market forces and how they affect currencies. Their answer is to enslave the population to pay for the insolvent loans of a few private banks which prop up their mobster government. Having a fiat currency of their own is the same *exact* thing, just enacted through inflation instead of taxation. Bitcoin promotes savings because it is deflationary, extremely so lately. Keynesian economic policy absolutely *depends* on the promotion of spending, that's why they hold the interest rate at 0% and they are still propping up the housing lending industry via "quantitative easing". Cypriot economics will *only* recover after the power has shifted from the corrupt fiat rulers to the legitimate local leaders of industry, who save and invest in Cyprus itself.

As I said, bitcoin will never be a lending currency. Lending will always have to be done in linked commodities or currencies which have inflation or at least stable prices. You can't lend in a deflationary currency, there is no incentive for the lender to make the loan, and it would be more expensive for the borrower compared to a loan in a commodity / currency that is not deflating.

Yes, obviously betting to avoid an external negative outcome caused by your lack of financial solvency is a wonderful idea. What if a terrrorist was holding a nuclear bomb and he would only defuse it if you gave him exactly 1 bitcoin, but you only have 0.9, then playing SD is a great idea! A better idea would be to play hold'em though, since you are playing against the players and not the house in that case.

No they aren't. "Compliant" exchanges do not help bitcoin, they harm it.

Bitcoin would be much better off growing organically rather than having a ton of newbies trying to make a buck by day-trading against each other or holding coins in government-tracked accounts.

@_date: 2013-07-07 08:23:34
Bitcoin is not really a democracy.

This is one reason the core ruleset cannot easily be changed...

Yeah, because all those people who just bought coins are going to be just itching to sell them. The miners are only printing 3600 coins per day, out of a total of just under 11 million in existence right now, so thats an increase of only ~0.3% of coins in existence per day.

I think that what will happen is that the entire fiat monetary base will undergo revaluation at some point, or several points one for each currency, and that physical commodities will end up being a large determinator of how the currency pairs end up looking after revaluation. China has basically bought out Fort Knox, so that doesn't fare well for us, the US government has even been accused of *counterfeiting* gold bars after tungsten-filled gold-plated bars with US stamps showed up in foreign reserves and even in the Manhattan jewelry district. Sadly I think Japan is actually doing really well for themselves by playing into the inflation wars going on right now, they are basically exporting unemployment in the style of the European socialist block right after WWI.

You don't need banks to store bitcoins for you, or to do transactions. Banks are not necessary for anything but lending, and bitcoin is not really a lending currency, nor will it ever be since it is deflationary. The common image of someone hiding currency under their mattress really only applies to fiat currency, where it is a bad idea as the currency deflates and you are not earning interest. In bitcoin, your money actually grows more valuable when you store it, so people have an incentive to save again, amidst the orgy of Keynesian loose policy enacted to punish savers and reward spenders.

I see this as a negative devolpment for the bitcoin ecosystem. Making more people use high-fee services, linked to IRL accounts in the fiat banking system. Anything over 0.1% is considered usury in most FOREX conversion processes, now you are paying a huge premium just so you can interface with the fiat system because bitcoin is considered a grey-market exotic deflationary internet-bond, and this consolidates it's position as such. This makes it much easier for the US government to affect the valuation and liquidity of bitcoin by going after a single payment processor. When possible, we should all avoid online currency exchanges, making these transactions IRL through localbitcoins.com instead, and building a local network of trust. Only by taking bitcoin into our communities will we ever free our societies from the central bankers, or even have any affect on their ability to finance deficit spending.

Right. So this makes each transaction authority split, and by taking out the m number of keyholders, you can lock out the other (m-n) from spending. When m is the bank and the escrow-holder, and n is 1, yourself, you need at least one of those other "keymasters" to be online and authorize your transaction. They act somewhat like a "gatekeeper".

No, I estimated the cost at $40M for a complete hardware attack plus mahours to run and build it, and a 3-6 month lead-up, for a government. The problem is that in 6 months, the difficulty will have rescaled up by a factor of 100 or possibly 1000. The only possible way is for them to team up with either Intel or Samsung and start making a LOT of chips at the 22nm or smaller chip spec.

Intel's fabs don't ever "go idle". They have workers there 24 hours a day, fabbing wafers all the time (I've worked in a bunny suit at a fab for Intel). Either that or they close.


That doesn't make sense. Every step of the fab is custom-made for a single step of a specific wafer. Tens of millions of dollars are spent developing and refining each step, constantly trying to improve yield. You can't just call them up and say, "Hey, I have a new ASIC, will you guys be free for ten minutes after midnight to do a couple quick wafers for me?". A centrino fab fabs centrinos, an Ivy Bridge fab fabs Ivy Bridges. They don't fab custom ASICs. The waveguides for UUV processes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each, also...

"It's amazing to me how many people think that voting to have the government give poor people money is compassion. Helping poor and suffering people is compassion. Voting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is immoral self-righteous bullying laziness.
People need to be fed, medicated, educated, clothed, and sheltered, and if we're compassionate we'll help them, but you get no moral credit for forcing other people to do what you think is right. There is great joy in helping people, but no joy in doing it at gunpoint."-Penn Jillette

You mean "Wouldn't sacrificing their wealth be in their interest?". No, it will never be in the interest of the miners to change the ruleset to be inflationary, *ever*. Egalitarianism is not tantamount to justice or even compassion. We're in the "distribution" phase right now $100 per bitcoin is going to be like $1 per ounce of gold, looking back. Bitcoin will never be as unequally distributed as fiat though, where the 1% control almost all of it and have a printing press that they use to enslave all the others by fiat.

You make no argument to back up this assertion. I disagree.
So what happens when I hire my private police force to defend me from your private police force? How many private police forces will I need to pay to "protect" me? What you describe is mob warfare, protection rackets for everyone, rule by whoever has the most money. I would argue thats *exactly* what we have in the world today, and the gangs called "USA" and "China" have taken over. 
More to the point, what anarcho-capitalists argue for is *overlapping* geographical boundaries for legal jurisdiction, but I claim that this is impossible. There is always a *de facto* final legal authority over any territory, and this is always decided by force. Anarchism is just a blind rage against authority of any kind, it is intellectual laziness imho.

Actually, it does. You *can* do fractional reserve banking in bitcoin, but there is no incentive. There is no incentive to make a loan in a deflationary currency because the bank would be better off just holding their bitcoins and not lending them to you, unless you paid a much higher interest rate than you could get if you took out the loan in another non-deflationary specie. There is also no incentive to let other people hold onto your bitcoin private keys for you, because that is more of a security risk than it is a valuable service.

I never had a problem running it as a miner, but getting the actual network stack running to do DNS lookups through namecoin is a real challenge.

Bitfury looks good right now. They have really power-efficient chips, but they are untested in production.

Because as a borrower, I have the choice of getting that same loan at 5% in a currency that is non-deflationary, meaning I would pay back less in real terms to pay off the loan. So now the lender has to accept a lower interest rate, because the coins are deflating. Average interest is generally right around inflation at 2-3% for anything but loan sharks, and so if bitcoin is deflating at more than 2-3% per year (which it will be), then the lender would have to accept *negative* interest to make the loan attractive versus non-deflationary currencies. Then the lender would have no incentive to make the loan because they would do better off just holding the bitcoins at that point. So, the deflationary nature of bitcoin means there will *always* be less incentive for both lenders and borrowers to lend/borrow in bitcoins as opposed to an inflationary currency or even a stable commodity.

Sure, I think it is possible for people to interact on a voluntary basis. I'm a voluntaryist. Justice and police systems are legitimate functions of a government, and it is more efficient to have less agencies competing for jurisdiction, since those disputes are ultimately decided by force. I think most ancaps just think that the laws of society should not apply to them, and they just hate the idea of any legal authority structure whatsoever. My argument is that such a viewpoint is *reductionist*, since every territory already has and always will have some form of final legal authority and that authority is always ultimately decided by force.

You'll probably get chips from the third batch. This means you will get 16 chips in your 2 machines, and there will be something like 15,000 chips already shipped by that point, by my estimation. Thats enough to give you ~0.1% of the ASICs from BFL, which will probably have something like 50% of the network mining power by then. Then, if 25 coins per 10 minutes, at say $100 per coin in June, $360,000 worth of new coins mined per day at that rate, of which you will be mining an estimated 0.05%, then thats $180 per day on the first day.

It's no quite so simple. Electricity rates vary greatly by region. Some people will be mining on their office or dorm electricity also. Many people aren't necessarily interested in ROI, but more so in getting coins in exchange for fiat, via the power company, while avoiding the trouble of exchange, so they might continue to mine even if it is slightly unprofitable in terms of electricity costs. ROI is all up-front too, so a bitfury machine would still not be desireable if the price-point is too high because all the mining profits would go straight to the manufacturer, like the AsicMiner USB chips.

I *completely* disagree with this sentiment. AML registered exchanges do nothing but make the volatility and valuation of bitcoin more dependent on govenment actions, and it's a complete submission to the authority of fiat governments. The common people need anonymous transactions more than they ever have. Bitcoin was never supposed to be under the purview of the central bankers. They had their chance, their time is coming to an end.

The client can actually still be forced to hold negative coin balances, in one account you will see a negative balance and in the other you will see a fake balance that makes the net balance out. You can't send those negative or fake coins from your wallet onto the network though...
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:30:39
I think it would be better to link this to the difficulty so as the difficulty goes up, the smallest possible transaction amount goes down. You could also make it just require a proportionally higher fee as the transaction volume goes down below that minimum threshold instead of just completely disallowing it. Another option would be to make it easier for miners to optionally exclude microtransactions or certain sources such as Satoshi Dice, or just block them if they fail a certain volume to fee proportion test. So many ways to give the users more control and options, implementing a top-down control that limits the options and utility of the client is not the best solution here.

Don't listen to the above, it's *terrible* advice. If you give up your address, the government *will* track your bitcoin purchases and expect capital gains to be paid if the price goes up, unless you report a full accounting for spending those coins. This is how fiat governments intend to bottle bitcoin. AML exchanges do nothing but hurt bitcoin by making the valuation and volatility more dependent on government actions, and allow fiat governments to leech off the bitcoin economy. Use Localbitcoins.com, it's our only hope.

The "blue" rate is the market price for anonymous bitcoins, which generally hovers just under the price for AML-registered exchange-bought coins plus the American capital gains tax rate, for btc/usd anyhow. In Argentina, the blue-market rate is the rate for USD that are bought in exchange for Argentinian Pesos outside of official currency exchanges, for which the rate is controlled by the Argentinian govenment, and the difference in that case is around 30% and gaining, generally because ownership of USD is now illegal in Argentina and they have to go though a "reclamation and revalution" process which could land them in jail or under tax scrutiny. That's the future for America, USD cash will eventually be considered contraband here too!

Thats the classical argument against deflationary currency systems, the so-called "paradox of thrift" as coined by John Maynard Keynes. [Here]( are the classical counter-arguments. Actually, one of the interesting points here is the liquidity trap caused by people saving and holding cash and not lending it, which could be specifically applicable to bitcoin, however the counter to this is that right now Keynesian economists are printing so much money that they are blowing up their bond ratings and finding themselves in a liquidity trap that way, i.e. Cyprus. I'd rather have too many people with a ton of savings as the problem rather than insolvent central fiat currencies...

I agree with this. However the largest exchange still controls 90% of all trades to fiat, and is currently re-incorporating in Silicon Valley, one of the most "liberal" and restrictive counties in America, and they already require ID verification for any large transfers. Then you have offshore buckethouses popping up left and right, and ten companies competing in the fiat-to-bitcoin processing fee industry, while there are maybe 1 or 2 companies working on point-of-sale systems. The music industry micropayment business is ripe for the taking, but we have one website selling music, not even supported by a record label, with no real recognizeable bands signed up. Namecoin could make it impossible for governments to censor websites by blacking out their DNS records, but it has one developer who changes the project specs every 6 months. Will Namecoin even be updated to support ultra-prune? Namecoin's slow death is just a symptom of the fact that people don't actually care about changing currencies and how they are used, they just want to make a buck off of bitcoin as an exotic deflationary bond.

No, the bandwidth problem is a scalability problem. Eventually the blockchain will grow to a size where it is not possible to download through even a T3 line in any reasonable amount of time, and the amount of transaction data being generated at any given time could actually start rivalling than the bandwidth of the internet, meaning even if you had the current blockchain, you could *still* never sync.

That's not true.

You should avoid cryptonit, they are about as amatuer as it gets. Their system doesn't even log account details and trades so if there is a mistake, no way of sorting out who owns what.

Actually, technically it is only illegal if you state that your currency is "legal tender" in the USA. That's why LibertyDollars got shut down so fast but they can't just outright make bitcoin illegal.

I don't really care what the government has to say about it. I'll let them chase me down for it, if they can. My goal is to weaken their currency system by subverting it. I don't think it is moral for one group of men to print money to control society and send men to war. I want the ability of crony governments to rob the public through inflation and deficit spending without affecting their bond ratings to be disrupted by reducing international dependence on fiat currency systems.

I'm not sure i understand this completely. Why would being interrupted make the ASIC process stale date? Wouldn't it just cause it to spend more time than needed processing communications data?
I wouldn't describe p2pool as "limited" against any poolserver system. It actually handles about a half-dozen altcoin chains nicely as slaves, and you can even mine terracoin as a head, if you really wanted to...
