As long as you pay after the transfer is done and confirmed there should be no problems. However I would never buy a paper wallet or something of that sort because of the trust needed.

The platform provides a layer of protection that allows you to trade without having to trust the other party. Unfortunately the things you were instructed to do went around the platform and stripped away all those protections so you are at the mercy of the other party. A legitimate trader would never do that.

Some (most?) exchanges will charge you an additional flat fee per withdrawal, independent of the fee paid to miners which is necessary for the transaction.

Have you seen that Dave Chapelle sketch where the guy goes "sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that"? 
China operates on plausible deniability. 
Yes, it is a coincidence that we are starting a company with tech based on our previous manufacturing subcontracting job. Funny how our designs are exactly the same, huh? 
I have seen various chinese gambling discussion groups maintain staunchly that they are spinach discussion groups (the two words are homonyms). To them, this is an airtight defense, as long as no one starts asking too many questions.
Of course the intelligence service knows everything, but messing with some just makes the other known quantities go deeper underground.

For hyperbitcoinization, 
1. We are still a long way off and if it happens, it happens essentially everywhere at once. We are nowhere close to this. Even using the term is a huge joke and you must be high on hopium
2. Even if a country's currency becomes essentially worthless, there are lots of conventional non-bitcoin mediums of exchange to fall back on. Other currencies, USD, gold (India likes gold). If the monetary system crashed overnight the average man in the street would rather trade with packs of cigarettes than fractions of bitcoin.
3. While India is having various troubles, their economy is still pretty strong. Being hostile to bitcoin is fairly normal as governments go and not an indication of anything at all.

Not sure about your situation but it seems rather inefficient to split as soon as payment is received.

I wonder if you're interpreting it the way everyone else is. Sure the merchant must by law accept USD as payment, but there's nothing stopping him from accepting or even preferring other stuff, like coupons or in-store loyalty points or whatever. 
This is not a bad law per se, nobody wants to find out their hard-earned money is unaccepted.

Depends on how you define the price going up I guess, whether it includes temporary spikes etc. Might be prudent to sell just before as it rises to a fever pitch. For reference, Litecoin right now is roughly 33% of the price it was during its most recent halving, 2 months ago.

Not dumb at all, it sounds complicated but is actually easy once you get used to it. I'm using Electrum but probably other wallets support this as well.
Machine 1: Always offline, has normal wallet with actual private keys.
Machine 2: For normal use, create wallet with watch-only address.
You can receive and monitor the wallet as per normal with Machine 2. 
To send, create a transaction and click 'Save'. Use one of multiple ways (QR code, portable drive, etc) to transfer the unsigned transaction to the wallet software on Machine 1, which will give you the option to 'Sign' it. Save the signed transaction and move it back again to Machine 2 and 'Broadcast' to the network.

That's interesting, I have no experience in payment stuff but I think what I would do is get each partner to open an account at Coinbase (not sure about their terms regarding porn) or other exchange, so as they receive the payments they can cash out to their bank smoothly.
As for splitting it would be very clean and neat if you just split the payments up 50/50 as you receive them, as every transaction can be easily checked back by everyone transparently. However I am wondering if it would not be more efficient speed-wise to simply have a balance on the same exchange and simply transfer the correct portion to them as you receive the payments. More messy accounting-wise though.
Hopefully perhaps there's a nice merchant solution that gives everybody control over their side of the business, that would be great.

Bitpay is an established company. They will survive despite the cost of compliance. What will not survive is any new/alternative competition to bitpay without heavy backing as they might not cover the now increased costs. So all this does is corral new business towards bitpay.

Having more money is always nice. Many life problems could have been solved or even prevented, by having more money in the past.
However telling people about bitcoin like this is an asshole move, and it doesn't solve the original problem, the way the system is structured.

It's useless to argue that betting on bitcoin is 'more useful' than using up the money on goods and services, because all you get out of it is more (or less) money in the future. You could say the same for Amazon stock or Japanese bonds or Pats to win the superbowl this year.

At some point of your paranoia, you realize it's trust all the way down. And why is the checking software assumed clean then? Keep in mind 99.9% of people verifying are using the exact same methodology to do it, so it's a single point to hack every user ever. If verifying integrity of the software is important, shouldn't they dedicate slightly more thought to making things easier and more secure for us?
