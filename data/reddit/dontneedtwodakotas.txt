Defense? There is no defense here. When someone from a country with no extradition treaty with yours offers you a get rich quick scheme that involves you handing them a bunch of money digitally then you're being scammed. 
This is common sense.

How are no chargebacks a benefit for the user?

This photo was as a result of vast electrical blackouts. How do you use Bitcoin without electricity? Also, are you one of the dumbest people in the world?

Maybe people should just use currencies for spending and should rely on other investments for savings.

Nobody buys things from me, I'm not a store. So how is losing my ability to chargeback a vendor a benefit to me.

Or they'll just use a more stable currency like dollars or resort to bartering

So I'm still out my money, sounds really dumb. No thanks

No, not really. They are a big consumer feature selling point. AMEX for instance has secured the business of many high spending international travelers in part because of their high grade consumer protections that let them spend with ease and no risk in countries they otherwise don't have a good grasp of language or ability to see signs of bad faith businesses
 


I think you overestimate the IT security level of the average person. This sub routinely sees people losing their money with no recourse due to mistakes securing their own keys. Half of people can't even routinely remember their own bank password, they're supposed to be able to robustly care for keys and keep them secure?
At least if my card number is nicked there is 0% chance I actually lose money. If someone fumbles even just once with key security however they could be ruined with zero recourse. A lifetime of perfect IT security is a pretty big ask for most.


This seems like an ancap fantasy that wouldn't really pan out in reality. Before the days of credit cards there were still scams galore.

He's already out. It's just probation lol

A wildly speculative asset is not a great piece to rely on for a safeb long term investment. 
Regardless, the reality is the overwhelming majority of Venezuelans live day to day financially, they have no extra money to save for anything at all. And actually as a result inflation effects are minimized, when electricity is up they simply spend bolivars as they get them via debit cards which avoids both the issue of inflation and the issue of needing mountains of physical bills. 
Of the few Venezuelans with enough money to save most aren't investing in currencies but are instead investing in foreign assets like foreign stocks and bonds
Bitcoin is still a niche holding even in Venezuela.

Well I get paid my salary via ACH. Occasionally I have friends venmo/PayPal me money for drinks/event tickets/airbnbs etc. But these are people I know personally and trust so I have no anticipation of tomfoolery on their part 


I'm not interested in doing either of those things.

I'm not a store, I'm a consumer. This doesn't seem like a great deal. I don't have the time to personally vet every single place I buy something from in my life, it's nice knowing that even if I run across a dick who doesn't deliver in some way I can very easily get my money back

The world doesn’t fund armies by printing money, that’s not really how anything works.
Venezuela’s army wasn’t bought with printed Bolivars, it was bought with oil.

Cost is always of concern. The value of RFID may outweigh the cost in certain cases, that doesn’t mean cost isn’t a concern.

Is it untrustable? The currency in my nation has been the standard medium of transactions for my entire life and several lifetimes before me. It's been a pretty safe bet for a long time that businesses and people will accept dollars for goods and services.
