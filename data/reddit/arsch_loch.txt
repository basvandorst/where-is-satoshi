Any clue if there will be a "crypto friendly" airport in Europe? :-)

Another hodler here... I believe in btc and in the long run we'll succeed, but the price trend might be negative over the next couple of months: 
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:56:11
Not really, but Doge had a better sentiment score than btc on enroyd: 
This could have been an indicator. But then again.... predicting these sudden pumps is really difficult.
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:10:50
It could be a feature if governments were forced to use crypto. Corruption could come to an end.
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:49:01
It means that BTC controls the market: 
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:13:07
How much was btc worth 5 years ago?
Did you buy your master's degree at walmart?
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:42:16
A sexy price
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:29:12
I'm calling you an IYI. It's not the same.
You're calling me a dumbass... well, a dumbass who made a lot of money thanks to crypto ��������
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:39:02
Is this why the sentiment score is soaring today? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:03:57
Well, reality shows that people assign value to btc. 
Your theories are nice, but you're what Taleb would call a IYI (intellectual yet idiot): you have your theories but you ignore reality.
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:46:37
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:23:50
You have no clue about cryptography and why it is important. This is where bitcoin gets its value from.
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:44:28
You don't have any long-term vision.
Nobody can take btc away from you.
Content on ETH cannot be censored by any government.
But according to you it has no value?
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:17:14
Livecoinwatch is a cmc clone. Maybe they even use the cmc api.
@_date: 2018-08-13 10:36:14
I'm goin to the beach. Have a nice day at work.
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:24:06
Today the market sentiment is very bullish today: 
To me it looks like a normal correction
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:38:31
You also don't understand the fact that everything is still linked to and correlated with bitcoin: 
Once this stops, crypto as a whole will brcome a more interesting asset (for banks, hedge funds, etc)

Using the reply button is difficult, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:03:01
The number of transactions keeps increasing. You really have no clue. Non-tech guy
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:31:41
Hence gold, silver and platinum are worthless, too.
Baseball cards and collectibles in general are worthless. 
Interesting theory you have there.
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:59:59
Well, the way I see it: it's an asymmeytical bet. If it gets adopted, you'll make a lot of money. If it doesn't, you don't lose much money.
This is the problem with you non-tech guys: you have no clue about probability. This is why you'll always be salary slaves.
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:00:55
Also the correlation between BTC and alts seems to be decreasing again: 
Could this mean that money is flowing back into btc (from alts)?
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:46:02
Just have a look at the market correlations: 
The market crashed because BTC crashed - basically. 
Dominance seems to underestimate Bitcoin's real role and importance in the crypto markets.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:16:09
What's their added value? Basically they're just like cmc... and they want your personal data (if you agree)
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:37:29
Yeah, but the live data has very little added value - a day trader checks the prices directly on the exchanges. So does a bot.
Livecoinwatch slows down my browser. 
Therefore it's not a real contender.
@_date: 2018-08-13 10:41:47
I just reported you.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:58:01
I know a couple of people who invest in crypto for their retirement.... and hopefully early retirement ��
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:06:35
Who would use btc to buy drugs? Why would you use a "currency" whose transactions can be traced back to you? I'm sick of this argument.
You should also read about Gresham's law: 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:12:36
It looks like a simple EMA. Probably "fair value" is just marketing.
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:05:32
The market sentiment is also up: 
It should keep going up (hopefully) ��
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:08:49
These guys sort of predicted this dip:  
But they also predict that the next pump will come soon. Let's hope for the best....
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:16:14
Hard to tell. The market sentiment has improved lately - I'm not sure if there'll be another big dip: 
@_date: 2018-07-14 09:34:37
True, but eventually all coins seem to be correlated with BTC. Just have a look:  
If you look at these charts, investing in alts or in btc doesn't make a big difference, right?
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:46:39
It could be the etf, but maybe some whales just decided that it was time for some action.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:19:31
When moon? ��
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:43:35
The next cmc clone?
Sorry, I need some more added value, like on walletinvestor.com or enroyd.com
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:54:40
Are you a time traveller? Have you travelled into the past?
What will bitcoins price be in 2021?
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:48:08
It says December 17th.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:35:11
Why would somebody pay for something that is available for free?
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:43:18
"Buy when there is blood in the streets". This seems to be the case currently. Also the social sentiment ratings are quite negative: 
As soon as the ratings go up again, it might be too late to buy.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:57:10
It was a joke. Never mind. No harsh feelings ��
