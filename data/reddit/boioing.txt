LOL at "physical delivery" in this context.  Ah, the language of the old world...

Hah, funny.  "Vets" long term perspective is... 1 month.

Their fees:














So if I do a lot of business, and want to withdraw to an on-chain wallet, I'm paying 2%.  That's basically approaching what Visa charges, isn't it?

The "Date sold / Date acquired" is unclear to me.  Because I don't necessarily sell the same quantity that I bought.  
In the example I gave, I have two purchase dates and prices, but one sell date and price.  
So how do I write the cost basis? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:30:42
Thanks, yes, after some more research looks like "First in, first out" is the main principle I was missing.  Gets really cumbersome to split up all these buys and sells to keep the 1:1 correspondence of shares bought/sold.  
Bitcoin taxes?  That's a thing? Show me!

2 hours too late!  Would have saved me a lot of calculator work.

Just another example of cherry picking a time window to support your mindset.  If you consider the calendar year 2018 (i.e. start Jan 1st), bitcoin ending at 7K would be a huge loss vis-a-vis any traditional investment.

He also didn't really answer the question of what would happen in a deflationary situation when wages would have to *decrease* to maintain their purchasing power.

Calling someone "the Nouriel Roubini" of something after he expresses own his disgust for Nouriel Roubini... that cuts deep.

Is there a simple way to receive money yet?  a lot of the lightning solutions I read about were essentially one-way.

Even the leading Lightning wallets just have a one-page website and a link to a GitHub page, where it's super unclear what is going on.  
For example:
I look at that and think, "uhh...."
I remember running a full bitcoin node in 2013, and it was super easy.  
1) Download and install and app
2) Download/sync the blockchain
3) You're good to go.

If it doesn't beat Venmo, it will fail

also, leaders use more syllable-rich synonyms for "view"
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:54:12
Yikes.  This is why you focus group your product name before launching.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:10:38
Actually, it's probably mostly people moving money to different wallets that they control.  3.2 billion sent, but not *spent*.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:58:27


Ok, but what about gains?  By that same logic, if you use appreciated bitcoin to buy something you don't have to pay capital gains... (?)
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:15:37
I thought Tor just anonymizes you by relaying your packets through several nodes... but in the end, the last node needs to connect to the server you're looking for, and that is done using the standard routing table/trusted backbone node approach. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:05:46
Yes, routing IS the central challenge.  And the fact that the LN whitepaper doesn't specify routing doesn't make the problem go away.  It's actually punting on a HUGE implementation challenge.  Mesh network routing is UNsolved. Routing tables get unwieldy as the network scales up, especially when each route also needs to be parameterized (you need to know the capacity of each node, and that capacity is also in flux).  
Right now, the topology visible in the updated LN map is quite centralized.  And that seems to be the leading solution to routing on LN.  Heavily centralized super-nodes.  Well hello there, crypto banks!  
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:40:54
"convert fiat to LN"?  Not sure what that means.
From my understanding, adding funds to a lightning network channel requires an on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:24:39
Guys you might hate me for this, but Rick Falkvinge's analysis of the Lightning Network and its problems is worth checking out:
He's an angry, contemptuous dude, but I think he still brings up valid points.
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:59:43


If my rent is $1000, and I refill my payment channel every month with $1000, don't I still have to log a transaction on the blockchain every time I top up?  In which case, what's the point of the lightning channel, I can just pay directly on blockchain since I'm paying a fee anyway for topping up
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:11:16
I haven't used bitcoin ATMs, but honestly, a 7% fee seems totally absurd to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:33:06
Hilarious to see intense fashion criticism on r/Bitcoin .  
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:06:07
This is creepy as fuck.  And I'm not sure why you're advocating killing those people who have a lot of bitcoin?  I'm not really comfortable with that.

I wonder how much they paid some Ad-guy to come up with "BankAmeriDeals (R)" 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:33:11
Thanks for the explanation.  Makes sense.  At this early stage, I can understand how it's capital-intensive.  Hopefully as this gets more popular, the economies of scale will kick in and bring those per-transaction costs down.
