I don't want to sound like a dick right now, because honestly I feel like we've actually had a moment... You can't trust a thing people come up with. That's absolutely true... Remember this applies to things you've already accepted as true. Unless you really understand the technical details of Bitcoin AND socioeconomics we are all taking other people's words for things. But hear me out for one second. Bitcoin core is the only one doing things the hard way. They are the only ones sacrificing user experience for decentralization. If your side is right, and decentralization doesn't matter, we have tons of other options that can survive and provide the change in the world that Bitcoin promised. But if you are wrong, without core, we lose everything.
To be frank, we sure as shit aren't going to endanger the world altering fundamentally amazing invention that is Bitcoin without a good godamn reason and hard consensus among even the most curmudgeonly libertarians and cryptophreaks.

@_date: 2018-01-09 16:25:22
I think there's some middle ground between your stance and the stance you describe. You're possibly dangerously close to a vocal majority on the other side...
Couple other points: One, the pro-segwit crowd is not a minority by any measure be it hash, market, or nodes. It's not even close.. Conservative estimates would put it at ~75%. Regular users are most likely ambivalent but pro low fees... 
Two, this brigading minority is more powerful than you believe: he put out that second tweet recently as damage control. I'm part of the bitcoin community in New England and off the top of my head know of accounts equaling ~50 million USD that have moved on from Coinbase due to this debacle, myself NOT included (though if he continues to delay improvements I will).
You are correct though that a great CEO understands what consumers really want, despite what they may be saying. But I think you'd have to be off your rocker to think that the bitcoin community AT LARGE doesn't want lower fees than what we are currently seeing. Segwit delivers that for minimal resources..

Anyways... out of those thousands of coins, 95% of them are money grabs. A select handful are actively developed and will continue to be developed for a a 5yr period, probably less than ~30ish coins.

By far the largest and most experienced developer team in the space.
Also, and this isn't as sexy, but all blockchain tech has scaling problems.. noone is tackling this head-on while keeping decentralization the number 1 priority (possibly even to a fault) like Bitcoin core. Ether seems to be fine with pruning and sharding and other solutions which reduce decentralization and individual sovereignty. Bitcoin cash is taking the easy road and just making blocks bigger hurting decentralization. 
It takes a lot of moral character and principal to do what is hard, to do what makes a lot of people angry,  while easier solutions are readily available, because you believe it is right. Bitcoin core is in this to change the world for the better. 95% of the altcoins are created because "hey this idea could sell" regardless of whether or not it actually does anything of use.
In a trustless world, Bitcoin core has shown time and time again why they are worth trusting.

Your post isn't asking a question.. It's positing a ridiculous hypothesis that the mempool must be cleared or else fees will skyrocket. You back that up with a picture of the mempool.
I would have moderated your post as well. Its two lines, a picture, and brings nothing new to the table. It's at best white noise, at worst malicious propaganda (more likely).
Ask a question if you have one. 
And if you are going to claim something, try backing it up with evidence... Why do you think a mempool must necessarily empty? Should 0-fee transactions be possible? If so, I'd like to hear why you think 0-fee transactions and unlimited blockspace is not an attack vector.

I fully agree. My use of the term 'brute force' was a bit harsh, or at least it didn't adequately describe the nuances of the debate, but I couldn't think of a pithier adjective. 
We should scale on chain as well. And I would have been fine with s2x had it come through the ranks like any other proposal. The way it was developed was what worried me most about it. There's absolutely a balance here. We just need some time to figure it out. 
I wouldn't call myself an L2 believer either, though I'm optimistic. I have a lightning node running on testnet and I can't figure the damn thing out. I've open a single channel but have no idea how to use that channel to route payments. Obviously, it needs some UI work....
Segwit is backwards compatible so while its a degree of 'messing with L1' its a far more benevolent change than any hard fork change would be. 
All and all, your concerns are entirely reasonable. If everyone involved in this debate had conversations like this I think we'd be a lot better off, which goes back to my original point in this thread. Thanks.

It doesn't matter how big the block size is. If blocks are ten times bigger I pay 1 tenth to make ten transactions to fill it up. 
Creating thousands of transactions is not computationally hard.
It's about actual economic demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:56
I constantly monitor the mempool. Two weeks ago fees in the 20-30s were getting in the next block. To have a 5 dollar fee not go in in 24 hrs is a lie. Hence, he delivered no such transaction ID. Please, look at the mempool and find a transaction from 2 weeks ago with a 5 dollar fee that took 24 hours to go through.. 
It's fine to complain about real fee problems.. But making stuff up to fit a narrative is annoying.

No it's not.. nailing a garden chair to a car is completely ridiculous and frankly insulting to anyone with technical expertise who has worked on ln. 
In this analogy what is the first car? The entire bitcoin ecosystem? A block? If it's a block the analogy is worthless, ln exists separate from the car, and simply uses the existing seats in the car to store information that somehow allowed the separate system to send passengers instantly with no cars. Literally if a block is a car the ln is better represented as a teleportation device that allows people to travel anywhere, so long as they keep a small article inside a car that remains secure.
If the car is the bitcoin ecosystem, I honestly have no idea what ln would be like because a car is a terrible comparison to a decentralized currency. What do the seats of the car represent? 
I've spent enough time on this.. the analogy is very poor and, again, insulting to those who spent time developing ln

Yes, it is a long time... a fraction of the time you claimed, but still a very long time. The fee was also ~2.25USD.
But I'm sure that was a frustrating transaction. And that is fine to discuss and talk about. Lying about it, though, is kind of shitty and is a really big problem. I know it might seem like a little issue, but those types of lies are the ones that get exacerbated and cause the massive divide that we see today. I'm a lot more prone to calling you a 'shill' and a 'troll' and not take you seriously if you are exaggerating a situation for effect. And once that happens, everyone gets all bent out of shape...

Sorry to offend you, but again, youn don't get it. Tokens can be layered on bitcoin or any other working blockchain (all sorts of sidechains, two way pegged etc.). They can be secured by the issuing of the base chain. So really, you don't understand the tech...
Haha, of course the police won't be replaced by the blockchain... I don't think ANYONE said that...
Token systems verify a lot, like my seat at the opera or my spot on a ferry. 
You can solve that 'security issue' with multisig addresses and town involvement (which it always would have been, I don't think anyone would have assumed a blockchain solution to house deeds would be a single signature asset. STILL FAR more efficient than the current system...
So really, keep digging. But all of your points belie your lack of understanding.

I'm not at all angry. I'm explaining why you were moderated. Now you can be angry, and ragequit to rBTC, or you can see that your post was empty of meaningful dialogue and adapt to join in the conversation..
According to your comments here, you're post was actually saying "having more demand for transactions than room will cause fees to increase.".. While this is better than the text you actually used in your post, it again, is not adding anything to this subreddit that you cannot deduce through common sense? I would be fine with you providing 'helpful' information like that, but if that was your intent, you really did a horrible job conveying it, and again, I would moderate your efforts in the hope that users would rely on other informative posts.
At the end of this, your post was entirely without merit...
If you want to go into more details about your hypothesis:
Yes, having higher demand for transactions then available space will cause an increase in tx costs. This will occur up until the limit is hit for which market participants will not pay. This is pure supply and demand. If you think blocks should be bigger, OK.But you can't have blocks be big enough to always clear the mempool. Or else bitcoin would be very vulnerable to spam attacks.... Large blocks lead to mining propagation issues and centralization of both mining and non-mining nodes. These are not trivial issues.

He could have stated that better. It's very geographically dependent on cheap energy, but nothing else. That's the only requirement and so it becomes a mechanism of arbitrage for energy prices. 
Most other industries require a certain type of workforce, specific resources, transportation/distribution, market, etc. Mining requires a box next to a power plant.

That's almost as absurdly simplistic as people who assume it should be vastly easier for coinbase to integrate segwit. Fact of the matter is they both have similar problems.

First off, there is no "fully centralized" or " fully decentralized" just a continuum. Bitcoin is mostly decentralized but mining is very centralized and node count could be higher. On ramps to Bitcoin are also very centralized. If there's anything to complain about now it's centralization it mining and onramps, high fees as well.
Lightning network provides some assistance to the high fees problem while not causing any further centralization of mining or nodes. Lightning network is a layer 2 solution that sits on top of the blockchain. 
On chain scaling helps with higher fees as well, but most likely only in the short term. It also causes additional Miner and full node centralization. On chain scaling changes directly affect Bitcoin.
Having a centralized layer 2 solution is vastly preferable to a centralized layer 1 solution, as layer 2 solution would be optional and can come and go without centralizing and destroying Bitcoin. But the lightning network is not centralized, it's just more centralized than Bitcoin. It's a hub and spoke network versus a mesh network. But anyone can start a channel with anyone, send payments to anyone, etc. And no single entity controls the lightning network. There are quite a few Dev teams all working together to provide some cross functionality.
Bitcoin needs to scale, there's no denying this. Scaling will cause centralization pressures at some level. Noone is denying this either. The question is, should we centralize layer 1 or later 2? Or more precisely, how much centralization pressure can we handle on chain and how much can we defer to layer 2.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:04:34
Oh I apologize for that. I take no issue with your post then. 
I'm sorry you've run into people ignoring the problems with commerce on BTC right now.. That hasn't entirely been my experience. In my opinion this subreddit and most of its long term participants understand a couple things. 1.) There has always been a question mark as to how to scale bitcoin. 2.) We aren't technologically there yet. 3.) Brute forcing the problem by making full nodes more resource intensive and hurting smaller mining pools is a kneejerk reaction.
We have a fee problem. We have a scaling problem. But there are possibly solutions to those that don't require us to mess with L1. We should exhaust those. If that means that Bitcoin Cash or some other alternative wins out, so be it. None of the current alternatives look promising to me (in terms of preserving decentralization) but thats fine and I'm glad we have those alternatives. But to harm the only blockchain that is tackling the problem head-on (preserving small blocks AND decentralization) because we can't yet buy our goods with BTC is small minded.
If blockchain technology can't scale (whether through L2 solutions or simply on chain) at least we still have a decentralized store of value protected from government intervention.

Ok, well those same vulnerabilities exist in current bitcoin wallet software then. So you should investigate those, because wallet software takes signed transactions and then sends them to mempool. Ln software takes signed multisig transactions and then sends them to mempool. 
.... In theory, where is the vulnerability? In what step?
I'll help you.. it would have to be in recognizing a valid signature (trivial, current wallets do the same), or sending (trivial, current wallets do the same). The watchtower issue is the only new step, but that's literally the ability to read the block chain and look for a specific transaction, (pretty trivial, block explorers do that, so do some wallets).... 
In what step are you concerned? Please be detailed.

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:35:01
Just so I understand what you are doing:
You asked for an attack vector where nonmining nodes are important. One VERY important attack vector would be in an instance of miner centralization (a problem we are currently dealing with) large changes to the ecosystem could be made by very few actors (S2X). 
Once I gave you a very credible example, you decided to change the argument. 
S2X, the actual code (apart from some bugs) I found to be acceptable for the reasons you stated. I just paid ~ 20$ in fees this week for 3 transactions and its absolutely cost-prohibitive. This needs to change. But I prefer to follow the BIP process and I prefer to have full access to the code and its corresponding dialogue as its produced. I prefer to stick with the developers we have trusted for YEARS, developers who, despite some character flaws have clear track records of doing what is right for bitcoin above all else. 
Bitcoin is more susceptible to social attacks than anything else. Painting the current core dev team as anything besides perhaps 'principled to a fault' is beyond disingenous. They are the only dev team NOT taking the easy way out right now. It's EASY to increase the blockchain and POTENTIALLY risk increasing centralization of mining and nonmining nodes. It's much harder to optimize the protocol and encourage L2 solutions in the face of constant attack.

Agree with you except for security bit. Ln is using bitcoin signed transactions at it's base. So long as bitcoin remains secure ln remains secure. It's very similar to a hot wallet in terms of security.
You can discuss watchtowers etc. But I'm not convinced those are relevant to a discussion about security. At the end of the day watchtowers are just watching the block chain for valid transactions that are out of date in regards to your channel. So, again, as long as bitcoin transactions cannot be faked, lightning is secure.
Is it itself scalable to levels required? Remains to be seen. But security is difficult to question.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:52:20
The "slew" of new code (not very specific) does not introduce any new method of transmitting bitcoin.. you just don't seem to understand this. All of the functionality, from a security standpoint, emerges from tried and true bitcoin methods. The ln is built on top of bitcoin and sends bitcoin transactions, the new complex code does not change bitcoin. 
What are you even taking about with "infallible transaction signatures when sometimes (someone?) decides to do a payment"?  You say, "there is complex code for... generating signatures"??? Again, are you questioning wallet software???
Are you questioning the ability to "parse transactions and previous history"??? Again, it's pretty trivial to validate transactions and that is something that most wallet software does today.
You do not understand the ln. Honestly, you may have a tenuous grasp on bitcoin itself, seeing as you think that "signing" transactions commit it to the block chain.
Thats ok though. Keep researching.

Agree with most of analysis. Monero is reported as having way too much upside. Old alts do not see growth like that, they wither, regardless of tech, because the alt market is hugely speculative in nature and new promise is easier to sell to speculators than tried and true. Privacy is not required by the vast majority of market participants, and bitcoin itself has semi solutions today and will have full solutions soon rendering the need for a privacy alt obsolete.

No I agree with you. But it's a smaller subset of the market, and again, it's an old coin. Think of all the zcash crap etc that took chunks out of moneros market cap, despite monero being the most widely used and accepted privacy centric coin. Alt coins are sadly just not valued due to use. You yourself used eth as an example.. it's all speculation, new investors hoping to find the next bitcoin selfishly chasing the gains the early early adopters saw. 
I like monero, I really do. I'd go so far to say it is the number 2 coin to btc. But I do not think the market will ever ever come to realize that.

A great deal of resentment and pressure would be assuaged by it. It is misleading to say that it 'will absolutely not be over' as if there is a large vocal majority calling for 8mb or greater. If you look at the history of this, as OP did, it becomes fairly apparent that the vocal majority want something, but are willing to greatly compromise on what that something is.
I do not feel any sort of great ill-will towards the core devs. They work hard, are knowledgeable, and above all.. I trust them. This is the most important thing to me. I trust them to not let BTC fall into 'their' hands (government blah blah conspiracy). The last thing I want to see is BTC centralized and corrupted. Having said all that, Core, specifically Theymos and lukejr, have shown themselves to be  exceptionally poor at understanding human behavior and communication. While I can't personally speak to their technical competence (though I am sure it is high), I can safely say they have exacerbated the situation at nearly every turn. 
Again, I do not blame core for staying at 1MB, I blame them for their aversion towards open discussion. It should be said, on behalf of Core, that there was probably some organized effort by spammers/trolls etc. to infiltrate the subreddit with misinformation. However, censorship, especially in a community of tech-savvy/libertarian/free-thinkers, was by far the worst course of action. This should be obvious to anyone with experience in public relations, communications or management (or sadly, really anyone with general life or work experience). Blowback is simple to comprehend and mitigate... 
Core isolates itself to everyone's detriment. There are intelligent people out here who can recognize coherent and logical explanations (as to why 1MB stays) and distinguish this from trolling/spamming etc. Core needs to trust US as we trust them. They, thus far, have failed. And it's not surprising... Like US, Core is comprised of people with libertarian/anarchist/cypherpunks ideals. 
Core should focus on logical explanations as their main communication tool, and leave manipulation and censorship to the professionals. Intelligent people can tell the difference, and we are not yet at the stage where we need to worry about the general population (they will follow an app or utility anyways, not a subreddit discussion). Another great reason to avoid manipulative measures: they are far better at that game than you are. 
Tldr Stick to the high road. Stick to the code.

That's your definition of censorship, which is fine (though quite radical), but is not the commonly accepted definition. From wiki: "... is the suppression of speech, public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable... When an individual such as an author or other creator engages in censorship of their own works or speech, it is called self-censorship... It occurs in a variety of different media, including speech, books, music, films, and other arts, the press, radio, television, and the Internet for a variety of claimed reasons including national security, to control obscenity, child pornography, and hate speech, to protect children..." Just using the radio as an example, radiohosts often refer to parts of speech 'getting by the censor'. etc. This is commonplace. To take your example, an elementary teacher might ask you to 'censor your language' in front of the children... Again, a commonplace occurrence. We (collectively, society) arrive at definitions primarily through our most common experiences/usages of that word. 
If we were just quibbling over the definition of a word, I would not have responded as there's no point in that. However, I get the feeling you are trying to rationalize or minimize the censorship that occurred. I think that's to the communities detriment.. First they take an inch, then they take a mile. It's best to speak up as soon as possible lest we fall into a regime imposing "real" censorship.
Please also read my post history on this throwaway. I am very much pro-core. I am also very much anti-censorship.

You do know that it being easier is meaningless in this argument. One could argue that its probably more representative of the actual economic majority because the barrier to entry is less. There is no economic incentive in node distribution, whereas mining has an economic incentive that necessarily causes centralization. Mining is not a measure of the economic majority, thats for certain. Node count is debateable.. But you certainly cant argue (which I believe is what you are implying) that mining is more representative of the majority because it is harder to do and only a select few can do it. That makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:12:09
Because you cant just want something and have it. Just because we all want the blockchain to be big enough to house every single transaction and to do it instantly doesn't mean that can actually happen AND retain security decentralization. If you rea the arguments (they have been posted a thousand times) that core has come out with, you can see that wildly increasing the blockchain will ABSOLUTELY cause centralization pressure. Increasing it by a moderate amount, will probably cause some, a small amount, may be negligible. It should be possible to increase it, and CORE devs are trying (see segwit etc.) but they are trying to do so responsibly. Because security and decentralization (of the main chain!!!) are CORE (no pun intended) attributes to BTC and it is NOT worth risking either of those in order to defend against pricing small people out (an event that has NOT happened yet). If you are super worried about the cost of transactions right now, I'd say you aren't using BTC that often. It is still extremely cost-effective to send BTC. It is ALL posturing/propaganda/politics that has everyone up in arms. There is still time to slowly develop and do things right. Core believes this, BTU? I think there are clear indications they are willing to spend more money on mining subsidies and spamming reddit than they are on good developers.

This came up in a different thread and I thought it was a great concept: 
"5ish different mining algorithms all re-adjusting independently would allow for new decentralized algorithms to be added and old algorithms to be pruned on some centralization metric (or random)? Has this concept been explored at all?
One algorithm necessarily gets pruned every set timeframe and a new one added... It keeps hashrate rolling, while making centralized mining a difficult business venture?"
 Even if algorithms are just dropped at random (perhaps with a higher likelihood if they are the longest standing algo) I could see this as greatly reducing the ability or desire of manufacturers to produce ASICs. On the flip side, we would still retain some high hashrate/ASIC protection from the older algorithms while opening up to new players on a regular basis? A pool of new algorithms could be widely known, but chosen from at random?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:52:12
I'd love to hear u/luke-jr 's take on this type of mining. It sounds genuinely good?

its a tough metric... let me use the worst case scenario: I make a crappy premine altcoin, i get it listed, i buy and sell it at a price to anchor the market way higher than it should be (any value in this case). lets say there are a million coins and im buying/selling at $10 bucks.... i just moved this metric by adding 10 million to the market cap pool of altcoins..
you are right though that some alts have done well over the last 4 years. and i do think this is a good thing, they are a testing ground for new ideas, but i dont think any can realistically replace BTC

Hi, I completely agree that less money will be lent out. That was my point, perhaps I didn't explain it well (I rarely do when typing on my phone). As less money is lent, people will not be able to pay as much for houses. Demand will drop (not directly because houses are "necessary"  and supply is "fixed" but for all intents and purposes value will drop [we could probably argue here about the effect on rent prices etc]). Prices will drop. The people who were priced out (by not having access to loans)  can still outcompete their peers (their relative wealth didn't change just everyone had less access to money) and they eventually get the home for a lower price. This is obviously simplified and I'm taking a process that takes some time (market correction) and applying it to a single hypothetical family.
I agree, interest rates will be higher. But the rest of the economy changes with it (i.e. prices drop, savings grow). Do you see my point? I don't disagree with you or your logic, its just not a simple question or answer. There are books written on this subject, and honestly, both sides can make very strong cases. I find it interesting, I don't pretend to know if a deflationary currency will work in today's society, but I know enough to say we really don't know.

Again, you claimed an economic majority supports it. From what I've seen FAR FAR from it.
My claims are: 1) we should probably upgrade and then investigate, not rush into things, and 2) their timeline was crazy crazy rushed. that should be obvious to anyone.

Potentially not though. As has been pointed out by others, its assymetric meaning it can scale difficulty down but not up. Right now you can't argue the fact that BCH is being abused by miners grabbing quick rewards (inflating ahead of schedule). It will continue like that until the next retarger (~1hr). Then difficulty goes to where it should be... They can then stop for the EDA cycle.. Difficulty quickly drops and they begin abusing it again.

You're missing the point of decentralization. Bitcoin could work right now with 10 nodes and none would notice. But if any state power wants to shut bitcoin down it has 10 datacenters to visit... that's it, over. If everyone had a full mining node on their cell phone, we'd be unstoppable. Somewhere in the middle is where we want to be. And you're right... its probably too centralized right now. Probably... but everyone's trying to figure this out and stepping on an 8x gas pedal doesn't sound too smart especially when fees are extremely reasonable right now

You can keep pretending only a few people wanted UASF if that makes you happy.

Less money being lent out does not necessarily mean less value or resources in the economy as savings increase now at a larger rate (deflationary). You could argue that the resources are constant and tied more to production/natural resources/ human resources than financial instruments creating wealth (either through inflation of base currency via lending or inflation of value via savings)

I was making transactions yesterday for ~5 cents and that was a large transaction (not usd but inputs). pretty sure right now some 0 fees are going through.... If its free there will never be a reason to improve throughput (not by simple scaling by better code)
Right now, yes we could spin them up. If it becomes cost-prohibitive we can't... I think we agree on things, I just err of the side of caution and you're a bit more gung-ho. That's fine. I think adoption is incredibly important and high fees hinder that. But, right now, with the spam attack behind us and segwit in front of us we are in great shape... Fee's should be extremely low in the coming months. We shouldn't rush into things when there is no pressing need.

... it should be obvious that this is at the very least a possible attack vector for basically every currency or information messaging system ever created. You could do this to the U.S. postal service and delay mail. You could pay in millions of pennies and delay cash transactions...
Whether this is an "attack" or not I don't know.. but what would be a terrible design would be if you changed the way the network treated this attack, by say, making blocks adaptive in size. A large miner could then spam attack, get most of their fees back, delay block propagation, increase network costs for other miners, and therefore buy themselves a mining advantage which slowly spirals towards a single dominant miner
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:25:01

Yes but it's a tenet they had been debated quite ferociously by the other side who refer to the pow as a "vote" or even pointing to it as "consensus". Clearly miners are just profit seekers, they don't show us the way, they follow the money. The users who assign prices are the leaders...

Hi tekdemon, I'm not a whale... For you and I (assuming you aren't either), the best we can do with our somewhat limited funds is invest in the currency. For people with a lot of money, the best they can do is invest in the currency AND the ecosystem because they know a healthy ecosystem is going to grow the underlying asset. If we make a 400% return we make a few grand, maybe a few hundred grand (I won't pretend to know your investment level).. If a large investor earns 100% they earn millions or hundreds of millions. That means if they have to buy 100 million USD of BTC, and then invest 100 million of USD into BTC companies, in order for their original BTC investment to be worth 400 million, it is very much worth it.

No, you could not argue that its 71 times as difficult, that would most certainly not be the case! That's sort of my point. I don't know how to help you see that, other than to think about the problem of limited resources (google that term). But basically, if theres room on the blockchain, I'll drop my fee and use it when I wouldn't have if I was forced to use a higher fee. You can't just say the same economic activity equates to the same amount of transactions. That's not how it would work. I know for a fact I would have used 2-3x more transactions today then I actually did, as I was combining wallets into a new segwit address (normalyl I like to send smaller test transactions but refrained today due to fees). So with less fees we get more transactions per economic activity. We also have lower fees so spam costs less per kb to fill. So, again, its not certain that it would cost more to fill a larger block, it probably would, but to what extent we don't know. Certainly not 8x (or 71 times) less... It's probably a fairly similar number cost wise, believe it or not.

I'll go into this briefly. Economics is not a hard science. While most economics experts believe a currency must be inflationary some do not. It's not surprising that most believe it does as that's the system in place today and it works ok ( though banks can centralize per, and people are slowly and invisibly taxed, among other interesting issues). Let's look at his home example or money lending allowing more people to buy expensive goods. It makes sense at first but only if you consider the price of expensive goods fixed. For example, if less people are lending money, then the demand for houses would drop. Prices would decrease. People wanting to sell and move would naturally lower their prices until demand catches up. Easy low interest lending is what caused the real estate bubble in part. Some people believe these artificial bubbles are a bad thing, some think them necessary. We don't really know what will happen with a deflationary currency, especially when it's going to work along side inflationary ones. While he thinks this is a long term insurmountable problem, he, and noone else I promise you, can prove that. Much like I can't prove otherwise. Time will tell, its a very interesting time in history, specifically economic history with so much fin tech coming up.

They only needed to be fearful of the UASF because it had a great deal of support. By most accounts 80% of people wanted Segwit, UASF forced the hand of the remaining miners.
The x2ers only need to be fearful if, again, the majority are against them. We'll find out soon.

I'm not sure what your definition of cashing out is, but if its "converting to cash/usd" then no, not necessarily (see above). If its "creating sell pressure to fiat" then no, not necessarily (see above). If its "exchanging btc for any other good or thing of value", then yes, necessarily.

You should get out and talk to more actual users of BTC. That's all I can tell you. The list of signatories is missing all the exchanges last I checked.. That's quite a problem if you want to claim the economic majority.... Besides that, a list of companies does not necessarily = economic majority. The users, the buyers and sellers, they assign the value.
My claims have not at all been rejected. In fact, all evidence speaks to the contrary. UASF? Successful. On-chain scaling (bitcoin cash) ~&lt;10% of the economic majority. 
Have you considered the NYA was successful because people wanted segwit... You seem to think that people only wanted the latter half of the compromise, or that the compromise being packaged together was somehow greater than its parts. We'll find out in November. Until then dude, seriously meet real life folks who  use bitcoin/talk bitcoin/run bitcoin startups. The simple fact that you can't agree that this is rushed is a big red flag for someone ignoring the obvious.

What if I said I made transactions 25 times smaller. Because that is what just happened. 100 bitcoin transactions were made which take up the space of 4 transactions on the block chain. Again these were bitcoin transactions, 100% in my control, incredibly fast. Honestly, it was fun.. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:10:42
No, I'm using a second layer that provides for extensive scaling. Look, I understand where you are coming from but hating on the lightning network is to hate on bitcoin itself. It's a super cool solution to scaling. Now there are other solutions, and maybe some are better, but maybe they aren't.. all I can tell you is I literally had a lot of fun sending micro transactions of actual bitcoin instantly.
Try it.
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:06:19
Wholeheartedly disagree. Most alt coins have shelf-lives. BCH has had its pumps, each getting smaller and smaller than before. BCH's value proposition was: "This could become the real bitcoin." That dream is dead now, its not new, its not fresh, its not doing anything that other alt coins aren't doing. Newbs like new, they want to believe they are outsmarting the market and are the first to discover a coin. Sure, BCH, LTC, ETH, etc will still get their pumps from time to time... but the real pumps, the big pumps, are reserved for those shiny new coins. The speculative market values mysterious potential over tried and true.
BCH is quite nearly a failure. The only surprise it has left is a slow, plodding, decline to irrelevancy. If you want a cheaper alternative to BTC there are better alternatives that have far more traction.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:57:55

You've got that incredibly backwards.. look at the dev work done by the people who you think are trying to undermine bitcoin. Seriously.
 Ver, Wright, etc. All those people who peddle the block stream conspiracy garbage can manipulate the rhetoric, control the story, politicize the community until the cows come home, but all you have to do is look at who's writing good code to know the truth. Time and Time again Maxwell, wiulle, van der laan, Matt, et al provide awesome code that maximizes all that is good about bitcoin.
To argue that they are undermining decentralization is completely ass backwards. They are the only dev team taking a bold stand to try and solve scaling while maintaining decentralization. If they are wrong, don't worry, there are thousands of alts going the easy way, leveraging future centralization for cheap transactions now.
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:57:12
I agree. I also see a decline from 0.11 to 0.05 as a distinct possibility in the mid term. It's always tough to tell...
It is definitely about increasing btc, most traders understand that. For me, personally, I have had mixed success with alts.. when it's good it's good, when it's bad it's bad. I tend to believe the best way to acquire btc is to accumulate via USD purchases and hodl. But that's a strategy learned over the last few years.. all newbs like to dabble. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:50:46
No it won't be the same. Between yesterday and today I made something like 100 ln transactions for the cost of 4 on chain transactions. That's scaling. No matter what dumb shit the bcash/altcoiners can spew, that is real scaling.
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:49:37

Use the dust at Lightning Spin
Withdraw your winnings (or lose all your dust)

I'm not trying to be a dick... if you don't see the benefit of bitcoins inability to change you don't get bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is valuable because of its immutability. Even with 80 percent of the hash rate and major corporations on board, bitcoin just fended off a modification that did not have user consensus. 
Again, I'm not trying to insult you. Just look deeper at what gives bitcoin value. Immutability/ Dee centralization is far more important than low fees. 
How long have you been watching interviews and reading about bitcoin? Honest question... keep reading etc. Also, and I can't recommend this enough, find a local meetup and attend. Ask around for their opinion of cores competency.

Alright, let's talk right now. Right now running a full node is cost prohibitive for everyone but the first world. And even then its not a trivial matter. I have a personal computer that I run a full node on, but its a tough choice to take up so much of my bandwidth... if its on, I'll see significant issues streaming hd etc. So I'll turn it off on occasion.. and I have Verizon fios...
I'd love to run a full node at work (free bandwidth! ) but my work computer has 650 gb hard drive.  Dedicating 200gb to btc doesn't leave me enough room for my actual work files...
I will bet 1mbtc you don't run a full node, and never have. You won't see the problems until you try to actively participate in the security of the system.

Mm you're right. These open source devs volunteering their time should probably give you a personal schedule for the launch of lightning.

They don't 'happen' to like it. ViaBTC made bitcoin cash based off proposals by Bitmain: 
That's from their own site. They attempt to distance themselves at the bottom of the blog but its common knowledge that bitcoin ABC developed by bitmain/ver/viabtc.
The active developer(s???) is Amaury Sechet (most well known for stealing code without proper attribution). When they opened up the whole 'we need a new EDA because our last one just accidentally let miners rake in more profit then intended! oops!' they looked at some others peoples code, then surprise surprise went with Amaury's even though most models indicated an alternative was superior. To make that 'decision' they asked impartial 3rd parties, one of which was Craig Wrights company, to review. 
Jihan Wu, Craig Wright, and Ver birthed this idea at the 'future of bitcoin conference'. Denying this is silly.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:44:14

Smeggletoot is doing a great job responding to you but I'd like to point out something a bit critical...
You've clearly done a lot of research, but it has also very clearly been skewed by your predisposition or inherent biases. The fact that you can quite confidently claim that bitcoin has no value and is pure speculation, yet you do not immediately understand what is meant by the "double spend" problem shows that you are not at all aware of the technical value bitcoin represents. 
I'm not trying to be a dick, you're definitely doing your due diligence, but be cautious of the fact that you have so quickly determined it has no value without understanding at all its technical merits. I would also caution others who find value without understanding..
Best of luck. Keep an open mind.

No it'd be more like bitcoin is bad because 50% of the core developers are ex criminals, 25% is a proven conman, and 25% actively gamed the system for their profit and blocked upgrades to that system for many years.
That's what we're saying. Not some people are bad, but literally the people who run bitcoin cash,and its lead dev, are provably bad actors in this space and outside of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:16:37
So, again, just to be clear. Your entire opinion of bitcoin hinges on having low transaction fees... Thats what you value. So, again, thats pretty foolish. It's beyond foolish. Great job throwing insults around though, thats definitely the sign of someone who has everything figured out.
Anyways, I have GREAT news for you. There are many many cryptocurrencies out there that have low transaction fees, and getting them accepted via the same payment processors as bitcoin is an inevitability, not a possibility. It will happen. So you will absolutely without question have the crypto you want... I don't know why you are so angry..
I'm glad I have the bitcoin I want, because Bitcoin is the only game in town that is currently more worried about decentralization than it is adoption. And, my friend, I value the crap out of decentralization.
Great job quoting Satoshi's SUPER technical argument... His word is gospel. Long live the king and all that..
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:47:21
Ya but your not just taking it from idiots and corrupt people, you're also taking it from new people who genuinely don't know any better AND increasing the size of the pump and thus it's appeal just by participating. 
If smarter investors didn't participate those pumps would not be as big and the pump originators would have less fools you fleece. 
Sure, you can ride the waves, but you are (and this is coming from someone who used to justify it) on pretty thin moral ground doing so.

Look, you've blown what was a simple statement into a personal attack on yourself. It was never intended that way. I can tell you with certainty that the books, videos,  etc have not been providing you with accurate information. Fyi, books and videos are other people's opinions too... my recommendation to bring it to the real world is so you don't get fooled by active misinformation against core... which you have clearly fallen for if you think they have a conflict of interest whereby they make more money by inflicting damage on bitcoin for no reason. It should be obvious to anyone that of that were true, that scaling was simple and necessary and they were purposefully hindering btc then some other crypto will come in and win, thus rendering their efforts pointless. Keep investigating. If you aren't going to do the real life thing, check out the code that core devs write. So much of it is completely unpoliticized and beneficial and represents great amounts of time and competence. Why would they do that just to try and kill bitcoin with their next breath....

I think you could argue that a store of value that appreciates and can be sent anywhere in the world is a product and or service. 
Bitcoin takes an appreciating asset, lets say gold, and puts it in a box and delivers it to whomever you choose.
Mining companies sell the gold.
Western Union basically sells the box.
Now a computer network does both.

But "his opinion" is weighed very vey heavily. Let's say he wants a change and some developers disagree, so they fork from one another...

What stats are false? Ver is a proven criminal, Wright is a proven liar/conman, etc. etc. Are you denying this?
Amaury Sechet... he has, time and time again, stolen code with attribution. He is the lead dev, basically the only dev, for bitcoin cash. Ver and Wright are basically the only miners for bitcoin cash. Comparing bitcoin cash and bitcoin is disingenuous from the get go.
Ad hominem? Honestly? The entire project stinks of a scam, all of its founders can be tied to immoral behaviour, and you think that can just be thrown out as evidence because the creators aren't their creation and vice versa? At some point you have to realize that these people directly influence bitcoin cash and can make it whatever they so choose. Why would anyone want a coin run by them? Look at the nodes... They are run on AWS. It's not decentralized, its purchased.

This is going to sound really dumb, but I want people to make death threats over BTC. I'm not a loony saying its the right thing to do, or that Vinny in any way shape or form deserves this, but having a BTC that is not controlled by a government is a world changing, paradigm shattering event and it is something worth fighting for. Again, I don't think we are there yet, and I don't in anyway condone these actions, but at some point, I'd like to think we would defend BTC with our lives.

The word 'stable' implies he will always have a job and income as long as he desires it barring any unforeseen medical issues.
I have a very stable job, life insurance, disability, etc. Basically, I am, by luck and by effort, in a situation where I can guarantee income for my family even in the case of my injury or death. 
This isn't abnormal, but it is a blessing. By paying for those things, it allows me to participate in riskier investments, to leverage low interest rates as aggressively as possible etc.
It's all cost/benefit analysis. Admittedly, life has a lot of variables though.

There are a lot of posts about shill accounts on rBTC, search around and look for them. Beyond that, here's a great way to see how much of that support is real:
Go to a local bitcoin meetup and ask around! Ask their opinion on bitcoin cash vs. bitcoin. Real people can't be faked which is great. 
Here's another data point (but its an online one so it can be manipulated to a degree [much more readily by BCH supporters though]): In the past 7 days BCH blocks are found 5.74 times per hr and average 107kb. BTC 6.23 and 1033. (source fork.lol) This means that over the past 7 days, days in which BCH went through an absolutely massive pump and dump with CRAZY volume, BCH has about 9.5% the transaction volume of BTC. It stands to reason that the user base is thusly approximately 9.5% of BTC. 
Currently, rBITCOIN has 426733 subs, 15312 users online (3.5%). rBTC has 87611 subs, 2928 users online (3.3%). rBTC subs to rBITCOIN subs shows that BCH has about 20.5% of the users rBITCOIN has and 19% active users online?? So BCH users use their coin exactly half as much as BTC users? That's weird given their supposed CASH vs GOLD argument....
Again, if I take the actual 9.5% verifiable (though it can be faked) transaction (user indicator) of 9.5% and double it? I get 19%... Thus, rBTC is exactly 50% shills on one of the few verifiable data points we have.
Now, I'd argue its actually more shills than that. Because transactions are so cheap on BCH there are going to be more of them per actual economic activity. Also, like I said, this was a MONSTER of a week for BCH.
Check out the user subscription growth of rBTC for some very interesting growth charts...

Man you have this so backwards...
Where's your technical argument for an onchain blocksize increase? You want low fees? Minipayments (onchain will never do micro)? Is that what you think gives Bitcoin value?
Seriously, where is your technical argument?
If bitcoin is just a low fee way to move money around the internet you are going to have a really bad time... It will never ever be as good as legacy methods for that. Never. TECHNICALLY speaking Bitcoin is the most inefficient database on the planet.
So bitcoin must be valued for other reasons.... Its decentralization has value. Its IMMUTABILITY IN THE FACE OF POLITICS AND MANIPULATION has value. 
By NOT changing, Bitcoin shows more strength than ANY change can ever show. If POLITICS can make changes, and S2X was a change, then Bitcoin has failed. 
There is no garden variety tribal bullshit in these words, there is just hard technical logic: Bitcoin is a currency protected from manipulation by governments or corporations. That is its value.
It is the hard, slow backbone on which we will build to change the world. And apparently we will have to drag people like you, people who are so easily politically manipulated, kicking and screaming. Welcome to crypto.

nm, just read your link... blocksonly isn't a full node and is irrelevant to a conversation regarding decentralization. decentralization involves a network of decentralized participants. if we had millions of people with read access to a database and one central server where we all submitted transactions that would not be decentralized.... at all

There's just the little issue of then getting users to use your implementation, and then convincing miners to mine it, and exchanges to support it (if it breaks current consensus)   and the market to buy it.. lose any one of those legs and you got an uphill battle.  S2x had everything but the users and the market.

Frogo has gone off the rails a bit here and I apologize for him... and I don't want to just attack you when you're already up against a crazed attack, but I sort of doubt the veracity of your claim that you've been running full nodes for years. Maybe you have, its certainly a possibility, but the only people I know who think a full node isn't resource intensive are people who have never run them.
They are certainly a nuisance to run, and many times, when HD netflix is lagging, or I'm trying to download something large, or worse upload a large file, I consider turning mine off. And I am about as first world as you can get...

Segwit makes transactions "smaller" and therefore cheaper. 
In reality it doesn't make transactions smaller, just reorganizes their data a bit, but they are definitely cheaper.

This only shows that most users are fine with the fees as is... If not, they would move their coins to segwit wallets and only use exchanges with segwit addresses. But they don't mind paying a small fee apparently... I disagree, I think fees are important and I changed to segwit immediately.

Me: but other things about bitcoin still good.
You: No all of bitcoin bad now.
Me: but just scaling is your problem?
You: No, never said that.
Me: so what are other problems.
You: Bitcoin isn't scaling.
Look, if you are saying that Bitcoin was hijacked? And that is your issue with it, then let me explain how hijacking will look and how it wont. A change is a hijack... A change to bitcoin can do bad things, because right now bitcoin (besides scaling) is good...
Staying the same? Not a hijack... Thats status quo. And a bitcoin that is status quo is a currency that is deflationary and free from goverment control.
Bitcoin is super hard to change ON PURPOSE. That is so important for anyone and everyone to realize.

I'm just reiterating what was said below but with segwit we just did a 1.7x the limit. You could argue we need more to relieve pressure but theres not even enough pressure to push people to adopt segwit right now.
Also, s2x isn't just a one time double. It's an attempt to replace core. They have admitted that time and time again. Not to sound like a core fanboy, but I'm going to be immediately wary of a group who gathered no user support, just CEO/miners, and didnt involve any current bitcoin core contributors.
s2x, is, by their own admittance and by their own design, a political move. 
There has been a longstanding method for improving bitcoin, this method was approved and used since the time of satoshi and ANYONE can do it. You propose a BIP. If the code is good, it gets adopted. Convince us with code, not with politics.
A lot of core contributors arent against an additional doubling of the blockchain. But I think its important we allow sometime for segwit to gain traction, and then its important we rollup a lot of other improvements into the hardfork. Good code takes time.

It's a shame you got torn up...

Sadly, that has not been a trait that's been office in a long time.  I would have gladly voted for Bernie. He's a man of honesty and integrity... if America could drop the bipartisanship and vote for good honest people I think we'd be a lot better off.

OK. What about the Amaury stuff that you conveniently skip everytime? He is the developer. He is kind of a piece of crap. Beyond that, it doesnt matter that 'they' arent developers. 'They' (Ver/Wright/Jihan) control bch far more than Amaury does. Again, if you don't believe that... for the change to the EDA Wright was called in as 1 of 3 people making that decision. 3 people! And boom, hard fork.
When people are put in control of something, an attack on that person is very applicable to that which is under there control. It is not at all ad-hominem to say "jee, bitcoin cash is controlled by some really shady people". The people in charge of bitcoin cash are the problem and were the discussion points from the beginning. Crying ad-hominem is a childish maneuver to sound smart online.
Your comments about nodes makes me wonder if you know what I was saying.. spinning up a million btc nodes would make it MORE centralized... As bitcoin cash did. They are PRIMARILY run on AWS because there is no real community support behind that coin. 
If you want to talk about bitcoin cash itself.... the eda was either A.) a horribly thought out change that smacks of incompetence, B.) a designed attack on bitcoin that allowed miners to maximize profits on both the bitcoin cash chain (high inflation) and bitcoin chain (high fees). Take your pick... Also, the only change they've made of any real significance, the increased blocksize, is completely irrelevant to their chain (they have no users and no transactions and no adoption). Their lack of segwit makes it less compatible for future improvements (which amaury would have copypasta'd over) and they have basically no developer support to code them.
Bitcoin cash is an altcoin with no innovation, no adoption, and scammy ass leaders.

You are so full of shit you don't even warrant a reply. Bitcoin is exactly where the majority of its users want it to be. Core is "in power" (actually they are merely 'leading the development') because, again, the majority of bitcoin users support core and they support the majority of bitcoin users. This is verifiable fact by anyone if you are willing to attend local meetups, talk to people throughout the crypto community in real life, etc. The fracture in this community is overblown by online propaganda.
Just because core isn't doing what you want, doesn't mean its a dictatorship. Get over yourself and come to grips with why bitcoin as layer 1 is so essentially important.

I don't know what studies your referencing but in terms of renting vs buying you have to take into account transaction costs (i.e. closing costs) on both ends (buying and selling, allowing for prices to increase etc) and then guess how long you're going to be in the property. 
Your example of an investor making more without paying off a mortgage is indicative of my point, hold onto your money and use it to invest. We were discussing buying a house outright vs buying with a loan. I said 'keep more money in your investments'. We weren't discussing buying vs renting, which if those were the choices you'd have to factor in the opportunity cost of a large down payment etc.
In your freelance example, again if you take my logic "let your money appreciate" and apply it to the situation we would again come to the conclusion not to purchase a house, but invest in a career and 'let your money or personal capital appreciate.'
I guess what I'm saying is, we are totally agreeing with each other, other than your 'not necessarily'.

It's a difficult social question.  many argue that a pure democracy would collapse after its populace learns to vote themselves wealth. 
Look at who the people are electing today? Do we elect officials who truly represent us and make decisions on our socioeconomic behalf? Or is the general populace cuckolded in to electing people who care only about themselves and their elite social allies. 
I'm not saying Nick is right. But if there was a bip that doubled everyone's current holdings and decreased the inflation schedule (simplified examples) would you trust the day traders or the new "bitcoin is an investment that doubles every month" crowd to make the right decision? 
Dealing with people sucks.  We are the worst.  When you get to work with code and hard sciences stepping into the realm of bitcoin, which is a sticky mess of code, economics, politics etc. Is frustrating and it would be far simpler to let the engineers decide. 
But you're right, simple isn't always better.  Having said that though, some things are just beyond the grasp of the public. And even though it sounds simple, Nick is arguing that the nuances of its effect are beyond the comprehension of most. I would argue that they just don't care.  Bitcoin is just an investment for so many people. All they care about is adoption so they can double their money and spend their lives with friends and family. Who can blame them?

Decentralized does not mean everyone gets to make their own decisions. There is no way you actually believe EVERYTHING should be up to the users. It is still, after all, a system. And systems have certain immutable properties by design. 
BU does not provide more control for ALL users equally, just MINERS and (too a much much lesser extent) node operators. It also very clearly, as has already been stated, introduces CENTRALIZING tendencies to a problem that has nothing to do with centralization... The problem is transaction space. Messing with the delicate balance of power that already exists JUST too increase transaction space is just completely unwarranted. There are better options, literally already coded and ready to go that help alleviate the problem of low transaction space.
If the problem was: miners have too little power, then BU might be necessary. But that is DECIDEDLY not the problem. If you are saying core has too much power, I'd say look at their inability to push through Segwit, or even kill the Asicboost! Both sides can't accomplish much of anything without us, we, the users, buying in with a strong majority (economic majority if we want to use that buzz word). This is part of the brilliance of bitcoin, not a bug, but a feature.
So again, why are you messing with the BALANCE OF POWER when what we want to focus on is TRANSACTION SPACE.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:21:02
This issue is really due to 2 things, 1.) it's early going and not many legitimately good businesses have entered the mining game. Bitmain was the first really well run organization with the distinct advantage of using ASICboost. More competition will eventually lead to ~at-cost miners being sold to the public which will reduce profits across the board. 2.) Mining profits are a result of increasing prices. If prices stayed flat miners would be turned on up until the point of the energy expenditures costing more than the revenue in.. Ever increasing prices means the whole industry is making more and chasing more, never reaching an equilibrium. As block rewards decrease and prices flatten, coupled with increased competition, mining will be less and less profitable (by design!). 
Bitcoin got two big too fast and we are seeing those growing pains on the main stage. It would have been nice to be relegated to the basement a bit longer.

This is, as with most alt coins, completely unnecessary. Instead of making a new token tied to bitcoin etc, make the POS like bitpay, btcpay or whatever and market it to restaurants. There is literally no advantage to putting another token in as intermediary. 
Instead of converting BTC to a fixed price token and paying you can convert to fixed price USD. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:19:44
I fully understand that. Hence RBF is a good feature to have. Unless you are under the misconception that blocksize should be entirely uncapped, then BCH's "advantage" is its under utilization. Any new crypto has that same 'feature' and is not at all specific to BCH. Again, as I just explained, the ability to run a full node is important, thus blockspace must be limited..
As a 3rd party dev you apparently are only worried about your customers 'right now'. Which is all well and good. But for bitcoin to fulfill its promise to the world it has to be successful in perpetuity.
Also, as of 'right now' 0 conf work identically on both chains as BTC's mempool is routinely emptied. No need for overcharging...

Running a full node isn't important until it is. It's not necessary for a user to run a full node on a network that is compliant with users. But if the network is behaving poorly, adopting new rules, it is imperative that users be able to choose which nodes to run and thus choose which rules the network abides by. So while it is normally unimportant, it is imperative to have the ability. The uasf was a perfect example of users threatening to fracture the network due to hostile miners. 
Bitcoin cash not caring about running full nodes is really really dumb. They give away all sovereignty that way.

You are incorrect. Bitcoin abc forked before core 0.15.0. 0.15.0 contained some pretty massive performance gains for initial sync. These are not included in Bitcoin abc. Please read the release notes for 0.15.0. again, bitcoin cash proponents do not see the benefit to full nodes so they do not care that they are using unimproved software in terms of initial sync. But please, start fresh and try to initial sync Bitcoin abc. Record the time to do so. Then initial sync Bitcoin core. Compare the times. They are not identical, virtually or otherwise.
Edit: adding some of the 0.15.0 release notes for you: "validating the blockchain during initial blockchain download and reindex is 30 to 40% faster, uses 10 to 20% less memory etc."
I know this because some of my outdated hardware would not sync prior to 0.15.0. for me.

Yes, and core is the scourge of bitcoin, coding improvement after improvement into bitcoin year after year all in an effort to kill it... And the only way to save it is to jump ship, throw off from those developers who continually write better and better code, who continually find bugs in other implementations, who continually push to make bitcoin everything everyone wants both decentralized and high capacity, and join Garzik! Garzik the great who has a company dedicated to deanonymizing BTC! Or Hearn, who buddied up with the R3 Banks and gave them insider information about his quitting before anyone else in the market! Or Jihan Wu who almost 99% proof positive has been gaming the mining world to the detriment of capacity but to the benefit of his wallet! Or Ver who told people to stay in MtGox and who pays for upvotes on his twitter! Or Craig Wright who literally claims to be Satoshi but refuses to prove it, a proof that literally would take 30 seconds of effort... somehow that evades him...
So ya, I think what I'll do instead of worrying about who is 'full of shit' I'll look at the actual code, see that Core is 100% not trying to screw over bitcoin (the code does not lie). I still don't see Ver's code, or Wright's code. I see Garziks is alright (a bit buggy) but also entirely unnecessary as its supporters have even said! From what I've seen of Wu's code I think I'll still clear, I prefer having a computer without giving Bitmain a kill switch...

I also believe that some transactions will be bigger with segwit cancelling it this "compression" benefit.

No, forcing people into sidechains won't centralize bitcoin more than increasing blocksize. I can understand the dontthrowbtc's frustration from that sentence alone.  1. You have absolutely no data behind it, it's your opinion you formed from reading social media, 2 it's not even a well thought out logical opinion to hold. Bitcoin is layer 1, centralizing layer 2 does not in anyway centralize layer 1, it just doesn't. You could argue the bitcoin ecosystem centralizes with sidechains but that's a completely different point (and to say it centralizes more than centralizing layer 1 is still an opinion statement with no data based off your gut feeling). I'm sorry if I'm being rude, I'm just explaining this as directly as I can. 
Furthermore, the problem with centralization is that it reduces security and bitcoins hardness against attack. If a layer 2 is centralized it is less robust,  but who cares,  bitcoin,  layer 1 is still decentralized and safe! That is hugely important. It's nor a question of: decentralize the whole bitcoin ecosystem because decentralization is good,  it's bitcoin must be decentralized so it cannot be attacked. Bitcoin is layer 1. Layer 1 must be decentralized. On top of a decentralized foundation you can change the world and noone can stop us. Centralize layer 1, game over.

Also, gold is produced at something between 1-2% per year over the last decade? So its not comparable to what we will see with bitcoin in ~30 years. Yen has been deflationary (so has the USD). A lot of currencies have... we are talking about the potential for a world currency that grinds to a complete and utter halt (basically). I find it curious though, that your first position was "deflation will destroy us" (i'm overgeneralizing, please don't get upset by this) only to start citing examples of deflation that has not destroyed us (though, you certainly can find articles pointing to deflation as the cause of economic downturn, for each one I could find some that will argue its a symptom).

I actually didn't even read this article.. Now, after review, it is an article saying that models that assume 'housing supply is fixed are wrong'!! I hope you don't try and use that against me, because, as we should both agree, my argument is that it is done and this article is nearly a meta article on all those times its been done.

You are correct though, attempting to refute a baseless accusation would also be pointless. 
There is no consensus for s2x. There never ever was. I never wanted it.  99%of the bitcoiners I know in real life never wanted it, clearly the market doesn't want it. Just because core isn't supporting your particular minority brand of bitcoin doesn't make them an all powerful oligarch... maybe, just maybe, your brand of bitcoin is failing on its own merit!

Well its difficult to argue with it being 'a different story' as I don't know what you are implying. 
To your next point, I never said 'they have no influence'. That is conflating the argument from what it was: "they do not control all of bitcoin. bitcoin is not at risk of a 51% dev attack. it is not dangerous af".
Here: 
This is a nice review from someone who has done their HW. Sure, bitcoin core devs have influence over the code (are you suggesting devs should be powerless???), but blockstream employees are not some dominant immovable force. That's a forced narrative that doesn't hold up.
I'd like to repeat this: By any metric available, or any independent unbiased study ever done, Bitcoin is THE most decentralized currency in the world (probably in the history of the world but someone who knows more than me might argue that seashells were pretty decentralized).
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:47:44
That makes no sense and isn't even true (blockstream isn't even close to 51% of the devs). You want devs to be able to agree to code btw. If the core devs never got 51% that would be bad...
Besides that, by literally any metric Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized coin in existence. Check the GitHub stats, do your HW, then try and argue. You won't be successful.

Having said that, its scary to think bitcoin can be changed by agreements made by corporations without user input. It sets a really bad precedent.

@_date: 2017-10-06 12:24:58
I wasn't aware someone did know all the users... We should definitely get their opinion!
Of course my knowledge is based on the people that I know.. This is true for everyone, yourself included, and the two people who I was responding to. How can anyone claim to know its just a zealous group leading s2x or dismissing s2x? (notice the poster above me used definite phrasing "it is" whereas I used suggestive phrasing "maybe").
I think my point is still quite valid though, many users are (and should) also be concerned with how well it works in the future, not just right now.
My second point is also valuable: if users only care about it working right now, then clearly they wouldn't be in support of s2x as it offers no benefits right now. (blocks are not full, segwit adoption is still low)
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:24:07
No blockstream really hasn't shown any interest in controlling Bitcoin. That is absurd propaganda spouted by people who were trying to control Bitcoin and change it, verified by the fact that they eventually hard forked and now run an aggressive advertising campaign trying to convince people that their version of Bitcoin is the one true coin.
Here's the best part though... Because Bitcoin is the way it is, we have two competing implementations, multiple alternative coins, hundreds of devs etc. If you really think blockstream is killing Bitcoin you should be happy there are literally hundreds of other coins that are basically cut and paste bitcoins with a couple changes like litecoin, Bitcoin cash, etc.
If you are like me and worry about decentralization, it's very reassuring that Bitcoin core is moving forward the way they are... They are the only Dev team taking the hard path. It would be easy to scale up the chain to appease people and potentially weaken the system. They've chosen a much more difficult and conservative path.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:56:29
They decided not to based on public backlash? Sure, they decided not to because they became aware that the public would not value their block reward if they attempted to fork. That's really the crux of bitcoin.. that's the whole trick that keeps users in charge.
All evidence (futures) pointed to a similar split like bitcoin cash currently has. In fact, I think you could make a strong argument that S2x people now mostly support BCH. So we have exactly what we have and most people prefer BTC.
If we start calling exchanges users (they are) we lose a lot of power in our language. Because miners are also users, devs are users, etc etc. So I think we should keep exchanges as exchanges, miners as miners, users as pure users, and devs as devs... So to be clear, segwit was activated by [edit: this should not say "activated by" but rather "forced by"] the UASF, led by the users. Exchanges, where large power is centralized in single points of control, did not activate segwit and were dragged along by the users (the profit motive at work at the protocol level). However, the users have no direct control over the exchanges adopting segwit (because segwit adoption is not a protocol change, and is not subject to the same profit motive), and therefore cannot force them to adopt segwit despite it being part of the protocol.
To summarize: UASF forced protocol change because bitcoin is only valuable if users use it. UASF can't force adoption because bitcoin is valuable whether its in a segwit wallet or a legacy wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:36:55
It's a fallacy though to suggest that only the rich have access to education and own housing without the use of loans. There are some great articles (they escape me now) about housing prices and how inflated they are due to the fact that loans are given at such low percentages. Imagine there were no loans given for homes, housing costs would drop dramatically as noone would have access to those funds. You can assume (for arguments sake) they are a fixed supply and people want to move/upgrade so we'd still see the same amount of occupancy/home ownership/sales etc. just none of the debt implied (we'd still have our relative wealth comparatively etc.). I'm not explaining this fully but explore the concept in your head: easy access to loans/money causes price inflation for necessary goods (education/houses).
To go back up to your post "deflation doesn't..." I agree with your analyses. But remember, bitcoin will not exist in a vaccum. The USD isn't going anywhere. Having an internationally accepted deflationary currency amongst a see of national inflationary currencies is going to be a very exciting experiment. Noone knows what will happen. :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:37:15

I don't believe it makes bitcoin unusable for most. Currently, we aren't even using our full capacity. People are choosing to pay high fees rather than adopting segwit. 
I don't know of any current bitcoin users that are using BTC for everyday transactions that don't have enough to put aside a few months BTC. Most people make BTC transactions a few times a week, and not for major expenses like rent, but for online purchases of games etc. Locking up a small amount for a few months is trivial in those cases.
We are not even close to the adoption of lower classes who are living paycheck to paycheck using BTC to pay for utilities and rent. The small subset that manages to do this (this subset doesn't exist) will have to be the most vocal advocates for adoption of segwit and other scaling options in the meantime. 
Net effect on BTC by waiting for LN: negligible. Adopt segwit, develop MAST, SCHNORR, LN. Then hard fork a larger limit if necessary based on adoption.

I'm pro segwit and a small blocker but that's a pretty unfair comparison. Segwit doesn't make the transactions any smaller.. it just cleverly increased blocksize with a soft fork while charging people more fairly for transactions, by weight not size, and opened the doors for easier coding of things like ln, schnorr. So it's great tech, but didn't compress anything.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:13:38
 You must not get out much... go to a local meetup and see whay actual bitcoin people think, not internet shills. Local meetups, you know, the group's that have been drafting anti s2x packs and posting them here.

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:42:17
I'd also like to see more innovations, like schnorr, LN etc. I guess what we truly disagree on is what innovations we want... I prefer innovations that maintain the security and fundamentals of the base level above all else. Also, I don't want bitcoin to 'respond fast' to users.. In a perfect world, where users are educated and rational, sure that'd be great. But in the real world a bitcoin that changes easily is an insecure bitcoin. Immutability is a valuable and fundamental aspect of BTC.

It is a fledgling technology... It's volatility will reduce, and has, as the years roll by.

As someone who has bought a 20,000 Dollar (2 btc back when btc was 500) snow blower with Bitcoin a few years ago, I regret nothing. That's what it was worth then. I also refill my hot wallet on dips and it normally turns out for the best or as a wash.

That will never happen by design. Core is a specific open source implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, not a lightning client. 
I could make a lightning client and call it core? Or do you want some core devs (they are a group of people that are only tied to each other by that github repo) to start a second project? If so, why? 
Despite all propaganda, Bitcoin is a burgeoning sphere of decentralized development. Core is nothing more than a GitHub repo with very good, well trusted, developers working on it.

You started with the past year, then selected the past 6 months to make your point. Maybe you missed the forest for the 6 months of trees on that...
If you used/owned bitcoin for the past year your money would have tripled. Using an inflationary currency with "no hidden fees" cost you 2x whatever USD you used..
That's not imagination, that's an inflationary currency. Now if you want to argue an inflationary currency is necessary for a modern economy, that's a fine discussion to have, but believe me, noone actually knows if that's true. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:46:36
I agree with most everything you said... I was just pointing out that money is a medium for acquiring all those things so its a bit strange to not equate the two concepts. A lot of powerful people become powerful by investing (using money) to acquire shares in successful companies. 
I don't buy into the whole 'a deflationary currency will kill our economy' mantra though. It really hasn't ever been shown in history to be true (the reverse has though! inflationary currencies have destroyed economies!), though i understand the speculation/theory behind it. I've posted here before about this, and how it really remains to be seen what a major deflationary currency could do to the world. I have a hard time believing people will simply hold it because it grows... Most people like to do things, like to run companies and take risks, and buy goods etc. I don't see "money for the sake of money" as an inherent quality of people. I think most people want money for either prestige or freedom (obvious simplification but these are the two primary categories I can think of).
Again, I'm not really disagreeing with you at all. A system based on hodling would not work, but I don't think such a system will ever truly exist.

Nullc is an awesome guy in my book.  About 4 years ago I came into this realm and thought I knew stuff and argued with him on irc on the benefits of pos vs pow. I didn't even know who I was talking with, but he was obviously making some really good points (points I'm sure he was forced to make a thousand times to a thousand other newbs like me). He probably doesn't remember that convo, but I've since had a few more interactions with him, and a great deal of my belief in him,  and in bitcoin, comes from the way he handled himself in dealing with another pos supporter.

The miners were forced by the uasf.. miners wanted 2x, as you said. If the rhetoric was correct, that miners controlled protocol changes, we'd have 2x. The users still rule.
And segwit adoption is hindered by the fact that biggest use case for Bitcoin is still speculation and some very large exchanges have not supported segwit. I think most users would use segwit if given the choice..
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:02:06
Hands down the easiest way to attack bitcoin is to convince people to side with a more readily controllable fork. This should be obvious. Everyone has the right to fork, and everyone has the right to defend against bad forks. I would argue we have a strong moral obligation to defend bitcoin against the likes of bitmain, garzik, ver, and Craig Wright...
If you don't want to call it an attack you don't have to. I don't prefer to myself. But I will argue against the ideas of those mentioned above. I'd also like to point out that the supporters of bch, ver, 2x, et al consistently claim bitcoin is being attacked by core...
So everyone is a hypocrite... Or we can just ignore words, and focus on the issues and the code, and the long history of core doing the right thing time and time again.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:58:41
I go back and forth with this in my head a lot... the whole Machiavellian question of how far we should go to protect BTC.
This whole debate, with the shilling/trolling/propaganda etc. has been, though harrowing, a fascinating and eye opening experience.

I'm not going to continue this, but I'd implore you to further research it. To say we don't need to imagine a world without mortgages because we have it is very incorrect (you keep trying to compare to the third world), and I hope you can at least admit that to yourself. There is no comparison to the third world. Wages are VASTLY different, economies are VASTLY different. There is no fruitful analogies to be drawn as there are far too many confounders. Furthermore, your claim that its silly to have an argument that begins with the assumption of fixed supply of houses  shows a bit of inexperience in economics as this presumption forms the basis of many scholarly articles (google assuming house supply is fixed, or fixed home supply etc.) It's not a perfect assumption by any means, obviously, but its an assumption that has been made thousands of times in academia, and its fine for elucidating some basic points in discussion

I've locked my money in a bank so its easier to pay with, its my checking account. No way do I want to carry around that much money...
For me, since I don't live paycheck to paycheck and can afford and do have a checking account witha  few months expenses in it, I can very easily use the lightning network. Its going to be faster and cheaper than on chain scaling, thats a certainty, so its not exactly worsening ourselves.
Personally, its identical to what I do know any ways. Cold storage the majority of my holdings, maintain a hot wallet balance for daily transactions. The only change for me will be lower fees..

There were 2x futures:  They traded around .1 to .2 BTC if memory serves me.
In reality we use language to dissect the world into bins to allow us to communicate. Minerals are stones and stones are rocks but those terms are still important in reality. 
Truth is truth, but I never argued that.
At this next point you are correct and I used the wrong word (i actually used the correct words "forced miners" most of the time and only said users 'activated' segwit once). I shouldn't have said the UASF activated segwit, rather it forced miners to conceed they did not have the users on board (profit motive) and then they activated via MASF. That's correct.
Your final point... saying user adoption is not relevant? You literally said segwit adoption at the beginning of the debate. I didn't bring it up, you did. The topic you are now introducing, MASF vs UASF is far more irrelevant to our debate.. Though I can see why you are more interested in it, as I concede I used the wrong verbiage...

Sure. But for a moment, assume you believe in bitcoins success. Eventually, with enough time and use/ acceptance it's value would stabilize.. that much should be an easy to accept reality. Then, combine it's price stability with an ever decreasing inflation schedule...
That's probably why you find yourself arguing with people on this subreddit. Because a lot of us believe in bitcoins success, and if it does succeed, it will be a far better currency than the USD for reasons you yourself stated. USDs inflationary schedule is unknown and somewhat unpredictable. It's value would vary far greater than a currency designed like bitcoin if not for it's massive value and acceptance...

User nodes literally comprised, by definition, the uasf attempt/bluff so I'm not sure how that is a common misconception.. uasf was not about consensus but is primarily a user bluffing mechanism meant to actualize the profit threat to miners. To simplify, miners only care about money, they are controlled by increasing or decreasing the value of their block rewards. This is why bitcoin cash only has approximately 10% hash despite it being EXACTLY what the majority of miners wanted all along. Users assign value.
The uasf is the users only way to push the profit decision dramatically back on the miners. "Do as we say or the network will be fractured". Miners then choose to risk loss of value (if they think the movement insignificant perhaps) or adopt user demands (if they think the movement is genuine and worry other miners will steal their profits by adopting).

I've seen this argument thrown around and haven't really questioned it all that much, but can you explain the use case whereby people want to spend money without locking it up? (not arguing just curious)
The way i see it, I have money locked up in a bank right now, and then I get to spend it with no fees with my debit card. To get access to my actual cash, to unlock it, I do have to pay a small fee at an ATM (but thats not my point just an ironic note). I'm not particularly wealthy, but I store funds in the bank... 
The only time locking funds up would be a nuisance are for unexpected and large financial burdens? In which case a 5$ bitcoin fee isn't stopping any use case either...
People living paycheck to paycheck wouldn't have the ability to use bitcoin because they never have the ability to lock it up to use LN... But those same people couldn't use bitcoin currently because of the onramping fee (initial BTC purchase). 
I'm honestly just curious and thinking through this argument. What's your use-case scenario whereby having to pay a fee to put funds into a checking account (LN) for then basically free and instant transactions is a problem?

Because I accept it for goods and others do as well, it is by definition, a currency. That's all money is at the fundamental level, a unit of trade or barter.

Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized and secure blockchain. It has more developers, a larger ecosystem, and higher adoption than any other coin. Why would any other coin have more value than bitcoin? None of them offer any actual advantages over bitcoin. Besides anonymity, which Bitcoin will eventually have, there are no useful functions available in any alt that is not possible in btc. Alt coins are important to have as backups and test cases and to just keep the whole ecosystem decentralized, but Bitcoin is the most important coin by far.

@_date: 2018-04-06 11:49:29
You are correct, it has a lot of great properties similar to gold and silver. However, unlike gold and silver it's easily transmittable across the globe. 
Gold and silver would be terrifically sound money, but they would restrict economic activity.
In a world full of fiat currency, sound money is an investment. It can be, and is, both.
Price doesn't matter, only inasmuch as a lower price restricts the total amount of economic activity which the system can hold and transmit. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:58:19
Just to piggyback on this and explain the feel more.. You'll essentially have one wallet app with 2 accounts, named either hot and cold or checking and savings.

Payments from your checking account will be basically instant..

some of the points he agrees with, like the sound money tweet, is just completely wrong. sound money, by anyone with an economic backgrounds definition, has to do with stability and normally infers a strong backing like gold etc. I think his agreement with roger is very telling here: while vitalik can see through the BS of CSW's technobabble, he is drawn in by ver's emotional ramblings.

I don't have any sources for you, but I see an OB Dev on rBTC all the time supporting their discussions and beliefs that bch is superior. 
I think it's pretty safe to say they are staunchly Bitcoin cash supporters. Their business model is a lot easier and simpler with Bitcoin cash. Bitcoins current stance is really hard on current companies. Basically it's wait, this will workout in the end and we'll be the better for it. Companies are a lot more worried about here and now, not bringing about an economic revolution for humanity.
That's why I'm happy we have a bunch of alts like bitcoin cash etc. Gives a lot of options so ideas can grow and offloads some economic activity so we can work on improving Bitcoin the right way, the hard way.
They really need to stop selling their alt as bitcoin though...
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:02:10
Well itd start with sound money, a base that can't be inflated. Inflation has certainly not proven itself necessary for an economy, let alone an economy of equal wealth distribution, which you again believe it is important for... 
I believe in a lower tax burden on the poor with aggressive rates for those with higher incomes. I think the stock market is a crock of shit compared to angel investors and would be very open to any policies encouraging direct investment versus the crap that brokerage houses offer to the lowest common denominator. 
I think the financial easings of 2008 onward were a direct theft of the American people. Someone should be in jail. Too big to fail? Instead of a direct bailout to the banks we could have used that cash to help the delinquent loans that were causing the bankruptcy.. instead people lost their homes to the banks, and the banks were awarded cash that in essence honored those loans without the people benefiting at all.
I believe in stricter policies against government procurement abuses. Any company that goes after government money should have a strict 20 to 1 salary ratio between the highest and lowest earners. I believe in tax deductions for companies that also honor similarly salary structures.
In essence, less interference by the government in small time earners and smaller companies, heavier interference in larger earners, larger companies. There is no substantiated economic evidence that larger companies have any distinct advantage over smaller companies in terms of producing innovation or economic wealth for the nation. In fact, as we have discovered, large corporations and wealthy individuals continue to get wealthier, grow larger bank accounts for the 1 %, which does not trickle down despite the "inflation" caused by our monetary policy.

Thanks for the posts nullc, I always appreciate your perspective. You are against bip148 primarily because it is hasty and goes against your very principled stand against dangerous chain splits, correct me if I'm wrong. My question is, though, at what point would you bypass your principles for the greater good (kill one person to save many etc). If bitcoin is replaced by ethereum for real world payments the world loses a great thing, decentralized money. Make no mistake about it, the only coins to be put in a position for success besides bitcoin will be coins with strong centralized leadership (because they can adapt, because they will have people fighting for its inclusion, because they can walk into a meeting and say "yes we can do that.")
I'm not really advocating for bip148, you are probably right, this won't kill bitcoin, we will probably reach some compromise, but I'd caution you against standing by your principles at all cost. It may seem admirable, but choosing your principles over the welfare of humanity is not something to be proud of.. it's selfish.  The best men in history are principled, but are not bound by them, they balance and weigh and tear little parts of themselves apart for the sakey of others.  
Again, I mean nothing by this, except to say, keep your mind open. There comes a time when your principles will be used against you.

@_date: 2017-05-30 15:00:42
I appreciate your effort at remaining unbiased, but what technical arguments does the on-chain scaling side have? Don't take this the wrong way but you believe you have a great understanding of both sides, therefore you should be able to argue both quite well. If so, please argue for the technical/economic reasons why on chain scaling is superior to Segwit... I'm honestly curious as to why a technically competent person opposes Segwit independent of political posturing.
You're arguing for a false equivalency... We've got 20 people on a lifeboat that is filled to the brim (one more person probably won't sink the whole thing, but NOONE KNOWS FOR SURE if 2 or 3 or 10 more will, but once it starts taking on water IT WILL SINK), and there are still passengers drowning in the water asking to get on. One person suggests we hand the people in the water our life-jackets because we don't need them anyways in the boat, and remove a few extraneous supplies to make additional room. Another suggests we double the amount of passengers in the boat and see what happens. 
An argument follows... It goes back and forth for quite sometime and gets quite heated between the two people, meanwhile the passengers outside the lifeboat are still drowning. Every reasonable person on the boat starts taking their lifejackets off to hand to the drowning passengers (signals segwit, which reached 80+%??) but the person who wants to take every one on board immediately demands they leave their lifejackets in place, "if we give them lifejackets now we'll never let them on the boat!" The first person then says, "thats not true, we should give them lifejackets now, see how that solution works, and then begin testing the maximum capacity of the boat..."
In what world do we have to equate these two arguments as being equally valid. Segwit is not incompatible with large blocks. We can take a step forward and have a look around... If it doesn't solve anything then obviously the on-scale solutions will gain even more acceptance having tried other solutions beforehand...

I would, without hesitation, get behind a 1.05 MB hardfork IF that hardfork fixed other issues and took place after other TESTED and READY solutions were tried. Pass segwit, and everyone will be much more agreeable to potentially raising the blocksize. (It would be odd though to go up by so little at a time, considering it requires a hard fork to do so which isn't exactly the best and safest of things. That is to say, I'd probably be more apt to go to a 2mb blocksize increase than a 1.05 MB increase...)

This is only opinion but in my interactions with the other subreddit it honestly feels like 75% of the comments are shills. Any time I engage them they respond in extremely similar ways. I don't honestly believe they represent even close to half the community.  On the other hand, big blockers do represent over half the miners and some big businesses.  Those people, sadly, tend to think only about getting rich, and not about the socio-economic freedom that a decentralized bitcoin represents. The get rich quick people need to realize that that way is a dead end... it's a fast upgrade right now, but it destroys bitcoins value proposition in the long run. We all get Moe money and freedom ensuring bitcoin is truly decentralized. It's priority number 1

This thread is an interesting statistical problem. You could assume the price would be either up or down from where it is today, assign normal probability distribution with some standard deviation measured on a recent (1 month?) timeframe. Then you'd have to look at all the respondents, something like 1770-1775 corners the market so to speak, making a 1770-1780 bid really only a range of 5 but with a stated range of 10 it would also lose to a 1776-1784. Put that all together use some expected values for splits etc and you could probably increase your winning percentage by a lot...

To clarify it is highly likely because miners would be orphaned if they do not mine the segwit chain. There is a possibility that somehow &gt;50% back out and do not mine on the segwit chain in which case they could orphan those who are on bip141. This wouldn't make much sense unless you really want to destroy your block rewards value.

I was thinking about this while on the toilet earlier... Why is Roger Ver going to throw away money... It doesnt make any sense, especially when he seems quite keen on making money by pumping Dash/Eth etc. I think maybe he is smarter than we think. He spams the network, with a discount according to his hashpower % he gets that back, this has a multitude of effects but particularly it: Drives up his altcoins, gets users on board with a new bitcoin. He spurns enough interest in the new bitcoin and then he tells people he is going to support it, but instead dumps his newly created (PREMINE) BCC for REAL BTC... Basically, some new type of premine pump and dump.. Admittedly I haven't thought about this too deeply.. Just a passing thought I had earlier.

Reading your responses below you don't know how bip148 works... My node is going to run just fine, and will not split so long as miners run bip91 over 80% in this period or the next few. 
Right now it's very close to happening... you lost your bet because you didn't understand the consensus rules of each bip/implementation.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:26:50
Again, if you think I'm redefining points you don't understand bip148 or bip91 or a combination of both.  You originally said uasf would never activate... it is on schedule to activate aug 1 as bip91 locks in seemingly today. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:57:18
I'm quite certain we have a lot of things in common. But there are some very real differences as well. We can still be opposed and have similarities...
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:21:01
Please explain how bip148 isn't going to be a viable active non split node by aug1 if miners continue signaling for bip91.

So you take offence to the word all... I'm sorry I used it, of course I meant we should look at MOST of the options and MOST of the possibilities. Not ALL of them. My mistake. You trolling coward.
"So that's that, look at stuff and discuss?" Yup, thats exactly fucking that. And guess what we should test first... SOFT forks, small, subtle changes... This isn't rocket science. And Segwit is absolutely a blocksize increase.

That's what we're trying to do... But just because he described it as such, doesn't mean he had all the code to do as such. He certainly didn't, or else he wouldn't have made any changes. Changes are necessary in order to become P2P electronic cash. But changes that throwaway decentralization are, again, WORTHLESS.

In my opinion price will increase if the agreement is broken. The wealthiest bitcoiners that i personally know are all for 1mb for at least an additional year to test segwit and other scaling features. This is anecdotal, obviously, but every response to this question is conjecture. 
It does seem however that at best the 2mb hf still lacks even 50% support:

HMM, maybe SMART developers take the time to beta test their code. Maybe less experienced ones put out builds that wholesale crash and would have jeopardized a 40 billion dollar industry. Are you still able to ignore the obvious?

Well its definitely a twist of the conversation to claim I think Linux is utter shit, for a lot of reasons, 1 being I said bad developers not utter shit ones (I mean if you think so, fine), 2 being the distribution of operating systems is not at all analogous to the distribution of bitcoin implementations. I think Justin Bieber is utter shit (not really) but he sold a lot more records than Sigur Ros... You can't just make silly comparisons and trumpet that as a valid point.
Beyond that my post was definitely tongue in cheek. He (or is it your other account) made this claim that I had an unbelievable metric with which to determine a good dev from a bad one. He came up with this line of crap, and I went along with his stupidity. In reality, I said there are people putting out good code (STABLE) and bad code (NOT AT ALL STABLE). 
There's a difference. If linux wasn't stable, itd be "utter shit."
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:57:00
Please correct me if any of my assumptions are incorrect..
This was done as percentage chance for the next 336 blocks ~2.33 days. Any activation prior to aug 1 avoids a split, so we have 5 more chances to reach the threshold?  If percentages hold 80% hash activates before aug 1 1-.5^5 = 97%?
So at 75% hash it's actually 50 50 to activate before aug 1?
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:42:36
You didn't provide a technical argument for on-scale chaining at all. All you did was quote satoshi saying it was possible. We know its possible, noone is saying its impossible, but people are providing very compelling technical arguments as to why it will increase centralization to very scary levels... Again, you are going out of your way to be unbiased, but actually appear to be very biased towards on chain scaling, because they are not equivalent proposals. On chain scaling CAN fundamentally interfere with Segwit as it CAN lead to centralization that CAN hurt bitcoin. Segwit does not have any of these issues. To compare them equally is already a bias. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:30:45
Ethereum classic maybe. Regular Ethereum reversed transactions based on the fact that its governance model is basically "whatever vitalik says"... 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:45:05
Yes there are core developers. Can they act like a group and have the words one says held against the others?  No. Can they individually help save the people who continually shit on them? Yes.
It's simple, honestly... they are a group of individuals. When you say "thanks core" you are rightfully extending your gratitude to all those who have made pr's, commits, etc. When you say core is a conspiracy of Blockstream, you look like either a shill, or a newb who's been tricked by shills.

Maybe I'm reading your poll wrong but j don't see that. And no, a majority of users don't want a hard fork block size increase, a majority of users want cheaper transactions.  Look at this kyc poll which use obviously far better as it's Sybil resistant: 
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:11:43
No, you need to have technical knowledge to determine this. Bitcoin is not magic, it can't be everything all at once. There is a balance between centralization and throughput, a really delicate balance that you need some technical expertise to understand. A centralized Bitcoin is worthless. We know that a decentralized one with 1MB blocks is worth about 40 billion. We all want to get there, but without looking very closely, with technical expertise, at all the options and possibilities we put the entire project at risk. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:52:20
I don't think there's any indication of panic... uasf was actually scary because it held economic weight... Bcc is meaningless
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:41:24
It's about trending, there won't be some sudden problem but if bitcoin is trending towards centralization then bitcoin is trending towards its demise (or at the very least to an easily attackable  state). Imagine a decentralized bitcoin that anyone could run on their phone. It would be unstoppable. Imagine a bitcoin that could only be run on $100k machines, it would be very fragile... somewhere in between is a sweet spot balancing throughput and size, nobody knows where that balanced point is though. What ere do know is at 1mb things are ok, node count is a bit low. Fees are very reasonable right now... segwit is going to at minimum double the block size. Smart, safe practices say to do that and then evaluate. Not do that and already have a 2x planned.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:56:59
It's 2x not 2mb. Segwit 2x is 8mb

I'm not going to argue with you as I do agree with your general intention,  however the people who blindly say no regulation is needed are just as naive as though who think all regulation is designed to right a wrong. A great deal of regulation, specifically financial regulation, is actually designed to prevent competition and increase monopolistic powers. As with every issue, there's a lot more nuance than crypto anarchists, and you, are implying.

In good times alt coins do great because new people getting in like to ride the rush. In bad times though, those alt coins will see huge losses, losses that outweigh their gains. It has happened before, it will happen again, because most alt coins have no value besides speculation. People are very hard on alt coins here, too hard as a handful have earnest developers and provide some good proving grounds for new tech, but people can lose everything on alts... pretty much weekly. It's gambling

Not really, especially seeing as ASICboost has broken then incentive rules... But even beyond that, small scale mining operations that mine at a 'break-even' level for principle are what keeps me believing in Bitcoin. The system was originally designed so that greed would be sufficient, but sadly, I don't think this is the actual case. Capitalism and greed tends towards monopolization (maybe without any government market obstruction it wouldn't but with various regulations/restrictions/patents [ASICboost] someone will always garner an advantage). I think for Bitcoin to succeed we can't complacently think the system is perfectly designed. I hate to rely on people not being complacent, but I have faith that this is a sufficiently important advancement (decentralized money), and a sufficiently small barrier to to participate, that we will overcome.

It's ludicrous how this rhetoric is working. Literally ALL the evidence points to WU and VER using paid shills and buying likes etc. but somehow someway these trolls do their job... People just reading through this, who haven't been here since the beginning (at least of the scaling debate) can't tell who are the trolls and who aren't. Repeat a lie enough and then it looks like both sides are astroturfing... Repeat the propaganda enough and people actually believe the blockstream conspiracy crap. It's a bit unsettling to be honest. For clarification, if anyone reads this and can't see through all the bullshit spewed back and forth: Every single bitcoin user I see at conferences etc, every single user that I know is real due to longevity in posting, chatting on IRC, all of them support UASF, Maxwell, small blocks etc. While a good deal of them were not technically competent enough to understand why a 4x increase is bad, they do know who to trust. And that for sure is not Jihan Wu and Roger Ver.

Holy crap. You were wrong, get over it. 77% of ICOs fund themselves? Doubt it, pulling random stats doesn't mean anything. Its GOOD advice to not invest your LIFE SAVINGS into a new venture.........

Whats the point of your post? You seem to have some sort of gripe that he's pointing out the obvious. You are pointing out the obvious that he is pointing out the obvious. This is obvious to anyone to whom the former is also obvious. This is like some sort of recursive nightmare, but honestly, you wrote a massive post to whine that "OP isn't wrong in anyway, but is stating the obvious." But what's obvious to you, might not be obvious to the 17 year old kid from Venezuela who was told to buy bitcoin to avoid inflation and then gets immediately hammered by this loss of value.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:37:43
I appreciate that you are probably a real person :). 
1.) It's possible I'm suffering from grouping myself with 'like minded people' but it would truly blow my mind to find a group out there, of active bitcoin users/business owners/coders, who would genuinely argue for trying larger blocks BEFORE segwit etc.
2.) Comparing a 4x increase to segwit from a  technical standpoint is really absurd. 99% of segwit critiques, from what I've seen, are propaganda. You have to go back ~1.5 years on the dev forums to see any technically based arguments.
The truth to the big block (adoption-first) side is this, "if we don't increase capacity we may miss out on users and MAYBE if we miss the wave we might just be stuck with a decentralized system that noone uses. (some other system thats not decentralized would have to catch it)". I think where the middle ground should be is: try segwit, than reconvene. Calling for a hard fork before we've even tried a major upgrade is completely unnecessary. The actual 'centralization first' desire should be, and this is true, smaller blocks now, segwit, and devoting resources to LN, schnorr, drivetrains etc. We should be very concerned that 1MB is already high....

You again provided no argument for on chain scaling. Where is the argument for it saying it has technical merit? You cannot scale on chain to 1.7x with no cost to decentralization, whereas you can with segwit. Again, saying "it can be done here are some numbers showing 'it can be done'" is not at all a technical argument comparing it to Segwit. Its not an argument for it at all, its just saying, we can make the files bigger...
Again, maybe 2x, or 3x wont affect decentralization, maybe 10x wont (they all probably will), but surely you have to understand that if it took 1 byte oh HD and 1 byte up/down of bandwidth everyone would have it, and if it takes 10TB HD and  10TB up/down noone would... So in there is a balance....
You have shown, which was my intent, that you are indeed biased "enough is enough". You are clearly in favor of onchain scaling right NOW. That's fine, but thats your bias. You shouldn't bring that bias into a technical argument, and you shouldn't pretend to be unbiased in your original discussion.
