This podcast names the criminal bankers behind the collapse of the Irish economy and features leaked sound clips of them laughing about tricking the government into a small initial bailout that would lead to the 400 billion euro blanket guarantee that ruined the economy and many lives.
This episode was advised by [Jonathan Sugarman]( a whistleblower who was blacklisted for calling out the fraud before the crash and has been campaigning against corruption ever since. 
These bankers abandoned lending practices, created a credit bubble, borrowed billions to gamble on the international derivatives market, and conned taxpayers into paying the bill, and they thought it was hilarious. 
This kind of bullshit is why we need Bitcoin.

Hey, come on now! This project is headed up by Brock Pierce *and* Reeve Collins of Tether, so... you know... it's in good hands.

Bitcoin Chairman Brock Pierce lives in Puerto Rico with about 100 other millionaires and billionaires, including Reeve Collins of Tether. They're aiming to buy 250,000 acres to set up a blockchain city from scratch. Land is going cheap after many storm victims have been displaced, and with no capital or federal gains taxes, Puerto Rico is an attractive location for all that wealth.
However, there's [a lot more to this story]( that simply isn't being reported on. Brock Pierce fled the US while being sued for running a child sex ring in 2001, a case which he lost. He was arrested by Interpol in Spain in a house full of child porn with a man who is now a convicted sex offender. Whether Puertopia is a good idea or not, the leadership cannot be ignored. 
We explore this in detail in the podcast, but if pocasts aren't your thing, check out the documentary [An Open Secret]( for more information.
