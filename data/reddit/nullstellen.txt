Do you see any major airlines flying around in Wright Brothers planes?  Bitcoin is like the initial Wright Brothers plane, it is the first successful proof of concept of the Block chain technology.

It's a currency, not a religion.

You seriously so god damn retarded that I don't know how you function.  You make it sound like stocks and mutual funds are investing tools solely used by the rich and powerful.  Literally everyone has the power to put their money into assets that will average 7% annual growth.

Pardon me, I left out the qualifier *long-term.*  The dollar/bitcoin you hold is meant to store value long enough for you to get rid of it to buy a product, service or an asset.  You aren't supposed to hoard a currency, you're supposed to spend it.

You may have seen his youtube advetisements where he talks about the [seven book shelves he had installed in his garage to hold 2000 books](

Are you guys seriously trying to compare a steady and predictable (sans the great depression) decrease over one hundred years to a decrease over 2 months?  I knew you guys were retarded but god damn.

A dollar is a currency, **a dollar is not meant to be a store of value.**
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, **bitcoin is not meant to be a store of value.**

People need to realize that Bitcoin was designed as an experimental proof of concept.  It is the first digital currency that solves the problem of duplication.  It is mind-boggling that so many people are ready to jump in at the first iteration of an idea before giving it the time to evolve to a state where it can meet all the realistic needs of a currency.
It's like everyone is flying around in Wright Brothers-esque planes just because that was the first successful model.
Being against Bitcoin does not mean being against the concept of a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Now you can conveniently swerve into oncoming traffic.
