The Devil and God are Raging Inside of Me 
Diasy  it at first but it became my  after 2 or 3 listens in college....
Deja Entadu  was good but damn they got darker and I became a sick fuck.....
Science Fiction  to a tie with Deja Entadu, Darker yes, but overall not the same..  Better In a different way yes maybe. I love the album but I guess I just have too much history with the others back when I was a young lad, now an old lady of 31.....
