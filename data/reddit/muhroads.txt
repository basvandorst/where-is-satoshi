Giving you half a dozen counter-examples (which you've mostly blown off) is not shifting the goal posts.


Murder requires malice aforethought, manslaughter requires a victim, and negligence requires damage or injury to another.
None of those are prosecuted based on risk assessments.

No, you're trying to get people to disregard rational thinking. That's a FAIL. 
It's *rational* to believe that Satoshi is a guy on the basis that most cryptographer-programmer-economists are male. What you seem to be suggesting is that because we don't know 100% that we should disregard what we know about these people and that, quite frankly, is ridiculous.
If all cryptographer-programmer-economists started making anonymous contributions and offered to reveal themselves after guessing their gender, choosing "male" every time would make you right far more often than wrong; choosing "female" would make you wrong far more often than right, and choosing "male" would also make you right more often than flipping a coin.
So no, it's not about cognitive dissonance. If Satoshi were, in fact, a female it would only make the slightest bit of difference. I wouldn't be scrambling to go back and change my opinion that her contributions are anything short of brilliant. All I'd have to say is, "I was wrong. Flip the pronouns". However, if another cryptographer came out with an equally ingenious idea it wouldn't be a gargantuan mistake to conclude, with perhaps *slightly less* a degree of certainty, that the gender of the person in question is male - and my assessments will change if and when the gender ratio gets closer to 50/50.
No rational person would walk into the Savanna and try to pet a lion on the off chance that it might be tame. That's just plain rational thinking, and I'll take that over feel good platitudes about "gender-normative assumptions" any day of the week.

Then you're arguing against something I never argued. I argued that shooting a gun into a crowd and failing to hit someone is not a victimless crime.


Harm is a moral view, not a statistical one. And assuming the existence of the crowd is, again, begging the question. DUI doesn't require people that could be harmed to actually exist to arrest someone for it, just to be hypothetically conceivable based on some statistical measure written in a book.
It's like going to the gun range and arresting the people there because the statistics suggest that a lot of people die due to gun violence - and using an imaginary situation of bullet ricochet as an evidentiary basis for prosecution without even considering whether the particulars of the case ought affect the level of risk.
The morals are being used to create the stats which are being used to justify the morals. Quite circular.


I'm not suggesting anyone should give up risk assessment altogether.


What statistics say we should? If anything, various cognitive biases suggest that statistics can cause us to value human life *less* or fail to appreciate the magnitude of suffering appropriately.


Because murder is immoral; that's why we collect stats on it, why we use stats to find out where it's occurring.. etc.
Yet we don't use stats to arrest those who could hypothetically murder, simply those who have or are in the process of committing murder. DUI is similar to the hypothetical murder. It's very similar to pre-crime; where you demand people sacrifice their rights at warrantless suspicionless checkpoints, detain them against their will, force them to sacrifice their bodily integrity by demanding they submit to blood tests and so forth. 
Killing people, damaging or destroying their property is already illegal and immoral. Weaving around, driving dangerously, causing people to fear for their lives is already cause to stop a person from driving because an actual threat is manifest. 
Going around seeking out elevated risk and inventing it in your mind? You sacrifice everything else, ultimately to the end of morality itself. 
If I could imagine you beating your wife and point to statistics showing that you are an elevated risk of doing so, why shouldn't you be charged? Why shouldn't I invade your house to make sure you aren't doing this? Why shouldn't I be able to send you through a cat scan to evaluate whether you have a psychopath's brain? Why not also send you to a psychiatrist to evaluate what your risk level to others is?


Maybe you're a detriment to society - you've taken far more out than you've put in. If you go away, everyone else will be better off.


In conjunction, yes. But risk alone? I don't think it's the right approach since it can be used to justify immorality as much as it can aid in finding it. I have no problem with using the risk model as an investigative aid so long as people aren't using it as a pretext to infringe on the rights of others.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:51:49
You directly caused people to fear for their life. That's not a victimless crime, it's assault with a deadly weapon.
You want an example of a victimless crime? Someone notices that people who fire into crowds tend to wear saggy jeans, so they decide it's easier just to imprison people who wear saggy jeans.
The point is if some drunk guy is weaving around and putting the lives of other people at risk, you don't need to charge them with being drunk - just charge them with assault with a deadly weapon.
That way you don't need to criminalize everything under the sun that could cause people to drive poorly - eating food, putting on make up, talking on a cell phone, etc. If they're putting lives at risk, charge them with assault or property damage. 
Jesus, guys, this isn't rocket science.

@_date: 2014-02-04 20:07:15


I think you missed the point. The point is *you can't charge someone for a crime if you have no evidence they committed one*.


No, your statistical averages written down in a book are putting someone's *imagination* at risk. 
And law shouldn't be based on hypotheticals for all of the reasons I outlined. Like I said elsewhere, under the risk assessment model, all police should be in Guantanamo because they represent a greater threat to the public than terrorists do. 
You really haven't addressed any of these counter-examples.


This is again, as throwaway-o pointed out, your imagination of what I'm arguing.
The original argument was that firing a gun into a crowd and hitting no one was a victimless crime. 
"Victimless crime is a term used to refer to actions that have been ruled illegal but which are argued not to directly violate or threaten the rights of any other individual."
If they don't see the threat, did it occur? Yes. But it's irrelevant. And as I pointed out elsewhere, stats do not determine morality.
If you live on a million acre ranch and I plant a mine on it in a random location hoping to kill you, yet the risk of you stepping on it is 1 in ten million and I am just hoping to get very very lucky (or I overestimate my chances), your risk model says it's OK to bury that mine on your property because the risk of you getting killed by it is negligible. 
This is similar to your "silent gun scenario", except with a twist: it doesn't even have to matter if you *know* that I put a mine somewhere on your property. The risk is the same regardless of whether you know. It doesn't matter that you feel apprehension that I intend to kill you; you're just being paranoid.
In fact, I could just stand outside your home and point a gun at you all day and that's OK as long as the gun's not loaded. There is 0% chance of getting shot by a bullet that isn't there.

Morality and legality are separate issues that should not be taken together. Slavery, for example, is profoundly immoral but was quite legal for a long time.
If you're arguing that evidence is irrelevant, then your argument had unnecessary premises. The gun doesn't have to be silent and unseen to evaluate the morality of the situation, in which case I revert back to my normal argument and we've wasted our time going down this avenue.


And that's another problem with risk assessment. People are just not very good at assessing risk, police included. The point is the government *itself* has spent countless billions on stopping terrorism, yet it is a really low-priority target from an actuarial standpoint.


OK. The stats show that X people are killed every year due to drunk driving.
What stats prove that anyone should give a shit about their deaths? The stats come first, moral views after - right?
What's our motive for collecting these stats if they're not informed by some moral view?


OK - let's say the risk of you getting killed by the mine is so low that my uptick in happiness at your demise would increase the average happiness of society to the extent that the risk is worth it. Let's also say I paid more to purchase this mine than you could ever produce in economic output your entire life, that I also had to buy an expensive license and go to school to learn how to use it, that I also paid a fair amount of taxes to "society" to do all these things, and that no one will care if you're gone. Altogether, let's assume it's a net gain for society.
Is it moral then?


Yes, and that's my point. Placing a mine on your property inhibits your rights, causes you distress, etc.
But under the statistical, risk-based model it doesn't matter. I put a mine on your property and the fact that you're distressed about it is irrelevant. Everyone could tell you, "don't worry about it buddy, you're not likely to step on it". 
My malicious intent should give you neither cause for apprehension nor sufficient cause to keep me the hell away from you.

Why don't we just skip the victim part and start throwing them in jail? The stats prove it out, maaaan. Let's just start punishing people statistically and then we can avoid the whole argument about Schroedinger's drunkard.
All the reasons you have provided for prosecuting this crime could be applied in other scenarios as well.
Got a live in girlfriend? Well she's statistically at higher risk of spousal abuse, so I hope you don't mind if I knock on your door to inspect your house every hour to make sure she's OK.
Young person? You're statistically more likely to do drugs, so I hope you don't mind if I rifle through your belongings to make sure you're not carrying drugs.

TCP is a terrible protocol from a security standpoint and the recent NSA revelations (among others) *have* made people think twice about how (or even whether) they use the internet.
The fact that it was not made secure by design is evidence that even ARPA didn't have the foresight to realize what it could potentially become. 
Contrary to the narrative, they weren't "wise central planners". Throw enough money around and eventually someone will come up with an idea that has applications elsewhere; even if one of those groups is the mafia.
That doesn't make what government does efficient, and it sure as hell doesn't make government moral, especially the DoD.
I mean if that's the principle we're going to operate from, we should all pay tribute to Nazis for creating technology that aided us in the space race (the V2 rocket program), technology that helped us synthesize ammonia using the Haber process, an important discovery which created a boom in agriculture and the production of fertilizer, allowing us to grow an abundance of food, undoubtedly saving millions from starvation.
While these ideas undoubtedly were developed to aid the Nazis and their allies (the jet engine made it to Japan, for example), they were morally neutral.
People, however, seem to be wanting to subvert the bitcoin protocol for their own rent seeking ends and they are sending lobbyists to D.C. in an attempt to create the very kind of problems bitcoin was intended to avoid - top-down, centralized control of the money supply.
Suggesting they should leave makes sense in this respect because they're not going to get what they want without destroying bitcoin itself; I will enjoy watching their frustrated attempts to do so, though.

No, on the contrary - I fully understand the idea that it is to deter risk taking where other people are involved.
But a mechanism for such a thing already exists - a victim. You don't actually have to hit someone for it to be an assault. You simply have to make them fear for their life, their safety, etc.
This is the reason drunk driving is a so-called victimless crime: a victim is completely optional. 
And there are advantages to doing things without going that route:
* You don't need to test people
* You don't need to force people to incriminate themselves
* You don't need to dragnet innocents looking for guilty people
* You don't need to detain innocent people against their will
* You don't need to search people's property without their consent
* You don't have to arrest people who may just be "sleeping it off in their car" on some "hunch" that they may have driven.
* You don't have to arrest people for having "open containers" on some "hunch" that they may have taken a swig from it.
If, on the other hand, you have caused someone to fear for their life, then the situation changes. You have a reported assault, you have probable cause and your investigation is localized to simply to the suspect.
Now instead of looking for a *chemical*, you are looking for an *individual* who you have cause to believe has committed a crime against another person or property.
The police attempts to "deter" people from drinking by doing random checkpoints only pisses me off. I don't drink and drive, I've been pulled over and subjected to one of their tests (no surprise, 0.00 BAC) because the officer's judgement was wrong.
Where does this power even come from? Can I pull you over at random intervals and force you to blow into a tube to prove you're not a "criminal"? Hell no.
So yeah, if no one's reported me for anything and I'm just trying to get home, then I should be able to go home without being hassled by nannies who want to waste my time teaching me a lesson about being "deterred" from doing something I am not doing.

No one is saying that people should abandon the idea of the blockchain, the actual technological advancement behind bitcoin. It has neutral applications. Bitcoin OTOH was created to implement an environment where certain ideals would flourish.
If you believe that money should be centrally planned and regulated you're not going to find what you're looking for in bitcoin. If you want to create an altcoin that automatically sends your identity and account balance to the taxation/regulatory authorities, fine. 
Just stop telling everyone else that the protocol needs more forceful central planning just because you think that will help it go "mainstream" so you can make money off of your holdings. It wasn't made for you to get rich rent seeking.

That's a pretty bad argument. A black person's parents caused their blackness and they made a choice to have children.
So go after the parents instead for creating a person that raised everyone's risk. Sterilize all black people to prevent this from happening in the future.
Same goes for women. The parents could have aborted female children, or genetically engineered their children to be all male so it's their fault.
Of course, males cause disproportionate violence, so all parents should be sterilized because we cannot take the risk.

Feel free to attempt to prove that they do without resorting to "impressions" (muh feels), circular logic, or the like.


Derp. I'm very sorry that you lack reading comprehension.


I've noticed that you seem to have developed a strange obsession with my sexual preferences. Are you trying to proposition me? 
PICS or GTFO.

Someone sounds annoyed. Do you need a hug?


Nope. Are you under the impression that you forfeit your individual rights simply because you're sitting in your own vehicle?


I've gone several rounds with you feels clowns. Yes, I realize reading things is hard for you guys, but if you try really hard maybe you could figure out how to parse those criticisms before regurgitating the same nonsense your buddies have and then bitching out with a bunch of passive aggressive parting downmods.
Your butthurt is palpable. I hope the strokes you're giving each other in your private forum are worth it.

This is a strawman. No one said that anyone was risking the lives of others. 
That's called assault, and no - I don't give a shit if you were high on meth when you pulled a knife on me and tried to rob me. That's just an excuse. You still presumably *chose* to do meth. You are responsible for that too, but your mental state has no bearing whatsoever on the fact that you threatened and attempted to rob me.
This is the "pre-crime" element he's referring to. You are assuming, without evidence, the existence of a victim because you could *imagine* one in some made up scenario, though you and I both know that people drive drunk all the time and not every single instance results in someone being killed, harmed, or otherwise.

Hahah you are a model of overconfidence. 
You've been proven wrong after exactly the fashion you requested so now, predictably, you're going to move the goal posts.
I noticed your boyfriends came in to white knight for you. I realize this must've been a very traumatic and intimidating exchange for you, so I'll let you take your leave.
See you later, honey. *hugs*

I've already addressed this shitty argument about "reducing risk" elsewhere.
You can reduce your risk of harm by driving around in a tank. You can reduce your risk of harm by not getting in a car at all. You can reduce your risk of harm by taking away cars from all of the elderly, all women, all men. You can reduce your statistical risk of harm by throwing all black men in jail, all white men in jail, all men in jail. You can reduce your risk of dying in a terrorist attack by killing all middle-easterners. 
Your calculus can be used to justify practically any intrusion into the rights of others because risks are always involved.
It would seem you have formulated a rather shitty argument that lacks any reasonable constraints.

Wouldn't mention it all if I thought I was.




They can *try* to do what they want, but yes - there is plenty I and others can do to stop them. People can refuse to upgrade, can fork. An economic system takes more than one person.


Bitcoin already reflects a certain ideology. To divert that path in the direction some people seem to want to take it is to kill bitcoin.


Interesting analogy considering I support decentralization so I don't have a "mommy" in this case. Some of these people, OTOH, are trying to run to a regulatory mother in a misguided attempt to compromise or eliminate bitcoin's decentralized nature.
And yes, Johnny can kick the volleyball instead of using his hands, but no one's going to call the game he's playing "volleyball", and when the ball pops because it was not designed to be kicked, he's going to realize he should have bought a soccer ball instead.

Lulzworthy that they would do this, but I can't say I'm surprised that all of the trolls and stalkers you have verbally slammed need their own support group. 
They protest your existence like central authority junkies who have had their needles taken away from them. It's quite entertaining for the rest of us.

Causing someone to fear for their life is assault. You don't need to punish subjective mental states like intoxication to punish people who cause others to fear for their lives.


Again you are *assuming* a hypothetical victim in your imagination - you are begging the question. If, for example, *Mythbusters* is doing a show on a closed course about the effects of driving while intoxicated and others either are not at risk, or they assume such a risk by participating in the filming of the show, then where's the victim? 
Shit, man, if you're going to go with hypothetical victims every time, you put the lives of others at risk *simply by driving*, drunk or not. Should you be slapped with a pre-crime charge for that because you could have accidentally run over some hypothetical little girl?
There's a difference between dealing with the real world, and one composed of hypothetical scenarios. Punishing people for a hypothetical scenario you can dream up is silly. With a victim, however, a court can collect concrete evidence and make a determination. 
As for what I personally think: I wouldn't want people drunk driving on my own property in most cases. As for the public roadways, everyone's going to have their own ideas about how they should be run. I personally don't like seeing bicycles on the road, for example, but laws allow for them.
The way to solve that is to end the monopoly on roads so that people can develop their own ways of solving the various problems - the best ideas for road management will rise to the top.
Maybe speed limits and traffic lights are stupid? I don't know, but I do know that so long as we have a monopoly it will be difficult to test other ideas and find out whether we as a society can do better.
Perhaps cars could be computer-controlled/magnetically locked to the road so that even a drunk person can operate them safely. Who knows? Maybe the problem is a technology issue and not a drunk person issue.
At any rate, if you're going to keep re-injecting a hypothetical victim into every drunk driving scenario, then of course I'll understand why you think drunk driving should be a crime; but the certitude with which you express this sentiment - well, I can also understand why someone would compare it to pre-crime.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:25:13
Yes, there is a basis to choose one way over another - the fact that most people in such a line of work are male. 
It's the same reason people would assume an anonymous nurse is female; because all of the available evidence of nurses supports such a conclusion. It's not just mere speculation as if we had no prior knowledge of the profession, were asked on the spot, and just randomly chose male.
Our prior experiences have guided our thinking. This is simply a Bayesian understanding of prior probability. If we let experience guide our level of certainty, then we are reasoning correctly.
**EDIT** Also, the fact that you are trying to rationalize this by adding further disclaimers to argue that Satoshi might be a female makes it *less likely to be true*, not more - because now we have an anonymous female with a male name, and she's concealing her sex for an unknown reason. Why wouldn't she choose a female name? Every rationalization you pile on without evidence will make your suggestion sound even more far-fetched and ridiculous, not more likely to be true.

If all you can offer in argument for someone being imprisoned and having his life and the lives of his customers threatened for the "crime" of minding their own business is "lol he dumb for being caught" then you're clearly blaming the victim.
Maybe instead of questioning why the chick was wearing a short skirt you should ask yourself why her town is full of rapists. Throwaway-o seems to have understood that, why don't you?

Now you're just making up shit. Nowhere did the author (a female, not a male, BTW) make any claims of any change of heart about ancaps. If anything, her post suggests a change in the political makeup of bitcoin.
She also didn't respond to a comment by directed at her or attempt to clarify her position. It appears she just downmodded him instead within minutes of receiving the post.
So I'm going to go with she still holds that position until such point that she says otherwise. Feel free to stick with your made up narrative that has no basis in reality.

No kidding. Under the state my legal status is unclear (Schroedinger's lawbreaker) and the government has as much value to me as a tapeworm.
Considering the religious love for the state in spite of all of the evil it has wrought, maybe it's about time people lost faith.

I'm inclined to agree here. Those numbers don't look bad to me. If you look at the percentage changes, the "swings" in volatility", they keep getting lower and lower. That looks like the currency is converging on stability over time. Maybe it is the S-curve technology adoption pattern after all.
