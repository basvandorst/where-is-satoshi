How do any of your exceptions apply to the vast majority of businesses?
If a Greek restaurant wants to take credit cards, they can.
They don't because they want to avoid tax.
All of your reasons apply to restaurants in London, New York, Tokyo, Berlin etc etc
Why do most of the restaurants in those cities take credit cards, but the majority in Athens don't?
Tax evasion.


Don't be ridiculous. If I wanted to bring criminal charges against an individual I would need to provide evidence.
Which individual am I bringing charges against?


I didn't assert that. I asserted that tax evasion is the main reason for only transacting in cash.

I suggested that you started your eduction on tax avoidance in Greece and the use of cash payments to avoid tax, by reading that article, not that you started and finished.

You make good points, and yes the selection process (for the judge, and for whoever selects the judge) is going to be somewhat political by nature.
However, there is a clear conflict with the executive selecting and the legislature directly electing, and their time in office is not temporary enough to negate that conflict.
Appointment should be by a body and a process that is as independent of the executive and legislature as possible.
The judiciary should be heavily involved, with enough non-judiciary involvement and enough rules to prevent abuse.
It may not be perfect but something like

No there isn't just as much evidence.
A check is tied to a bank account (a bank account that has a registered owner), it has a signature, it may have fingerprints.
What is a bitcoin address tied to?
If you kept passing bad checks for every breakfast, they would be liked to the same bank account (or a set of accounts).
With bitcoin you could create a new address for each breakfast.


It's not that they are dumb, it's that they have to balance the effort they put it.
Yes, if you used bitcoins to carry out major fraud or buy explosives, then law enforcement would quite likely do everything they can to track you down, but here we are talking about a breakfast.
It's far easier to tie a bad check to a person than a bitcoin address.
You've also missed the important point that the main deterrence for the occasional bad check is the bank charges, which don't exist with bitcoin.
If you assume that restaurant owners will be super keen to accept bitcoin and that law enforcement will make bitcoin crime a high priority, then perhaps the problems will be overcome.
The far more likely outcome is that owners will be stung a few times, contact the police, be told that nothing can be done, and then just stop taking bitcoin or insist on confirmations.
EDIT: So, we're back to confirmations. Either they need to be quick, or buying breakfast with bitcoin isn't going to happen on a large scale.

That may be, but it has nothing to do with new money flowing into BTC.
You say that the miner holding is the same as him selling and you buying, so that supply and demand is balanced and the price stays stable.
In many ways yes, but neither of those situations results in a positive flow of money into bitcoin.
1) The miner mines and holds (no positive flow into bitcoin)
2) He sells 25BTC @ $250 and you buy @ $250 (no positive flow into bitcoin)

There is often an efficiency that comes with producing more than you need for one day. Think farming, or coming across two edible animals in a clearing, or a tree a long way from your village that is full of fruit, or any kind of modern day mass production.


Apart from the issue of efficiency, comes the demand mismatch. Yes, it's more efficient to kill two animals in one hunting trip, and someone will probably want the meat, but do you want something that they have?
You need an intermediary things of value (money). 
Again, you could formulate that money as debt rather than a thing of value to be bartered, but it is unnecessary to do so.

Possibly, but there are at least three differences.
Firstly it is much more difficult to prove intent, if you had sufficient funds, but the transaction never confirmed.

Depends what you mean by counter.
You can only block the patent if you can show prior art, and that has to be public before the patent is filed (such as your magazine article example). If you kept it hidden then you couldn't use it to block the patent, even if you could prove that it existed before the patent (e.g. via a hash of a document).
In some jurisdictions, if you were previously using it without "going public", you can keep using it yourself without infringing the patent, but you can't actually block the patent.

No, you're taking a very narrow view of money laundering.
Yes, if you get your money from selling drugs, you may well run that money through a legitimate, tax paying business to launder it. Paying tax is a good way to not bring attention on yourself. 
But the point of laundering is to hide the origin of the money from the authorities. 
When it comes to tax evasion, you can use the cash to pay for services or to buy assets that will not bring the source of that cash to the attention of the authorities.
Still money laundering,  just not the type you usually see on TV.

The court weighs the evidence in conjunction with the testimony of the person that gathered it.
If an investigator submits screenshots and gives testimony as to how and when they were taken, the court and the jury will likely consider that strong evidence. They will presume that the investigator has no reason to risk perjury.
It is open to the defence to cross examine and to introduce evidence to rebut, but just suggesting that the investigators can't be trusted just won't cut it, there needs to be evidence to back that up.
Probably the majority of evidence in any trial can be falsified by the investigators.
If courts and juries presumed that investigators would do or say anything to get a conviction, then there would never be a conviction because little of the evidence could be trusted.
There are all kinds of claims about evidence being blocked by the judge.
There are long established rules about what evidence is admissible, so you would need to provide very specific examples of what was blocked and the reasons that the judge gave for blocking it, before anybody could say whether the judge erred.

You're probably right that most of the devs will continue with whichever branch is adopted. For most of them, there won't be any difference.
However, for the current "core devs" (i.e. those with commit privileges), they may end up as just another developer on the XT branch (if Gavin doesn't re-appointment them on the new branch), and they may consider that they have lost status.
How will they deal with that? Will they feel pressure to switch to XT, simply to maintain their perceived status? Would Gavin take them anyway? (it would be much easier to proceed with further changes, if only he and Mike need to agree)

Credit is being given something of value now, and entering into an obligation to give something of value back later. 
Money provides a mechanism to store and exchange value, it is not an embodiment of credit, and it is needlessly complicated to try to formulate it as such (yes, you could formulate it as a running credit ledger, but its fundamentals are more simple than that).
We barter, and always have. Money became a fungible item that we could barter for anything else. Credit, where given, just allows the barter to be staggered.

Are you saying that the judge totally prevented cross examination of the prosecution's witnesses or that she prevented certain lines of questioning?
Again there are well established rules about what can and cannot be presented as evidence.
I quickly Googled "Der-Yeghiayan's testimony" and found this
It seems that there were several issues, including asking him about a meeting that he wasn't actually present at (i.e. hearsay) and also existing case law that prevents an “alternative perpetrator” line of questioning unless there is strong evidence that there was, indeed, and alternative perpetrator.
The problem is that a judge is bound by certain well established rules of what can and can't be permitted. 
It is not the case that the defense can say or do anything they want to get their client off, they have to also abide by the rules of what can and can't be permitted.

The other issue with having your own blockchain is that you can control the development of the protocol (for your fork).

But, if you could distribute your own blockchain to get verification trust sufficient for your purposes, then having control of the protocol could be a big bonus.

It would depend who was using it and what for. They would need to arrange for enough parties to secure it, but it doesn't need to be secured by a network of the size and distribution that the Bitcoin blockchain has.
It would probably not be entirely trustless, in that it could be made of parties that are known and somewhat trusted.
For Nasdaq it could, perhaps, be a network of the existing clearing houses and possibly other financial organisations, exchanges etc.

OK,thanks, that fits with what I thought. I am trying to create the raw transaction through the Brainwallet JavaScript, but I get this in the transaction history.
    {
        "notice": "Some funds are pending confirmation and cannot be spent yet (Value 0.00199459 BTC)",
        "unspent_outputs": []
    }
That value is everything that is in the address, so that explains why I can't create a transaction.
Because I got the minimum amount wrong, I assume that the transaction will eventually fail, rather than just take a long time to confirm.
Any idea how long that might take?

This kind of paralysis is actually going to be one of the big risks of Bitcoin blockchain adoption.
Does anybody think that the likes of Nasdaq are going to tie their solutions into a platform where product development decisions can be stuck for years?
Probably the biggest reason for them to run their own blockchain will be the confidence that the development can be controlled. Hell...they might even just take the blockchain approach but build everything from scratch.
If people want to see the Bitcoin blockchain being the one used, then the product management needs to be a lot more credible.
I think Gavin should be bold, increase the size and release (if he wanted to be a little less bold, he could just increase it in increments). Either one of the core devs will revert his change or they won't.

He is the one dismissing the possibility of an attack. I am not stating that an attack is possible (so I am not saying "you're wrong"). I am saying that he is overconfident and that is a risk.
Unless he can be sure that he has predicted every possible method of attack then he should not be so confident that an attack is impossible. He can never be sure that he has predicted every attack, and it is very unlikely that he ever would predict them all.

We need to be careful with "natural progression". It can be used to make all kinds of claims.
Some would claim that there is a natural progression from smoking cannabis to living in a crack house and selling your body for your next hit. 
Others would claim that there is a natural progression from playing violent video games to gunning down people at your local mall.
Where is the proof?
Banks have been getting away with all kinds of questionable behaviour (including those you mention) throughout their entire history. So if teams of hackers directly stealing assets are a natural progression, they should be doing it right now and have been doing so since the first financial IT systems.

Yes, it's interesting that it is being considered for applications such as Nasdaq trades, but a single bitcoin worth of transactions is going to potentially give you at least 100 million trades.
That depends upon whether single Satoshi, zero fee, transactions make sense and, how many times the same output could be used.
Could you record all stock trades ever, using a single Satoshi being transacted again and again?
Depends upon how the implementation ties a stock trade to a transaction, do you need to own the transaction output to own the stock, or are they just spamming the blockchain with transactions to record the trades?

It's not a lot of money (although he does seem to claim that it is his life savings) but it is still a lot of cash.
Yes, I'm sure that cash deals of that amount for used cars are not uncommon, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a lot of cash (you've arguably picked by far the most expensive thing that most people would ever buy with cash).
Assuming that he didn't plan to use his whole life savings to buy a second hand car in cash, I can't conceive of a need to have $16,000 cash available to him.
The next largest expense that I can think of is possibly a deposit and first month rent on an apartment but, again, it wouldn't make sense that he would rent a place where the deposit and rent were his whole life savings.

Actually, yeah, you are right, I was mis-reading the interface. I don't suggest that it is negligible, but I don't think the percentage volume is high enough to explain the sell off.
Spread across various exchanges the dent in the order books would be much smaller, and i doubt that they are forced to dump all in one market order.

The volume is vitally important, and if they are forced to sell then they will just place a market order. It is not the case that there are no buyers, but that they will sell at the current best offer.
If you sell 5,000 at market that will just fill the next 5,000 btc worth of buy orders.
Looking at the bitfinex order book right now that would push the highest buy order from 198.42 to 198.11

This is an attempt at satire, of course, but it fails on a couple of important points (IMHO).
It mocks the idea that drilling for oil would stop if the price of oil fell to very uneconomical price, but that is exactly what would happen.
The difference is that (for now) the world can't do without oil, so there will always be demand (until oil is completely replaced by something else). The price is falling and production investment is being reduced, but because of ongoing demand, the price will have to stay at a point where some drilling is economical.
The same cannot be said for Bitcoin. There is no fundamental need for Bitcoin, so demand and price could fall, so that mining would become uneconomical.
There is a similar fault with the stock market analogy. At least some of the companies traded produce outputs for which there is a fundamental demand (inc oil companies).
There is no absolute need for Bitcoin, unlike oil.
That doesn't mean it will fade away, only that it easily could. There is no way that we will have stopped using oil 10 years from now.

Is he trying to claim that one financial organisation is going to directly steal assets from another, or from their customers?
That's a bold claim to make, and I can't see him providing any evidence to back it up.
If they were prepared to outright steal assets from one another, they would have team of hackers right now trying to break into each others systems. After all, the costs of such teams would also be "far cheaper than the value of the assets they could steal."
The banks seem to be experts at making plenty of money through cheating, without having to take the huge risk of directly stealing.

Lending in a decentralized currency doesn't change the fact that the issuer may default. 
Lending in exchange for shares (and convertible bonds) already happens, it also doesn't stop the issuer from defaulting.

Yikes, that's really tough, although the price was about $220 around Feb 5th, so the total dollar loss was only around $17,000 rather than the $22,000 that they would be worth now.
Perhaps that is some small consolation.
As others have said, you should perhaps review measures such as paper wallets and Trezor, before diving back in, and certainly reconsider leaving large amounts of crypto on exchanges.
Given that BTC seems to be in an uptrend at the moment, I would be hopeful that you could quickly recoup your losses...if you get back in quickly.

The whole referendum was a joke from the start.
The actual question was about whether to accept very specific conditions, but the Germans tried to make about staying in or leaving the euro, and Tsipras tried to make it about vague principles of rejecting humiliation and controlling their destiny.
Whatever politicians managed to convince the voters they were voting for, they were voting to accept or reject those specific conditions. No more and no less.

You're missing the point.
The vast majority of people will understand the way that I am using the word waffle to describe much of your comments, because they have a feel for the nuance of language and human behaviour.
You, on the other hand, need a new written definition to understand language when it deviates even slightly from your existing definition, and a formula to understand human behaviour.
You cope by dismissing language variations as incorrect and behaviour outside of your formula as "bizarre".
You appear to have a very literal mind, and one that misses nuance. That's not a bad thing.
It just means that you are going to have problems understanding people.

If miners verify transactions, what will happen when all of the bitcoins have been mined?
Will the mining difficulty simply fall to near zero, so that anybody can handle all of the transaction verification on a single computer (and do so without reward)?
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:30:44
So, as such, it would not be possible to taint such a unit, only a wallet/address. I suppose you could taint a transaction but, again, it should only be possible to tie that to a wallet/address.

I see that they have now refunded you. Excellent.
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:45:12
It seems to me that you need widespread adoption.
That is not going to happen without all the usual safeguards. So either:
1) We wait until somebody has built those safeguards
2) People use platforms such as PayPal that offer those safeguards, until such time as 1) happens.
Of course, there is a problem with 2) in that there is no point using Bitcoin if you have to go via PayPal.
So perhaps everything has to wait until 1), but then is it really feasible that we can have those safeguards without a 3rd party...and that the 3rd party won't want a sizeable cut?
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:46:48
Thanks, that really helps to clarify things.
So, a transaction could be tainted, and not affect other transactions that exist in the same address, but the taint could also pass to other transactions which stem from the tainted one.
Also, tumblers are therefore really tumbling transactions rather than coins.
So, Bad Guy 1 sends a transaction for 10 BTC to the tumbler address, but is then paid 10 BTC (minus cost) out of a completely different transaction(s).
I suppose the tumblers do a large amount of transactions between addresses, so that each Bad Guy is not paid out from a single (or small number) of incoming transactions. You wouldn't want to launder your drug coins, only to find out that you received terrorist coins instead :)

I haven't frequented the Yahoo boards and, if they are anything like the Google Finance boards used to be, I wouldn't want to.
Stupid, baseless hype and any other opinion was shouted down as an obvious plan to push the price down and buy a certain stock cheap.
For example, I remember looking at the Las Vegas Sands discussions, and rather than real discussion it was all ridiculous hype and talk about how they would take each other on trips to Vegas when the price hit $X.
The part I found particularly pathetic was the obvious hope that anything they posted there would have any real effect on stock prices.

The problem is that lots of those points you listed, are genuine doubts that people have about Bitcoin, just stated bluntly.
Most people who post here are often (almost always?) trying to convince the wider audience that their point of view is correct (whether it is pro or anti bitcoin), and most people realise that the way to convince most people is through emotive, snappy sound-bites, rather than long-winded logic (ask any politician).
So, concerns are often dismissed with a simple "FUD" and those making positive comments with a "to da moon".
So, yes, people on both sides of the debate, default to blunt shorthand in their arguments, in the hopes that they will stick in the minds of the audience.

Trying to incentivize it this way is fatally flawed, as others with development experience have pointed out.
Do most contributors really need to be paid? I doubt it.

Yes, if you just wanted to do it once, then you could manually run the command (copying and pasting the address), but what if you wanted to do it multiple times?
And, yes, of course you can use the GUI but there are various reasons that somebody might want to use the API directly (for starters, it's a much quicker way to get a new address/key pair).
So this is not my suggestion for the best way to create an address/private key pair, it's not my suggestion for the least amount of code create a pair, or the best operating system to do it on.
It is specifically, for someone who wants to use the Bitcoin Core on Windows to create their address/key pair and wants to understand how to use the API to do that, and wants to know the bare minimum to get started. That was the aim of this post (because I couldn't find it more succinctly anywhere else).
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:33:37
Sure, there are plenty of ways to create addresses and keys, but some may want to use the core directly (perhaps because they don't trust other software). That is why I did this, and thought I might as well share.

I think that a lot of what is dismissed as trolling, is actually just bluntly spoken, unpopular views...which are not the same as trolling.
Yes, they may be repeated often, but so are all the bluntly spoken, popular views.
I haven't decided about Bitcoin yet, so I want to read as many viewpoints as possible.
It is difficult to weed out the valuable critical thinking from the rest of the noise...both popular and unpopular...but that is not an uncommon problem.

The biggest problem is that it is still difficult to buy Bitcoin in the UK, without paying a big commission/spread (5-6%)
A lot of the availability seems to be from one man bands, with a limited supply of bitcoin.
Looked at one site earlier today, which has a good reputation, and it basically said "come back in a couple of days, when we have more BTC in stock".
I know that there is a shop that sells them in the city, but when you work out the spread (compared to, say, Bitfinex), they are actually charging (if memory serves) about 8%.
I am still undecided about Bitcoin, and only have a grand total of 1,000 bits :)
However, I would possibly like to start amassing some, but don't want to pay too much over the odds.
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:05:28




OK, so it looks like I am confused.
I recently started running the Bitcoin Core. It took a while, but is now up-to-date with the Blockchain and keeps itself up to date with new blocks. Am I running a "full node"?
As I understood it a transaction was not "Confirmed" until it was in a mined block, and that means that you cannot be sure that a transaction is not a double-spend, until it is in a mined block? Is that correct?
Is the Bitcoin Core that I am running only verifying blocks that have already been mined, or is it also storing and propagating unconfirmed transactions?

Page Views != Readership
"Unique visitors" to their website is 90,000 per month.
Even if they were genuinely different individuals (unlikely), they each view less than 3 pages per month (247,000 page views), and many (most?) of them are going to be people that get the magazine anyway.
Sorry, but you are never going to convince anybody that hundreds of thousands of people read Convenience Store magazine.

Sorry OP, this must be very stressful for you.
Am I correct in thinking that:
* 1) The OP created a BitGo wallet
* 2) He then lost his private key
* 3) He ran the offline BitGo app on his wallet
* 4) The app transferred the balance from one address to another address for which the OP does have the private key
* 5) The app set 85 BTC as the transaction fee
Is that what happened?

You're correct.
However even when something is clearly specified there are still a multitude of reasons that a contract can be ruled unenforceable.
Things such as sufficiency of consideration,  undue influence, unfair contract statutes, lack of intent, etc, etc, etc.
Having contracts in a public ledger and even having them self-executing cannot solve all of those issues.
The only true test of whether a contract is enforceable, is whether a judge says it is.
