Yep, no issues going from non-segwit to segwit wallets.

Transition back? It's been thousands of years since the advent of exchanging "money" for goods and services.

Don't waste time waiting for dips... I feel like people wait and wait then when they see a $1000 drop they buy EVEN THOUGH it is still a higher price than when they started waiting. 
Not about timing the market; you will drive yourself crazy. I've bought at numerous ATH's and literally all of them have been obliterated over time.

If you know that it is impossible to call, then why ask? Nobody on this planet, let alone this subreddit, know. Taking others advice to circumvent your own judgement is a setup for disappointment.

What is gold and silver? Why does that have intrinsic value? It doesn't any more than bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:24
Probably a troll but I'll bite; BTC is up 18% in 24 hours lol. What is with all this sensationalist stuff? People saying 'Buy teh dipz buy teh dipZ!" but refused to purchase 24 hours ago because the price was too high.
