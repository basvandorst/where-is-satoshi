[This is not legal or financial advice; I am not your attorney; you should speak to an attorney who represents your interests to get answers specific to you own situation]: There is nothing special about the taxation of cryptocurrency (except, perhaps, the novelty of valuable forks). If you acquired something, you owe taxes on its fair market value at the moment you can exercise dominion and control over it. If you own something and later trade it for more than it was worth when you got it, you owe taxes on the capital gains. If it was worth less, you have a capital loss. If you have something that is worth money and you haven’t already paid taxes on its fair market value, pretty much anything you do with it needs to be reported to the IRS and your state and, unless you’re donating it (under extremely special circumstances) you need to pay taxes on the capital value that you haven’t ready paid taxes on (even if it’s a gift to someone or an entity that isn’t charitable, you need to pay the tax on the gift).

The issue with this type of analysis is that it ignores that many of the biggest mining operations pay nothing or close to nothing for electricity. While the economic “profit” of the operation (for all parties involved, including the subsidizing electricity provider) might not be positive, the profit of the operation for the recipient of the mining rewards can be positive regardless of the efficiency of the miners.

I never touched my BCH, so you can add my stash to the 55%. So with me and Satoshi included, it should be something like 55.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%

No I didn’t; the premise of his question is flawed. The rules haven’t changed, so his “retrospect” notion can’t be addressed. The rules that applied in 2017 are the same rules that applied in 2016 and prior.
