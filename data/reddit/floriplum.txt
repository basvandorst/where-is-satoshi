So i asked that yesterday but i haven't found a solution yet, i want to buy bitcoins in germany but i have problems with the verification that all suggested sites have(i don't really like it for privacy reasons, and i have no official paper with my address on it) so im looking for an alternative. Right now i actually only want to buy a small amount to play a bit with it/get used to it and test out a few things so i also had no luck on bisq. 
Thanks for your help

So you normally use the hardware wallet as cold wallet?

I also got a message from my antivirus that it contains ludicrouz.v

I was referring to the localbitcoin site he linked, the problem with bisq is that i cant find a seller that sells the amount of bitcoin i want (i want to buy 5-10€ for now to test a few things)

Sorry for that, it is fixed now

Can i somehow buy bitcoin without the verification with an Residence proof because i have no paper with my name and adress on it?

So i downloaded electrum wallet and virustotal showed me [this]( is it the right version since there is this scam going on?
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:32:31
could you explain that a bit further please?
@_date: 2019-02-09 06:50:47
So in theory it should be save?

If i use a hardware wallet how would i implement a solution with a cold wallet?
@_date: 2019-02-09 07:03:51
So im kinda unsure if i would get a hardware wallet how i would set it up, so my plan would be to be able to pay with my phone, my laptops and have a cold storage. I thought i may have a wallet for each pc that contains a bit money each and use the hardware wallet as cold storage or is there a better way to set it up?

Looks interesting, so this is basically a marketplace, so it should be fine if i buy from a seller with high reputation?
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:28:08
i got it from  but havent checked anything besides the file if it contains viruses
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:16:40
Well im from Germany, where can i exchange them?
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:12:54
Could anyone help me and say if this is the right version of electrum (i downloaded it from here  since i get a virus alert from the windows defender and also [here](
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:40:35
