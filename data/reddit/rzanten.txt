To be a legit exchange in most countries you need a financial licence to hold fiat which is not yours. So, you will not get this licence cause you will hold, sell/buy btc. So, this is actually really bad news for bitcoin exchanges that can expect the next step of being shutdown cause they don't have a financial licence and illegaly hold third person fiat. Nice move ECB

What happend with Dell last time then? The price moved up a good load after the news hit the internet. But I guess that maybe the Dell news wasn't priced in somehow. Weird times.

We need more pools which offer 0% fee.
I think this is the most important reason why people mine where they mine.

Its very hard for a business to start selling bitcoins over there. The number one problem is that you will need to convert your useless bolivars directly to dollars to buy back bitcoins at bitstamp for instance. So you need to go to the black market for this and pay 16x the official bolivar/dolllar rate. Then, you get cash dollars since you arent allowed to have a dollar bank account inside Venezuela. So how do you get these dollar cash bills that you now have in Venezuela out of Venezuela and deposited on a dollar bank account outside of Venezuela which then you need to send to bitstamp. Very complicated and risky business. But if you can manage to start something like this and offer a cheaper way for the Venezuelans to convert there bolivars into bitcoins or dollars then you will have a monopoly over there.

I still can't believe that the price went from $475 moments for the announcement to ~~$469~~ $467 now about 25 minutes later. You would say that the big traders are on top of this awesome news. Also IRC is amazingly quiet. =/

We have seen that when the Bitcoin price sinks, a lot of Dutch people directly buy bitcoin. That's why our buffer went to the 0 BTC mark faster then normal today. Of course it also takes time to get some funds to Bitstamp each day.

So, Bitonic is awesome but you would like to work by an American company instead of Bitonic? I am confused.

I have researched this.
The problem is that no business will take the risk. Let me try to explain this. 
So say some Venezuelan guy over there gives me 240 American dollars for a bitcoin.
These dollars they give me are physical black market dollars which are illegal there. So now I as a business need to transport those physical dollars out of the country, deposit them onto a bank account and wire them to bitstamp/bitfinex to rebuy the bitcoin i just sold with a profit and take a huge risk cause of price volatility and of course a big fine. This since i cant put the 240 dollar on a Venezuelan bank account, of course no bank over there accept these illegal black market dollars.
So you will say, "hey maybe ask a huge fee for this service? Sell a bitcoin not for $240 but for $370?"
But then this Venezuelan guy can better just buy the $370 dollars from the black market and use those for there needs instead of trading it of for some bitcoins.

Wow they are fast. What about the silver market manipulation research that started a million billion years ago? Still ongoing and no legit proof huh?

From the CTFC in 2013 when they closed a 7000 hour long silver market manipulation investigation which they started in 2008. 
“there is no viable basis to bring an enforcement action with respect to any firm or its employees related to our investigation of silver markets.”

Okay, everybody there wants Bitcoin now, clear.
The question now becomes; who wants to sell there bitcoin and wants those kilos of bolivars in exchange?

So many suits still not realizing its not about the blockchain technology but more about the decentralized part that makes the blockchain revolutionary. And THE best decentralized blockchain is Bitcoin right now. That day when this realization comes == Moon ┗(°0°)┛.

The SEC need to give a response after a certain period after the license request with a question. And then the Gemini team has a certain period again to answer. That's how it goes normally. I heard some stories from some regulated Payment Service Provider that your request for a license could take as long as 3 years of ping-ponging.

I know you guys don't wanna hear this but..
Are you gonna create the same reddit thread in 5 years when the 20 MB limit is reached? I bet by then the interests are even bigger to not fork and its gonna be even harder to convince the majority to again fork to a 50 mb blocksize limit. A free market solution where the bids of side chains increase when the ask increases scales much better imho.

Goverments can close gateways from there currency to Bitcoin. This will put a serious threshold on the value inflow Bitcoin now still experiences. If miners are having a hard time exchanging there bitcoins to other currencies to pay there electricity bills, Bitcoin is gonna face a difficult time surviving that.
