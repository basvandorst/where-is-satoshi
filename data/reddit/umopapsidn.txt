Median income != middle class

I'm just stating the classical archetypes. There's plenty of overlap. Successful self employment, freelancing, or specialized professions can get you there too. *Relying on* a paycheck makes you working class, breaking out of that but still needing an income makes you middle class (relatively high financial independence). 
We just live in a society (at least in the west) where the working class has most of the benefits and comforts of the middle class and the line's heavily blurred.

A degree of financial independence is middle class. If you rely on someone else paying you for your work, you're not quite there yet. 
Any credibility of your article went out the window by likening 200k income to a billionaire's level of wealth. 


Wealth, not income, is the driving force behind class. Classically, there's the poverty class(welfare dependent), the working class(employees), the middle class(employers), and the upper class(wealthy).

People at median income still live paycheck to paycheck. If they have a savings, it can't carry them very long. If they're laid off, their standard of living will take a significant hit. The average home isn't affordable (3x income) to someone at median income making property ownership out of reach. That's not middle class, that's firmly working class

It still is, but used to too.

They make more money so they get more back when taxes are cut. It's not rocket science. The change in brackets is actually much more significant at the lower ends unless you consider people making $65k rich.

1, then 10, then 11, then 100

I've been arguing against a flat tax and promoting a tax cut for the middle income population (the ones that pay the least currently and gain the most from the cut). I'd argue for 0 tax if it were reasonable but that's not going yo happen.
Also, my opinion is that the government isn't responsible for welfare, especially when it's at the expense of the middle  class. Tax cuts are the best possible thing a government can offer, especially since it comes with the implicit cost of reduced spending in the long run.

That makes absolutely no sense. Are you saying the middle class pays more for it by keeping more of their money?
Also, the concept of a deficit (which isn't great, but the spending increase isn't that drastic) isn't explicitly debt. Pretending a nation's broke because it's spending more than it makes that year or that pretending that a country ever has to reach 0 debt is absurd.

Flat taxes fuck over poor people massively. The new tax reform is actually in a solid place assuming the cuts become permanent/extended.  BTC treated as a commodity like stock is the best case we can hope for honestly.

It's literally less taxes for anyone that doesn't have a 750k+ house that can't afford it (by not having a 250k+ household income).
By claiming it hurts anyone else, you're being completely disingenuous. Spending on welfare traps is another animal.
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:05:10
So why is a flat tax a viable thing? All it does is make anyone not in the upper class (basically everyone that cant afford it) responsible for footing the bill, and the spending bill is another issue than the tax one.

Yeah it doesn't work. Unless you shut off immigration completely (in *and* out, good luck with that), offering welfare to all poor people in a flat tax system is a perfect way to destroy the nation's economy.
