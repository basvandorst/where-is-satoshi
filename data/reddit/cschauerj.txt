I was also on the fence, and just did the same.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:47:31
Wummm is correct.  I posted a link yesterday and it's already been removed. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:12:25
I don't agree w Greg much but he did tell me a couple days ago that he and his Company had no influence over the shitty (in my words) moderation here.  Guess he was right about that!
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:26:12
Real constructive.  At least he took the time to "argue" while you stay holed up in your protected environment here on refusing to acknowledge other points of view. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:29:56
No need to get nasty.  There's countless examples of the moderator removing posts and comments when they don't mesh with his beliefs.  You hear one side on this forum and it's unfortunate.  I'd be happy to post links to the proof you want but I'd then get banned myself.  Follow me over to r/btc and I'd be happy to discuss.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:15:18
Greetings again.  3 months have passed since this discussion fizzled out.  It's difficult to keep an open mind about this debate when it is clearly suppressed on this forum.  Nullc, you were kind enough to respond before...  how is this not a huge red flag to any rational person?   
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:17:30
What a joke.  They must have meant facilitating only those messages the moderator agrees with.  This forum is censored.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:44:23
Well 'taking the discussion elsewhere' really isn't an explanation, but your point is taken.
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:57:01
If the work is "open and in the public", and done so "transparently" then why the need to suppress discussion on this forum?  This question either remains unanswered here or lands a poster banned.  Again, how is this not a red flag?  You come across as sincere but this is the big elephant in room that supersedes every other detail, every other question.  It discredits the Core's position.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:00:48
How does Blockstream not "influence Bitcoin Core" if some of those developers are employed by Blockstream?  Wouldn't they then have a fiduciary obligation to Blockstream?
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:32:42
I'm in the same boat as you.
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:34:28
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:58:51
Is there a layman's way of describing why that is?
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:58:29
I understand that but it's there nonetheless.  It links right to bitcoin.org.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:53:38
thesilentwitness, I just sent you a private message with a link.  When I posted it here it got removed.  
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:32:37
Negative ghostrider
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:01:55
Well that's more forgiveable then someone such as yourself who's been around longer (or so you imply) AND is gullible.  How is it productive to chime in with the smart-ass comments?  Address the questions I asked.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:43:28
Yes but Segwit is DOA.  What's the alternative plan to scale in the short term?  As much as I don't like receiving unsolicited messages that one is accurate. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:58:47
Bitcoin has become very resilient:)  I do think that BU is one of the reasons many are still optimistic.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:50:28
While I disagree it's a good analogy I must admit.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:23:18
Thank you for the reply.  This probably factors into why it took my node so long to sync up to begin with.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:48:49
Well said!
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:41:52
It's called compromise.  See paganpan's post.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:49:13
This is speculative at best.  Could've labeled it the exact opposite and it would've made sense too.  
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:58:45
Has it ever occurred to you that not everybody with a differing opinion is a shill?  I dumped my savings into Bitcoin because I had faith in it.  What's your stake?!  Probably not much.  Yawn.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:51:19
In 20 years it very well could be however.  But the more important point is that "big blockers" aren't at all opposed to LN.   
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:07:18
That's some deep thinking right there.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:05:21
Might be so but why then do you spend your time on a bitcoin forum?  If I sold all my coins I'd never log on here again.  
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:29:54
I have read it.  And you should read Andrew Stone's reply.  Also Brian Armstrong seems to be of a different opinion than Charlie Lee.  Pretty sure he calls the shots there.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:43:02
Or to stimulate discussion on a topic the thought police here have "banned"
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:58:48
Gambling is immoral.  Unless the government is involved, then it's fine.  Hypocrites. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:01:09
Segwit didn't happen on it's own merits.  If so it would have happened last year. USAF supporters are delusional.  Only reason segwit is happening is cause the community is finally compromising.   
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:00:23
Crystal clear now.  Lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:30:25
Yes, and everyone else here is dilusional.  The euphoria is abt the compromise being made in the community, nothing to do w the core developers.  They've only hurt progress.  If the "2x" block increase doesn't happen as was agreed you will see the optimism disappear very quickly.  
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:32:55
I'm confused. Wasn't everyone celebrating Segwit being "locked in" a few weeks back? What's the difference?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:10:26
Geez!  Is there ever any serious discussion here anymore??  It's all b.s., memes, core propaganda... wtf
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:57:53
Yeah, that'll help for a few weeks...  Then we'll be back to square one because they'll ignore the fact that the great majority wanted to compromise and double the block size along with segwit implementation.
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:14:33
Yay!  I got a confirmation
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:02:54
lmao  Did someone ever print that on a t-shirt?
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:12:02
Sorry, I'm drinking:/  But I honestly posted this in a light-hearted state of mind. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:06:05
Seriously, I just spent an hour shopping around on Overstock.com and now my order is gonna get rejected.  Where's the utility in that?  
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:50:43
Um, the Bitcoin Cash crowd is about off-chain transactions too.  Win-win:)
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:11:34
Just bought a laptop through them.  The transaction went smoothly.  Maybe they've sorted out whatever was the issue?
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:53:13
Thanks for the informative replies fellas!  
Do you agree with or believe the censorship that goes on in this subreddit is necessary?  Or is it just accepted?  It hurts the credibility of this forum imo.  Why not allow discussion on a discussion post?  How would anything ever reach consensus if not allowed to be discussed to begin with?  I have a hard time connecting the dots between people supporting alternative methods of scaling and those supporting "altcoins", which is the rationale the moderators here use in blocking members (some very prominent in the Bitcoin community) and removing posts, comments, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:16:40
That makes no logical sense.  If you think it's going to zero you have nothing to lose trying to dump it.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:53:24
I'm confused.  Wasn't everyone celebrating Segwit being "locked in"  a few weeks back?  What's the difference?
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:37:04
I apologize.  I figured I was speaking to your level by using the same terminolgy as you in your post.
How it is any of us actually owns property in this country when the king comes around once a year and demands property tax?  Why does the government have the right to a chunk of my income if there is a better method.
With a consumption tax on everything except say unprepared food, you are somewhat volunteering to pay taxes.  You make conscious decisions in the things you buy and do not buy.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:03:27
Yes, It's clear by your grammer among other things, that you are not too bright.  This won't go anywhere.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:18:32
Income tax and property tax are theft.  A hefty sales tax/consumption tax would allow you to more or less voluntarily pay taxes.  And those w more income that choose to buy more and bigger toys contribute more to society.  Simple and fair.  So in conclusion, fuck you noeeel.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:43:03
So because he's not eloquent he's dismissed as a lunatic, a clown, an idiot??  He made valid points.  
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:04:26
It should not be but there is a clear correlation in the views between the moderator here and Core.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:48:56
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:34:40
Damn near empty because months and months of high fees and long confirmation times have chased away users!  Pretty counter-productive.  A hard fork for a modest block size increase has been "necessary" and the "best option" for some time now.   
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:55:21
Folks that support the "best devs" as you refer to  them, seem to ignore that even quoting the whitepaper on this sub gets your post deleted.  Hello, that should be your clue that core is NOT acting in the best interest of Bitcoin.  There's no other excuse for it.  
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:49:13
And bite my shiny metal ass
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:48:10
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:47:34
I'm guessing she's been a real disloyal bitch the last couple years.  Won't listen to reason, deceptive and no respect for the people who care about her?  I say dump her.  Her friend is hotter and she's the real deal.  The girl you've been dating is an imposter. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:47:31
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:28:54
That's awesome!  Congrats!  Sorry with the current  transaction fees the tequila was pricey:/  Keep the faith.  It will get worked out.
