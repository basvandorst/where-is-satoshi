Segwit is the car modification that enables new tech such as lightning. Lightning is the flux capacitor that allows the vehicle to teleport.

You're fine. I'm sure it'll get there way before you pay off your mortgage. ;)

It's too specialized and competitive to be profitable at this point, but if you banded together a large enough group of Chinese mimers, you could probably profit from an 51% attack.

The one and only of course. The knock-offs will just wither away and die.

It's highly dependent on location, but I heard that pan handling is on a rise and may overtake it soon, so you might want to diversify and do a little of both.

You can't have lightning without segwit though. It's a process.

r/bitcoin is a mixed bag. If you want better content, download the feedly rss app, search 'bitcoin',  select 'bitcoin websites', then follow the ones with interesting looking content. Done.

HODL first. Peer to peer currency comes with 'Lightning' later.

Don't use Coinjar, I think they charge about 5%. Use Independent Reserve, they only charge 0.5%, then transfer your bitcoins to a hardware wallet.

I think this thread explains it.

HODL first. Buy coffee with Lightning later.

Not if the alts are all centralized and mutable like ETH for example. The Blockchain applied to the Bitcoin protocol, that's immutable. I think with second layer solutions, Bitcoin can just implement new features on top also. I think it's easier for Bitcoin to add new features than it is for alts to gain as much of a network effect as Bitcoin.

Now's a good time to dump your bcash Mr. Nakamoto.

If you watch the trade history window on the right hand side of the video, you can see large buy orders getting filled.

Sydney based exchange, Independent Reserve to buy/sell, only 0.5% fee, Good security practices.

CEO Brian Armstrong..."When we speak with these institutions, they tell us that the number one thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely. his is why I’m excited to announce Coinbase Custody. The next step to accelerating the world’s adoption of digital currencies is to unlock the institutional money preparing to enter the space."

You're probably right. I'm not qualified to answer, but would a lightning powered Brave be out of the realm of reality?
