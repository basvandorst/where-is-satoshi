not interested in dustcoins. sorry

wait, yes and no. The transferee can *attempt* a double spend, but once a transaction is accepted by the network any further attempts to spend fail.    
I'd argue that ownership transfers after 1-6 confirmations of a transaction (statistically, probably 1-2 confirmations is more than enough)    
    
edit: i see that u/AcesAndEights21 did specify double spends within the same block. I might be wrong
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:50:14
not bad! CoinSierra isn't a bad name. Kind of like Amazon.    
It's also not a particularly good name... and your website needs designers.       
Check out some of the other markets that are being linked here. You should contact and collaborate with them. Or PM me. All i can contribute is btc and opinions ;p

It can, but we would need a much much more secure blockchain. When every networked device is a mining node, and we have the blockchain in orbit and on the moon
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:47:25
It was really surprising! Pleasantly surprising :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:13:12
nice! :)
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:41:25
dazzling :), but not really. The name won't succeed and the site needs a designer. If you are a VP of Product then you need to hire a marketing advisor
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:17:44
i agree that it feels like then, but past performance is no guarantee of future results....
We can be sure of one thing: mining difficulty will plateau if the usd/btc ratio doesn't increase    
Also, most of the market movers were on GOX. People around here like to ignore mtgox, but the fact is that volume has plummeted and everyone now is "waiting to see"    
Edit: to clarify, i mean trading volume
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:20:18
because THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS!. If you won't take the time to understand why this entire community knows satoshi's addresses, and why we'll know when they are spent, then you are uninformed, and you shouldn't be asking questions here. Use a search engine or start a new subreddet: r/PEOPLEWHOASKQUESTIONSWITHOUTRESEARCH

A broadcast transaction isn't fixed until a block is confirmed, and, before confirmation, a transaction can be received and sent again.    
So, ownership concludes at the moment of the initial transaction, but you can game the system and ownership is slippery?
@_date: 2014-05-12 03:17:55
I think it's pretty clear as long as the network is distributed. Realistically, irrevocable ownership occurs with the first confirmation.      
Coinbase, which i use, allows 0 confirmation transactions. So does Bitpay. If an entity has &gt;50% of the hashrate then they can confirm whatever they want, otherwise 1 seems to be enough, as far as i can tell    
    
edit: btc-e requires 6
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:15:04
You are so misinformed that it's painful.    
First, if you're serious, say "cryptocurrency", not bitcoin.    
And the rest of your post is so full of misunderstanding that it's insulting to this subreddit.    
Educate yourself. You don't even have to use google.com! bing.com, yahoo.com, any search engine will provide you with answers

It's alright. Like webcrawler was an alright search engine.    
Alright doesn't cut it. We need good. And bitmit was very good. Did you every transact on bitmit?
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:25:02
If you are serious and not trolling, (most posts here are from troll accounts, hence the hostility...) If you are serious about this, you need to research, duh! Are you so lazy that you post a question in a forum and expect an essay?!

IANAL, but your definitions need work.    
    
How about this:    
    
A Bitcoin is a unit of value that is divisible up to eight decimal places. Its divisibility can be adjusted by community consensus.    
Ownership of Bitcoin is recorded in a P2P ledger ("the blockchain") on the bitcoin network.    
Transferring ownership of Bitcoin requires a private key [only a private key, the public key is derived from it...]    
etc, now I'm tired of typing :) PM me if you really want to clarify the definition, or just do more research

It works in tails or any linux distro. How did you try it?    
    
EDIT: I have personally rolled keys with bitaddress in tails, so I'm sure it's possible
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:49:49
 is generally the best way. I don't use macs but all you need is a browser and a printer. Ideally you wouldn't do this with an online os.....
    
    
EDIT: it's an open source project here:    
EDIT2: Although I think this is the best option, it is NOT the most user friendly. Electrum provides a good balance.

I'm a pessimist. I don't have too much hope for humanity. I think cryptocurrency might help lessen the suffering of the underprivileged.    
Though understanding crypto requires an education...fuck it. Let's just surrender and accept that Africa will have starving children who are conscripted into armies, and we'll all be in the same situation after the next meteor impact

I'll check them out, but none of those domain names are going to go mainstream    
     
And the sites themselves need work. Bitmit was so gloriously simple. :(
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:06:22
I'm not trying to insult you. That isn't an offline setup.    
You want an offline wallet?    
    
1. get some dice. get a hundred, from a hundred different brick-and-mortar vendors. (This will require some travel, but it'll be worth it!)    
    
2. roll a private key with the dice. Do it a bunch of times, and average the results. I recommend rolling the hundred dice *at least* a hundred times each.    
    
3. send your btc to the address you've rolled. Yeah! Perfect cold wallet.     
    
...    
    
Oh, you also want to spend those coins? Ok, NOW IT'S NOT OFFLINE OR COLD.    
    
There are many good ways to have a secure hot wallet. You may not have learned enough yet...and I don't mean that with condescension. I'm not trying to insult you
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:20:17
a wallet means a group addresses.    
An offline wallet is one or more offline addresses. You can only transfer from an offline address once. Transferring from it means it's no longer offline, 'cause you have to use an online machine to transfer!   
You may not entirely understand the concept of hot and cold wallets, change addresses etc.    
Just be careful trying to be too secure without understanding what security is. When i started with cryptocurrency I made a bunch of very expensive mistakes (sad to think of now, but can you imagine that I lost thousands of btc before when I was trying to be clever and forgot about change addresses??)
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:27:01
libertard coiner :)    
Does that term apply to anyone who appreciates the potential of cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:30:08
I'm busy. Here's my last comment(and please understand that I'm trying to be helpful):    
You are asking for help on a public forum.    
You have demonstrated ignorance about security.   
You are attacking those who give good advice.    
You need to rethink your approach.    
   
Either listen to those who answer your questions, or stop asking questions.    
Good luck

I live in NY too. Give it time. I expect street vendors to adopt bitcoin first...         
btw, I was shopping online for a real padlock today, and the site I arrived at accepted btc! out of the blue :) very cool
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:51:23
haha. but of course names are very important for widespread adoption. Can you imagine if bitcoin was called browndollars, or NONcents??
