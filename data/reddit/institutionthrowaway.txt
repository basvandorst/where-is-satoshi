I'd say yes, but it slower when everything is going down. Higher ups care less about fast tracking things if they think they will lose money

The current standard is no different than the usual documentation for general financial interactions. We dont have agencies breathing down our neck demanding anything right now. But we keep everything standard and above board.

I think the ETF will be pretty helpful to the ecosystem, which is a pretty obvious take. I think that we are probably 6-9 months away from approval, but who knows that can change quickly. I think the big issues are the unregulated nature of the spot market (BTC) and how those unregulated and foreign markets could upset US investors. Bitmex liquidations for some crazy risky player can drop the market a bunch, and that scares regulators.
I dont know how much I believe in BTC whales manipulating the market. BTC is massive and there are too many moving parts in this market for someone to manipulate regularly and on their own. Alt coins with smaller caps? Manipulation is pretty obvious most of the time.

I'd say anything which would clarify the regulatory side of things. ETFs is an easy answer, but honestly just knowing the rules of OTC trading would be massive, and potentially open up a lot of doors in the industry

The days are pretty much non stop. Crypto never sleeps! There are shifts in our 24 hour operation, so the start is always getting to assess the position and current status as the shifts change.

I think it can have a very interesting effect in the sense of the liquidity of value across the globe. I dont think itll effect high level finance as much, but things like allowing people to expand to previously risky areas will be huge. I think it will the the tide that floats all boats rather than some sort of catapult

The liquidations on bitmex cause cascading effects to other exchanges. When the liquidation engine goes, it moves the price on bitmex and its a big enough move that it bleeds to the other exchanges as well

The best way is to probably have a financial background and jump in to a smaller firm. There are some crypto firms which are lacking in traditional financial knowledge.

Tough question since this space can change so fast and is pretty irrational. If things stay the same, bearish until some more demand gets drummed up. Probably going to need a retail boom to precede the institutional boom. I could see it exploding at a random time. But probably not until there is a small catalyst, and what that could be i have no idea!

I havent researched this particular site or group, but I'd love to take this opportunity to preach caution in the space. I work professionally here and I still dont use personal cash to do anything more than apply what i feel comfortable with losing.
File anything you put into crypto to busting in 5 years. Dont put anything you cant live without. Its a rough space and can burn you. Be smart! Id love for you to invest in what you believe in, but being productive with your funds should always be paramount to hype

Great question. And way after the AMA but I wanted to circle back to it regardless.
I think the thing I wanted to talk about the most (and the reason I did the AMA) was that there are some notions about 'institutional' money i wanted to dispel. 
There are some serious, operational, non sexy reasons more places arent trading right now. Those are securing funds, KYC/AML practices, exchange funding for fiat, and hedging opportunities. These are all things that require more robust financial products and regulation to occur. Without them, even the biggest firms are just buying crypto and hoping it goes up. Not sustainable, and not an easy sell when you are down 50% from ATH.
Growing the space in other ways and waiting for the go ahead from regulators will be big. Side note, fuck Bitmex, their liquidations are why you see huge swings every day

Uh bots seems like we arent making decisions ourselves, but its probably a bit more nuanced. We have humans trading leveraging software which can properly place orders in ways that would be too time consuming for a person to do by hand. But not much is just algorithmic or autonomous 
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:08:09
Its a long term strategy 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:03:58
the OTC market right now is pretty small. Right now most trading is on exchanges obviously. When the regulation gets sorted out the OTC market will be much more liquid. No good answer right now

Interesting question. I unfortunately have little exposure to foreign markets since I am entirely focusing on US side of things. I'd say in euro Slovania and Estonia and Luxemborg are all frequent places I have interacted with. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:18:49
I think the US tends to lead the way on regulation. I bet it wont hurt to cooperate at an international level and it could certainly move things along, but i expect the US to do their own thing regardless
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:07:04
I think that it will take a few large steps from US regulators. First, they need to iron out when coins will be rules commodities or securities. Right now the consensus is that BTC and ETH are commodities. The problem is, you need the SEC, CFTC and all kinds of different regulators to get on the same page.
I think what needs to happen is to create a FINRA like entity, which would be a self regulator for the major exchanges which could help them all be on the same page too, and establish a singular regulator devoted to the space.

Yeah I am working with the mods over on but I will post here as well. 
I like that everyone is so excited for the ETF! It helps get people who arent used to finance get a bit more info on subjects. But sometimes it backfires and causes more misinformation (ie Futures FUD)
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:47:23
Would the subreddit be interested in some sort of AMA? I am considering it if people are interested. I have some experience currently working for a US institution which is trading and might be able to offer some insights into the space

Ive spoken to some mods, I am going to go for 12EST on Thursday!
