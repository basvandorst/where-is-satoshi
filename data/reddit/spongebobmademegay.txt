The only problem is the amount of time that it takes to propagate the transaction in the block chain. If a customer makes a purchase but does not attach a transaction fee, it may take a long time to show up in the block chain.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:30:27


lol, this speaks to me. I am one of the stupid college kids who bought bitcoin with student loan money (more than tripled it btw). I have been trying to day trade alt-coins lately. First I tried to analyze all the details of each coin to determine which ones had a market advantage. That turned out to be a horrible strategy. So I started just buying whatever coins had the nicest, most consistent graph. At this point I am just throwing money at things and I have no idea what I'm doing but shit, it's working! I guess it's hard to make bad investments when most coins are doubling in value every 4-5 days.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:35:31
bitcoin is the slowest alt-coin too. If we all used worldcoin, you wouldn't even need a payment processor when at a restaurant.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:07:13
Bitcoin's 10 minute block time makes an attack computationally expensive. 
* Block time = amount of time required to "guess" a password.
* Hash rate = the amount of computational power trying to guess said password at any moment. Password difficulty is adjusted to hashrate, setting a target blocktime of 10 minutes.
* forking = two miners discover the password at almost the exact same time. Both the new block attach to the block chain. Which ever one gets mined first continues the block chain while the other is just a dead end.
* orphans = blocks on an unused fork (transaction still get processes though in some other block)

Is bitcoin not run by get-rich-quick impulses? I wouldn't brush off alt-coins so quickly. Because everything is open source, all improvements made to the bitcoin protocol can/are copied and improved upon and tweaked in other alt-coins. This market is just completely absurd in general.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:57:55
This article says that bitcoin could, at most, be sped up by a factor of 10. That is still 4 min transaction times which in a day to day sense, is quite slow, and would require an intermediary. Some of the improvements listed would require a fork, which essentially means it would be a completely different currency.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:47:00
the integrity of the proof-of-work system is dependent on encryption to prevent double spending. The reason that the block is encrypted is to make it computationally expensive to attack. If it takes 10 minutes for 10,000 computers to break a password, then the odds that a bad actor can confirm x number of blocks in a row is greatly decreased. BUT the point I was trying to make is that past a certain point, the length of time required to decrypt the block becomes overkill. For example, the odds of a super computer 51% attacking bitcoin are like 1:1x10^20, but the odds of a super computer attacking worldcoin, which has a 15 sec block time is like 1:1X10^14 which is still ridiculously small and, practically speaking, equally unlikely. Its a balancing act between the number of nodes, hashrate, and the block time that gives the coin security. In terms of probability, it would be virtually impossible to 51% any of the top 10 crypto currencies, regardless of block time because of the enormous hashrate and number of nodes.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:22:26
On the one hand, a market crash would see the riskiest assets lose the most. Bitcoin is a risky muthafuckin asset. On the other hand, if banks failed and needed and the economy need a monetary boost, bitcoin would fly in anticipation of inflation. And if the banks tried to seize assets directly from people's accounts as was the case with Cyprus, bitcoin would also soar to be highs. But I don't think anyone really knows at this point...

There are many ways to buy bitcoin but there is trade-off between time and price. You can have bitcoin in the next 10 minutes if you are not concerned with paying 10% above market value using localbitcoins.com or btc-e with your credit card. Or you can wait a couple weeks to go through the bank verification process at coinbase. campbx is pretty much only accepting money orders, unless you want to take the time to be KYC compliant which is going to take some time.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:42:05
if you live near a bank of america, you could have bitcoins in your digital wallet within 10 min. (if the bank is open lol). visit bitfloor.com, make an account, click "deposit", select bank of america and the amount you wish to deposit, take the account number you are given and go to the bank, deposit the money, get back online, sign into bitfloor, you will see the money you just deposited instantaneously, click on "trade", its pretty self explanatory for there.

I love this question, and I love how you said "when" instead of "if."
If you look at the stock market right now, you would see that the amount of stock purchase with borrowed money as a percentage of GDP just hit an all time high. The entire global financial system is based on government and central bank issued debt. And to top it off, interest rates have never been lower. Not to mention China's real estate bubble. In short, the global economy is looking sketchy right now, but the Dow has never been higher. I think its fair to assume that at some point in the future, the cheap money (debt) that's fueling the economy right now is going to cause some problems.
If that were to happen, what to expect from bitcon in terms of price performance? Well, considering that a market crash with mean total chaos, bailouts or bail-ins as we saw in Cypress. People would be looking for a solid store of value that no government or banking cartel could touch or manipulate. That's why I think it's fair to assume that if there were a banking collapse, the price of Bitcoin would skyrocket to levels we could have never imagined. The only way that Bitcoin could reach a value of $100,000 is if $100,000 bought you a lot less than it does today. We would be talking complete global financial catastrophe the likes of which have never been seen before. It would be biblical, and many of us would get insanely rich, and many many more people would suffer incredible hardship

I'd rather have a "house of cards" than the government's dirty hands in the blockchain. But also, Paul Volker has never heard of bitcoin?! Does this man live under a rock? It's shit like that that really discredits conspiracy theories. Maybe the government really is just misinformed and incompetent and nobody is driving this train.

I didnt have to pay any fees, I just had to wait 11 hours for bitfloor to send my .5 BTC to my wallet.

The fact that bitcoin a complicated technological financial instrument is the reason that us nerdy non-wallstreet bankers have been able to make so much money. Many of us on this subreddit actually have a better understanding of bitcoin than most the old ass white dudes running the economy. Now *that's* crazy.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:37:00
Holy shizzah. Bro I had the same problem as you, I've been freaking out all day. My transfer finally arrived. It took 11 hours sweet Jesus.

The last 2 bubble/spikes were about 8x bigger than the previous bubble's high. My guess is a pop if Bitcoin hits $2000-ish in a very very short period of time...

N000000b. It's OK most people here have ignored the "dont panic sell" advice at some point and got burned. Just don't make that stupid mistake again.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:15:34
thank god it dropped! the pressure was building way way way too fast. If you think that a stock should just keep climbing with out any dips, you have obviously never looked at a damn price graph. When the slope of the curve goes into full retard mode, something is wrong.

I am 100% in it for the long haul. If the price crashes, I'm going down with the ship. I have no plans to sell.

Well we have quite a few items so I just wanted a method of updating all the prices on a page every minute or so with AJAX. I was planning setting up a merchant account with bitpay in a couple weeks, i see that they have a bitcoin price variable I can access. I'll probably just build the AJAX price updating framework first then swap it out for the bitpay variable later...
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:02:40
I think that the long run fundamentals totally favor bitcoin. The global bond market is set to collapse at some point and everything else will collapse with it. The lack of liquidity will cause bitcoin to soar. Spartans hold on this one.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:33:09
No, all I have is my wallet number, I've been trying to find a transaction number but I've had no luck. I searched my wallet number on blockchain.info and it showed my past transactions but not the one I'm missing :/

If a "magic the gathering" trading site can become the world's largest bitcoin exchange, anything is possible.

that does not look legit.

Interesting. Does this mean that the block target can be made even shorter? What kind of trade offs would this imply? And is if the block time were shortened, would it be backwards compatible?

i am really pissed at bitfloor, i tried to send .5 bitcoin to my wallet and they claim to have sent it but it hasnt shown up yet and its been 12 hours. Good riddance.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:52:33
you are asking a question that literally no human being knows the answer to. It only costs about $5 to transfer money and place a trade with bitfloor. Maybe you should buy half now and half later. Or 1/3 now, 1/3 later, and 1/3 later later.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:28:07
The fact that everyone thinks it is going to crash indicates that it will likely not crash in the same pattern that we've seen before. Things are clearly very different this time.

Localbitcoins.com is very safe for buyers if you do a deposit. Unfortunately the banks are closed today. But localbitcoins.com also gives you the option to purchase in person.

global GDP is about $70 trillion. The global derivatives market is a little more than $1 quadrillion. When you look at the derivatives market, you realize that crazier things happen in the economy. I think it is entirely possible that bitcoin could reach that kind of market cap, highly unlikely, but entirely possible.
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:59:02
yeah I only lost .5 bitcoin, but at today's prices, thats a good chunk of money

were you going bitfloor to blockchain as well?

One thing I've noticed about these exchanges, if you tweet them enough they will respond
