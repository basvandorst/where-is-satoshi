So you'd rather have a central group of people regulate what Bitcoin is or isn't?

If I had a stack of ASIC boxes in my office chugging down $$$/day in power, along with the AC to keep them from melting, you can be damn sure I'd be turning them off when the electricity's too much.

Ah, so reading up on the target value:
* The BTC network tries to have a new block every 10 minutes.
* The network adjusts the "target" value which is used in the difficulty calculation to try to keep the every-10-minutes value flowing.
* If enough ASICs shut down, this drives the difficulty down, opening up opportunities for folks like me to take my scrypt altcoin GPU rig and point it at BTC instead for some quick coin.
OK, fair enough. Worst case if BTC doesn't come up for a while is the world reverts to where the scrypt altcoins are. Transactions continue, the market doesn't seize.

Right, so then they close up shop. Who verifies transactions then?

So in other words, "too big to fail".
When a bank pops, money disappears from the system, and so does too when it's a BTC exchange. Major economic busts like this are like forest fires in that they're ultimately helpful in the ecosystem (see also [this blog post about "growthism" vs capitalism]( ).
Unfortunately, it really really sucks to be a chipmunk stuck in a tree in that forest when the fire starts.
