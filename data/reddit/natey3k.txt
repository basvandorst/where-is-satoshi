Bitcoin inflates and deflates massively every day. That's kind of its thing

I don't understand how these work. Did you just give OP $3?

I need to do an Original Oratory (8-10 minute memorized, scripted speech) and I chose the topic Bitcoin! Thank you for this, I've been stuck on specific ideas for my speech!

Seriously, how do people have these gifs ready on hand?

In Bitcoin, I presume?

Thanks for the link! Now I can get into an argument with more evidence than "this one guy posted on reddit" to someone that hates reddit! 
No sarcasm, seriously, thanks

Nice job on shopping "...coin" in the top on the last picture, it made me think that it was a new episode. That's why I'm in the comment section...

I got $4 from you sexy motherfuckers

Sorry, I tipped all the money I was given (don't feel bad, it was $3.24) and I didn't realize there was a transaction fee. Well, good luck and thank you for the opportunity to have a 14 guy casually cruising the internet give to a cause that's worth giving. Like I said before, now I can say "You know that tragedy in Washington? Yeah, I directly supported them in **Bitcoin**"
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:08:21
Then how does OP redeem said $3?
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:43:04
Then e what do you suggest? BlackBerry? ***lel***
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:37:22
Thank you very much, kind stranger!
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:38:36
Thank you, kind internet friend! This is better than someone buying me gold!

A little while ago, someone tipped me ~$4 of Bitcoin on reddit. Will me calling in the Bitcoin tip bot help you guys out? It's not much, but I have no use for it and I don't want it to go to waste. I don't mine or heavily into Bitcoin, I just find it interesting. I don't have a Bitcoin address
I'm just wondering if I tip you guys via the Bitcoin tip bot through the comments, will that be able to go to you guys?
Good luck out there!

Is this an episode of Archer?

Is this for real? I've always been skeptical of the "honor the family name" thing in eastern culture, and with 'samurai' in there, it's hard to tell if you're serious or not.
