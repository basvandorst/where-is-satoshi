It is a very risky "investment". I am not educated on bitcoin, but my ignorant perception as someone of the general public is there are so many different types of crypto currency, then what are the chances that bitcoin or any of the other ones available in the early stages of crypto, be the one that becomes widely adopted by the public in the next decade or so?  I admit I don't know much, but these are just the types of thoughts that would go through the head of a lot of random people, making them scared to invest.

I was forced into getting 10k in bitcoin since it was only way I could get money off a poker website.  It dropped 10% since they paid me out which is kind of annoying.  If I did not need the money (I dont) am I better off just holding and waiting for recovery and sell anytime over the next few months??  I really know nothing about bitcoin, only just looked at a price chart for first time today.

most poker websites really pushing using only bitcoin for deposit and withdrawal.  thats how I ended up with 10k in coin that I dont know what to do to get money from it, sitting on block chain.

I needed the truck for my business. It was the cheapest new truck on the lot, in Canada, GMC Sierra.  I kept buying $3000 trucks that would get 5-10,000 km and crap out and have a $2000 repair, but the truck isn't worth $2000 at that point, so repeat.  Since I don't do my own repairs, its a crap shoot buying used for a business vehicle, you can get lucky or very easily screwed.
