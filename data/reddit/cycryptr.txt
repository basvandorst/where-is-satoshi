Nah, Coinbase is the one funding the miners. What, did you think bitcoin is created from nothing? /s

They are not including any transactions for the blocks that they are mining. They are taking the 12.5 BTC coinbase transaction reward, without providing the service of including transactions (though they are at least hardening previous transactions by adding another block). 
Either their pool is screwed up (given it's been over 12 hours of this, I'd expect a tweet or something on their announcement page), or they are attacking bitcoin by intentionally increasing the mempool, which can be seen to have sky rocketed since yesterday: [

Plenty of time has passed before each of their empty blocks: [

We're talking about only a 1-2% loss here. Transaction fees are currently nothing compared to the coinbase fee they are taking without providing a service, so yeah, it's selfish, in case you're still wondering the answer to your question.

They are not gaining as much money as they would be if they were including transactions. They are missing out on transaction fees, which is like 0.1 - 0.2 BTC. Not much compared to the 12.5 they are getting from the block reward.

Bgold is off somewhere premining.

Yes, absolutely! What this looks like in the end is up in the air. Could have an "export" button that allows you to back up your macaroons at any time. Then using an "import" button to use on another device. Not the best user experience. 
I like the idea of making it completely login-less, but the alternative is having a decentralized log in system that is linked to your storage account (like Blockstack does with Gaia hubs), but I don't like what Blockstack is doing. There's some bitcoin based decentralized identity work going on that could allow linking to a data hub much like how Blockstack works, so that they could store their macaroons somewhere. 
In the end, I may just allow a hybrid approach so that users CAN remain anonymous but if you want to use on multiple devices without 'import/exporting' then you need to use some log in type of system.
Just spit balling here, random though, but maybe a c-lightning plug in or something that keeps a database on the side of a node just for the owner's data - since a node is essentially a server anyways.

I think what I'm referring to is the 1099-K? Is that IRS reporting still triggered only by going over $20k in sales?

Thanks! Looking forward to trying out.

How do the whole tax / reporting thing work? 
I know for awhile some companies publicly stated they didn't report unless you go over $20k. Is that still the case (in the industry) and/or is that applied to River too?

Thank you!

Thanks, yeah I don't have many opened right now, I'll spend this weekend finding some good channels to connect to.
