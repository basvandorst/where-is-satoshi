sir, you are wrong af. the state of mining computational power gives it the intrinsic value. among other qualities of owning the coin itself. the power is in those that own the coin and those wiling to accept it. it is no different than stock. 
you smugly keep mentioning 1’s and 0’s as though a stock cannot be shaken down and explained away in the same way. At the end of the day a company shared on the stock market is only a bunch of people and hardware capital working together to stimulate exchange of value. your use of the word intrinsic is simply weighted on your faith in the stock market and not in crypto, which is madly incorrect.

...so when they dump, they lose that dominance right? they own 60% but after multiple dumps they own less and less right? I’m not getting the conspiracy.

this is like when i used to vape(no longer do) and my mom kept harping on the fact “they are known to explode” among other fud that was going around at the time. she sent me an article one day about a guy that had his explode in his pocket and burned up his leg. I sent her an article about cellphones exploding and that silenced her real quick. never got flack about vape from her again.
