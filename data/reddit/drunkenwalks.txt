Great article digdug. You cover the issues around bitcoin as money very well, and I'd recommend others read it even if they haven't seen any of Gary North's articles.

I was thinking of checking scores yes. You would need to know who you are extending credit to and how high risk they were. Regarding instant access/instant loans. To make the process (once approved) instant seems pretty easy actually. You are essentially just spending out of a web wallet. You would probably want to put bitcoin scattered among many addresses in relatively small amounts and as a user requests purchases you make the payments from some set of those, which get attributed to the debt of the user. 
It would certainly require some engineering effort to make it all work seamlessly, but would nothing more challenging what is already being done.
For the app you really would just be requesting that the company send a payment in bitcoin somewhere, and then settling up with the company later.
The difference with BTCJam is that I want this to eliminate the scariness of starting to use bitcoin. With BTCJam you still need to actually manage these coins, borrow them ahead of time, figure out how wallets work, worry about security, etc. What I'm suggesting eliminates that for the extreme newbie. 
BTCJam also looks it requires the repayment to be in BTC. This is scary enough for me to avoid it because what if the price of BTC suddenly goes through the roof? By converting the debt immediately in USD you avoid the risk of short term volatility and if the company/group loaning bitcoin wants to hedge against the price going up they can replenish whatever they loan out. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:29:17
I understand that risk assessment of a particular borrower is a non-trivial problem. However I think that this is something that would not be a real impediment since as you have pointed out people are already doing loans in bitcoin, and more over the loans being essentially in USD makes me think that this is something that could be figured out pretty easily by anyone already working with loans/credit cards. 
It would eliminate scariness by not requiring you to handle or hold the bitcoin yourself. You don't incur any risk (as the user) of your bitcoin being worthless suddenly or that it will be stolen from you because you don't know how to set up a cold storage system. Those are the "scary" things I was referring to. 
RE: BTCJam. That is awesome, I'm glad to hear it.

The heat resistance of the crypto cards is really cool. Being destruction resistant is a great feature. But, bit-cards have the advantage of cool backgrounds (custom even). Plus, they are something like 1/3 the cost of the crypto cards, while still being very well made (I bought some of the originals).

People know who he is, where he works and lives. So yeah, he should be a little worried. Maybe no one will do anything, and lets hope. But if I were him... well if I were him I'd just be straight with people about wtf is going on. But baring that, might be a good time to hire a body guard with all those profits. 
I doubt a bitcoiner would go so far as to kill him.. but a hard punch in the face? From someone who has a lot in gox? That is something I could see happening.

You are wrong. Not only do you play both ends against him (or more specifically the anti-regulation preference), as if both libertarians (against forced self-sacrificing) and those who would hope for a bail out must both agree with you some how. 
Not everyone who has lost money would so readily abandon their ideals in order to get it back. And you insult us all, and speak to your own character, by suggesting that we would.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:52:38
This is correct. I forget where I saw it exactly, but I think it was one of the presentations one of the trezor guys gave this year. They said, or their slides said, that the way they generate the actual seed is a combination of the seed words and the user supplied pin, such that using a different pin number with the same seed words will yield a different set of addresses. 
So, you could very easily put some small amount of bitcoin in your safety wallet and if a robber of any sort wants to take it you could provide the alternate pin number and have plausible deniability. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:30:51
I know that BitPay's terms of service explicitly rule out use for selling controlled substances, and I'm guessing coinbase has the same sort of issue. It seems like directly using one of the main guys is unlikely to be doable because of this. And essentially comes down to the same problem as when dealing with actual banks.
If they have a bank account associated with the business you might be able to accept bitcoin directly and setup something to automatically sell it on an exchange and then transfer the money back to the business bank account. 
An alternative that may or may not actually work would be if employees accepted payment in bitcoin, and then used something like coinbase or whatever to turn that into USD (or not as they choose). I don't know if they would be cool with that or not, but at least it is not explicitly forbidden as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:09:32
Since I was really only talking about loaning coins, but immediately converting the debt into USD some of this does not apply at all. But what does apply seems to be summarized when you said: 
"Your loanee could walk away and you would have little to no recourse."
However, in this case we are thinking about it like a credit card company. You would know who your loanee is, and would have the same recourse that they do. They owe you USD (I'm thinking in terms of the US but obviously this would extend to other places) and so you can exert plenty of legal pressures on them to get them to pay. You do, after all, know who they are. These are not anonymous loans.
I think your big fears of scammers miss my suggestion that the debt is held in USD. How would this be any more of a scam than a credit card? Nothing I said relates in any way to fractional reserve banking. If you prefer think of it as instant bitcoin purchases with deferred payment with interest.  In this way the only difference between this an coinbase or Circle is that the bitcoin purchased is sent to the merchant at purchase time instead of held in your online wallet, and the deferral is for a longer period of time, but with interest charged to mitigate that risk somewhat.

Just bought a book and video game with bitcoin on Overstock. I had them picked out and in my shopping cart on amazon, no need for that now! Way to go overstock, making the future happen.
Looks like they are using coinbase for the payment processing.

I have one too and I get why there isn't much to talk about, but I very strongly disagree with your negative feelings. 
The reason there's not much to say is because I JUST WORKS PERFECTLY. It does what it needs to do and it does it flawlessly. The web ui is simple, but it offers up all the basic functionality you would need and considering it is replacing cold storage with paper wallets I think its pretty fucking nice. 
If you don't like the web ui then you can use any other wallet that supports BIP32. The fact that a hardware wallet was able to come out supporting this before so many other soft wallets support it is just ridiculous, but really not the trezor guys' fault.

I saw it down there, but I waited. I expected prices to go down more after the news was more widely reported. Instead, Gox runs and bitcoin prices go up! Seriously I need to stop underestimating the honey badger.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:17:55
I can't quite figure out if they are storing the private key on the card (as they say) or if they are storing some seed that is used for generating private keys/addresses. If it is just the private key, encrypted obviously, then what happens to change? 
In either case it looks like the only thing the card itself it doing is providing a convenient way to carry around a qr code. So yeah paying $17 for that does seem a little pricey.

Enforcement can ride on the back of the fact that debt is kept in USD instead of BTC. And the two big differences from btcjam is that 
(1) (just mentioned) debt is kept and repaid in USD. 
(2)  Loans are on-demand and paid out to a merchant (i.e. used for spending in the moment) and this process would not require a person to first take out a loan, wait for approval for that loan, then transfer to a wallet, then pay a merchant. The difference here is the same as between a credit card company (on demand loans paid to merchant) and a bank (long term loans you take out and do with as you will, but with a long wait between application and receipt).
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:42:05
I hope this works out well for them. I would have probably thought just going with bitcoin would be a better choice. That said, having something like a 'government backed' crypto-currency should at least be interesting.

Tried it out on testnet, seems pretty great! I've got a couple of questions. Do you support 24 word seeds? I entered one (just made it up by repeating words from other seeds) and it seemed to load a new wallet, but does it do this in a way that means I can move between this and other HD wallets with longer seeds? 
I also noticed that when restoring an identity I get some surprises: my "permanent identity" in the lobby changes and I have to hit refresh in order to reconnect to the gateway. 
Despite this I really like the way the wallet looks and feels, I can't wait for the full release. Thanks!

Minus the 21 and Bitcoin aspect this idea was being used in a paper published a while back, I don't know if this is a really common example or not. 
But the idea was that you can achieve optimal (in some sense) equilibrium between two (or more) selfish agents through side payments which allow them to come to an agreement over limited resources in an automated way.
All of that is to say, the automatic intelligence side of things has been worked out for this sort of thing to work in theory. The barrier has been trust-less micro-payments between autonomous agents, and self-driving cars. Looks like those are disappearing in the near future.

I think it is even more insidious than that. I think they plan on patent trolling businesses like coinbase out of existence. Seems pretty straightforward if they get the patent. Clearly any business that deals with bitcoin is infringing it, and so must pay royalties large enough to make running the business no longer profitable. 
This is how they kill bitcoin in the US and EU (because you better believe that will be the next step).

@_date: 2013-11-27 20:56:21
That's not the *worst* strategy. But the problem is that there is no telling when a drop will occur or how big it will be. So you could end up "waiting for it to drop" while it goes up past $2000. Or it could drop 50% tomorrow. There's a lot of volatility and so no one can say for certain.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:30:03
Love the idea and would buy. Biggest concern are the fees. As others have pointed out if merchants are charged 1-3% when I use this, and then I am also charged similar %, then it feels both painful and mean (painful to me and mean to the merchants), where as I'd rather it either be painful or mean instead of both. Also, I'm not sure it would *really* take the place of things like gyft if the fees are high because gyft essentially discounts your purchases. So a 2% fee on purchases is more like a 5% difference from gyft. 
I'd rather pay more for the card upfront and have lower fees than get the card for cheap and have higher fees, just my 2c.

Complete newbie here, and trying to understand what is going on. I read through some of the explanations and think I have a basic idea: 
MasterCoin's, built on top of the bitcoin protocol, and allow a whole range of additional features from the savings/guardian addresses to the exchange of property deeds through mastercoins as a new special currency? Is that roughly true at a very high level?
Obviously I'll need to read through a lot more to get a full understanding, but it seems like all of these features could already be done in bitcoin (well I guess obviously since this is built on bitcoin), so then what is the point of creating the separation between MasterCoin's and bitcoin? Aren't all of these features just special types of transaction scripts? Why is the Exodus address even needed?
I think the ideas of what you can do with this sound really interesting, but I guess I'm confused as to why it would need to be done in this way. Thanks for any insight you can provide!
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:56:52
Isn't this the point of the encrypted private key? As long as you use a reasonably strong passphrase, then you don't really even need to trust them because they never see the unencrypted private key.
This looks awesome, I just bought a couple of them myself. How long did it take for you to get this?

Just tried it out. Actually pretty fun. It looks like all the games, which are knock offs of well known games like battleship and monopoly can be played either for free or with a buy in and that the winner gets the pot (which I'm guessing depends on the buy in amount). 
But even for free the pot is non-zero, so if I'm going to play a mindless game, I might as well play one with zero cost and a chance to win a few fractions of a cent while I'm at it. 
Two things I'd mention after trying it out:
1) In one of my games there was some sort of bug or lag or something that caused me to not be able to do anything until my turn timer ran out, so I essentially lost a turn. But this only happened once so far.
2) The cash-out threshold is pretty high, which means you've got to either actually play non-free versions to earn enough to cash out, or play a ton of games (and win).
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:55:17
So you talked to the owner. Can you tell us anything else you found out? Such as, how did he find out about bitcoin and what led him to decide to accept it? Might help in convincing others. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:29:41
This is true, but it ignores some of the details that make it less problematic. I don't disagree with your statement, but just think that in practice things are not quite so dire.
First, you'd need to double spend and then get the hell out of there. For most internet purchases the company can just not deliver the product until confirmations occur, so this mainly would be an issue for in person transactions. So the point I'm making here is that the 'customer' needs to spend and then leave pretty quickly, otherwise the store would find out they had just been robbed and take action against the thief. 
Second thing is that credit cards are even worse for this 'double spend' issue because a person can dispute a charge and cause a charge back days after the original charge is made, meaning that the uncertainty about actually getting the money lasts much much longer than if receiving payment in bitcoin. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this though.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:16:46
If your money is in bitcoin and you want to spend at Stop &amp; Shop then you have to pay some third party in order to do so. Perhaps he'd rather pay a gift card company that supports bitcoin than a bank?

This. 
We do know that 95% of the coins were, by design, to be mined within 6 months. By comparison, we are 4+ years into bitcoin being mined and only half of the coins have been mined. 
There is no way to slice it other than Quark will have heavier concentrations on the early adopters, if you consider the coin release schedule curves it is just absurd. While at the same time the early adopters of bitcoin actually took much greater risks and investments into an unknown/untrusted idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:34:15
This does worry me. But I would put the likelihood a very low. That said, this worry is one of the reasons I've bought multiple cards. I can keep the balance on any one card low and thus reduce the chance of losing all my money substantially. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:40:15

This seems meaningful. I don't know what it means, but the feeling I'm getting is that many people have been rushing in to buy this morning because of some of these news stories suggesting that the congressional meeting will be somewhere between neutral towards pro bitcoin. So regular people have been buying in as much as they can through the easiest entry point (coinbase). 
This is pretty exciting to me because it seems like it indicates a lot more adoption by 'regular' people (or regular speculators), but I can't shake the feeling that we are overdue for a rather large correction.

I remember reading at some point that it will have the option to wipe the device after a certain number of incorrect PINs are tried. What about another option to allow there to be a special PIN that wipes the device and resets to a new random seed. 
My thinking is deniability. If I refuse to unlock a trezor for you, then you know I have money on it and might be inclined to compel me to unlock it. However, in such a situation if I can simply enter my wipe PIN and it appears to unlock but with an empty balance (because it has changed to a new seed and wiped the existing keys) then it is quite difficult for anyone to establish if I've just wiped it or if it was simply empty to begin with. 
Just an idea of a feature that I think would be cool.

I read the article. Who is this John Lyons (author) asshole and what role does he play at Microsoft? The wording is also extremely inflammatory. He essentially tries to connect Bitcoin to child pornography and terrorism. Talk about the one two punch, jesus.
He then suggests the two ways of dealing with the problem are to (1) outlaw alt. currencies like bitcoin and (2) confiscate the proceeds [of online crime]. 
Based upon [this]( I can't really say with certainty that he is still with them, but if he is I'd really like to use that to hate on them a bit more, can anyone help me justify my rage?
