It's even more worrisome with bitcoin because the keys explicitly denote ownership.  There is no other way to say "these bitcoin are mine" than to be able to sign the address that is holding said bitcoin.  Don't hold the keys?  They aren't yours.

So the financial industries answer to 08 was to build an even bigger house of cards?  This will not end well.  This time bankers and finance types deserve the gallows.

If you don't control the keys, it isn't yours.  How something else works is irrelevant.  But muh legal fiction
