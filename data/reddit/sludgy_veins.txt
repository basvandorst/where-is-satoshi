so should we start posting old news articles about bitcoin in case some people didn't know about that particular news?
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:26:47
but that's a low fee and doesn't scale appropriately. It can cost you 40 bucks to send 15 dollars worth

yea i feel like that pre-christmas drop hurt us a bit though. Had that not happened I think we would have had more people buying in with christmas money - but that drop made them weary 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:22:56
Yup. This is old news, good news, but old news

This is the number 1 rule.
Also a good process is how "smart" gamblers do it. When you earn money, only use the earned money to continue buying in. Put what you started with back where it came from

everyone here wants a lambo and doesn't give a shit about it becoming peer-to-peer cash.
They want to take their bitcoin to a centralized exchange and cash out $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

btc isn't satoshi's vision. It has changed big time. 7 year ago Satoshi wanted to increase blocksize. 7. years. ago. He also called it peer-to-peer cash, not gold
And lightning network has a good chance of centralizing the network.
That being said, BTC still has a solid vision, the devs just need to get their act together before it's too late. Market share is dwindling at a rapid rate lately

Not only that, current wait time on BTC confirmations is longer than waiting till monday lol

uhhh, i've got bad news for you
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:30:13
this is a good question that I hope gets answered. At least for the moment, the sidebar could use a "minimizing fees" read up
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:19:20
wow i never even thought about people using their credit cards to buy crypto. If they can pay that off quick enough or get large enough gains - it's almost a guarantee they will lose money
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:33:39
because nobody wants to eat the fees?
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:20:18
hell if they did it before november they probably aren't too mad about it!
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:57:37


holy fuck. i'm starting to think you guys are idiots
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:25:20
as a republican voter i couldn't be more disgusted by this bill. Way to go guys, mid terms will be almost 100% blue now - and you know what I think we deserve that to be the case. This is a fucking disgusting bill
Can we hurry up with cloning people, we need to replace all the people in the senate with R's next to their name with Rand Paul 1-51
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:23:07
practically a guarantee. he doesn't seem like the type of guy to move his money out of exchanges
