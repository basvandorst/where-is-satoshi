I get why they would say it though as it is in a way a gamble. That being said it's very common for investors to put 5% of their portfolio into "high risk" stocks which I see as just a gamble as well.
Telling someone to put all their extra money into bitcoin is irresponsible but telling someone to put a small % of their portfolio into Bitcoin isnt.

Bitcoin goes from 5 cents to $1 - "Gee wish I bought when it was 5 cents"
Bitcoin goes from $1 to $10 - "Gee I wish I bought when it was $1"
And on and on and on....
I sure as heck don't want to be the guy in 2020 when it's $30K saying "gee I wish I bought when bitcoin was $4800
