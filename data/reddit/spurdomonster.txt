Free marketeers and libertarians will often point out lack of regulations as desirable for economic institutions(banks) and businesses/corporations, but here we have the opposite, lack of regulation and economic players not engaging int he open deregulated market. Was trying to point that out,.

They forked into their own chain while claiming they are the "original chain as satoshi intended" but satoshi is not around to tell anyone what he/she/they/them/xir intended to begin with. Then roger ver keeps going on and off about censorship in his sub when the bcash subreddit also actively "censors", and by censor he means the mods remove posts and ban people, but this is the -bitcoin- subreddit not the bitcoin-cash subreddit
So they(bitcoin cash supporters) would be in here all day and go on and on and on about bitcoin cash  *while having their own subreddit* and for that they call censorship.

1. Coinbase is fine they are the literal face of a "bitcoin bank". Like a bank they are also insured. But if you purchase from Coinbase.com directly you will pay a premium unless you purchase on their actual users exchange, which is GDAX.com. If you have an account withcoinbase you will also have a GDAX account. It can take a few days for the transfer of cash to BTC though.
