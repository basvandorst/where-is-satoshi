It's [an old idea](

Oh yeah, that reminds me: Buzz, Orkut, Wave, Dodgeball, Latitude, Jaiku...

People also laughed at HomeGrocer, Pets.com, Cuil, Seqway (thanks and thousands of other products and businesses that did in fact fail (Or at least failed to change the world). The few examples that did not fail are in no way a trend.

That image is a thumbnail, can you link a readable one please? (Perhaps via imgur since tumblr messes with sizes so much)

It also implies "Not directly tradable as specific pieces of metal/paper" (paper wallets not counting)
A virtual currency would theoretically not have to be digital, it could be somehow stored on an analog format like LaserDisc and transmitted as audio or radio or something. (Of course that would be ridiculous for a discrete exact thing like money, but it's not impossible)

Any chance you might describe what "Bitcoin Bowl" is and when/where etc? I was rather curious myself seeing all these headlines here.
(Yes, I know I can just google it, and I have, but it would be really nice to see OP's question answered here on the sub)

I'm a little behind - how many BTC are 1 satoshi and 1 bit?

How many public defenders (or lawyers in general) accept bitcoin? Because if your assets are frozen you certainly are not going to be able to convert them to fiat!

It's not large enough to be readable there either!

I suppose that's a possibility, for some reason it hadn't occurred to me. Of course it might lead to questions but better than trying to get it into a bank account.

I checked and it requires Facebook login. It's exactly the kind of app I would never want anywhere near my FB profile.

The one I know of is  - it's actually Satoshis per upvote, not even bits - but hey, "free money".

In a sub where there is only one or a few active mods, that would basically be the choice between "Censored" and "Unfiltered" - Better than nothing, but still needs a way to elect new mods.

That could work.
