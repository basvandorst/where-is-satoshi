My financial aid money came in a day late! Ugh! I bought 1.97 for $700 and then today I got 2.5 for $995. I bought at 350 and then I bought at 385. Would have been really nice to buy at 300.

I run a printing business and have access to whole sale stickers! Can we crowd fund this? I'm happy to do it. I'll update with my bitcoin address when I get home.
