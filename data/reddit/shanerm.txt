Think about standard oil or at&amp;t and the baby bells. We wouldn't have anti-trust laws otherwise. Todays oligopolization comes mostly from corporate consolidation aka mergers and acquisitions. And many would argue that the FTC isnt doing enough about it/ allows too much consolidation. That's probably because our government is also quite vulnerable to the influence of outside capital.

Like any market or network that is mostly unregulated bitcoin is vulnerable to outside capital. Now one person may not have the capital to attack the network (with purchased hashpower) or market share (with purchased coins/capital for more.) Or at least not enough incentive to do so. But a relatively small and powerful group could pool resources to do so. Think about bitcoin's market cap vs the amount of capital controled by banks and governments and ultra wealthy people. Also think about how far ahead early adopters are of everyone else. Much like how unregulated markets tend toward monopoly or oligopoly, bitcoin will naturally centralize around those with the most capital. Those people's interests may not be the best interest of bitcoin/blockchain.

Yeah but at some point they'll probably unpeg it from the dollar and attempt full monetary sovereignty. I expect that to include the introduction of petro-yuan, at least eventually, which could foreseeably lead to war with the US.

Most fiat isnt physical either though. Most of it is debt, issued through fractional reserve banking.
