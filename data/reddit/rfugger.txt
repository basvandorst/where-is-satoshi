That chart shows all-time hash rate.  It says nothing about what's going on today.

The difference is that the chart you linked is over a longer time period than Blockchain.info's, so it doesn't say anything about the validity of Blockchain's data.

Ripple consensus is neither PoW nor PoS, but a straightforward cooperative model that can quickly detect and eliminate bad actors:
People have been pointing out that Ripple's validator network is currently centralized around servers run by Ripple Labs, but that is natural given that they have by far the largest stake in maintaining the integrity of the network. It's ironic that the Bitcoin network now finds itself in a similar situation, after so many Bitcoiners have dismissed Ripple for being too centralized. I sincerely hope GHash are responsible stewards of Bitcoin while this situation gets resolved.

Because there's no mining, the coin must be otherwise allocated, which I agree is problematic.  No need to be rude about it.  Just pointing out that the parent's statement that "proof of work is the only decentralized method of achieving consensus" isn't accurate.

I understand the arguments, but I am not convinced that the centralizing forces you mention are stronger than the decentralizing force of innovation and new players that comes with allowing the transaction rate and userbase to keep growing.  In my view, limiting the transaction rate artificially is already causing new players to avoid joining the Bitcoin economy, and, ironically, it is only in that stagnant state that the centralizing forces you speak of come to dominate, *regardless of blocksize*.  
I also think mining centralization is oversold as a concern.  If a cartel of mining pool operators comes to dominate the network -- and you might say it already has -- and starts to misbehave by, for example, censoring some transactions, the vast distributed network of actual miners will quickly learn of it and shift their hash power to other honest pools.  If enough hash power doesn't shift, the community will start buying hash power to point to honest pools.  
You can't ignore the power of the inherently decentralized community behind Bitcoin -- that's the whole point.  The reason we accept the degree of centralization we already have is because transactions keep going through just fine.  It seems silly to spite the userbase by artificially limiting the transaction rate in order to reduce some minor centralization forces that only hypothetically lead to some transactions being restricted in the far off future.  You're essentially engaging in the hypothetical attack that you're trying to prevent.

The intent of taking the 20th percentile is to require 80% of miners to be voting for at least that much change.  Therefore it ought to be the 20th percentile value when the change is an increase, and the 80th percentile value when the change is a decrease.  If neither can be satisfied (20th percentile is a vote for a decrease and 80th percentile is a vote for an increase), then there is no change.  
Either that or just take the median...

My guess is they're limiting it to donations because there are minimal consequences if there are delays or other issues.

Can you explain what you mean by "returned the balances and kept the real profits for himself"?

It was dollars on Bitstamp being frozen due to a lawsuit, not XRP. XRP are unfreezable, same as BTC. Any fiat at any normal cryptocurrency exchange can be frozen, nothing to do with Ripple. Actually, to trade BTC against fiat, you have to take your BTC off the blockchain, so your tradeable BTC is freezable. But XRP is always tradeable on the Ripple ledger because the trades are built right in. 
Ripple also provides a straightforward way for fiat balances to be unfreezable (by setting a configuration flag) if an exchange decides to operate that way, something that I haven't seen any Bitcoin exchange figure out how to do yet. Ripple users who don't like any risk of frozen balances can stick to non-freezing gateways. 
There are other criticisms of Ripple that carry weight, sure, but this isn't one of them. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:13:44
You can't even trade Bitcoins for fiat (or anything else) on the blockchain. To do that, you have to take it off the blockchain where funds can be frozen by an exchange (MtGox?). Ripple actually allows exchanging unfreezable XRP for fiat on the ledger (ie, Ripple blockchain), so you are comparing apples to oranges. Ripple even provides for non-freezability of fiat if a gateway wants. There's no reasonable way to do these things on the Bitcoin blockchain, so the comparison isn't valid. 
To make a valid comparison, compare using only XRP on the Ripple ledger to using BTC on the blockchain.

I presume you're talking about an attack where there are only a small number of nodes which as a group become susceptible to government regulation, address blacklisting, etc. In that case, transactions are restricted and demand for blockspace goes down, meaning the equilibrium blocksize goes down, and it becomes cheaper for more people to run nodes, so the network rebalances itself.

The banks' fear of open, decentralized solutions that they can't control is pushing them to improve their proprietary systems in order to fend off the new competition.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:27:52
The validator network is the part you're talking about. That has nothing to do with anything being closed source. Ripple Labs runs a bunch of validators that are trusted by other validators, but they do not yet AFAIK trust other validators, meaning they still have control of the validation. They say this is to be able to roll out software updates easily and quickly, something that is an issue with Bitcoin. I suspect that they are also waiting for larger validators to join.

If you got 40,000 XRP on the initial bitcointalk giveaway, that would be worth $320 at current prices.

Yeah, Counterparty is cool.  I said there's no "reasonable" way to do Ripple things on the blockchain to give myself wriggle room, because I know that systems are being developed, and I love that they are.  I just haven't seen much integration with many exchanges or the mainstream Bitcoin world to make this kind of thing as seamless as Ripple.  Yet.  It could get there and I hope it does.
I should probably have said there's no standard way to do Ripple-type things on the blockchain with the default client, or something to that effect.
Still have to contend with 10-minute block confirmation times though...
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:29:16
Yes, I would have preferred it to not be the default, certainly.  It does seem like a compromise to the political reality, positioning Ripple as more palatable to existing financial institutions, but I don't know the exact reasons for it.  I'd prefer to have a financial network that routes around existing institutions, just like I'd prefer an ad-hoc internet that routes around existing phone and cable companies, but inertia is strong, despite technology that gives us the capability to do more.  In the end, it's up to us to build gateways that don't freeze if that's what we want.  And of course, use and promote Bitcoin.

The analogy does nothing to justify the proposition that bigger blocks are somehow less secure in any meaningful way. I do not agree they are, so the analogy is deceiving.
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:48:50
Using Vitalik's continuous dynamically scaling max blocksize based on a weighted moving average of recent actual blocksizes would let users themselves determine what they want Bitcoin to be.
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:22:42
Well, not identical, since it takes the average size, not the 20th/80th percentile like BIP100, and averages only recent transactions, not over a fixed time block, and adjusts continually, not at fixed intervals...  But your point is taken.
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:16:06
Yeah. Makes me think that 30% of MIT students' parents pay for everything.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:15:33
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:06:16
Yes, that's right.  It's the validation network topology that is currently centralized, although if other validators decided to stop listening to RL and started listening to each other instead, no one could stop them.  That's just the balance of the network right now.  Where it will evolve is hard to say.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:29:45
Also note that if Ripple were attempting to block transactions or otherwise misbehave in their validation, it would be easily detectable. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:23:43
That claim needs a lot more justification than I've yet seen.
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:38:33


This is a strange thing to say.  Raising the max blocksize doesn't force anything.  It simply allows for more transaction volume.  If people don't want to use it for that, then it just won't be used.  Keeping the max blocksize low is what forces the blockchain to be a settlement ledger rather than a payments ledger.  A larger blocksize allows for either possibility.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:02:32
Actually, it was Bitstamp's choice to activate the freezability flag (or not activate the non-freezability flag). Ripple merely provides the choice in the software. Then Bitstamp alone controls the freezing of its accounts, not Ripple Labs.

To be fair, the three founders of OpenCoin, which became Ripple, Jed, Chris, and Arthur, split 20B XRP between them and assigned the remaining 80B to the company. Chris has pledged most of his to charity as I understand; Jed has pledged some I believe, and has sold a large chunk to fund Stellar; Arthur had a smaller amount and I'm not sure what he's done with it. I believe all three have signed some sort of lockup agreement with Ripple Inc. to prevent their XRP being dumped. So realistically there's at least 10B of that 38B that's not really on the market. I don't see how that's any different than Satoshi's 1M+ BTC stash though. But definitely market cap comparisons between XRP and BTC is always going to be apples and oranges.

The banks' blockchain won't have currency tokens, just a ledger to keep track of transactions and balances between them.
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:01:52
That is how the Interledger fees will work -- at each hop, the fee is paid on its own ledger.  But I believe fees on the Ripple network will continue to be paid in XRP.

The new Ripple is probably closer to my original concept from 2004 than the designs I came up with later on.  I thought it would be cool to have the accounts off "in the cloud," but I couldn't imagine how to implement that securely.  Satoshi figured it out with the blockchain, and Jed McCaleb and David Schwartz have improved on it I think.  What they're working on *is* the continuation my Ripple project, with my full permission and approval.
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:51:43
When OpenCoin contacted me about implementing my concept, I was extremely skeptical that their design was feasible or that they could pull it off even if it was. Over the course of a few weeks, they answered every technical objection I could fathom, and, more importantly, demonstrated that they believe in the power of open systems to change the world. If there's anyone on the planet who are better suited for building Ripple, I don't know who it would be. 
Obviously, they have to distribute the XRP in such a way to build community support.  Part of that is trying to avoid having people game the distribution system. I know this is one of their hardest challenges. 
So doubt all you want, and certainly hold OpenCoin to their promises. At this point I'm just excited people are talking about it and working on it.
