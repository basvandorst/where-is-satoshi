Ditch CB asap, roll with Gemini..always transfer your BTC to your own wallet with your own personal keys immediately starting with a small amount just as a precaution and then the full.

The more time goes on the harder and harder it will be for people to buy a decent amount of Bitcoin. Especially with sites like Coinbase and all of these exhanges. The limitations and regulations will continue to get worse. It probably won't even be worth buying it in the future, there will be certain apps and software where people can earn it more easily than they ever could as supposed to buying it through your own bank. Sites like steemit are changing the game and future apps should make things easier but we still have hoops to jump through.

Also in case you didn't know Gemini is owned and was started by the Winklevoss twins the originators of Facebook, if that means anything to you. These guys put some serious cash behind their exchange and are making some colossal moves in the Bitcoin world. All the best buddy.

Buddy , simply put , even if it's $50 bucks $25 whatever just buy some and store them in your own wallet not on an online exchange. Start looking into ICO's to flip your investment and buy more BTC. Keep building from there. Never go all in and keep reading about Bitcoin and other promising altcoins. Don't ever bet the house. Little dab here little dab there pretty soon you will have your coins stacked.

I felt a little uncomfortable a few months back about Coinbase but I hardly ever kept my funds on their exchange or any exchange for that matter. After I bought from there I would always immediately withdraw my funds. Now with all this crap going on it scares me even more and they are one of the top exchanges in the US as far as easily being able to purchase Bitcoins. Also FYI whatever purchases you make with your Bitcoins directly from Coinbase is tracked and kept on file unless you transfer them to your own wallet as mentioned in my previous post. Gemini is the only other exchange I've used personally and to me always seems to be less of a headache than Coinbase but there are still a few bumps you must pass before being able to purchase from them, i.d. verification etc. I'm in NY so these exchanges are currently the only ones I can purchase Bitcoin from. Every other site blocks me because of the whole BitLicense fiasco.  I heard Circle is a good place to buy from also check them out but do a little research first.

Scam. Stay away.

Nobody "owns" any Bitcoin. We merely have "access" to Bitcoin with a special set of private keys. The Bitcoin blockchain owns all Bitcoins. ��

Exchanges will be decentralized and what will China do then. Internet kill switch.

I sent BTC with a medium fee yesterday and had to wait 5 hours for confirmation. I have a sick feeling all of this is not going to end well. This is unacceptable and sad. And please don't respond to me saying "well send higher fees next time". A medium fee should be MORE than enough to have a simple transaction be confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. 5 hours is not a reasonable amount of time. Looks like those with the highest fees get the preferential pampered treatment while the rest of us get to hold our asses in our hands. BITCOIN IS NO LONGER WHAT IT SET OUT TO BE PERIOD.

You don't own Cryptos. You simply have access to them with a private key. You own private keys. Cryptos are owned by their corresponding blockchain. You are not a blockchain, you are human. Fin.

Excellent breakdown basheron . Thank you for this.

It's a dumb move on their part if they shut down all exchanges. Now it goes underground, where things can really get tricky and dangerous. Sellers would have to resort to selling in person which inevitably means scams, robberies and murders. It's happened before and with exchanges being non-existent, it will happen even more. That is a fact.

Give it a few hours buddy maybe even a full day or two. Bitcoin is having a massive slowdown with confirmations and Bitcoins showing up in your wallet.  It's more than likely an unconfirmed transaction and that's what is preventing you from seeing the coins in your wallet. No worries just give it some time.

You can never say 100% for sure but the price rose way too quick. Just yesterday it hit a high of $2738 and now it's back down to $2576. If you do buy now at these prices just make sure you lock it away for at least 3-5 years minimum and don't even look at or touch it.
