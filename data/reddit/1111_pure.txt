Educate them about bitcoin, blockchain and the tech behind it and allow them to make their own investment decisions. Never give investment advice to friends, the upside is never worth the downside. If it crashes and burns you will never hear the end of it.

You are so right. Just read twitter and stuff and you can see how ignorant and clueless so many people still are. Spouting off shit when they have no fucking clue what they are talking about. I laugh every day as I accumulate more.

Yes, all addresses generated will work for you no matter when you use it so you will be fine! Also as said by a previous poster, definitely turn your bitcoin into litecoin before you move it from bittrex to coinbase as the transaction speed / transfer fee will be much better. You are looking at a 15-30min transfer window as opposed to a 24hour+ backlog btc is going through right now. You can then sell your litecoin on coin base right away or convert it back into btc if that is your wish.

Idk, my thoughts are that it's possible the human brain can't handle the emotional aspect of a bitcoin over 20k. The idea of it crashing back to zero will always be in the back of the mind of people. It may so overwhelming that there may always be some type of fud/panic selling along the way that prevent it from going over. This is just pure speculation though.
