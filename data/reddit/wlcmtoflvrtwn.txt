Feel bad for the people who are losing their jobs.  Also sucks that the Executives will probably get cushy bonuses to offset their stress of having to fire 18,000 people......fuck banks and any Fortune 500 company executive.  They are all terrible human beings.

Oh I agree with you there.  Still falls on executives who have 0 clue how to actually run a successful business and are only in it to make themselves rich and powerful.  They give 0 shits about the people who work for them.

I buy using newton.  Takes seconds to setup and verify your identity.  No need to use interac e-transfers as they connect directly to your bank using plaid as an in between.  No fee buying or selling, and can buy instantly as soon as you transfer money,  no waiting for the e-transfer to go through.  I have also used NDAX, but they do have fees.

If in Canada you should use Newton.  It allows instant transfers to and from your bank with 0 fees.  It lets you connect to your bank from right in the app/website.

I’m sceptical.  How many email addresses do you have that you don’t know which one you used?  Also kind of sounds like you found a bunch of stolen passwords and are looking to hack into peoples bitcoin accounts.....

Yup.  It’s awesome. Quick and painless account setup and verification.

They don’t get you bank credentials. They use a third party connection using plaid.  Plaid also does the linking to your bank account from Coinbase, venmo, among other companies.  Seems fairly trustworthy.

I use NDAX.  They seem pretty good.  Good customer service.
