Look dickwad, before you start posting pretentious comments about you and your financial wisdom, grow a pair of NUTS. My rant about educating yourself on bitcoins is assuming that you ALREADY have a more than general education on finance, investing, and entrepreneurship. Go ahead and ask questions. Become the new Napoleon Hill for gods sake. Before worrying about the financial future of my future children, take the time to look in the mirror and ask yourself, "why am I such a goddamn pussy?"

Because of bitcoin? No. Because of the automation of the work place and everything that comes with it, most definitely. Technology and innovations such as bitcoins are the driving force behind it. There will always be freeloaders and those who don't carry their weight but we as a society have the potential to completely change the marketplace and the way our economy and society functions, most especially (and hopefully) our educational system which advocates regurgitation and non specialization.

Quite well is a relative term. With the amount of technology and innovation nowadays, it should be more than possible for ALL millennials to live "quite well". Now go and troll your way out of here.
