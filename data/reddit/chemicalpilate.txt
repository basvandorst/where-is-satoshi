Hmm, my iPhone has it. :-/

I did! :-)

Welcome to the party! :-)

Again, you're saying the price of oil has nothing to do with it, right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:31:50
I dunno man. Venezuela funded it's national government through oil sales revenue. The price of oil fell and they couldn't keep the party going. It's a hell of a lot simpler than your explanation.
P.S. Yes, I've read "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man", thanks.

So the price of oil had nothing to do with it?

It looks dramatic with that time window view but if I look at OKCoin volume at 3 days or 1 week it looks like a brief spike that got tamped down...

Can you post your output from bitcoin-cli? My full node running 0.14.0 agrees with OP.

I bought some computer hardware with BTC. It was pretty awesome. I kinda wish I'd waited to do so, since now I feel like the infamous pizza guy but as a friend's grandmother used to say, "gams is gams". I got my hardware and still had some BTC left over with which to enjoy this rally. *pours a drink*

But who's to say what the odds were at the time?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:19:05
True, but how do you measure the odds when you only have one chance to make the observation?

I believe Cash can connect directly to a bank account or to a debit card, but I wasn't aware that Cash supported credit cards.

From the original source (therecorder.com):
"DOJ trial attorney Amy Matchison said at a court hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley Thursday that the IRS has been in talks with Coinbase about narrowing its request to only items the agency would need to look for unreported income. In particular, Matchison said that the agency intends to retract its request for password and security setting information for U.S. Coinbase users."
