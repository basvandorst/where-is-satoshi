My account froze with thousands of others. It was publicized, it was the second time it had happened.

Or both.

I don't recall where I purchased it from. Coinbase is crap, I haven't used it in 2 years since my account was frozen for 2 weeks for no reason.

Coinbase.com is the most popular place to buy with a debit card. It is good that you are going to store on the Trezor and not on Coinbase. If you do not want to provide tons of personal info and/or don't wan't to use Coinbase, Bitquick.co is my personal favorite but you have to deposit into their bank account. Last, localbitcoins is worth the effort to meet a bitcoin dealer and build a relationship, then they may accept venmo or other 'debit' apps.

Yes, any amount of Bitcoin is good to have. $20 of Bitcoin in 2012 is worth $9,500 today! Create a paper wallet and stash it!

I’m holding for now. I’m the business owner so I’ll do what I want with the profits. As long as $4k is accounted for, I may use the profits to renovate the office or I will take a vacation.

I've been holding crypto for about 25 ppl for the past year. I allow them to take action (buy,sell) between the 27-30th of each month so it's less micro-managing and promotes long-term plays. I take 3.5% of all cashouts and it has worked out very well for all parties involved however only 2 people have cashed out. I make a google sheet to share with everyone so they can see their holdings. If you type 
=CRYPTOFINANCE("BTCUSD") in a field it will pull that coins current value.

I’ll purchase transactions of $2k - $9k with Bitquick pretty regularly. With coinbase they have withdrawal limits but they are high now a days. I’m biased bc of a bad experience w Coinbase but you should probably use them.

I bought my Trezor using bitcoin.

I would approach the Bitcoin as you would cash. The background check should still apply as should any protocol. Using a service like bitquick.co the Bitcoin is as liquid as cash. I accepted $4k in Bitcoin from a clients last year, it is still in a blockchain.com wallet and I consider it cash for all tax/accounting purposes. I DON'T report the profit made on the Bitcoin, to the business it is only $4k cash.

I stopped using coinbase 2 years ago when I was frozen from my account for no real reason. I recovered by coins but it was a bad experience. Also, coinbase collects a lot of personal info, like opening a bank account. If you are only using coinbase to purchase, and withdrawing them to your Trezor theres no real reason to not use coinbase. I still prefer bitquick.co to buy larger amounts.

The $4k is in my accounting as “cash” I don’t have a bitcoin column.

The fastest way is using localbitcoins.com and listing your bitcoin for sale. You are likely to sell the bitcoin above market value within 3 days, which is the minimum amount of time to receive bank transfers from any website.
