That is exactly what I'm thinking, but I wanted to ask around in the community and see if anybody had any information I'm not privy to.

Possibly using the same technique many of those money transfer requests a few weeks ago.

Thanks for the info.

Are you going to make any setting user customizable?
Any chance of putting the code on GitHub?

I might be able to make this. Not sure though. I'm currently in the process of getting moved back to Austin.
This is my "maybe" RSVP. :P

lol. It wasn't my plan until I saw the poll was still open. :P
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:01:44
Voting is open. We should tell them what we think. :D
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:18:46
Hmm. That seems like a bug. lol

Perhaps [The Bitcoin Song by Tatiana Moroz]( could be used in the Ad?
Possibly using the music with no lyric and then "Use Bitcoin whenever you pay" towards the end of the commercial? We'd have to talk to her about it of course.

This would be awesome as the background music for the [Bitcoin Commercial](

The minimum fee is 0.0001BTC/kB when it meets that certain criteria. Just to clarify for everybody.

Is this going to be available for only UK residences?
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:58:30
Great idea. Can't wait to see the fees reduced though.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:14:54
Oh. I read your post wrong I guess.
That's no good. I have been using the Wiki a lot lately.
Hope to see it back soon.

The ignorance the media has in regards to Bitcoin is astonishing. It's my believe when you're reporting on something you should at least take the time to understand it. The mass of America gets their information from these outlets, and when the outlets are giving Bitcoin a bad name the mass of people get that idea as well.
I just watched a segment from Street Signs (looking for the segment pictured here) about the house in Las Vegas being on the market and accepting bitcoin as a viable option to buy. They are so ignorant about the currency, and just spreading this ignorance and misinformation among the masses.
It's very sad.

Like pardax said, the miners solve blocks. Currently they are rewarded a certain amount of bitcoins for solving that block. They are also awarded any transaction fees.
I'm sure you've heard of the block chain. Each new solved block is added to the end of that block chain. Each block contains a list of all or some recent transactions, a reference to the previous block in the block chain, and the public address to the miner that solved the block (to know who to pay the reward to).

Server maintenance maybe?

Suggest it to them. The only way they'll know the desires of their customers is for their customers to ask them to do something.

I know you're still in Alpha, but what's the ETA on iPhone development?
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:53:32
Working on it!
Seems like if they accept credit cards (which a lot of them do) they should be able to accept Bitcoin easily.
