If the btc is sent, it's sent regardless of whether the receiver lets you trade with them. A btc transfer can't be cancelled once it's confirmed. Also why would you buy bitcoin and then move them unto an exchange?
Also, in case you're not a troll. Don't ever use bitcoin.com. It's practically a scam site and what you bought is likely bcash (aka bitcoin cash by the creators trying to appropriate the bitcoin brand) and not bitcoin.
You should be able to trade them to real bitcoin once they're on the exchange though.

That still does not make Bitcoin unreliable (You'll have to actually explain how replace-by-fee and merchants makes bitcoin unreliable. Merely mentioning those don't don't really mean anything in terms of argument to me. It may be obvious to some, but I'm reasonably new to the space so they don't mean anything to me in  terms of unreliability). For bitcoin transactions to be unreliable they would have to sometimes simply not work. The only times bitcoin transactions "don't work" is when people offer too small of a fee. That's not an issue with bitcoin in and of itself but with people not understanding the current situation of the congested mempool. I'll agree that bitcoin is currently facing severe problems in regards to the mempool but I'll disagree that it's an apt description to call it unreliable as a result. Certainly less practical.
There are no real cases of transactions not going through for no reason as far as I'm aware. I'm new to this space, and did enough reading that I didn't have issues sending my coins the first time around - However not everyone do their due diligence. One cold argue that needing to do research to do a transaction makes something complex - And I'd say cryptos are for sure complex. Something being complex and requiring a bit of forethought does not make it unreliable though.
Bcash being cheaper to transfer does not affect bitcoin. Bitcoin does not become unreliable based on what other coins can or can't do. It can make it comparatively less useful or more difficult to use, but not objectively unreliable simply because something works differently. If you pay the appropriate fee your transaction will *always* go through. The only unreliable thing in that is that the fee is always changing.
Those three adjectives you called bitcoin is why people conclude the bcash community is misleading newcomers. People hear "unreliable" and think it means that bitcoin randomly doesn't work sometimes. You neglected to comment on my dissection of the "Slow *and* expensive contradiction. I'll take it you have no rebuttal or "What about" for that.
On the topic of "whataboutism" - Sure bitcoin people often make the same conclusion that bcash is a scam or a bad coin. But that's usually with some good arguments behind it (The misleading bitcoin.com and the active attempt to hijack the bitcoin name does make it a scam - akin to someone selling a car claiming it has a certain engine, only for you to find out it's a different engine after the fact- And the seller knew but deliberately neglected to mention it.)
What's important to note is that doesn't mean bcash as a coin isn't valid. It just means there are bad actors in the community, and unfortunately it appears the community are embracing them. I believe that to be the main reason why people dislike bcash so much. It's not the coin, but the way the bcash community has very little issue with the unethical bad actors within their community.
The agressive stance against anything bitcoin was the main reason why I didn't spend very long in r/btc before concluding it wasn't somewhere I wanted to spend my time. There are shitposting and trashing everywhere, but r/btc gave me a an entirely different feeling of "This is miserable and hateful" - that was as a complete newbie to this space - No bias or pre-determined opinion (Besides having seen that one video of Ver rage quitting an interview, which is why I actually wanted to learn what bcash really is. As a coin, let it try on it's merits, but the cultist defending it as the "One true bitcoin" are bonkers.

Bitcoin isn't your average currency. It's unreasonable to go into new tech without assuming one first has to do a bit of research on how it functions.
Just like you have to learn about what a crypto is, how wallets work etc. you'd also have to learn what the mempool and transaction fees are. There seems to be a lot of people who does the bare minimum amount of research to waddle their way into sending btc, but stops *just* short of knowing they minimum fee to include in order to have their transaction processed.
It's part of the responsibility of being your own bank. If you don't want to be that, don't use bitcoin.

(Don't confuse bcash people using the term "bitcoin core" to describe bitcoin, with the entirely legit "bitcoin core" client which is software used to run a bitcoin node and is highly beneficial to the bitcoin network. In general, anyone trying to call the bitcoin crypto anything else than bitcoin is a red flag.

The "Taking down banking" is a ridiculous goal - I don't think many people seriously believes this. Banking may be forced to adjust, but they will never disappear because of this alone.
But yes. Crypto is an *alternative* to fiat. It's not going to kill i,t but it's going to offer an alternative for people who for any reason would like an alternative.
It's early tech and being an early adopter comes with extra hassles. Nothing is as streamlined as it should be. In terms of wallets this refers to both wallets that sets fees way too high, and wallets that allow for people to send transactions with such low fees they'd never get confirmed. That's not really the fault of bitcoin itself - It's as much of a responsibility of the wallet devs.
Perfectly, you'd want a wallet that monitored the mempool and adjusted the fees in real time, but it doesn't appear many wallets do this right. 
I use  to monitor what transactions are currently going through. Right now you can send bitcoin with a 140sat/byte fee and have it processed in a reasonable time. That's something like 8 bucks. Not ideal, but better than paying 40 bucks because your wallet set that as the recommended fee, or 1 dollar because "Well I don't want to pay more than that"
Right now, one has to adjust expectations because of the mempool issue. If you have an important transaction it might be perfectly fine to pay 10$ to have it arrive safely, timely and securely. But for buying coffee? That would just be naive.
Through my link you'll see that the mempool congestion is a fairly new issue (A couple months back it didn't exist) so wallets are not well adjusted to it. And not many learning tools are available to inform newcomers.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:08:25
Except exchanges don't set the fees. This is a screen shot from Myceilium I believe, and if you look at it you'll notice how it's entirely up to the user to set the fees.
Miners decide themselves what fees they want to include in the block - But you yourself is in full control of what fee you want to include with your transaction. Right now you'll do fine with a 140 sat/byte fee.

People have been working on it for years already. Instant, low/no fee transaction is what Lightning Network is for. It's already being tested on testnet and has been successfully used on mainnet. It simply lacks wallets to be ready for widespread adoption. 
I personally don't think of bitcoin as replacing fiat. But it's a sound alternative to it. Unfortunately, the past 2 months it's running into issues (See  - Those big spikes are the mempool congestion and the high fees are a symptom of it. I find it likely for the congestion to be much lower, if not entirely gone, in 3 months. 
In it's current state bitcoin can easily function as an *alternative* to fiat when it comes to larger money transfers (You can send transactions with a 8-10 dollar fee and it'll go through) - That's ok if you're sending hundreds or thousands of dollars internationally. It obviously doesn't work for every day purchases. That's why we need Lightning Network.

Yeah, I don't think anyone foresaw a congestion issue to this extent occurring. To be fair, the same thing happens in other systems. Shipping items get lost all the time, and banks hae lost track of money in the past as well. The only reason this isn't something we recognize as a major problem in those instances is because of regulations forcing banks to reimburse their customers (And shipping companies offering insurance). Systems that allow for "limbo" exist, but there's always someone who holds responsibility. That's the big difference for bitcoin.

How exactly did the devs actively change bitcoin into something else without hardforking? Hardforking is the action of changing the blockchain. Bitcoin didn't hardfork. Problems arose (Mempool) and devs didn't want to add a quick bandaid, instead opted to work on solutions with better scaleability.
Sure, bitcoin doesn't function as well as currency as of right now as it used to - But that doesn't mean the devs actively changed it. The only active change is the bcash hardfork - Which your analogy fits well. Except you change it so the pig insists that it's now the real improved duck - The original vision of the duck, and the actual duck is somehow changed. That's how newcomers look at bcash. It changed into a pig but keeps telling everyone it's a duck -Sure it used to be a duck and share common history with ducks - But it changed and became something supposedly better. Why it would then continue to try and associate with the legacy duck, one wonders.
Bitcoin devs are in fact so cautious about any change that segwit was softforked in order to give everyone sufficient time to test and make sure it's safe. Over time bitcoin will be useful as currency again, but the transformation is much slower. One can argue if that's a good or bad thing, but I appreciate that they're doing it with caution when they're handling tech that people have millions of dollars stored in.
And people will always use crypto as stores of value. Some use bcash for that as well. Just like not everyone buys lambos to drive them - Some just likes to collect cars. That doesn't mean it should no longer be considered a car.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:32:10
Well, considering the implications of such a currency it may very well be worth it. Considering the instability of fiat currency in certain countries, (Venezuela most recently) in part resulting in mass riot and starvation (Healthy babies have died of starvation in Venezuela due to no breast milk substitutes being available anywhere. Not even in hospitals). A stable currency, not prone to inflation and tampering could help prevent thing like happening in the future. Of course there's no accounting for the Venezuelan government refusing outside help.
Point being, a stable economy is likely going to help many countries avoid catastrophe in the future. Of course we are not there yet and the computing power needed will only grow until then. But it certainly could end up being worth the computing power.

When I go buy crypto it matters a lot whether I get bitcoin or bcash. They share common history but at one point they split. Bcash hardforked and became something else. The hijack isn't "Someone is stealing the code" - The hijack is the deliberate effort to confuse bitcoin and bcash. Litecoin don't go around claiming it's bitcoin, so why would bcash? There's no reason at all why bcash supporters should be so hellbent on being called bitcoin (I giggle when you type  (cash) like that - Just call it by it's full name. I don't go around writing "(American) football" and "football" either. It's ridiculous. I say bcash and bitcoin, and american football and soccer. Because it's the least misleading naming convention)
Bcash became something else than bitcoin (Improvement or not, doesn't matter) yet is determined to be called the same as the one who didn't hardfork. 
It's deliberately misleading - Instead of building it's own brand and space, trying to prosper off of the bitcoin brand.
If you just stuck to "Bitcoin cash" that would be fine. But for some reason the community (or Ver?) decided it wanted to be called bitcoin instead of bitcoin cash - No matter that it would confuse a shit ton of people (Or because it would?). There's no problem with bitcoin gold or bitcoin diamond because those coins don't try to actively hijack the bitcoin brand (If they are they certainly aren't trying as hard). They don't confuse newcomers by claiming "We're the real bitcoin. That other thing is bitcoin core/legacy" (And no, bitcoin is not called bitcoin core. Bitcoin core is the name of the software client and wallet used to run nodes)
People are calling it bcash to try and counteract the agressive brand takeover that bcash supporters are attempting for no other reason than stuborn pride. (I for one think bcash is a much better name than bitcoin cash)  
How you think there's anything wrong with changing the intention of something over time, I can't fathom. (I will also argue that no one decided bitcoin should be a store of value only. It just so happens that's all it's really good for right (Unless you want to pay the high fees) now until solutions to the mempool congestion are fixed - And people are for the most part accepting of this because the people who wasn't already hardforked and made bcash as an alternative)
No one is saying you're stupid for sending 10$ - And you could, if you pay the fee. It just so happens that fee is rather high right now, so it would probably be stupid in the sense that you're paying more to send something than your sending. But if you absolutely need 10$ somewhere you can do it, and it will work flawlessly assuming you pay  the necessary fee.
If you insist that you should be able to send 10$ for cheap, there's nothing wrong with that either. You absolutely should. The mempool problem is what's stupid. And thankfully there are alternative coins to use until it's solved. 
Litecoin and ethereum are doing tremendously well. Bcash isn't doing nearly as well as one would expect, which is weird. I personally wonder if it's the rhetoric and aggressiveness of the community turning people away from it or something else. (Bcash addresses are falling while bitcoin and litecoin is up)

Depends on what you mean by "Transaction through an exchange" - If you mean trading btc and fiat on an exchange, then that's entirely the exchange. It doesn't even happen on the blockchain so it's irrelevant to bitcoin. Those trades happen on internal databases and some exchanges take 0 fees (GDAX) and other take larger fees. But they are not blockchain transactions. That's not data entries moving on company databases.
If you mean when you transfer btc out of an exchange into your personal wallet, then the miner collect the fee because it's a blockchain transaction. The exchange may also take a withdrawal fee if they so choose (But again, not all exchanges take fees - And they have nothing to do with bitcoin specificly).
If you have your bitcoin on an exchange they're not your bitcoin. They're IOUs and the trades made there are not blockchain transactions. You should always have your bitcoin in your own wallet - And preferably one that is segwit compatible and at the very least allows you to set your own fees (Not all wallets allow that).
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:09:49
There are a lot of reasons to avoid coinbase / GDAX though. The CEO is hostile towards bitcoin improvements and won't implement segwit. There's the whole bcash insider trading thing and either lying or simply not having a clue about their roadmap, since a roadmap released a week prior to the bcash trading launching claiming there was no bcash trading planned until 2018.
And that's just on top of my head. If you dig around I'm sure you'll find more issues with them.

Depends on what you mean by "Transaction through an exchange" - If you mean trading btc and fiat on an exchange, then that's entirely the exchange. It doesn't even happen on the blockchain so it's irrelevant to bitcoin. Those trades happen on internal databases and some exchanges take 0 fees (GDAX) and other take larger fees. But they are not blockchain transactions. That's just data entries moving on company databases.
If you mean when you transfer btc out of an exchange into your personal wallet, then the miner collect the fee because it's a blockchain transaction. The exchange may also take a withdrawal fee if they so choose (But again, not all exchanges take fees - And they have nothing to do with bitcoin specificly).
If you have your bitcoin on an exchange they're not your bitcoin. They're IOUs and the trades made there are not blockchain transactions. You should always have your bitcoin in your own wallet - And preferably one that is segwit compatible and at the very least allows you to set your own fees (Not all wallets allow that).
Educate yourself. It'll save you time and money and potentially a lot of grief.

When I decided to look into bitcoin a month ago and stumbled over bcash, the first thing I saw was the Ver ragequit interview. He immediately seemed to give off psychopath vibes and everything I've seen and heard since has only made that clearer. 
I went to r/btc to get some more insight into bcash as a coin. Except the frontpage was filled with people shitting on bitcoin, Andreas and everyone else who didn't support bcash blindly. 
It was pretty easy to decide that even if bcash had validity as a crypto, I didn't want to anything to do with it's supporters. It gave off alt-right vibes. Not exactly a good impression.

Dane here. I assume this is only a problem with larger amounts of money, right? You may want to look into withdrawing smaller amounts of cash over time in order to let the bank receive the funds without having to do major anti money launder checks.

If you've already moved it to a non-segwit address you gain nothing from trying to move it now when the network is still congested. Just wait and move it once fees and congestion lowers.

Yes, you absolutely need a wallet.
Unless you intend to trade with the coins never leave them on an exchange. It leaves you open to exploitation by the exchange (Shutting down) or hackers attacking the exchange. Coins on an exchange is not yours. Unless you hold your private keys they are not your bitcoins. They are simply IOUs.
The safest wallet is a hardware wallet. A physical piece of kit you purchase that can store your coins offline. 
Many use desktop or mobile wallets. I myself use a mobile wallet. There are several decent ones (Electrum, mycelium, Samurai) - Consider using a segwit enabled wallet from the get-to to send coins faster and cheaper.
To check the value of your investment run a portfolio app. I havent't found a good one yet. Alternatively just check the price of bitcoin and multiply it by your amount of bitcoin.

They aren't your bitcoin while they're on an exchange. If you don't hold the private keys, the coins aren't yours. While on an exchange the bitcoin are just IOU's.

Coinbase sets the fee higher than it needs to be. You can currently send BTC with a 7-9 dollar fee. Coinbase is literally charging double the amount necessary. Whether that's them pocketing the excess or actually overpaying the miner fee is irrelevant. They're charging double.

Isn't the adjustment always 14 days apart regardless of mining power? Just like each block is roughly 10 min apart regardless of mining power? (Of course adjusted by the bi weekly adjustments).

600sat/b? But the screenshot provided earlier says 127sat/b - Which is why the transfer isn't being processed. No one scammed you, you're just being silly.
I was new to this in december and apparently did better research than you because I got my coins transferred for free through GDAX.
Just learn from your mistake and don't be a bitch about it. Lots of people are making these mistakes at the moment since the mempool isn't very forgiving. But as you very well know if you've done your research as you say you have - No one took your coins. They're there, delayed because you messed up the fees. You'll get them in a couple of weeks.

Look! He memorized Ver's talking points :D
"Slow, expensive and unreliable" are contradicting statements - But who cares about that, it's all about convincing the newbies.
Bitcoin *can* be either slow *or* expensive. Not both. Either you pay a low fee and the transfer takes ages - Thus cheap and slow. Or you pay a high fee and it's quick - Thus fast and expensive.
The unreliable part is just made up. One of the blockchain tech main proponent is its reliability, so if bitcoin is suddenly unreliable, that means the tech behind it is flawed. And since bcash and bitcoin is built on the same tech... see where I'm going? 
Ver's talking points, he makes sure to mention every sentence in every interview he makes, are easily disputed by anyone with a shred of critical thinking.

If you ever intend on using your BTC then it does matter. Coinbase being the biggest exchange there is makes up a huge amount of the overall transactions being made. If they implemented segwit and batching that would help the mempool spam problem a great deal. But they're not because the CEO is holding a shit ton of ETH and as long as BTC is having problem with the mempool ETH will increase in value.
You have an interest in the coin you're buying (For use or not) being updated so that it functions well. This affects both it's use and value - Far more than the small transfer fees you save by using GDAX.
(I'm still using GDAX because Bitstamp is taking forever verifying people. I figured I might as well save the fee but I'm not going to continue to support that company)

Open 1 channel. Send btc to anyone using the entire network.
If C needs to send money to A, C can send money to A by opening a channel with B who already has a channel connected with A. That ay the payment goes from C to B to A.

There's no doubt people are spamming the mempool. You can find addresses sending every 2-3 minutes back and forth between each other with above average fees. The only reason to ever do that is to spam the mempool. They're banking on most of those transactions never getting confirmed- They just want to push the fee up so that they have something to attack bitcoin with.
(Someone linked one of these addresses yesterday but I of course didn't save it...)
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:36:09
You transfered from GDAX - Which pays the fee for you. That doesn't make it free to transfer. Just that you weren't the one paying. It's literally one of the only exchanges that will cover that fee for you.

Except the difficulty adjustments will keep everything equalized. If chinese miners were put out of the game, sure that would affect the value of bitcoin, but not it's integrity. The difficulty adjusts to make up for the lower amount of computing power on the network and nothing would change in terms of keeping the network running. 
In the case of China they do already hold the most mining power so seeing their power diminished wouldn't actually be a bad thing in terms of keeping bitcoin decentralized, right? If the difficulty adjustment also happens this would enable more smaller miners to get into the game as well. 
This is how it works, right? I may be mistaken.

If you think it's feasable to get anything from a 10$ investment you don't understand the basics of math. If you invest 10$ and the value increases by 20% over the next 6 months, how much money have you gained? 2$
Your investment returns are proportional to your original investment. You should not invest if you do not know this.
That said - If you want to invest any real amount of money you need to put in hours of research and make sure you know what you're doing. Otherwise you're literally just gambling and very likely to mess up. You can not circumvent the necessary research by asking reddit to do it for you. Start by reading things from this subreddit.

I agree. But to be fair we've never seen such a larger inflow of people in such a short amount of time.

As you'll notice, I never criticized bch itself (I'm not going to pretend to know which would be the better choice - I saw the ver ragequit video and determined it probably wasn't for me). I still went to /btc a few times and assessed the community and the type of posts there.  I'm not calling anyone scammers, paid shills, compulsive liars etc. like you'll see so many other do. Neither do I try to tear down Ver (Though we've all seen the Ver video, referring to that as irrational rage is fiarly factual)
I have no issue with bcash itself. Let it live as it's own thing. But the tone in that subreddit reminds me of the shitty people in school who's tear everyone else down if they as much as sneezed wrong (Of course they supported each other amazingly well too. That's how packmentality works).
To be fair, immediately after my comment hre there were an increase in Ver and bcash related posts here due to his AMA. In my opinion there's no reason to keep such track of what the other subreddit is doing. Point out when someone says something wrong, and don't shit on other people for trusting in a different coin. You'll never get anything out of it.

I really have no stake in bcash (it's a better sounding name than bitcoin cash) vs bitcoin - But going to /btc and seeing the thoughtprocess and mentality of the people there makes me want to have nothing to do with it. 
Almost all the posts focus on "Bcash is better than bitcoin / bitcoin is shit" or "Ver is amazing, the shitcoin guys suck"
(It boggles my mind the hate they have for AA. From all I've seen he seems like a perfectly normal, well articulated, genuinely nice guy. But then again - it's coming from people who don't have issue with Vers irrational rage, so there's probably a different approach to people over there)
There may be a decent amount of shitposts here as well, but nowhere nearly as many focus on shitting on other coins or people, and there's a distinct difference in the amount of actually useful posts with focus on helping others, discussing tech, etc.

it's fairly common for banks to cancel / withhold transactions that are outside of your normal spending pattern (Like spending 5000 euro if you ever only spent USD) - When I bought a camera lens a while back my bank texted me and asked me to call their number. They blocked the transaction because 1000+ euro was irregular. I told them it was me right away and the purchase went through.
But if they continue to block the transaction after you contact them, that's bullshit. Punish them by personally going into the bank and close your accounts - Let them know exactly why - and pick another bank.

The idea that things get their value from intrinsic value is outdated and has been de constructed plenty the past hundred years. Do you think the value of gold comes from it's use in electronics and jewellery? No of course not. It comes from the fact that people perceive it to have a specific value and are willing to pay that price. 
Diamonds have no intrinsic value. They aren't scarce, they can be fabricated easily, they aren't even the prettiest gemstones out there, yet  people are willing to pay tons for them - Not because if their usefulness. Only because they perceive their value to be so. (And that perception is of course helped along by the diamond monopoly who has a vested interest in keeping it like that). So while the btc price may be manipulated and inflated - It's not because of it having no intrinsic value, because intrinsic value doesn't determine what something is worth.

If Bitcoin solves it's issues and starts functioning as a currency, there's literally no reason to swap to a different currency that comes later. As you say. Your normal guy doesn't care about tech details as long as it works - So if bitcoin gets it shit sorted and people start using it, there's no reason to swap to a different currency. A different crypto is only valid as long as it fixes an issue bitcoin has. Most of bitcoins issues will be solved with LN (And continually improved upon) so any serious competitor will need to release before LN is widely adopted.
Keep in mind there are already crypto out there that solves bitcoins immediate problems, and while they're popular, they are by no means killing bitcoin. The bitcoin brand is still far stronger than anything else out there, and I doubt applying "Apple" or "google" to something will make it immediately popular (Google+ anyone?)

Addition: Bitcoin transaction can not be tampered with or blocked - I think that's what some people misconstrue to meaning it's also anonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:57:37
The exchange is regulated, bitcoin is not. Gdax and coinbase both have to follow anti-money-laundering regulations etc. and as such are required to keep tabs on who is buying and selling.
Bitcoin is not made for anonymity (Every transaction made is broadcast publicly) - Big misconception that btc is supposed to be anonymous, in my opinion.

You're probably better off consulting a professional instead of strangers on the web. Ignore the bitcoin part. Just ask if you have to pay capital gain tax. If yes, that probably applies to bitcoin as well. (Unless there's a specific different stance on Bitcoin)

Unless you're buying a high amount of coins at once you really don't need the stop orders. just use the limit orders. They're much simpler to use in a jiffy, and unless the dip is incredibly short lived, they will usually get filled.

You can not purchase with a card on GDAX. It's wire or sepa transfer only.
The point of GDAX isn't to buy coins swiftly. It's to trade. Constantly buying and selling in order to make profits. The purpose of Coinbase is to have a simple and swift way for newcomers to buy bitcoin and move on.
If you're not in a hurry there's no reason not to use GDAX over Coinbase. Why not save the money, right?

Edit: Less ridiculous: Venezuela, South Korea etc. Are adopting it not because they think it's cool, but because it's one of the only solutions for when shit hits the fan. That's why I trust it. When shit hits the fan, bitcoin will be one of the solutions.

Ask a Swedish tax worker. No one else will know. Or google it.
In Denmark they made a decision years ago to not tax personal gains from bitcoin. It is however taxed if you've bought in for gains. (Silly distinction to make since it's pretty hard to prove one or the other without first determining what behaviour would prove one or the other)

I think alpha in this case just refers to the devs (Two man team IIRC) still seeing this as the early stages of development. From what I've seen from it it's stable and functional - And updates are coming at a nice rate. 
Know that this isn't some corporate wallet with a 25 man dev team. Regular guys doing a hell of a job making a wallet with some really nice unique features. 
I have no actual idea why they still say the wallet is in alpha because it's more feature complete than older wallets.

Wages are higher and living expenses lower. Tired of your job? Go back to school any time and learn a new craft, get paid a monthly stipend by the state while you study. And see the doctor for free whenever theres the slightest concern. Born in alow income family? Dont worry, you can still get a high end education without loans or saving for years.
Oh shit, you have to pay 40% to have a life where you have complete and total freedom over your future and can do what you dream of doing?. Better stay in the US and work that 10$ wage (Danish minimum wage is over 60% higher than us minimun wage)

The company you work for just shafted you by "giving" you private healthcare. Its considered part of your salary and thus its taxed as income. But doesnt really matter. Of course someone in the top bracket complains about earning a ton of money and being in the top bracket. Having not grown up in Denmark you need to consider the benfit it is for a family with children to not have to pick which one goes to college, or not going into debt because of unforeseen illness. You dont see gofundme campaigns for medical expenses in Denmark. You dont see gofundme campaigns for taxes either.
Ive run my own business and I know how the taxes feel devastating when you're the one making your own money from your own business. But what I would personally prefer and whats best for the society I live in as whole often dont match, and its important to keep that in mind in my opinion. Especially when talking about taxes. No one likes to pay taxes. Not the poor, not the rich, but people seem a lot more content and worry-free in the countries where they do.
Im not going to change your opinion on this since you obviously hated your situation while here and thats ok. It doesnt mean the system isnt benefitting the vast majority of people.

Exchanges are not wallets. If you do not hold your private keys, the coins are not yours. What you have are IOUs. Unless you are trading you should never hold coins on an exchange - It leaves your coins at risk of being lost to hacks or other security risks associated with exchanges.
Get yourself a good reputable segwit mobile wallet (Do your research, this is not something you can't learn for yourself by investing an hour or two into researching wallets). On android I recommend Samourai. The devs seem to be in it for the right reasons and the features are great.
On exchanges you can lose your coins to hacks, insider fraud/scams, mistakes, bankruptcy - And probably more.
On a good wallet you are safe from most of those things, and it doesn't leave you open to new attacks (A wallet with a stealth mode will keep you safe from muggings - Even without a stealth mode, just make a dummy account as a decoy and you're safe)

This actually doesn't help. I of course can't remember the name. But some streamer or youtuber talked about how some hacker had repeatedly attempted to get a hold of his SIM card. Understandedly being scared of the hacker succeeding (Heed been trying intensely) he called his provider and set up a password. 30 minutes later his SIM died. After days or weeks of failed attempts, the password allowed the hacker to just call in, claim to have forgotten the password, and the moron on the other end reset the SIM.

Being 15 you're not exactly a kid. Also, we can't conclude whether you're damaged yet ;)
The kid in question is 12, which is probably about the age limit I'd set for introducing someone to what crypto is (Just in terms of making sure they actually understand what it is). Introducing them to price tracking I'm not sure.
I got super hooked on MMOs when I was 13-14 and it did not do anything good for me. Obsessing about numbers going up can be a real detriment to development. Not always, but sometimes. Certainly in my case.

Let's pretend the Bitcoin blockchain is a physical ledger. You have to decide what size paper to use for this ledger. You'll receive a new ledger every 10 minutes no matter what size you pick. Let's say you choose to make your ledger using A5 paper and I make mine using A3 paper. We both receive our ledger every 10 minutes, but mine is 4 times the size of yours and is able to hold many more transactions.
This all sounds good to me, but within a few days I no longer have space to store all the large ledgers I get every 10 minutes. I end up buying a storage unit to store them all... and another... and another. This becomes really expensive and I end up not being able to afford buying storage space, so I throw the ledgers out. In this case, only the rich will be able to keep their ledgers. Fewer people will be helping secure the network and keep it decentralised. 
Meanwhile, by the time I've bought my 3rd storage unit, you've just filled up the storage capacity at home and is buying your first unit. It's much cheaper for you to store ledgers and so you're not as worried about long term costs. This also means more people, with smaller budgets, will be able to store ledgers and help secure the network. 
People using smaller paper focus on optimizing the space they have (Typing in a smaller font, abbreviating terms etc.) in order to fit more transactions into a smaller space, whereas those who use large paper don't optimize and just keep using bigger and bigger pieces of paper whenever they need more space for more transactions - Leading to more and more storage space being needed, making it more and more expensive.

Isnt the definittion of the americn dream that everyone should be able to make their own future, and be able to do what they dream of doing, despite their social and economic status? Denmark is one of the countries in the world where what part of society youre born into affects your future the least. In the US if you're born poor you often stay poor in most cases. In Denmark theres little correlation between your family's wealth and your level of education and income as an adult. That's literally the American dream.
