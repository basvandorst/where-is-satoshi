I believe the formula is current price / 200 day moving avg.  So.. 7,120.17÷9,393.18~. 76.  Who the F knows but I guess this somewhat positive.

I'm pretty sure I said I didnt know anything about teeka except some internet ads.

He's not teaching it.  He's having Teeka Tiwari on to explain crypto.  At no point does he claim to be anything but a novice.  You morons should be happy he is promoting crypto to a big audience 5hat has $$$.  I dont give a shit about his politics but I do care that he is informing a very base about crypto that could increase my bags.  
*I've seen Teeka Tiwari in internet ads but I dont know anything more about him.  He is bullish on crypto tho and I like that.

Well, whether he's a good shill or not is your opinion.   We all have one and we all have the right to share it. I'm for spreading the word of crypto in a positive light.  This ain't politics, its crypto and Beck is bullish on crypto.

Would you be ok with Stephen Colbert bringing an expert on and talking crypto?  If not, I respect your consistency.   I would be extremely happy to see Stephen Colbert talk crpto on his show.  You think Beck is an idiot, fine so does my wife.  The fact is tho the conservative right has a lot of business owners who no nothing or little of crypto and may just be turned on to it like me and I assume you too.  I'm looking for adoption like most of us on this reddit page.  Good luck to us all on this bloody Tuesday.  Buy the dip.  Lol.
