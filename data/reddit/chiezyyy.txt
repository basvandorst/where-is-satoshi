Nah my problem lies in trusting alt coins too much, not believing in bitcoin’s potential enough I guess

That’s why everyone in the crypto space(hodlers,youtubers,redditors,everyone) knows that the golden rule is “only invest what you can afford to lose”, if you stand by this crypto is more like coke tbh, never tried it but looking at graphs all day will probably give me a kickass high someday

Yeah seems like everytime i sell it rebounds back up again, im too young and inexperienced maybe and still have weak hands...

Nah bought at 7.5k, didnt lose out USD wise, but lost BTC-coin wise.. wanted to even up my coin holding

Yeah i knew the fees were high but had no idea it was thaat high, and i'm trading more than 100$ , but thank goodness i asked reddit, cause if not for this i'd lose a few months worth of allowance ��

With a a good temperament, how hard is it to get a weekly gain of 2-3%
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:12:43
Yeah the volatility and overall unpredictability scares me most, one moment u think ur selling high and turns out it spikes, that's what i'm most afraid of rn
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:15:21
Nah it's just extra cash that i'm putting in, by broke i mean i live off my allowance so not much income
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:20:02
Yeah my parents are always encouraging me to try this out cuz they can't, hence me asking around.. thanks so much for answering
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:11:06
Hmm yeah i agree, but im young and broke, so situation 1 applies to me here, so i guess not much to lose anyways right
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:03:15
LMAO, elaborate on this
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:29:08
Wow u seem very knowledgeable and some of the risks above i actually never heard of, thank you so much man. Seems like you need a certain skill set and it isn't quite the basic day trading that i was expecting it to be..
