I send $100 to abbey
I buy$100 bitcoin. I send it to somewhere. 
Abbey gets $100 from local guy Jack and gives him passcode to obtain bitcoin.
That somewhere has to be your service. You hold the funds.
Why wouldn't people use localbitcoins over your service? People usually buy and sell on demand rather than function as ongoing exchangers.

I just gave an example of delaying broadcasting a longer length fork than the commonly accepted one by an hour. The longer length will be accepted by the network as valid. You said 'length means nothing', it is the cumulative hashing power. That doesn't make sense, a block chain doesn't have power, it is just data. Maybe you mean the cumulative difficulty of that block chain, which is the definition of 'length' in this context. See

Is it possible to separate the block into a header containing the solution for adequate difficulty and the transaction information? The header could be small and propagated quickly and then there is a window of time for the transaction data to be propagated. Any headers received after the first are kept in queue as candidates and only used if the transaction information isn't received in a timely fashion. That way, the only race is to provide the block header, and the miner has incentive to maximize block size for maximum transaction fees.
