Gold has value because other people want it and perceive it to have value. It's a simple as that. The same goes for pretty much everything  else out there.

I find it to be completely the opposite. I think bitcoin is interesting. But I disagree with a lot of the statements that people make that are extremely optimistic without reason such as "Bitcoin is the currency of the future" "Bitcoin is so much better then traditional fiat" "Bitcoin is much more secure" etc. I become "upset" when people hype bitcoin based on poor arguments. 
For example there is currently a popular submission titled "Here's a fun one: Every Well's Fargo in the United States is currently offline. Debit cards are not working, can't withdraw cash. bitcoin users unaffected."
Bitcoin advocates usually point to shit like that to "prove" that bitcoin is inherently better somehow. 
Or another poor argument I often encounter is how Bitcoin is better than credit cards due to no charge backs. It's true there are no charge backs. There is better seller protection, but with that comes with less buyer protection.

As I said previously, the statement made was **Credit Card vs Bitcoin**, not paypal vs bitcoin. Paypal is a third party service compared to credit cards.


I know it's not an alternative. What I'm refuting is the statement that the fact that there is no chargebacks is evidence towards Bitcoin being better than Credit card.


Once again, the fucking comparison is **Bitcoin vs CREDIT CARDS**
If you were to try and argue that Cash is no more or less safer than Bitcoin, then I'd probably agree for the most part. But the comparison is between **Bitcoin vs CREDIT CARD**


Yes they are an idiot. That's exactly the fucking point I was trying to make. Don't you understand context? I was giving the "Credit card is obviously worse than Bitcoin due to charge backs" as an example of a stupid argument. That is all that I fucking said. And you are trying to broaden the whole topic to include third party services and the USD even though I never made any claims about this.
Simply put, "Credit card is worse than Bitcoin because of the ability of buyers to charge back and only on that fact alone" True or false? Obviously False. It's better for some people, worse for others. If you think it's False, great, we're on the same fucking page. If you think it's True, then you're just like those idiots who cannot construct a good argument.

I'm not sure if you're a toll or just a genuine idiot.
The fact that there is no chargeback mechanism means it's good for sellers but bad for buyers. Is it really that fucking difficult for you to understand that there are two groups, one at an advantage, ie sellers, and one at a disadvantage, ie buyers.
From the POV of the sellers, two things can happen. 
1)They transact with a legitimate buyer, buyer receives the goods and does not charge back.
2) They transact with a scammer, scammer receives the goods and wants to charge back.
In situation 1) Sellers are indifferent to chargebacks or not since charge backs don't come into play.
In situation 2) Sellers don't want chargebacks to exist, as it protects them against scammers. Sellers are better off.
So the net effect is that sellers are better off with no charge backs. That's a positive thing.
Now from the POV of buyers, two things can happen.
1) They transact with a legitimate seller who sends the goods once they receive payment. Chargeback is indifferent here.
2) They transact with a scammer who receives payment, but never sends the good. Buyer would benefit if there is a charge back mechanism, but there isn't. Buyers are worse off.
So you see Sellers are better off, buyers are worse off.


No, as I stated it is not an inherent function of bitcoin. The comparison is simply Credit card vs Bitcoin on it's own. Not with any added services. If you want to combine added services then I can make up shit like, credit cards can give you rewards points, some give you a 1% discount. You benefit from credit cards if you pay off your balance before interest accrues. The time weighted average credit card balance * the interest rate you would otherwise have had to pay is effectively free money. 
Looks like credit card is a much better service once you factor in the benefit credit card companies use to entice you. See? I can add in whatever fucking third party service I want to as well. In fact it's not even a third party service since it's provided by the credit card providers themselves.
Regardless of all that, if you were even half competent at basic comprehension


ie no third party bullshit.

I think you should learn what a ponzi scheme is first. I don't know if the statement you quoted is actually true, but it's not something that is logically untrue.
Someone sets up a speculative investment fund. It makes huge losses, they lie about saying how it made good returns and pay out returns by selling capital rather than actual proceeds from the investments, and now you have a ponzi scheme.

Yes it is a poor argument.


So let's say you send some bitcoins to a guy in order to buy some goods. He never sends the good, not even a tracking number. He doesn't respond to any of your emails. He has at this point clearly scammed you. What can you do? Nothing. There is nothing stopping the seller from self-imposing a buyer protection, but ultimately if someone scams another person, there is no recourse.
What you're describing is a third party service. In that case there is buyer protection, but it's not a feature of bitcoin in itself.
Though you could argue that cash has the feature, that is not the argument being made. The argument is explicitly paying via credit card or via bitcoin. Which is safer? If we limit the argument to purely buyer and seller protection, ie chargebacks and no chargebacks, they come off relatively neutral. One is better for sellers, another for buyers.


You don't understand the argument do you? No fear of chargebacks? What about fear of being scammed? With credit cards you have the preace of mind that if you get scammed, you just go for a chargeback. With bitcoins if you get scammed, good fucking luck getting your money back. This is precisely the reason that I find arguing with bitcoin advcates so frustrating. You are only able to look at it from the POV of one person, in this case the sellers, and then determining that it's better. What about the buyers POV? Did you forget to consider that? And going back to your example of bitmit.net, that service uses bitcoin, but in the end is third party, and is not inherently a feature of bitcoin itself.
