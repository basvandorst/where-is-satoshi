Yikes I didn't even see the 2.5 rating... I just know that Bitcoin core is a legit wallet on desktop so I thought nothing of it when I downloaded it... Am I screwed here?

I copied the private key into Samourai and it transfered right over and then from there I was able to send payment to who I needed to. Seriously man I owe you I thought I just lost a goddamn shit load of money! Haha thank you for real

It only shows 1 input and 1 transaction which is the disturbing part... I could send you the wallet address if you wanna take a look for yourself. I just don't understand how a wallet could receive coin but not be able to send it out, that makes no sense

Oh wait, I found a way to copy the private key is that the same as exporting it?

Yes it's completely empty now, normally I use electrum wallet on the computer but a buddy just wanted to send me some coin so I thought I'd download a wallet real quick on my phone and it legitimately almost turned my life upside down lol. I was stressing over this for hours before I even posted, it's 4am where I am right now and you just saved my ass more than you know, thank you thank you thank you ���� I really owe you, I'm definitely gonna be more cautious from now on. I didn't even know electrum had an app

When I enter the wallet address it shows the confirmed balance that I received, that's a good thing right? I just literally can't get it out

Omg I got it to transfer to samourai! I almost wanna cry lol thank you so much man, I just thought I lost a shit load of money
@_date: 2018-10-27 10:43:08
I don't see anything that says export... There must be a way to get it out though this is crazy

Which wallet would you recommend the most of out any of them?

What exactly is a lightning wallet?? Sorry first I've heard of it
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:42:46
Wow okay, thank you so much for the information. I've been using Bitcoin for years and years but haven't been keeping up with stuff like this and Segwit. And you responded very quickly, I hope I didn't wake you lol.
Sorry, and thanks again!

Yea sorry, it was just a quick response. I'm very grateful for it. Thank you

Sorry what is LN? And why is Bitpay an enemy of Bitcoin??
Also (sorry for all the time questions) what is a lightning wallet? How is it different than a regular one?
