The fact you think I am unhappy because I tell off a Jesus pusher leads me to believe you have a hearty bounty of preconceived notions that are based off absolutely nothing tangible.
Therefore you are looking in a mirror and telling me I am what you see.
You couldn’t possibly have any way of making such a statement accurately hahahahaha it’s actually hilarious as it is insulting.
Again, if someone is unhappy because they don’t have what you need to attain inner peace and happiness then it is you with the issue.

Nobody likes hearing “I tOlD yOu sO” and you literally made this account and base your posts off literally telling people I told you so.

Just because you grow up somewhere or close to something doesn’t mean you know, understand or care about that thing.
Trump doesn’t care about how money works, like most people. Trump isn’t capable without the money and certainly not smart enough to interest people in what he talks about, because all he has going for him is that he has some money.

You need to teach yourself about real wallets.

It’s pretty simple. You can open the app, go to accounts, select your bitcoin wallet, select trade and your trade option(buy,sell,convert), sell for usd then you go to your usd wallet, in accounts, then select withdraw. If you’ve set it up in your account settings, you will have the option to withdraw to your bank.
The faster method, literally no more then a few minutes, uses PayPal. Withdraw your money to your PayPal account from there you do have the option to withdraw from you PayPal straight to your selected debit card in less then minutes for a 10% fee, which doesn’t go over $10.
Fast but fee heavy. Wouldn’t suggest withdrawing the next year at least though.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:45:41
This isn’t at all what I have said and all you’ve created was a trap in the beginning.
You’re an idiot and a god fearing asshole.
There is subjective morality.
That which we choose to become and exhibit.
I’m straightforward. If I think you need less god because you want to tell others that they need god, I am going to tell whomever that they need less God and more humanity.
You can believe whatever you want. But stop pushing it. It’s already lead to enough atrocities.
Fucking asshole with your middle ground fake ass support and never actually helping another because you’re so busy sitting on the fence talking about how others absolutely must support this because they don’t want to fall into your two sided “philosophical” trap attempt.
Pig fucking, wind blown brained, Neolithic self absorbed, ingrate born of a sheep born to be sacrificed to the sweeping hand of god and his emotional fits of wrath and child like treatment of the entire planet.
Fuck hitler. Fuck people who meddle with others lives. Fuck pedos. Fuck the institutions(religious and business) filled with prostitution and fuck the god damn internment camps set up for humans displaced by war and fuck those who support turning others away and still call themselves people of any god.
Fuck the people who have abused Latin American children who’ve been displaced from their homes because of rampant political abuse and war mongering due in part to the nation under god. Who have a good track record of displacing governments.
Oh but again fuck you.
Fuck your god. Enjoy the universe and set up a better world for those who have no choice but to be born, asshole.

@_date: 2019-07-14 22:55:07
Sure I did.
I’ve only reinforced a conclusion you are only capable of moving past.
So I did nothing but illustrate no one needs your god.
Humanity needs no entity or entities besides itself to turn global society into a golden era.
I am tired of self responsibility being traded for faith that leads to abuse of trust over and over for selfish elitist asswads that rape, pillage and destroy cities for their god and I honestly believe humanity will be fine without the gods that have lead only to thousands of years of conflicts and uneducated approaches to understanding the universe.
Your god allows millions to die because they aren’t fruitful for the capitalistic machine we all must feed. Your god has you fighting wars in foreign countries for god and country for lies and profit of states within states, bleeding the masses out so they can continue to grant themselves more power while the faithful scold everyone for not believing like them.
Even as you are getting your neck cut into and bled out by those who deceive you into believing the impossible, you’ll gargle out in a bloody howl to your god who has forsaken everyone
Or you can learn there is no god. There is the universe, a growing plane of existence in which life is definitely capable of on a scale you couldn’t possibly fathom, and of all the life that has developed in all the billions of years the universe has existed for so far, and of all the gods that develop from the spirits of whatever ecosystems all those aliens inhabit in all of those galaxies, your god is the one that all of us sentient beings need.
Or you could just accept the universe is hostile, impersonal and it is your responsibility to make existence a better place. If you want a warden for this planet, it’s up to you.
And maybe that’s what your god would want you to fucking realize, if the fable actually existed.
Keep your god out of bitcoin.
We don’t need that “In God We Trust” bullshit for this money.
If anything god is the culmination of humanity uniting. E Pluribus Unum. In the end, we become the thing we fawned over in bringing us to salvation.
If anything you’ve illustrated my point

The fact that my life without god is empty is hilarious. What I am angry at is actually the humans who make other people miserable or push their practices into others because they think people are empty without what your dead ancestors told one another without a single conclusive piece of evidence to provide even a iota of evidence.
I don’t hate your god. I hate you all for making the world a worse with your blind faith.
Your unquestioning loyalty leads to further exploitation and more unresolved issues.
Though happiness is fleeting, it certainly isn’t non existent.
And if you can’t see how other people can be happy without god. Then it’s you who has a fucking issue

What the fuck
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:47:30
Universal basic income is a necessity to maintaining the structure of an inherently self destructive system.
It allows a repair and alleviation from complete degradation. Much like a body needs to flush and clear and clean toxins, a free trade, capitalistic market with a tendency to be dealing with the rest of the globe would more than likely not suffer from providing for the people who could turn down exploitative practices that manage to keep popping up. Making companies fear even attempting the culmination of such abhorrent business practices.
If people can say no just because they have enough to cover the basics of life, bullshit companies can collapse in on themselves rather than prolong the suffering and putting off a death that was obviously going to arrive in part due to flawed business models and the unfortunate diminishing of human integrity from greed that can manifest when some people lose sight of the bigger picture and become consumed by attaining more resources than is humanly possible for a single entity to spend on oneself and even a modern family unit.
UBI can take every welfare program and the workers and the workers that verify the work and seek falsified information, all resources taken from that and put towards a UBI for adults and children is feasible and could be an amazing stimulus for economies on a global scale. Not to mention you can be paying government workers in bitcoin, or whatever means for transparency as well. Total different subject with its own problems though.
Thé ripple effect would be profound and disillusionment to the very idea that everything is built of scarcity could be eliminated. Scarcity in resources available is a ridiculous notion when you look into food produced per year and how much is thrown away. Some understandably. Others unjustifiably.
But to bring it back on track to if bitcoin can be a solution to this.
Yesbit could. It would just need to be integrated in part with at least the United States government for disbursement to the people.
There is already a coin that has been playing with this idea for a couple years now. Started off as grantcoin rebranded to manna coin.
Cryptocurrency/blockchain certainly provides a feasible means of monitoring and distributing UBI
I wouldn’t say it is stupid though.
It grants liberty. If it grants too much liberty to individuals over corporations, then I really don’t understand any opposition to this idea.

I wouldn’t thank me. I was slightly tipsy after having a group celebration.
But, after reading some of these comments. The idea of UBI and attempting to automate certain processes are entertaining because, from my point of view, they should be free of any leftist rightist what have yous. It’s more of a failsafe for dire economic times. 
And more of an idea to help bring balance and ensure full profitability in more than how much can be made per quarter.
A step closer to ensuring every mind has a chance. From my point of view, it should be in part because nobody asked to suffer for historical decisions that influence a wave of politics heavily influenced by complex geopolitical catastrophes.
The consequence many are mocked for. Ignorantly taunted for even, are situations out of their control. From war torn, dictator controlled, hyper inflation due to over printing etc.
The social safety nets are fantastic introductions in history to attempting to alleviate the fall that inevitably comes from the prosperous rise in economics.
But everything can be improved from my point of view.

You can use a powerful enough computer if you want to keep your coat down. You’ll be using a fair amount of electricity and likely burn that bugger out faster than expected.
It would essentially trickle bitcoin to you by downloading mining pool software and letting it run.
Building or buying a rig for this will have widely different costs.

I understand where you come from with this concern.
But it doesn’t pay people to just live. It ensures that people are able to at least live and continue providing to the workforce in all its shapes and forms.
There are many ways to provide and augment. To limit the inches of markets to due to our own limited perception and knack for nonsensical tribalism on too many fronts is, well, exactly what is preposterous.
If anything with everyone having their basics provided for then you grant people alleviation from being able to place themselves in any self victimization stance. It allows you only to see that you have this to fall back on and nothing stopping you from pursuing your passions and interests.
If anyone even begins to complain about not having the means. Then it is that much easier for people to say without bias that this person is failing to see the truth that they are historically and unequivocally in a better position than any group or culmination of people in history.
So suck it up and keep working. And it won’t be insensitive. It won’t be uncalled for. It will be the truth. We are all starting from the same means
And those means grant you the right to say no. But saying no endlessly will bring you no closer to knowing what is possible and definitely what you’re capable of.
That argument, to me, that people will be lazy doesn’t hold water.
People love to use that argument and lament on how they achieved their goals and happiness regardless.
The psychosocial nuances to ensure people continue being adept members of the workplace are already in place.
The only laziness that is manifesting is your attempt at utilizing critical thought in that sweet neural cluster resting behind that neutron star of a skull

It’s better to hold. Work your job and accumulate. The 4 year strategy will allow you to sell at the new ath, which is going to be obvious, and rebuy for multiple bitcoin.
Better than scraping up fractions at cost.
I like to reposition during times like these. But I don’t suggest it to people if it’s their first round. This literally plays on delayed gratification. Would you like .5 bitcoin now or 5 bitcoin later.
The less greedy you are, the less stress you experience over all with bitcoin if you’re trying to trade small amounts.

That’s why I wonder if spaceX will move beyond being a passenger/resource/cargo company. Not that they have ever restricted themselves.
But if spaceX ended up venturing into asteroid mining they would have access to a lot of raw resources to sell back and redirect any positive returns back into itself.
I wish spaceX was publicly sold.

You have a lot to re-educate yourself on.
Bitcoin was coded to be unlike the monetary assets you are used to.
All fiat is inflationary. Simply put, it will lose buying power over time and has a shelf life. Especially when it is freely printed.
This entails a whole slew of problems in the future. We won’t even get into the ~~coup d’état~~ practices that ensure the US dollar remains a reserve currency.
When the dollar was backed by the gold it stood to be a much better representation of money.
That’s gone as being a commodity backed money stopped in ‘71, I believe.
Inflation will become worse.
No one argues that.
Bitcoin is an attempt to wrap all the things that make gold valuable while making it its own commodity backing itself.
It is deflationary and highly and easily divisible.
You remember the power of the decimal from mathematics I am sure.
These seemingly whole, rounded and indivisible numbers are not only capable of being divisible, but it essentially opens up a whole new realm of possibility.
Same with bitcoin. You don’t actually need an entire coin. Sure having a whole one in the next decade will probably provide more than enough for you and your life.
But if it grows and gets used by even 20% of the global population, it would start getting to the point where you start subdividing it into smaller units, satoshis, and wouldn’t need to really consider a whole bitcoin as anything but a subjective goal.
Now in comparison to libra. It has a block chain. It has miners and it has nodes.
Nodes can’t be bought for 10,000,000 a pop by only the wealthy..
The blockchain for bitcoin is now at a point where it is pretty much immutable and people are still taking time to work on various layers for bitcoin in attempts to augment the software. The miners processing the blocks/transactions are helping ensure the strength of the blockchain and the ability to attack and control the entire thing is expensive and grows harder every year.
Libra is a stable coin designed to represent 1 dollar. It will follow the dollar..so if bitcoin is deflationary, Libra follows the dollar and always looks appealing since it is 1:1 trade ratio
Why in the blithering fuck would you put your money into an asset to get less of something back?
Exactly for the reasons I stated prior. At the very least it is a hedge for your time wasted gathering fiat so you can live your life.
Not only can you look at bitcoin as a representation of fiat losing its buying power over time, as it grows in buying power, it also represents its resounding success as a successful deflationary, scarce, trustless, immutable, borderless, available 24/7 commodity with no real 3rd party to worry about once you’ve got your bitcoin in your controlled wallet.
Libra may have access to billions of minds, but eventually those minds will realize Libra has no blockchain, is bought into by corporate asshats, it ties your identity to everything you do, think about doing and then some.
Imagine having your identity tied to every paper note you ever spent. Would quickly make cash kind of a bitch...those are just a few of the problems with Libra.
Now bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. It is transparent. While there is KYC with some places you can buy, you can get around having info connecting you to an amount of bitcoin you purchased by connecting peer to peer or even using third party apps to mix and move your coins from wallet to wallet. If you don’t want people knowing how much you truly have. Up to you.
So there are a few things. There is plenty more to read up on though. Take some time and have fun
Édit: in regards to you worrying about missing a train.
I honestly believe any buy in under 50,000 is a good buy in.
Hell, buying in under 100,000 will probably be considered cheap eventually.
I know it’s weird to think about, but I remember when bitcoin was dollars, then it grew and I had a hard time imagining it taking off because it had such a small percentage of people interested in it.
That doesn’t matter, even with only about 1% of people seemingly interested it’s proven a stronger asset than probably anything ever created by humans.
The more people learn about it the more they realize it’s nothing like the games we’ve been used to playing

Your logic is nonsensical.
I was kindly saying you’re a dumbass
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:53:43
It’s up to us, when the time comes, to remind all the people that are exposed to the coin on its release what it is, where it stands in the crypto ecosystem(species wise as a coin), what it could achieve long term and all the reasons why it would be better to put their money into a crypto that provides an actual roi lol
This stable coin joke aside.
Shit like this will be confusing for some folk and it might muddy up peoples perception during their acceptance stages.
So let’s just prepare ourselves for that possible mess if facebooks execution is even remotely successful. Which..I would feel like a dumbass if I didn’t acknowledge it will probably work for them.

Because with bitcoin you always get amazing returns if you just hold onto it. And you want someone to get you an extra 8%.

Yes it does. Just remember each coin will have its own wallet for storage.
Good luck with those idiots
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:10:14
Buy bitcoin. Hold it. During high put it into a good stable coin. We will probably hit some crazy high 100+ in 20/21
Cash out some if you want. Wait. Slowly reposition back in over you own set amount of months or where you think the bottom could be. Then fucking wait and do it all over again.
You could attempt to mine, but you should maybe mine something using a machine you can put together which is decent and could be used for some promising alt mining without overheating risks you could have with some rigs in a small space and no risk of drawing attention to you for excess power usage.
So invest cash in bitcoin and computing power into an alt
Experiment and learn and have some fun. Enjoy your peanut butter sandwiches and ramen.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:03:31
Yeah, of course. There are some noteworthy projects.
Every alt that I buy I get its logo tattooed to me.
So I never forget my decisions and I always remember to think really hard about something before I act.
As a result I have obtained only the finest bag of shitcoins 90% of the time.

Hold it. It is a commodity that grows. Don’t need to put anymore risk in. Learn about security.
Stick whatever money you can spare in over a long period of time. Avoid alts until you’ve acquired knowledge and a good bitcoin position.
Don’t try trading to acquire more. That takes some luck. If you don’t have a lot of coin then it’s not worth it.

When, unfortunately, is subject to our irrational emotions and aspirations while reality is always very surprising but consistent with bitcoin.
It’s outlandish, but it seems inevitable. You can’t really stop it unless you destroy every computer that’s ever downloaded the chain or if people migrate to some similisât but more effective system.
But for now

But the black community has such great comedians
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:52:34
You can. You’re definitely free to! But that’s where the blockchain, digital financial ledger (the bookkeeper) comes into play.
The blockchain becomes immutable, or harder for even big fish to lie about receiving or transferring. Which happens in banks,government and corporations plenty.
While bitcoin and other coins can grow stronger over time. That’s because of the miners ensuring everyone else’s copy of the blockchain they have downloaded matches everyone else connected to the network.
Anything new will be susceptible to what bitcoin was in its beginnings as well.
You can start a project anytime you please. But it’s code will need to be examined, tested and a community needs to participate. Other wise it will become susceptible to a 51% attack.
Essentially a democratic overpowering the chain and allowing the 51% holder to navigate the chain as they want for their purpose, malicious or not. So any decentralization that was  meant to mimic bitcoin dies pretty fast.
Bitcoins doesn’t have a single point of failure. It has pretty much gotten past the risk of 51% attack.
You have to remember that some people might get left out but anyone who is dealing with hyper inflation right now or has in their past probably sees the value of bitcoin. At any price.
Eventually the dollar will hyper inflate and then any amount would have been better than the millions or billions you suddenly hold that can barely buy you a weeks worth of food.
Edit: I should also mention that when you do make a new coin it needs to obviously be interchangeable with other coins on exchanges. If you cannot pair it towards some coin someone prefers, then it becomes that much more useless
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:47:31
You need to think about it like this. You are now your own bank. You are responsible for your funds as this is a statement of liberty as much as it is a statement of financial sovereignty.
So you need to do your due diligence and be certain of a wallet.
Your best bet is a hardware. Cold storage.
You sound like you’re worried about repositioning. So having a mobile wallet would be, possibly the way to go.
There are several wallets that can provide secure holding of your btc.
But I would suggest you forget repositioning until after the big all time highs
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:59:09

You’re looking at it from the wrong viewpoint. Understandable.
There are only losers if you don’t try.
If you don’t attempt to do squat. You will « lose » if you sit there and believe it’s too far gone for you to participate, it will always be. 50 years from now
It can be 10,000,000 per whole coin or more. You wouldn’t be thinking like that.
If you put 2,000 in now and had only about 2/9 of a coin
That would still be about 2 million in the future..
Sure..you won’t have as much as everyone else
But if you are going to compare yourself to others right now as too late to the party, when right now les than 1% percent of the world utilize this asset, then you always will be.
Your view point isn’t allowing you to see that you would actually be an early adopter still.
You are only missing out because you’ve convinced yourself you’re late by relying on your initial preconceptions and immediate emotions.
Not good for critical discourse or long term thinking and organizing.
Do research friend

Like others have pointed out, you could just go to neighbors and explain you want to invest some spare money in bitcoin and ask for help.
But since you’re so young you should definitely just hold onto bitcoin until you are able to sign up with an exchange when old enough.
I mean..technically you can still trade while being under 18. But I would hold onto bitcoin if you’re only throwing less than an immediate 1k, focus on accumulating and waiting for the next all time high
An ATM will be the fastest means of acquiring btc but if you’re going to try to get as much bang for your buck you will need some patience and don’t fomo if the price is rising.
Perfect time to expand your social circles and talk with others at school and maybe find out if anyone knows anyone else holding tbh.
Then maybe if the neighbor thing doesn’t work, you could set up a p2p exchange with a trusted 2nd party
Just make sure you have a trusted wallet, and the transactions confirm before exchanging cash
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:29:51
Buy half a bitcoin. You won’t need to put in your entire savings.
Sit on it no matter what. Continue to learn about crypto and security and just wait until the time is right and we experience the 3rd ath this cycle.
Be wise about your wallet. Don’t choose some fake web wallet offering interest or some weird shit offer.
When the time is right then you can easily exchange your .5 bitcoin for stable coin or even exchange for fiat, if you aren’t worried about any taxes hindering your ability to buy back in after the major correction that seems to always happen after the big ath, then use your earnings to buy back a couple coins. At the very least you can get yourself one whole coin.
Just don’t be tempted to try trading it. Once you have .5 you could even begin DCA in slowly, so as not to thin your financial cushion.
Mainly just hold and try to learn about the cycles bitcoin seems to follow. Should help maximize your return when you have some timeframe in mind

Yeah yeah. I know that.
But if this wallet can be utilized as a node, I’m curious what’s the highest amount people are comfortable with having on this app while using it as one.
I want to build my own node but have also been curious about a mobile node. And I actually haven’t heard of this wallet.
Honestly I will probably just build one
Don’t even know why I asked
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:51:29
There is no such thing as coincidence. So yes
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:23:24
The entire point of bitcoin is being your own master. Your own bank.
With this premise comes the ultimate responsibility and test of character.
Many people bitch and moan about not being truly free. Well bitcoin and it’s blockchain are a step towards this liberation people say they wish to seek.
You need to be smart, weary and skeptical.
This requires a significant, but not overwhelming, amount of re-education.
Once you understand the basic mechanisms, your realize it cannot be stopped. Maybe slowed, but not stopped unless the community finds something that surpasses bitcoin. Market dominance says that hasn’t and won’t happen, until it does.
So chasing the promises of ruin will be what leads you to ruin and distrust and a sour taste, because you will have to play the same game that everyone else did in the beginning, holding and waiting for gains to be realized. That can be spend up if you hold significant amounts, but if you plan on holding for 10 years then you will be fine and will never need any broker.
Sign up for an exchange, a notably trust worthy one. Make sure it is the correct web page, that gets people, once that is established, bookmark it. Buy discover wallets. Learn to send. Play with small amounts for practice
Send to your chosen form of storage
Set and forget and don’t get caught up in price stuff too much
Or you’ll end up like us losers who get sucked into the crypto sphere for a few hours a day
Oh and emotions
Just learn to examine them and observe.
If you put your money in solid projects then you shouldn’t even stress.

@_date: 2019-06-25 07:31:04
When other coins help solve problems in our day to day and assist us without anyone even requiring a lot of understanding of it all but nonetheless utilizing blockchain or blockchain like tech.
Then I know bitcoin will have made it. Here’s to the next decade of holding
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:10:56
It’s not the worst thing ever.
But truly it goes both ways
There was a time I didn’t actually think bitcoin was going to go past 5,000. But it still did.
From plenty of participants experience, OP’s post doesn’t seem so irrational.
Especially when you consider the layering that can be implemented on just bitcoin.
But naturally since there is some visible bombardment by some consistent people talking about everyone being fake,  I could see how this could stoke some fires and lead to immediate ad hominem.
But that doesn’t negate the attempts.
Only human.
Despite us agreeing in our mutual action by supporting the networks we believe in. We will not agree on price speculation and we will not all agree on tech implementation.
We most certainly won’t agree on the scale of manipulation and never will we be able to attach our political ideologies effectively upon bitcoin
I don’t necessarily agree
I just don’t see the need for the weird brigading
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:32:51

There are still decades of progress to be made. Blanket statements are a horrible attempt at summarizing anything. Especially with the majority of neurotic idiots who float around these parts.

How’s that..
What echo chamber do mean?
Édit: There are people who believe many different things and hold different political views and some who don’t hold political views.
They are working their asses off.
This all is broken. Something is wrong. It should be quite easy for us all to point at the inherent problems, rather than fall to propaganda and blame or shame others.
Also, posting liberal/libertarian/conservative flags as attributes of bitcoin when it technically surpasses this makes it a moot point.
Bitcoin doesn’t give a fuck, it rewards/incentivized you for participation and verification of the network.
No need to check any boxes or reveal personal information.
And certainly recognize that people are doing the best they can with that which they are born with, more often than you probably care to think about.
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:43:26
Also it’s not like...pyramid pool schemes...
You’re not contributing to another’s wealth.
More keeping your existing wealths buying power in tact and because it is a scarce resource. Only about 18,000,000 will be used, it is more scarce than gold. Which litters our solar system. At the very least.
So your earned money holds its value. But also gains value because of what the last person was willing to buy and sell for. It’s not pooling cash. It’s simply what the market is willing to pay.
Similiar concept to gold

One of the laziest attempts at explaining reality. It’s unfortunate people become so comfy with such a dead end answer.
I think markbear was being facetious but we won’t be going very far if all our answers lie in planting seeds of complacency.
Believe what you want. But if it becomes your answer to damn near everything and allows you to diminish your educational and conversational returns, then you will lead one blind and bleak life.
I got one believe in no supreme deity, but if there was one it would probably want the entirety of the universe to fend for itself.
Seeing as there is literally a sea of resources floating around just this solar system, I think a lot of our problems are some manufactured bullshit due to corrupt practices of “godless” men, taking what they will to upend a system for the gain of a particular social subset.
We have been told there isn’t enough for everyone, that is far from the truth. We just need to work together in order for everyone to thrive. Resources everywhere for the taking.
Sure, we can’t access it all yet. But we could once we clean house and implement the technologies that will insure a more just and economically robust system comes to fruition.
It will simply take as much time as we push for

Ah so you weren’t being facetious.
If you think that I can explain where the universe came from then you’re mad. If I attempted to, I would be insincere.
All we know is what we can deduce from guesswork associated to mathematical processes that are proven right or wrong.
Leaps are made with educated guesses after hardworking scientists gain understanding of some part and they are proven right later when scientific consensus can be concluded.
For me, personally, the idea a supreme being crafted this single bubble of seemingly ever expanding space that holds streams of galaxies clashing and clustering, stretching and tearing time/space and simply being the only thing that can save us from the tainted teachings of a fallen archangel that itself couldn’t save or control when apparently they could control everything and everyone and guide them to their ultimate end goal..god
It’s exhaustingly redundant and increasingly insane.
It’s more likely a highly advanced race of beings created humanity than an entity outside and inside of everything that is so benevolent it intends only the best for mankind.
It’s more likely we are part of a system that expands and dissipates and maybe retracts then expands again.
Maybe we are one of many reactions in a multiversal process with different sets of physics that harbor different sequences of organization.
Again I cannot answer that.
You and I can both read the scientific literature/studies and watch all the lectures and talks.
But depending on how set you are in your ways, we will never reach similar conclusions on a deity or deities creating something that could be explained with further sleuth work and inductive reasoning.
Belief, in the sense of religious belief, not believing in love or someone or something(very different and we can all understand these differences I presume) doesn’t always create progress.
It often results in a centralized system which just becomes corrupt and the words of faith are used to move you into becoming a power mongers play thing.
Fairy tales weaved together from bits of folklore tens of thousands of years old doesn’t explain the universe any better now than it has attempted to in all its various forms for all the times countless others have tried.
So why don’t YOU try to not perpetuate the idea that it serves as anything more than comfort food for unaddressed existential crisis and enjoy the rich information we have been gifted with.
A lot of humans have died seeking power and information like we have available and still some fill their mind and soul with bleak curtains and wall off other streams of thoughts that could form.

A one mile wide asteroid, very small size, can hold $20 trillion worth of metals.
Sure we need to get better at identifying possible candidates just like oil companies needed some methods of efficiently finding and collecting oil.
The science will need to be refined :)
No doubt, so that the mining trips have as great a return as possible.
But the reward for the venture seems worth it, as far as I can discern.
And would probably allow us to realize just what is possible and a lot of viewpoints would change just with news like that.
I don’t see why things would collapse when we keep coming closer to doing things the majority say aren’t possible.
People keep saying nothing is going to come of it yet people are planning away
I believe I understand your fracking comparison.
But I don’t think oil compares. We are exploring other means of “energy exploitation”. Some exotic and totally impractical.
Some only become practical with understanding and exploration.
Maybe we won’t have fusion tokamaks in 2035-2050
But the fact we are actually able to carry out these processes shows we are on the brink of some amazing discoveries throughout sciences

Thank you!
Hardly a silly thought. I realized this several years ago as I’m sure anyone who is into astronomy/sci fi has. It’s truly one of the most thrilling things to contemplate.
I used to be hardcore into space colonization, which I still am, but I realized using fiat and maintaining some semblance of Society while carting about was absurd. Even with a digital representation it is still prone to hacking and corruption. Along with our energy production capabilities. The thought that we could maintain anything similar to an efficient solar system sized projects such as mining and colonization while continuing to use just fiat based systems, well, it inspires a big nasally scoff from me.
Just brings an image of a horse drawn stage coach shipping resources and cash to the colonies around the solar system.
Maybe something like that sets up the possibility for autonomous piracy. If you’re using machines and computer programs to ship only resources around that is.
With blockchain you could assume that with this wouldn’t happen if there was some internet setup somehow between Mars,Jupiter our planet and natural satellite, despite whatever lag. You would still be able to sync data faster by a system of lasers transferring information than being mr. space money bags hauling around your space cash in your fatass ship.
 
By that time though, bitcoin and a select few alts would be worth so much people probably wouldn’t consider even trying to pirate metals.(Hopefully because there is an even spread of resources amongst the growing population, there isn’t even a need for such acts. I am rooting for the best of cryptocurrencies capabilities, so there is that perceptual bias!)
There are plenty of nuances in setting up a solar system sized economic machine.
Transferring information and having a trustworthy means of transporting this value and info has to be totally different then this fiat catastrophe we live with today.
Blockchain could very well be a hell of a solution in maintaining fucking order.
I have a hard time seeing an economy that has humans working within the system and using it as a platform to not need incentives to continue without drastic philosophical and I suppose psychological transformation of social standards.
So some Star Trek, every resource is available for all humanity system, is as far away as our ability to efficiently produce/capture massive amounts of energy.
Blockchain has the ability to do so much. It’s up to us all to figure out these niches where it’s necessary.
Gonna be a pain in the ass. But that’s the way she goes
Value wise
With less than 19 million being accessible, the price is definitely capable of surpassing anything anyone thought of.
But this is a long run game. Maybe with the fruits of asteroid mining we gain so many new metals that it totally changes our perspective of natural resources and how we function and engineer buildings, computers, terrestrial/ airborne/ water vehicles etc.
Just the architectural possibilities get me all excited.
Which is one of the hopes right. A lot of speculation
But feasible all the same

Realisticalally it will end up hitting a bull run around February 2020 price will have risen over 2019 to 8,000-9,000 and start making a climb in late December possibly early January to the 10’s of thousands and once it bounces in its teens for a bit then it will sky rocket after bitcoins 11th birthday to settle near 90,000 and that will spark the huge FOMO wave and bring us to 160,000
Then after that there will be a halving and then there will be a lull until there is a sudden increase in price during the fall and the world sees a FOMO run like none has seen.
People will see a second chance and it will be seized

Who is your broker?
Be careful.
You can buy bitcoin from an exchange.
Decent exchanges might have an option to buy with cards directly. Decent exchanges are Binance and KuCoin.
Or you can use something like coinbase and send the bitcoin to a cold storage wallet or hot wallet on your phone.
Coinbase is essentially designed to be user friendly but there will be fees that they throw in.
To avoid these fees you can use coinbase pro, formerly Gdax, to move your USD balance from your bank transfer(done after account verification) and login to coinbase pro with same credentials you sign up with at coinbase, then avoid the fees by purchasing bitcoin from there. Keep some extra satoshis and move to your personal wallet or wallets.
Decent hot wallets (wallets that are going to be on internet connected devices) BRD, coinomi and some cold storage options would be a trezor or nano.
Buy hardware wallets straight from website for safety.
Learn how addresses work. Always do test sends with small amounts. Always make sure you entered the address correctly.
There is going to be years of self education ahead of you.
The sidebars in r/bitcoin should help as well

You’ll need to sign up for exchanges that have fiat offramps available.
Cashapp, coinbase can be easy to navigate as long as you know how to safely send your btc.
Edit: with coinbase you can connect your PayPal so you can transfer to your bank quickly.
If you are just signing up for an account though, it may take a few days if you have to verify.

That is possible.
It’s slow moving. But that doesn’t matter if you hold enough. I can see how it’s a problem at this point in time for anyone holding less than 0.1 but it can’t be counted as dead just yet. There are so many developments to undertake.
It may not be what everyone is looking for in a currency.
But it is doing its job well enough.
The time will come for other chains to prove what their models are capable of.
Until then the sovereign money outside of any countries domain is btc.
I’m all for more energy efficient solutions, but we have some time to wait before these things are properly implemented and we see the effect garnered with word of a better protocol being implemented in the digital world in regards to a sovereign, trustless, fast etc and outpacing what bitcoin gained during its life.
Before we even get to that we still have to have more than 1% of the global populace’s interest and I think we would have attained at least another 50% of public interest in utilizing crypto before we are even close to a block reward problem you bring up.
It’s a problem that can be simulated though. So maybe we’ll find out a likelihood before any emissions issues.
Also, bitcoin isn’t ineffective in what it does at all.

But that drastic noticeable difference comes after...say 15 years to be really noticeable.
Right now we are dealing with people who’ve been here since the ineffective musings of us idiots trolling on 4chan to traveling world wide and expanding their coding language and then some.
If there are any knowledgeable green crypto co that try to start now to replace bitcoin

Honestly. Couples should establish beforehand some savings plan. I’ve been in a similar situation but the money wasn’t even invested. It was just eaten or spent on frivolous shit that was sent to Salvation Army or goodwill.
Should OP have dumped every last cent of his savings into Bitcoin like that? It’s his prerogative.
I would suggest he takes some months to expand into researching other solid projects. But again. His money.
That isn’t much money to be honest anyways. Between the two of them, they both could work full time jobs and make that again in a year. Not counting living expenses at all, of course.
But I don’t think it shows that he isn’t willing to listen. If anything it proves that she was overly concerned about money that he never even had to give her a say in. And he invested it with the intent to make their world better.
He didn’t fuck about with it...so to speak hehe but OP may be better off.
He ignores her, rides this out. She hits him back up after some time during the price rise. He posts a screenshot of her trying to say she wants him back

Thank you for posting this.
These are subject matters I’ve thought about heavily since I first learned about Cryptocurrency years ago and realized they could interlock so many pieces of interplanetary travel and create a whole new financial ecosystem.
It’s exciting, enthralling to think that the stories about space travel I was read decades ago as a kid by my mom are within reach of humanities collective hand.
If I make it to 80 I have no doubt that we will experience some of the most beautiful and probably frightening times of our lives

Well that is kind of a contradictory statement. If not a complete oxymoron.
Hardly anyone truly provides for themselves anymore.
That’s the funny thing. Everything you earned came from someone else.
We all provide for each other and attempting to state you provided for yourself or your parents or grandparents did is still reaching. I would say that hunter gatherer lifestyle is more of the one that you may want to adopt. Or the one you want everyone to adopt.
But unfortunately what you want everyone to do isn’t feasible and it won’t solve anything.
Because what you talk about doesn’t provide results, because it has nothing to do with the growth that is coming in 21st and 22nd century.
We’re at the point where we need to be prepared and have a lot of ideas at hand in order to creatively guide ourselves through the problems we are sure to face as a global society.
But if you want to start a hunter gatherer revolution or join Amish society go ahead.
Meanwhile everyone who wants to participate in a technology driven society will need to do a little more mental acrobatics than walking into a room of mental gymnasts performing a little backwards tumble and saying “Boom, that’s how you do it losers” and actually believing you left those folk with an unforgettable lesson.
If you want everyone to provide for themselves then everyone should get their own planet and if they can start life on it and get it to grow plants they can eat then they succeeded. Yes. Let’s do that. That’s feasible. I don’t need to believe anything else other than you’re lazy if you don’t succeed..

Anti science especially
I try so damn hard to stay moderate because i have some conservative views and liberal views
Obviously the people that support bitcoin hère understand a pretty liberal concept...apparently, but still wax intellectual by throwing and wielding blanket statements of their “opposition” as shields and weapons. What does it do
Absolutely fucking nothing besides reinforce their weird, anti intellectual rants and delving deeper into idiosyncrasies related to their chosen adopted pre cognitive approach to life and from there on out they are always right. Yet always selfish.
Somehow their beliefs are insurmountable
Yet these children. Or maybe adults with sub consciousness that never change, now support something that is totally about liberating people in so many facets
In ways that would go against many conservative folks, of the religious types(possibly), beliefs.

What is your take on all of this?

The ideas and plans that have been formulated for executing the ideas.
How do you think emerging tech will affect humanity. Can we grow in a way that addresses global poverty?
Do you think companies sparking the true space race will have any positive impact on job growth and the types of jobs available.
Will governments provide incentives for re-education from other sectors which could translate prior job skills towards our colonization and setting up a possible lunar foundry? Is a lunar foundry even necessary?
What’s your take
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:05:56
The usefulness of the metals could easily outweigh that worry by the time any companies do begin the process.
Why do you think the United States passed the space act in 2015?
Any us based space firm holds the rights to own and sell natural resources they mine from whatever bodies they do seek in space.
So we have a new ocean, so to speak, to explore and it’s filled with a lot of riches.
A company gets an asteroid with rare metals maybe even interesting minerals.
That’s not even considering if there were biological organisms accidentally found. A happening upon transpermia in action would be a nice scientific discovery.
But the significance of a company having rights to what they mine means they can hold onto their finds, conduct research without having to go through bullshit trades to gain materials they need for any tech/hardware necessary to conduct experiments.
They sell/trade material they need. Governments can hoard their gold. Companies will get more of their own.
It’s going to be a very complex process. With so many factors that can create scenarios we can’t totally conceive.
So it’s better to prepare for what we can and cannot now
Bitcoin and blockchain can serve a purpose in the next steps humanity takes in our expansion.
We are growing.

You don’t even exactly need to be tech savvy to use privacy coins. But yes, it does take self education. Bitcoin being pseudonymous does make these alts necessary unless there is a soft fork in the future implementing privacy features.

[here](  are a [few]( of the many things you can read on the subjects and [privacy coins]( .

Crypt from the creeps, nobody but you can prevent forest fi..uhhh crypto losses, I mean..we will be your digital lockbox, we are creative
Cryptopia-your recently deceased loved one dies while leaving behind a 100 part treasure hunt to seek out their assets? Fuck that shit. Make life easy on your family and friends when you leave this plane of existence. So enter... (reading rainbow banner goes by) cryptopia!
Crips only- tired of bloods taking all your street cred, girls, money and making you and your foos look like fools? Well move your wealth into crip only. In the likely event you die in a street altercation with a rival gang member, we take the assets you left with us to launder into crypto! During the initial set up for the laundering process we procure a legal document in which you assign the names to whom the assets will go to once you’re murdered. So give your family the future you refused to create by ruining already fucked up neighborhoods, with Crips only. ^^^*Bloods ^^^are ^^^not ^^^restricted ^^^from ^^^our ^^^business ^^^model ^^^despite ^^^our ^^^name*

What do you want? If anything UBI is more of a hot stimulus injection coming from all directions that gives the economy what it needs to stay well oiled and turning.
That means better results in a lot of sectors and hopefully addresses the calamity that is our social welfare system. It would be stupid to allow the system that is in place to continue burning away cash.
With something like UBI thousands of orphans and young adults coming from dire housing situations and economic situations gain a chance at getting some job, a basic apartment (by themselves or with a roommate, depending on state) and actually feed themselves.
The right set up for UBI could make the point of having food stamps, unemployment etc all implemented on a blockchain system that could cross connect to blockchain possibly. How they approach the implementation is up to whomever pitches the best sales lines..
But all the technicalities aside, there is benefit. A truly efficient and straightforward benefit that would augment the day to day of millions.
I imagine that the psychological effect would be very uplifting in regards to alleviating your mind from focusing on how you will pay off everything within 2 weeks and what you may need to sacrifice paying for in order to make rent.
You can argue about budgeting, you can dispute that it goes against the American Dream.
But things are just going to get worse. Americans will become the most taken advantage of by corporations because they don’t « want socialsim » and your great country collapses because you couldn’t recognize that you didn’t want to reinforce the backbone of the country. It’s people.
And we haven’t even talked about the possibility of job scarcity becoming a problem with an increasingly automated workforce.
So again I ask, what do you want? How do you propose going about fixing the calamities within our, for simplicities sake, just within our social welfare/safety nets?

Not to mention. This could literally pave the way to allowing people to truly saying no to a job and not accepting one that they may not care for or have lied about being qualified for and wasting everyone’s time and energy after things don’t work out. It happens all the time.
I could see the likelihood of people becoming incentivized to then start taking on jobs/careers that actually delve into their varied interests. Or even lead people to starting their own small little companies again. With the internet and even the growing likelihood that peer to peer transactions will be deeply engrained in our day to day living, it’s not entirely improbable to to believe that this could bring a much bigger flow of value/wealth than ever before.
I mean, just having the confidence in knowing you can say no and not suffer with even mild anxiety about food and housing problems likely leaving you more than able to perform to the best of your abilities, would have to be one of the most empowering things a human could feel.
Incentive to not work, technically. But it’s easy enough to have anyone realize the disparities that could arise if they outright refuse to take the steps to ensuring their future with what society grants all.
Along with such a system would evolve its own musings and proverbial warnings and philosophical takes on what one might expect to happen negatively and positively.
Which is good. Some people might take advantage of the UBI in that they set up communities and pool money together to buy plots of land that they can live off of. Maybe people can pool their spare money towards projects they believe in. I mean their are so many probabilities and problems that will arise. As seems to be the motion of the universe. But it’s better than dealing with the problem of continuing to believe the system as it stands now will probably not leave tens of thousands in destitution. If not worse

Truly I believe that approach is exactly one of the catalysts that leads people to modes of thinking that lead to commuting acts of fraud.
The entire point of UBI is it attempts to address multiple economic, political and psychosocial problems with one fell swoop. Not 3-5 swoops of varying power born from uncertainty about the opponent “problems” in front of you.
I do hope better experiments come along. It’s a fantastic and surprisingly old idea. More than likely, a necessary one as well

Ok don’t listen to this cat.
BTC is bitcoin. Unfortunately we have some zealots, as some communities do, which hardforked blockchain, because they didn’t agree with direction of the coin/chain. They fork it, which is just how you make alts, as your quickest explanation.
They won’t state they are a fork, but the true vision. So yeah, watch out for that confusing perspective.
A lot of us in the space are dumbasses. Some more well informed, others just lurk.
Sorry you had to experience the BSV idiots straight off the bat.
Just be careful of people trying to say shit like this, because BTC is bitcoin. 
You can read about the hashwars, the BSV and BCH ,bitcoin cash, conundrum and so on, to gain some info on the delightful idiocy that sometimes takes place in these spaces.
We have left pure speculation territory, but now more than ever it’s necessary to be critical and skeptical
