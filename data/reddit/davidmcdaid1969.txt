I have a similar problem and no reply to escalated ticket. I tried to withdraw 2 BTC to my Trezor but 10hrs later and it just said "pending". My Trezor never acknowledged the transaction. The wallet address is correct as I've used it to withdraw from Kraken before (so it's not that as I used the drop down menu to choose the wallet address). 
After 10hrs of 'pending' I decided to use the red cross to cancel the withdrawal request. Then it changed to 'Cancel Requested' for three hours.
Now it says "canceled" but the funds have not gone back on my account.
Please can someone help as this is urgent and I can't wait for their support team as they seem to take forever to reply (literally forever).
Did any of you guys get your funds back after it changed to 'canceled'? How long did it take?

As a follow up, I can confirm that the 2 x BTC have just appeared back on  the account (just over 7hrs after I cancelled).  So, don't  panic folks, it's a glitch.
