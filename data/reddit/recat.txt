It's very sad that you can trust nobody with your bitcoins these days ... not even a licensed professional. :(
Am I the only one who honestly would not steal any amount of bitcoins around here?
Of course... There's no way to prove that.. But whatever.

Get the flying fuck out of florida. Florida's ground isn't safe.

Well if you payed attention you would know the differences between value stored as FIAT and value stored as gold or Bitcoin and you would see the amusement of the fact that the US dollar in modern day is no longer backed by gold, while it was before.

FIAT has direct relation to bitcoin. Don't even pretend it doesn't.

Coinbase is shit. Just send to a BTC address. Costs you 0.15$.

A pos system is a blank slate though. You could write your own software to do bitcoin transactions. Even if you have to remove existing software. Tablets are rather limited.

Needs a little bit more mass production.

Has eGifter shut down Walmart gift card sales?

I suggest everyone should run their web browsers in sandboxing software, such as SandBoxie.

Oops, that's just a display. Well, actually that gives be an even better idea. Get a touchscreen display and just any old computer! :D

I would REALLY suggest hacking up one of those touch-screen POS systems. I theyre x86 based and they're designed SPECIFICALLY to be robust enough for use in commercial environments.
(NOTE: I HAVENT OWNED THIS MODEL, ITS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I AM REFERRING TO. Review your item before you purchase anything. Also, check out craigslist. also, ask him if he's got any old POS's sitting back.)
