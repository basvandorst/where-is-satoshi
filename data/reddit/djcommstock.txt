When I started it was peaked at about 5k. I can only wish I could buy more at that price now. Don't worry too much about it if you plan on holding it for years. Just forget about it and check back in a few weeks.

Well my main advice is don't invest recklessly. Putting in a large portion of your finances into one type of asset is never a wise move.
That being said theres lots of exchanges for you to use depending on your native currency. You can also look into Bitcoin ATMs located all around the world. 
For wallets while you're just starting out just about anything free will do. Personally I use Electrum as my computer wallet, but there's a few android apps that you can use that will do. As you increase your position and the amount of funds I would highly suggest getting a brand new hardware wallet like a trezor nano s. Theyre a great tool thats simple to use for keeping your money safe.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:36:28
Oh, I see what you meant.
I was just making the point that in theory you're spending the same amount of money either way so its not changing the value that you spend by purchasing in either btc or fiat. Not recommending people that they should purchase in btc and then immediately restock their btc.
But if you bought that $50 game in btc when it was at 19k you would have gotten that game 25% off, just saying.

1. I understand that using it to store wealth is a thing, but that's obviously not the point I'm getting at. I also use it to store wealth, I wouldn't consider that being "used" since I have no intention to do anything with that portion for quite some time other than keep it cold.
2. The more people that adopt the use of BTC for transactions the higher demand that is created. Higher demand with an unchanged  supply (unchanged meaning at the pace it is mined currently) leads to higher price (simple economics). If you think that businesses adopting to accept btc is doing nothing for the value than idk how to help your poor soul.
3. People shaming themselves for purchases made in the past, typically 1 post on every page in this forum. People telling others to hodl and do nothing else. You get the idea.
4. Gold was used for common transactions less than 100 years ago. The US dollar used to be backed by gold, yes its not chipping out shavings of a gold bar you pull out of your pocket to pay for that morning coffee, but its still technically trading gold. I don't like the argument of comparing gold in general though because though its been a good store of value it does have other uses than just currency. (a conductor for pretty much every electronic)
5. Transaction fees are high now at this moment in time, but it wasn't always like that, it won't always be like that. Lightning network. Also ever try to clear a check at a bank, that can take up to a few days depending on the accounts, yet btc transactions weren't viable for transactions because of the time it takes to complete them?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:56:55
Why would you rather spend fiat though? If the fees for fiat and btc were the exact same, what would be the difference? They would both be the same exact value at that current time. Also I don't agree with thinking that people only spend btc because they're overextended into the market.

I get that, its tough right now with the fees, but it wasn't always like that and it won't always be like that. I just felt like I had to post this because I saw some shaming in a post about someone that purchased something.

my guess is that he doesn't actually even have that btc to begin with and was just messing with you. You would have to live under a rock to not hear about BTC being the price its at until now. If hes playing PUBG I'd imagine hes probably heard of the internet and knew about the btc price.

population grows, more houses need to be built, land value increases. Your not going to see real value of land depreciate, only inflated value of homes. As long as people still have sex, increasing the population, and those new people need a place to live: the real value of land will continue to appreciate

Are you just mad because someone with better knowledge on the subject disagrees with your opinion? The housing bubble was bad, yes. Almost collapsed the world economy, not even close. You’re a crazy person if you actually think that. Bubbles happen all the time, by your logic the dot-com bubble should have been the end of the internet.

It's still only at a 8% gain for 24 hours! Everyone sell and bring the price down to $5,000 so I can buy more

Coinbase (which is also Gdax) is a US business so its fairly safe to use. I recommend dollar cost averaging any large purchase amounts (ie buy some today, buy some next week, buy some week after, etc) just so in case there is a dip you can get better prices. After you purchase your btc, I would highly suggest using an offline wallet of some sort. Paper wallets work, hardware wallets like trezor or ledgers are great options too, and there are some software wallets that are good but I wouldn't recommend holding a large amount of btc on it for an extended period of time.
EDIT: you should buy using Gdax to lower fees, Coinbase is just the company that operates Gdax

Best advice is to buy what you can lose as stated. I assure you that buying your "dream car" is the shittiest  plan you can have. Buying a car will almost always result in a loss because its value depreciates. It's just a losing game there.
Best Strategy: Diversify
You're young, as am I. If I was in your position. I would invest a fair percentage maybe around 30-40% of my assets (cash) into risky things such as bitcoin, some tech company stocks, etc etc. You could put this whole risky % into bitcoin, but just know if bitcoin falls that's that.
Take another fair portion 30 - 40% and invest in something that will be more of a long term hold such as some simple companies that have strong backing behind them and a good track record (Disney, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc.) My recommendation would be some S&amp;P ETFs. S&amp;P ETFs are essentially betting on the United States Economy will still be around.
Probably would want to keep around 25% in just cash in case something comes up that you can invest your money into that you deem worthy, maybe buy an old guitar, car, whatever with intention to fix it and flip it for profit. Make take a class to learn useful skills that could lead to more money (ie. programming classes, IT certifications, learning how to weld metal, whatever it is). Point being that's some back up cash for when an opportunity arises.
I know since you're 16 you can't open up a trading account, but I would imagine your parents are probably smart enough to understand that if you have a set plan such as this, they would be willing to set one up for you. I can almost guarantee that they would be much happier to see you putting your money into investments rather than buying some car thats only going to cost you a lot more money down the road.
Disclaimer: Any advice that I've given I am not liable for the outcome of it. These are recommendations not guarantees, when it comes to investing there is always a risk that you will lose all of your money. Diversifying just limits the risk while also limiting potential gain. 
Yes you can throw all your money into bitcoin and pray that it reaches $100,000 a coin, but if it becomes worthless so does all the money you put into it. by diversifying you cover your own ass to a point.
EDIT: Also by contacting r/bitcoin you are reaching out to a very biased source (though everyone here seems to tell you mostly the truth). People are more likely here going to tell you bitcoin is going to reach the moon, which we all hope, but no one really knows.

When you bring it into a regulated currency you are taxed on the gains. So if you invested $1,000 and later took out $1,250, you will pay taxes on the $250 earned

A paper wallet is exactly what it sounds like its an offline wallet that is printed onto a piece of paper. They're cheap and easy to use (QR code to scan is also printed on it), but I would put it in an actual SAFE to keep from losing it. Very easy to misplace since again, its just a piece of paper. Personally after about $1k invested its best to just go onto amazon and buy a hardware ledger. They're about $100
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:50
bitcoin investments are treated like stock investments from what I understand.
You don't pay taxes on unrealized gains, only on realized ones. So if your money is in BTC it's not taxed because thats the investment and you haven't cashed out yet. When you exchange BTC for cash though it is considered a capital gain/loss and you pay taxes on the amount you gained. Which falls under capital gains tax (not income tax)

So if you buy bitcoin and leave it in bitcoin then taxes won't be applied to it because its considered an unrealized gain. You would have to pay taxes on it when you exchange it back into USD (or whatever currency you use) as a capital gains tax. The same way you would pay taxes on any sort of investment income.

True, a home can hold a value less than the value you paid for it, but it will always hold value, and over time, it will appreciate. At the time of purchase the price might have been inflated, but there's still always physical land behind it which its real value will always appreciate.
If you were to buy a house for $500,000 during a period of market inflation, but then the market crashes the next year and your house is now worth $300,000 you are at a loss for that time being. In 20 years though, its probably going to be worth more than your initial investment and will appreciate to a far greater value because.

Just buy it. Why worry about dips if you don't have any position in it in the first place
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:57:22
Okay, but when it comes to the fact that you have say only $1,000 to buy btc with, buying at a price point that is lower would obviously be better. The point I was trying to make is that it's better to just buy it when you can rather than trying to just get it at some "ideal" price.

Instead of feeling bad that you purchased things with bitcoin years ago, you should feel glad that you contributed to what it is now. hindsight is 20/20, but if no one ever used btc to buy and sell stuff with, it wouldn't be where it is now.
So be happy that you directly helped make btc what it is worth today. Shout out to my purchase for $200 worth around $8,000 today

You can link your bank account to coinbase and transfer your money in and out. Make sure to read into how to use Gdax though to limit your fees
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:22
I believe it depends on the amount of BTC that you’re sending, I’m not 100% sure on this part. But typically whenever I move a few hundred around there’s a $2 fee to transfer it from one wallet to another
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:53:06
Same thing happened to me but I opened a support ticket with them and within about a day it was fixed and I could use Gdax. I suggest the same thing since their support was pretty quick and helpful. On coinbase the fees are pretty outrageous.
The only time I would recommend using coinbase over Gdax is if you need to purchase coins at a dip and you don't have USD stored in Gdax. Since Gdax is only an exchange you cant lock in a btc price point without already having USD in your account ready to go.

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:16:12
It really depends on what you think will happen in the future. If you're buying to hold long term because you think the price will get to 100k than it doesnt matter (relatively speaking) if you buy it at 4k or 7k. That being said, DCA is the best way to mitigate risk, but you pay a premium sometimes to do so.

@_date: 2017-11-15 18:25:45
Not often do I say that its better to buy from coinbase, but with the dip as low as it was the fees make up for the fact that I got to buy at a lower price. I'd rather pay $300 at a price point equal to 6500 (after fees) than pay $300 at a price point of 7100 (no fees)

So Coinbase has a delay and a fee, since they lock in a price point, wait for your bank to transfer money, coinbase creates the order and waits for it to be filled.
With Gdax when you transfer your USD to them and it sits in their account, when you purchase BTC it is instant. The only delays you suffer is A. When your bank account is transferring money into your Gdax account. (2- 4 business days) B. When you are withdrawing BTC from your gdax account into your private wallet. (typically 30 - 90mins depending on the blockchain)
The actual exchange of USD for BTC in gdax has no delay because you are creating the actual order and then someone fills the order. So the btc becomes available instant
Side note: Depending on how much BTC you are planning on buying  / selling pay attention to withdraw limits. (ie. they don't just let you withdraw $1million overnight, because they don't hold that much cash on demand)

A home is not really a speculative asset. The price of land will always have value. As much as it pains me to say it, bitcoin has value we give it, there's nothing intrinsic behind it
