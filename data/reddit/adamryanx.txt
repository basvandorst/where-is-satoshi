Btw those who down voted this comment (above) are morons. Buffett doesn't understand BitCoin and this quote proves it. Accept it.

Logic goes the other way around too- it's nice to have the aoo because then you don't need the card.

Nice straw man. What's the weather like up your own ass?

How do I tip you? I wanna throw doge at you because you are awesome.

No, you're totally right. He should give his fortune away when he doesn't have to. Good point. You're a genius.

Please elaborate on this.

Taxes? Hahahhaha. No, you don't need to pay taxes on BitCoins. It's an anonymous currency, remember? Use that to your advantage. The gov't doesn't deserve any of these winnings and you're actually in a position now to be able to AVOID paying taxes since they sent you all 10 at once (unlike, for example, hitting it big in Vegas where the taxes are calculated and taken out right then and there). Be smart. Hoard them and don't let any moron convince you of selling them for USD. You'll lose money in the conversion and taxes. It's a stupid move. 
Rockefeller didn't become Rockefeller by listening to the advice that told him to play it safe.

Wow. Dick.

Ah, so the old geezer doesn't understand it. Thanks for posting this.

Turn around and stay still. I'm totally not taking a picture of your butt. Promise.

Why take the risk? BECAUSE IT'S A CRAP LOAD OF MONEY.
The IRS can do an audit? So what. *"My computer crashed and I lost all my BitCoins. I never got to cash them out."*. 
They can't tax you on income they can't prove you have.

TheSelfGoverned makes a good point here, Dr. We literally could make hundreds of dollars here.
