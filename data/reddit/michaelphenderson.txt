I bought 1000 shares of OSTK when I read that yesterday.

I thought the same thing about billpay, PayPal, and eBay.  Boy was I wrong.

Wonder how that will work in an ira.  I guess they just hold in a different wallet?  But makes the stock not fungible anymore no?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:46:10
Both sides are

Everyone will figure out what miners already know.  Shitcoins are shit and only good for trading for btc

Saying anything positive about bch in this sub typically results in a ban.

Ban hammer in 3..2..1...

Mining might slow?  I'm guessing it's going to slow A LOT in 10 days.  Core needs to stopping making decisions based on what's good for their pocket books and make them based on what's good for the network.  Increase the block size already!

Thank you all for the suggestions.  Sounds like it's either slow and on par with credit card fee or fast and expensive.  I should have mentioned that I wanted it to be a demonstration.  I want to show people how it works.  Since that doesn't seem possible at the moment.  I've decided to gift them the paper wallets as suggested and then also gift them a small amount of litecoin in real time.

Why is space on a blockchain precious?  
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:38:20
Sorry if this has been addressed before, but why doesn't core just accept the 2x change?  Isn't it suppose to be consensus?  
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:05:13
Half a pizza no?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:16:31
That's debatable.  I would say it is already money to you and me and will soon be money to everyone.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:23:26
Lol people with different opinions and ideas are always an attack on the establishment. Core acting like the us government.

Was serious.  I got a notice that they were cashing out all of the bcc and distributing the cash to stock holders.  Should be a little over 180.000 being liquidated, can't remember the dates if said though.

Probably put it cryptopia, last time I had it on hitbtc and it took forever.  If you keep them in your private wallet it might be awhile before they allow external deposits while still allowing to sell the forked coins on their exchange.

Why you think silver market is scam?  Seems like only decent precious metal market to me.

I think you missed the point of the comic.

It's not in my house ��.  It's in some vault somewhere 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:19:39
Gotcha nm then, that won't be good.

Religious views blew me away (being in Bible Belt)
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:19:19
Gbtc cashing out their bcc?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:50:46
Yes it is.

Naw man you would have sold it all the first time it reached 10x what you paid.  You wouldn't have known the future.  I bought AOL stock when it first went  public with my college loan.  Me holding until it peaked would mean I basically never did another investment.  People and the world just don't work that way.
