This was a pretty good answer. Thanks

I understand but as of now it represents so a needle in the haystack of our economy and all kinds of assets can be seen this way as well

What percent of the total budget is that?  I actually have no idea but if the budget is in the trillions or hundreds of billions that might not actually be bad but if its 1% or more then thats horrible

Lol seriously nobody cares about bitcoins most politicians don't even know what it is or that it exists

I like the idea of cryptocurrency but currency and humor is not where I will be banking

This is a big one. Can you guys service the country of Armenia. I have relatives there and sending money to them is slow and somewhat pricey between 3 and 5 percent. It would be amazing to be able to send a bitcoin immediately to Armenia and have a relative of mine exchange it at bitcoin for us dollars. This would be revolutionary for Armenia because a very large portion of income comes from outside of Armenia.

I agree that it does give credit to what Bitcoin is and can be but at the end of the day we did just potentially lose hundreds of millions of buyers especially the kind of buyers who were actually spending it thus creating higher volume and a higher price.  Its a big hit against Bitcoin.  Just hold onto Bitcoin because when other emerging markets like India come in we will again see this sort of spike.

I feel like this only means there will be a higher mark up on the Bitcoin price for china

I understand what you mean. But 20 years has ups n downs. But recent activity suggests a steady growth. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:03:18
Oh I like that thanks
@_date: 2013-09-05 21:09:40
So far to verify all I had to do is give them my online login info. I don't see any other verification steps

@_date: 2013-09-05 04:11:50
Wow thanks. What are their prices like compared to bit stamp or coinbase 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:34:48

@_date: 2013-10-19 20:57:59
What does this couch thing mean. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 19:57:52
I was thinking something along that line. Great video thank you 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:00:19
This really is something I always wondered is if a big bank would compete and honestly I think all it really does is that it highlights Bitcoin as a solid system that even a huge bank would go after.  It'll be like google flopping with Google plus only to make Facebook look better

What kind of food?
