It's seriously a joke. But I'm sure I was able to get a few interested in it because of how well it has treated me.

Definitely renting a lambo

I don't genuinely feel bad at all. I only share my great experiences with it.. never told them when to buy.  Not my fault at all, this is a joke lol

Wow you're quick to judge lol. Does it say anywhere in the post that I told them to buy? NO... It was simply due to my prosperity in it that caused others around to hop on board just like every other person and their mother who had FOMO at the top. If anybody knows a thing about trading, that's the point where you get stuck holding the bag.  
You people on here take stuff way to serious, this was meant as a joke.

Yeah I suppose it's because only a select few would actually pay the crazy fees the ATMs charge instead of going online for it.

That would be cool to know. I mean it's only going to become a full fledged currency if we spend it right?

There was like a 10% fee added  to your final cost

I think Bobby Lee has been very level headed through it all so far and I'd bet on his predictions first

Same thing with plate customization on Forza horizon 4

I'm totally down for this! I'd put in $100

What would be even cooler would be to pay them in Bitcoin for the ad!
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:50:12
Amen to that, TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!
