I didn’t commit

Or they try by jumping on here and asking and getting savaged away for ‘noob’ questions
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:35:10
Exactly. This guys ball went long ago

So pretty much the same as any other house purchase?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:12:55
Both, and neither. it took a massive dive soon after he mentioned it would. Now he is saying you should own some indicating it will continue to rise. I mean you shouldn’t be basing your trades on what other people advise unless they are specifically targeting you though

Well congratulations on your milestone :)

Was just thinking which currency

Was just about to mention this. Mark Cuban is actually really intelligent and worth listening to
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:51:38
That was my point, in which currency? It’s already hit 10k in AUD and other currencies. Sorry I’m aware he is most likely talking in USD but I didn’t realise the joke needed to be explained

When he owns 10000 BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:10:35
I don’t think this would be passed until mainstream adoption as it would be seen as using the nobel prize for a publicity stunt. The more unstable the price of bitcoin, the less chance you would have of achieving this

A decent comparison, noticeably absent of moon landings and overpriced cars. Worth the read

Hold on, i don’t see why it has anything to do with a credit bubble. Bubbles burst when there is too much pressure right? In other words too much supply and not enough demand. That’s oversimplifying things because there will ALWAYS be demand for credit. So in this case it would happen when there is too much credit supplied than is able to be paid back. Happens all the time. The thing is that government and banks are able to step in and control this with interest rates/inflation. This is where I assume you think bitcoin will step in and take over because it bypasses both the government and banks. Supposedly. In this instance I can’t see a real world case for bitcoin being used for credit unless banks and government adopt it as an asset. But that won’t happen because of the anonymity and vulnerability that comes with that. They wouldn’t be able to track fraud on credit for example. I just think this is totally misguided. But you’re welcome to correct me when I’m wrong

Yeah what he said makes so much sense to a freshman^^
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:20:28
Ok no generally I wasn’t sorry, but on that point I personally use my credit card for bills absolutely. So does my business. That is besides the point however as it doesn’t address he issue of people still needing credit and vendors accepting payment by credit
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:46:52
I understand supply and demand but I don’t understand why bitcoin would ever replace credit cards. Not even that I don’t understand, I blatantly disagree
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:46:51
There we go, a full comment we can agree on :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:02:26
Ok so firstly, it’s for this scenarios purpose only but it’s relevant even with what you are saying because you are assuming that a grocer who doesn’t want to use banks doesn’t HAVE to use banks in this scenario. See a grocer has wages to pay, taxes to pay, bills to pay, stock to buy and customers payments to accept. Unless all the grocers customers, suppliers, utility providers, landlord and employees etc etc, ALL don’t want to use a bank ( that circle expands exponentially by the way), then poor grocer does have to use a bank whether it’s against his wishes or not
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:07:16
Again I agree but I sense you are seeing this from a strong USA stance. I’m from Australia, and what I mean by that is that you are talking on a global scale but possibly thinking on a national scale.
Also, with what you are saying in mind, does bitcoin still fit the bill? They are huge shoes to fill, and would require MASS adoption which is why investors still buy in due to speculation. But in a real world scenario does bitcoin really fit that bill. Is bitcoin, with all its values and all its flaws, able to fulfill the role of being a global financial reserve - even long term?
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:33:34
True - bitcoin is faster at settlement that today’s providers. There are better in this domain however. I don’t know if you follow other coins also but let me give you a scenario. Right now, ripple or XRP is easing its way into financial institutions by not going against their interests and instead working alongside them. For our purposes if we focus on the fact that ripple provides extremely fast settlement time, up to 60% cheaper than what banks are currently paying. Let’s say mass adoption of ripple and XRP takes place globally throughout financial institutions. Where does that leave bitcoin for this purpose? 
The way I see it is, bitcoin is slower and more expensive than ripple and therefore it won’t be adopted as a settlement provider. This however does not change the fact that people hold and value bitcoin. Ripple is able to be used to transfer both fiat and cryptos. So back to my original point- I don’t hate bitcoin, I own some. But I don’t see a real world purpose other than a store of perceived value. I just think as a global reserve is a too extreme speculation for it and it’s perceived value today and ongoing for a while is reliant on people (99.9999% of the population right now) not truly understanding blockchain and its capabilities, or understanding paychology and how markets work, and using hearsay rather than facts to buy into the ‘brand’ that is bitcoin

I have one. The biggest problem an American Express cardholder faces are the fees passed on from Amex-merchant-retailer-consumer. Other than that it’s a good card

Firstly, no I am EXACTLY correct in saying that bubbles burst under too much pressure. That was a metaphor for the rest of my discussion.
Instead of being a complete fuckstick, read a little more into what I’m saying. I agree somewhat about your credit bubble, however, you say that interest rates and inflation can only guide credit valuation for so long. What is it that you suggest is going to detract from this being the case? Is your ‘for so long’ going to end suddenly after all these centuries? If so, I MUST reevaluate my understanding of markets and the financial world altogether.
Again, I agree that BTC will not replace credit and I agree that I am unsure about whether another crypto will or is capable of doing so. Sorry, I mustn’t have been clear about the anonymity. Because I agree also that bitcoin is not anonymous, however, it is largely perceived to be and that is one reason why there is a lot of perceived value in this particular coin, wrong as it may be.
I am not saying that bitcoin is not a good investment right now as I don’t like to give investment advice. If this is why your feelings have been hurt by my comments, you shouldn’t be investing with emotion.
Besides this, may I ask, which of my premises are wrong?
