Ofc I am doing own research, I only invest in coins if I see a potential use of this coin for example IOTA in M2M or payment method, but I also hold Cardano which is the better Ether in my opinion and some others.. but I don’t see any use for bitcoin. For me its overhyped, ppl who want to buy alt coins have to buy btc and that might push the exchange rate.. because of that I wanted to hear why ppl invest in bitcoin, I mean the scaling problem is real and why are ppl trusting this coin tho

Well it was overvalued in my opinion..

I am sure that bitcoin will grow in long term. But do you guys don’t fear the obvious problem of btc? Talking about scalability and transaction costs. Dont get me wrong, no shitstorm I just want to know what these hodlers are thinking. As a noob I‘d rather invest something like IOTA, which obviously doesn’t face these problems if it’s really working. Convince me please.

I‘ve seen many posts with thousands of downvotes mentioning these problems... either it’s just a problem in my eyes or fanboys are just ignoring it. I dont know.. I got mine out at 17.5k$ and spread it in some alt coins. Wise choice says my Blockfolio ;)

Wow! Someone having early Christmas this year, i guess you have them already a few years so tax free money;)
If I‘d be you i would leave the btc aside, maybe get a little bit of alt coins just for fun and the most important I‘d cash a bit out and get my family on a nice holiday together. Miss the ild times. Enjoy!
