Yes. On iOS I'm using iPGMail. It's been the best for me so far.

Plus signing! Everyone is focusing on encryption and not signing. It's nice knowing that messages purporting to be from Facebook are really from Facebook without having to dig into the headers.

No. That's why I said: "I know that, at the very least, this has to be a US-centric view given the international nature of the currency."

Not yet, but I'd like to. What's the usual day/time?

I think perception could make a difference in adoption in some places, yes. That's why it concerns me.

I didn't forget about China! Or any other country. I specifically said in my post that I realize that this has to be a view that exists within the U.S. I'm asking about within the U.S., specifically.

Apologies. It was not my intention. My post was sincere, and I felt like the rest of the text did justice to my question.

I do understand PGP, TOR and Bitcoin tumbling, actually.
My point, and what I think you might be missing, is that there's a lot more to operational security than just what you're doing in the digital realm. Those things are all helpful, yes. However, assuming a lazy dealer decrypts your address and leaves it exposed either digitally or physically, then what law enforcement then has is probable cause. They may not be able to tie BTC or network traffic to you in court. The existence of your address may not be enough to prove it in court. What it gives them is a solid lead to hunt and probable cause to get warrants to watch you more closely. If I'm buying drugs on the Internet, I don't want to be identified at all. If law enforcement has identified my address as suspicious, then I've already failed.
To be clear, I'm not buying drugs on the Internet and I'm not trying to be contrary for the sake of arguing. I'm just pointing out that OpSec and real anonymity are actually pretty hard to do.

Sure, you encrypt your address before you send it. So, what? The NSA didn't read it when it was going by on the wire?
The reality is that it was promptly decrypted by some shitty dealer, saved in a plaintext file, and/or printed out for shipping labels. If the dealer is caught, that encryption won't mean a thing. 
Besides that, if the dealer has the ability to decrypt it, don't you think they will as soon as they get caught and the cops offer them a deal to give up all of their customers?
Encryption isn't a panacea. OpSec is equally (if not more) important and everyone seems pretty bad at it.

Not a troll post. I saw a bunch of twitter post like the one I linked up top, and it genuinely bothered me. I was not aware that there was a perception in the U.S. that only white guys are into Bitcoin. I actually thought of Bitcoin as bigger than that.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:56:27
To be clear, this is not my view. It's a plethora of Twitter posts like this that lead me to ask the question:
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:28:37
Oh hey. I walk by your car in the ATC parking deck almost every day. Nice ride.
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:45:04
Because parts are their only cost? Margins have to cover a lot more than that.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:53:15
Wait. What? If you have a mailing address then it's pretty easy to put together who it belongs to. Right? I understand there may be no proof of who the BTC came from, but if your address is found on a shipping label at a Silk Road dealer's home, I think it'd be safe to say you're less than hidden.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:37:09
No. What makes me sad is the possible perception within the U.S. that  Bitcoin is something only white males are into. I think Bitcoin has too much potential for it to be pigeonholed that way. That is why I asked.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:55:29
I don't disagree. It doesn't prove anything. It would, however, probably get your neighbor a visit from law enforcement. If you're trying to be anonymous and hide in plain sight, I'm assuming visits or attention from law enforcement are something you'd like to avoid. That's all I'm arguing.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:39:11
I'd love to give it a try. Still have any invites?
