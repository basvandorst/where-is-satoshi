the electricity cost is too expensive for people to run mega bitcoin mining.
china electricity bill is still low.
maybe you want to start mining factory in india, indonesia, etc?

if I can buy something with bitcoin, I will. the experience itself (when I bought some humblebundle when they were still accepting btc) was... amazing. 
no fill whatever form, name, creditcard number etc. just scan and done.
my problem is, it's kinda hard to buy more bitcoin in where I live (3rd world). the fee is kinda high

it will continue to drop for the following week. keep buying bit by bit. to average your investment.
dont try to catch a falling knife. (ie. selling when it fall)

this is not the dip. this is the bulltrap. dip is when it goes below (or just slightly above) the price before the crazy ride (1200)
it will. prepare for AT LEAST 1500. probably lower
