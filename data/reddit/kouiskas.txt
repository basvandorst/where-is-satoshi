I'm a WMF employee (technically a contractor, I guess, since I'm based in Europe). I'd enjoy being paid in bitcoin in part or fully if it were an option.
In fact, as a contractor, if I were paid fully in bitcoin it would save the foundation the wiring fees they pay weekly. Or for people who don't have a business entity to bill the foundation with, possibly part or all of the 11% fees charged by oDesk.
To me a big appeal of getting paid in bitcoins, even if just a small percentage of my salary, is that it's a very safe way to acquire bitcoins. At the moment buying bitcoins in person or on exchanges is often risky. Which is probably the main reason why it's still mostly tech-savvy people who get coins and spend them.
While most WMF employees certainly won't be interested in getting paid 100% of their salary in bitcoin, you might find that quite a few of them would be interested in getting 1% of their salary in bitcoin or some small amount like that. Just because it's an easy and safe way to start experimenting with a cool technology. It's probably worth having the discussion to see how many employees would really be interested, anyway. Even if it doesn't actually happen for a variety of reasons.

Please tell them that everyone who has money locked at bitcoin-24 is eagerly waiting to get it all back... Personally I don't care if I have to get it back from the German authorities, the Polish authorities or from bitcoin-24. I just need to know if, how and when I'll be able to get it back.

I've bought 158BTC for about 5500€ (now worth roughly 7900€, I guess?), I'll be adding 50000€ in 10k chunks over the next couple of weeks. Long term investment. If that big investment goes well in the short term (i.e. moves into the "I don't have to be worried about the price every day" zone) I'll probably keep buying around 4000€ worth every month.
50K€ is about half of what I had in long-term savings account at my bank. I've never invested in anything risky before, I always went for the super safe, guaranteed returns stuff. But that type of investment is barely keeping up with inflation anymore.
I believe in the future of BTC in its own right and its long-term value. However if I decide to retire in the next couple of years I might have to cash some or all of it out back to fiat, because I doubt that I'll be able to buy real estate with BTC where I live. The common folk just won't adopt it that fast.
Also in my rare spare time I'm working on a BTC-based online service. Something purely BTC, no other currencies going in or out, not using anything like bitpay, because I think that developing the real BTC economy is important. Even if the exchange rate is so volatile right now, I hope that services like the one I'm working on will help people start thinking in BTC.
