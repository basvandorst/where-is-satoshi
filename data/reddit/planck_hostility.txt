It's about market orders versus limit orders.
A market order says "I want to buy (or sell) at whatever the current market price is."
A limit order says "I want to buy (or sell) at this price or better."
If the highest buy limit order is for $200 and the lowest sell limit order is for $250, nothing is going to happen.
Until, that is, somebody comes in with a market order, comes in and says "I want to buy at whatever the going rate is."  Then he fills the $250 order.  Price monitors report the most recent trade occurred at $250.  Suppose the next lowest sell order is for $300.  Then the next market order buyer has to buy at $300.  Price monitors report the price continuing to rise.
So yes, every transaction has a buyer and a seller, but if there are more market buyers (i.e. more people saying "I'll buy at whatever the going rate is"), the price will tend to rise, and if there are more market sellers, the price will tend to fall.

Assumption 1 is wrong.  Bitcoin has value primarily as a speculative asset: people buy it because they think it will increase in price and they will thereby make money.  The definition of a bubble.
Before that, yes, the only value it had was as a black market currency.  But this value remains whether it's deflationary or not because for people who want illegal goods, a deflationary currency is better than no access to illegal goods whatsoever.
Silk Road made Bitcoin a thing, speculation made it a bubble.
All other uses of Bitcoin, including as a general-purpose currency, remained hypothetical and were never actualized in people's actual behavior, and actual behavior is all that matters.
