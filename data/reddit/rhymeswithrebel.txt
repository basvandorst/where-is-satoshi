Hey guys!  As many of you know, the situation with modern media platforms is pretty lousy.  Regardless of where you go to share or watch content, you’re pretty much stuck with content gatekeepers, DRM, overhead, intrusive ads, and total loss of privacy.  Worse, if you want to buy or sell anything, you’re stuck dealing with traditional payment processors like the credit card networks, Paypal, and Amazon payments. 
**We’d like to fix that.**  Nebel.TV is a peer-to-peer media distribution network for Android and dedicated hardware devices - no central authority, no gatekeepers, no DRM, and it’s all encrypted for your privacy.  Media is bought and sold via Bitcoin micropayments, and you discover content naturally from your friends on the network. We plan to use blockchain technology extensively for content sidechain pegging and public digital signatures.  
Along with using Bitcoin to buy and sell media, we’re also introducing an entirely new kind of advertising model.  Advertising is completely optional, but if you chose to enable it, you get Bitcoin micropayments every time you got to watch an ad.  You can then turn around and spend those Bitcoins on content, or cash them out to a private wallet.  This payment model can only exist by utilizing the low fees and security of the Bitcoin network, and we think it’s more sustainable in the long run.
Nebel.TV is still under active development, and we need the support of crowdfunding to finish it.  Please check us out, and if you like what you see, help us spread the words to your friends, and consider backing.  We’ll be doing an AMA later in the week, so stay tuned!
