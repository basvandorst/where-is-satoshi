He said his Paypal limit had been reached due to offloading BTC previously

I sent him £ not BTC

I thought this might be the case, he has transfer options for Hong Kong and Belgium also. Maybe these 3 places are preferred due to low taxes and such.

One transaction was done with a guy with an Isle of Man bank account who was listed in the US Dollar section for some reason. Transaction was a simple, I asked if £ were ok, he said yes, I transferred my money and he transferred the BTC.
Another guy did payments in only $100 USD, but wanted it in the form of an Amazon gift card, I went on Amazon.com bought one, got the gift card code from my email address and we did the transaction.
Both successful transactions so far. In all I now have about $700 of BTC, for the rate that is posted on the charts.

I found one guy with an Isle of Man bank account and did a successful transfer with him. I seen another few UK bank accounts there. You should search under "other online payment methods" there may be some sellers there that suit you.

Why not?

Is it possible to track him using this method?
or maybe GPS metadata from his passport photo?

I will definitely do this eventually, he's just caused me too much inconvenience to get away from this

Very helpful. Thanks for the support

Are you kidding? GPS metadata is increasingly common in cameras today. Of course getting an IP address from a pic is not possible but the metadata could be used to store GPS details

UK, he had a UK passport anyway. Bank was Royal Bank of Scotland

Don't think its that one. I think his username was ferrariman something, I cannot find the listing again

Way too many assumptions is your comment to be taken seriously
