Nathaniel Popper is certain that he met Nick Szabo, though his description didn't seem a good match with the recent photo

That question is the reason why data such as this, which removes all long transaction chains, has been published at the same site for years.
That's probably only useful for people who actually care about objective truth, though, and not ignoring evidence that doesn't fit their preconceived ideas.

Lawsky's saying the laws are so old that they're outdated, can't be used for new form of currency. You wouldn't agree with it?

I had no trouble with withdrawing a few dollars about half an hour ago
the Purse.io wallet (chain of P2SH addresses) which my payment came from still has money in now

I got a phone from coinsfortech.com yesterday. Site's OK, not much selection and searching didn't always find things it should find.
This ain't nothing flashy, but it's my first big BTC buy
 
Purchasing was easy and fast. It's like using a credit card, but, there's a difference
It's like using a credit card, but without the anxious wait to see if a foreign bank I never heard of before is gonna spit my money back at me because I spelled my address wrong or they decided I'm in the wrong country or I bought too many things this week. There's no layers of security theater crud, no anti fraud and pin codes, no badly-coded validation popup or 'verified by visa' shit. I just pay, and the money goes where I send it. If I fucked it up, that's my problem. 
One other thing. No fees
Because of the free shipping offer they did for black friday, the price is in the same ballpark as I would have paid if I had shopped locally. Now I wait for delivery
