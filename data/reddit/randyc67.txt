@_date: 2017-12-03 12:44:13
I commented coz  bitcoin.com is a known site of roger ver and is a proponent of bcash... many post here in reddit are advising people to transact on other site if u wish to get BTC ..., but maybe they change i dont know coz i dont have and wont have bcash.... bitcoin.org is a website for BTC

I don’t know about you but i was hoping that it goes down till 3.5k so i can buy more
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:18:41
i think this was trigger which made the B2X proponent drop segwit2x… Mr. Nick Szabo endorsing NO2X movement… hell you can’t fight “Mr. Nakamoto”… what if he dumps his B2X coins and flooded the market… bye bye to all NYA supporters..

we the BTC community NEVER FORGET………….
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:11:39
Maybe its wise to diversify and sell some of BTC while its hot.... if B2x push thru and without replay protection... many of those using coinbase may lose their hard earned money thru replay attack... most of us here nows to hodl until it clears.... but the majority of new coinbase users dont... a class action suit may make an exchange weak and vulnerable... thus affecting the price of the BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:00:02
Thanks from the bottom of our heart

Death spiral maybe for bch.... BTC  is what people are excited about... and these drive investment company to BTC and not some other wannabe...  but if it dips then all and even thise who are diehard supporters of BCH will certainly buy... why because it is THE REAL BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:25
don't be.... this is just a pump and dump...

never enough…. 1 then two then …… you get my point… at first you say that 1 coin will cover all then you realize that why not just hodl 1 then buy another that you will spend for a good life… then you think hodl 2 then buy another for the same reason….. too tiring. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:02:51
Try paybis.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:22:19
I likewise ask them regarding segwit2x and their response was non committal... this was a few days ago... even Abra was non committal... so better put your btc to a hardware wallet or bread if your using ios or android (not sure regarding android)
Never leave your btc on any of the above or you might lose it if they got hacked or have a technical problem... or much worse since they support B2x they might just swap it with those...
Just my 2 cents
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:05:11
Try paybis
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:25:33
Breadwallet.... just download it on the apple appstore
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:37:56
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:59:08
Downloaded it... seems to be very promising... thanks
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:04:08
Im in the same boat as you... got Btc, xrp, eth and litecoin... but the problem in my country is that there is no exchange for altcoins so if you want for example eth you have to convert 1st btc to eth... and there's the mining fee... so i was thinking why not just keep the btc abd convert the rest to btc...  coz all follows to btc... btw i am not a trader, i am a hodler... hope you get what i am trying to convey... 
Just my two cents
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:06:59
I agree.... ledgerx will drive the BTC price beyond comprehension ��

what happens if the BTC core developers, upon frustation with the 2x group, decided to jump ship to litecoin since litecoin is almost identical...
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:48:28
BITCOIN core of course
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:48:28
Maybe do ab apple watch version and can be use as a complication or watch face

Yup you may... just make sure you close the bitcoin core software properly before powering down your laptop
