I disagree with your statement completely! There is a difference between verifying your identity, and the extraordinarily intrusive documents, questions, and compliance that is being required by some exchanges!

Bitcoin still has by far the biggest infrastructure for actual use.  However, if bitcoin cannot be both a transactional system, and store of value, with low fees and quick confirmations, it will become the  MySpace of social media.  
Bitcoin has a quickly shrinking window of time in which to solve the long confirmation times,  and high fee issue.  If the community does not come to consensus on a proposal soon, bitcoin will flame out and go down in history with Napster, MySpace, and Beta vcr’s. 
I hate to see that happen, as I’ve been onboard the bitcoin train since mid 2013.  We need a larger block size now, as a short term solution to provide transaction capacity as a bridge to get to lightning and other technologies.  The inability of the community to achieve consensus on key issues could realistically be bitcoins downfall.

No,  mixers do not offer much privacy anymore at all.   That’s a common misunderstanding people have.  Mixers are effectively useless since the advent of advanced blockchain analysis tools like chainalysis.  
The bitcoin blockchain ledger is fully public and with advanced analysis tools, they know if money was sent to you from a dark net market, and if you sent it to a mixer, and they can determine how many you sent through the mixer, and how many you receive back, regardless of if they come in different amounts at different times.  It is not hard for modern chainalysis to connect the dots on your entire bitcoin history, present and future.
If you want to mix your coin, skip the mixer, goto morphtoken.com and convert your coin to Monero (it’s cheaper than a mixer also). Once you convert to monero, transfer it to another Monero wallet to put distance between your coin and the morph token offramp..
Now you have a coin that’s private and anonymous and you can send it to an exchange like kraken to convert to usd, and nobody is able to determine when you got that coin, how much of it  you have, who you got it from, etc.
It’s like a cash transaction, nobody needs to know the details unless you decide to share it with them.

Increased use brings along increased tx fees...  however, in order to scale to the point that tx fees alone can cover the mining costs, we will need To be able to handle significantly more transactions than 1MB every 10 minutes!  Something must give as the block rewards continue to half. 
All these people who are against increased block size, must be against bitcoin as a transactional currency, because it’ll be relegated to a marginalized store of value if the transaction limits are t scaled to allow miners to be profitable without sucking the tit of block rewards!

Your oversimplifying things to suggest that banks will die.  The worlds monetary supply is a debt based system.  It’s estimated that 90 trillion dollars exists in the world economy (excluding the derivatives market which is really a zero sum game).  
However the amount of debt in the world is roughly 325 trillion dollars.  So 90 trillion exists, to pay back 325 trillion in debt.  
The vast majority of this debt is collateralized, meaning secured by property, and other meaningful assets.  All the banking system needs to do is tighten the money supply, and cause a chunk of that $325 trillion in collateral to be foreclosed on...
Bitcoin is a great asset to the world, but with 325 trillion in secured debt, it’s going to take a lot more than a blockchain to derail financial institutions as a whole!

You don’t have to pay taxes every time you trade, you have to pay taxes once a year, for all of your trades the prior tax year.  If you held the asset for more than 12 months, it would be treated at long term capital gains rate, if held for less than 12 months, it would be at short term capital gains rate.  
Also - it’s not when you “cash out” it’s when you sell the asset. So keeping the fiat funds In your account doesn’t delay the tax

Banking and savings, banking and savings....
Bitcoin needs to solve several major issues while its brand is at its peak to continue to dominate and grow.  If it cansokve these issues, it will be MAASIVELY undervalued still:
1) transaction scalability - bitcoin needs to be able to seemlessly handle visa/mastercard level volumes.  This can be achieved through lightning, but that’s too far out.  In the mean time, a short term solution needs to be implemented right now, to allow the network to support the growth that’s being experienced at this very moment.  The easiest solution is to increase block size, and to get all major wallets and services using segwit addresses!  This will buy some time for the permanent  solution to “come to market”.
2) hand in hand with transaction scalability is transaction cost.  Bitcoin can be more expensive than alt coins, but each transaction really can’t be more than about .25-.75% for true adoption and mass acceptance. This will self correct if we get unconfirmed transactions numbers down by addressing item 1.
3). Mining needs to be overhauled to more appropriately address initial concept of bitcoin.  Mining needs to favor individual pc’s and home devices, as opposed to specialized ASICS if it is to turkey remain decentralized.  The consolidation of massively expensive, server farms with massive electrical needs only leads to 1 end, consolidation, and central control.  This is not as urgent as item 1/2, however if this is not addressed, once the value become high enough, consolidation can take place to take control of the network, and at that point code can be changed at will including the holy grail limit of 21m coin...  
If these 3 things can be addressed soon, bitcoin can win the game.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:21:24
I disagree with your position completely.  One of the main reasons bitcoin lost so much value over the past 48 hours comes as a result of the huge backlog in unconfirmed transactions, and the expensive fees that go with it.  Bitcoin’s valuation is past the point of early adoption pure speculation.  The recent flow of money coming into bitcoin has largely been early adoption mainstream users.  These are not the techno geeks that have bled bitcoin the past 5 years.  These are every day moderate people, who will expect competitive transaction fees, and fast confirmations.  If you expect bitcoin to keep rising in price, and continuing to add users, with a limitation of writing only 1MB of data to the blockchain every 10 minutes, your in for an extraordinarily rude awakening!   Can you imagine any other asset on earth with a quarter of a trillion dollar valuation, that can’t handle its basic transactions, merely because it can’t come to concensus over a adding the capacity of a few MEGABYTES of data per hour?  The thought of that is just insane, yet it’s where bitcoin is right now!  I assure you, people won’t just “wait”, people will pull out, and go to more advanced technology crypto if bitcoin doesn’t solve this VERY soon!  
I’m a huge bitcoin advocate, I have used it in every day life for 5 years, and have mined on a commercial scale. I’m not against bitcoin, I want it to succeed, however mark my words, it will go by the way of Napster, and MySpace if this isn’t fixed soon! So let’s get a proposal online and get concensus and continue watching this goto the moon! Or let’s keep hodling onto our balls, and watch in dismay as the value gets sucked right out of it! We need a fix!  It’s a disaster tens of thousands of transactions per day never get confirmed, and we’re knocking on that door right now!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:34
Miners could back the futures to decrease, which would drive down mining revenue.  I don’t see the point, nor how doing that would manipulate the market though?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:28:12
The difficulty adjustment would not occur until the next scheduled adjustment block.  Block confirmations would slow by 95% in the mean time, until others started mining to pick up the slack.  Potentially a period of several months could go by with a huge bottleneck (up to 95%) of transaction confirmations...upon reaching the next difficulty adjustment, the system would self correct and everything would be as it was. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:45
The difference between the start of 18 and the start of 17 is about 300,000 unconfirmed transactions, and growing!  If there is not a fix to the severely handicapped 1mb block size every 10 minutes, bitcoin will quickly lose its valuation!  
Users coming on board will not tolerate $30-50 fees, and long confirmation times.  
Besides, the unconfirmed transactions are going to keep growing, and it will start producing a lot of transactions that drop off the network from not being confirmed.  This causes chaos, and that’s not what bitcoin or the market needs!   We need a larger block size RIGHT NOW in order to keep bitcoin from losing its brand and much of its value! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:49:17
The answer is, it’s too early to tell since nothing has scaled to that level, and nothing else has really scaled to bitcoins level yet.

What’s going on is that bitcoin is currently capable of confirming roughly 15,000 transactions per hour, and the network is receiving between 20-30000 per hour.  Unconfirmed transactions have increased to roughly 300,000 unconfirmed.  This is something that needs to be fixed, and right away, or it’s going to have a devastating effect on bitcoin.  
In reality, all it would take to fix this problem for the short term would be to increase the blocksize to 8mb.  That’s the equivalent of 1 high quality music song in data every 10 minutes...  not even a drop in the bucket for the hundreds of billions of value tied up in bitcoin. 
If someone doesn’t put forward a proposal, or if a proposal fails to gain concensus,  bitcoin is going to lose its brand strength and it’s price is likely to be severely handicapped.  
We need something to hold over until lightning is ready (perhaps a year away).  Even bringing back the segwit 2x would help this significantly!   We need something NOW!

Currently with the 1mb blocksize were limited to about 15,000 transactions per hour. 
An 8mb blocksize would be somewhere south of 120,000 per hour.  Or 33 per second.  That should accommodate network growth, as a stopgap to get through until lightening and technologies like it become available.  Once these technologies get adopted, it will be limitless, as most transactions will be off chain, or on side chains, freeing up the blockchain...  the biggest problem is if we don’t get a temp measure in place, the mainstream adoption will end in failure and bitcoin will become MySpace...

As of this moment, the generally accepted position is that you would not owe the tax until you converted to US dollars/fiat.  It’s akin to a 1031 real estate exchange. 
However - the new tax bill floating through Congress looks to put an end to that.  The current bill will make taxable any exchange, regardless of whether its crypto or into fiat.
This is a BAD deal, and really needs more attention before the tax bill passes and really turns the screws down on exchanging crypto assets.

I have been a heavy bitcoin user for 5 years.  I’ve had a large mining farm, run full nodes, and have used bitcoin as both a store of value and a currency heavily during this time.  
The biggest problem with bitcoin seems to be that gaining consensus in order to achieve technical progress has been proving to be a major obstacle.  Bitcoin desperately needs to be able to handle larger transaction volumes, RIGHT NOW!  $20 transaction fees, and long confirmation times are going to destroy the bitcoin brand if not fixed soon!   
Bitcoin needs to be capable of being both a store of value, and an easy and quick to use currency.  If it cannot be both, then it will be replaced by a technically superior crypto currency.
It’s naive to think that it’s value can continue to grow if its technology cannot support that growth!  We need lighting NOW, and we need all exchanges, wallets, and bitcoin sites to support the already existing segwit protocol, as an urgent stop gap measure.  We have people filing into bitcoin by the millions, and they aren’t going to remain patient very long with $20 transaction fees, and long confirmation times.  It’s too cumbersome!  
My fear is that since the bitcoin cash guys took the ball and bat and went home, there is no other proposals that are on the docket that could fix this problem, and I don’t sense many people are working or are far enough along in a proposal that will fix this quickly.
Lighting is too far out, we need a temporary block size increase to keep the brand and value growing in the interim!   Bitcoin is going to get 1 shot at becoming the dominant mainstream crypto currency...  and if it doesn’t step up to the plate, it won’t end well!

While your assessment of what currently causes much of the volatility is in fact accurate, the solution is not to give a monopoly license to bankers, declaring  them as the only legal entities that have the power to make such moves to the market.  Because all that does is allows a privileged minority an exclusive license to commit the same unfair, and illegal for everyone else actions over a limitless amount of time, as long as they are slightly more subtle about it. 
The market itself will correct this volatility as the market matures, and more people adopt bitcoin. 
The problem currently is 2 fold, the first, is that the standard for determining the market value is not in fact representative of the actual market.  
What determines the “price” of bitcoin?  It depends on where you look!   Some websites base it on the last transaction price, regardless of transaction volume of a single exchange.  In that case, a single transaction representing as little as less than a dollar in value,  is directly responsible for the price that’s reflected in wallets used by millions. 
Additionally, a  relatively small percentage of bitcoin trades are made at exchanges that often are selected as the source for the market value, again these exchanges however are setting the published market rates for all transactions.  
I think that consensus solutions can be developed that largely mitigate, or even eliminate this issue.  
It wouldn’t be particularly difficult to add code into bitcoin, where  an average price against the dollar is determined by a formula, weighing transactions over the past 90 days where more consideration is given to newer trades and trade volume.   Something like this, would largely mitigate the feast or famine price structure that exists today as a result of using last price on individual thinly traded exchanges.   If the wallet providers, and community began to embrace a price structure like this, it would be vastly more representative of the true market value, would be much more difficult to manipulate, and would provide much needed stability to the price of bitcoin.  
This certainly isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s a relatively easy solution, that can curb one of the most pressing problems that bitcoin faces today (market manipulation and volatility), with a fair, balanced and inclusive solution.  
One thing I would caution, is that prices and volume from sources  such as decentralized exchanges, and other non KYC bank institutions, must be properly represented.  Indeed it is these decentralized, peer to peer transactions, and the people who use them that are so vital to bitcoin, and bitcoin so vital to these groups of people.  
This would also assure a more real world indicator of market value, as these decentralized and peer to peer transactions have consistently placed a higher value on bitcoin over the dollar, when compared to federal reserve influenced institutions, who selectively discriminate against large segments of the population based on KYC, AML, and the ability to cancel anyone’s account for any reason, or no reason at all, simply because they have the power to make those decisions.

You all talk without even addressing the fundamentals!  
Bitcoin is facing a MAJOR crisis!  There are 300,000 unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain.  Bitcoin can confirm roughly 15,000 per hour and there are currently between 20,000-30,000 new transactions hitting the network every hour.  This backlog is continuing to grow, driving transaction fees out of this world, and your going to start seeing large numbers of unconfirmed transactions drop off the network without confirming!   We need an update to the block size as AN IMMEDIATE stop gap until lightening is ready and adopted.  If this doesn’t occur very soon, with concensus, your talk of a price hike will be nothing but a pipe dream!

I agree that we will see things change.  I also think bitcoin and crypto currency will be a tool that will help keep banks in check, and force them to be more competitive.  But the truth is, banks have enormous political clout, and when the rubber hits the road, they can simply use their considerable influence to crack down on decentralized currencies, not unlike the US making gold illegal, and forcing the people to turn in their gold for fiat dollars.  
I’d love nothing more than to see banks replaced, I’m simply suggesting that they likely have way to much of the worlds assets under their belt for that to be possible...

The draconian measures that are being adopted  aren’t really about security precautions.  They are the result of international pressure via the fatf!  
Do you really want the financial establishment being able to lock you out of the system because an algorithm determines your a “risk”. Because that’s where it’s going.   The fatf is requiring that all exchanges cross share all user and kyc data amongst all financial institutions.  If you get banned by coinbase, you’ll be banned by the whole international consortium.  It’s how the financial system is setup, but with fiat you atleast still have cash as an option (for now anyhow).
For those of us who actually do still care about privacy and the freedom to be in control of our own assets, it’s time we start seriously committing to platforms like Bisq and wallets like wasabi, or currencies like Monero.

Actually you don’t need to jump through hoops to get xmr traded at an exchange.  Just goto morphtoken.com and make an anonymous exchange is really all you need to do for that. If your a us resident, it’ll require tor or an international vpn. 
The point of entry and exit with crypto to fiat  is currently where the rubber hits the road,  Although that is rapidly expanding (ie:shapeshift, localbitcoins, Changelly, etc).  
Everyone seems content to inaction and allowing this to occur.  if we don’t put a stop to it soon,  even purchases with crypto will be subject to KYC.  This will be done via large retailers only accepting crypto from a wallet that requires Kyc to spend funds at Starbucks for a coffee for example.  Much in the same way bitpay requires a proprietary payment link only supported by certain wallets in order to make payments.  Of course you know the next step, once that works well is the Kyc for purchases component.  
What’s even more scary is that much of this can be done without any US law at all, simply via the international FATF under color of treaty or international agreement!

No - it’s actually easy to be extremely safe with crypto!
I use bitcoin for nearly everything!  
For long term savings, you setup a cold wallet.   You write down your 24 key recovery phrase, and place it into a plastic waterproof container, and bury it in a safe place where you can retrieve it. Bury it in your yard, or your parents if you’d rather.  
You can send bitcoin to that wallet anytime you wish, without compromising the private key.  So you can build savings.  
Or better yet, you simply buy a Trezor, and bury the recovery phrase for it in the same manner.  Trevor’s are hardened, and you can transact without compromising security.  
For daily spending Use a bitpay phone app wallet.  It’s safe and convenient.  You can also instantly transfer your bitcoin to your copay Visa card and spend that way. Whenever you wish.   
It’s much better to be in control of your own future, than to give more power and control to the banks, by participating in the the biggest thievery of the people in history!

Dollar for dollar, bitcoin uses significantly more electricity.

Enlighten me, because i couldn’t find any traditional technical that showed this coming.  To me it looked more like the significantly light trade volume on the exchanges (200m daily combined vs 4B ) created a situation where there was little liquidity on the order books, and a relatively small amount of money coming in pushed the price enough to trigger a series of margin calls with buy to cover pushing the price up more.  Then the second wind the rally caught was your typical FOMO guys that come running in just before the inevitable correction...  those are the ones that bitch because they spend the next year trying to get even.  This seems a lot more like the reduction in volume and relatively empty order books were the cause.  Atleast from the angle I’m looking at it.

I dont get why people even put stop loss orders into exchanges. Its like posting on social media that you got a safe for all your money at home, because your going out of town for the month.
If you are doing any sort of mildly advanced trading, you need to operate with an API, and run your own bot, so that your intentions cant easily be manipulated.  There really isnt a ton of bitcoin volume thats actively being traded on exchanges.  Most transactions are people simply looking to exchange in or out of crypto, Beyond that, its primarily the exchanges themselves who know with detailed specificity the status of all users assets, trade history, short positions, short exposure,  etc. and therefore they know the intentions and capabilities of all users, and have bots that stack orders to extract as much profits out of users as possible.   Sometimes that chain of events leads to rapid price changes.

Shouldn’t be a major obstacle.  Why do you care if you need to pay tax if your making a profit you wouldn’t otherwise have made not using bitcoin?

In terms of that being a hassle...  It’s not a hassle at all, as long as your using a modern btc wallet.   most wallets  at this point automatically calc your cost basis, capital gain, or loss.  Electrum being a good example.  You simply Export to spreadsheet and your taxable component is done.

A cash flow examination wouldn’t reconcile this issue.  This is not a balance sheet issue, it’s an income statement issue.  Although negative cash flow is certainly a different problem created by accepting credit cards.  It usually costs a business about a week of credit card receipts in rolling cash flow, due to the settlement delays.  As far as you know, he could have 5 years of cash flow sitting in a bank account though. If your running a high volume, low margin business, where your gross profits are 10% of revenue, your net income is likely to have have razor thin margins or losses and the credit card fees make an enormous difference in any such similar scenario.

Thanks for your contribution in that case.  My thoughts are that btc is going to trade slightly bearish in the short term.  I think all the FATF pressure on exchanges is having a negative impact on transaction volume.  
It’s becoming more difficult to acquire bitcoin for many people, especially with places like localbitcoins shutting down in person trades.  I think this is why its been much more in line with global stock markets s lately.   Because there’s been a shift in the way it’s being used. It needs more transaction volume before it’s going to increase in value.  
If things stay status quo, I don’t see it going up until we get closer to the halving in 7 months.
The community needs to push its use as a currency, and not simply a store of value.  In order to have increasing value,  I believe  it needs to be widely accepted by people as payment, because that’s really the way to stand up against the invasive Onboading that global exchanges are being forced into by the banking cartel

It’s incredibly easy to use a car as a weapon to kill people also.  Should we work on eliminating cars as a result of their ability to be used as an illegal tool (they can also be used as getaway vehicles for bank heists)?
If someone is intent on money laundering, there are many ways to do that while inside the banking system also.  One could simply book expenses to an offshore supplier in a host of different ways.  Should the banks be shut down also, considering your line of reasoning we should eliminate banks because they are used by criminals as well, some even run by criminals.

That’s simply false.  There is a far higher likelihood of Alipay/we chat being hacked.  It’s just that when they are hacked, the banks simply inflate the currency more to replace the money.  That inflation is going to continue to get worse as more and more money is needed to cover the interest owed by nation states in addition to the ever growing fraud taking place in the banking system.
I do agree that bitcoin can be hacked, and when it is, unless you insure it, your not going to have  recourse.  However,  it’s far more secure than bank systems, and if people take a little time to understand how to secure properly, it becomes damn near impenetrable.

Financial Insurance is a joke!  If our money was insured, why didn’t the government allow the reckless banks to fail in 2008....  because obviously we were all insured, so the only harm would have come to the failed bank, and the insurance companies who recklessly put themselves in a position to fail!  
Of course that’s naive!  The FDIC could not have paid out insurance on Bank of America failing, without any other bank failure!  
The fact is, it’s not “trusting them with your money” it’s the inherent control they have over you, your money, and the entire economy! 
They can choose not to allow you to withdraw your funds, anytime they deem anything “suspicious”, they send in SAR reports in secret on their customers, they pry into your personal lives on deposits, and they tell you who you can, and who you can’t send your money to: IE credit cards blocking bitcoin purchases, daily withdrawal limits, all sorts of games!  And the deflate the hell out of your assets, by constantly creating money out of thin air!
I’d rather simply write down my 24 key recovery phrase for bitcoin, place it in a waterproof container, and bury it underground, and make occasional deposits into it for savings.  For daily spend, a wallet on my phone, and a bitpay debit card that loads bitcoin instantly...  much easier than dealing with the greedy thieves!

I guess I’m not making my point.  My point is that it doesn’t really complicate your taxes.   If you use the electrum wallet (for example) right within the wallet, it automatically calculates all the details needed by the irs.  You simply need to print out those details from Jan-1-dec-31 the same as you do with your bank statements.  You then take the total from the bottom of the printout, and place it on the correct line in the tax return.  It’s extraordinarily simple actually.
I personally disagree with the way the irs has interpreted its tax treatment.   But it is not difficult to perform the actions required.

From any exchange you can transfer your bitcoin to another wallet address.   Ledger comes with the live companion app.  Just setup your ledger, and whatever exchange you use to buy the bitcoin, be sure to send it to an address provided by the ledger companion app.
Once you do that, the private key is secured by your ledger hardware wallet.  
The wallet (like any wallet you control) will also have a seed key (mnemonic), write that down by hand (don’t copy paste and print, as it can be stored in cache on the printer, etc.), and preferably have it laminated, and then stored in whatever your preferred safe location is.  If your idea of secured storage is a bank deposit box, then do that, if it’s your home safe, do that, if it’s buried underground in a secret location, do that.  Just know anyone who gets the seed keys has access to take your funds.  A hardware wallet acts as an electronic safeguard preventing malware, etc from hacking in and gaining your private key.  The mnemonic, or seed key is essentially the key that your ledger is protecting.  You need a backup of it, but you need to understand how critical it is that those words are protected.  The ledger can block all the efforts on the front end, and if you leave those written words laying around for your neighbor to see, your ledger becomes pointless.   You must keep that seed secure.
If you still have questions, please ask.

I agree with your suggestion that the amount of printed currency today is largely irrelevant. However, it is the federal reserve that’s in control of the printing of new currency.

With that said, it’s not the 1.7 trillion in actual federal reserve notes that’s the major issue, it’s the amount of money banks are creating through debits and credits within the bank system that’s the real problem!

Multisig hot wallets can be very secure.  It depends on the amount of funds your storing, and what your risk profile is.  If it’s a repressive government regime, or something Ike that, I’d say your only safe bet is to store the bulk of your coin in a cold wallet, outside the reach of the regime (IE: mnemonic sealed and buried somewhere safe). You could even do a multisig cold wallet setup for more security.  
If your worried about random thieves, or random hackers stealing your phone,and getting access to your hot wallet, then multisig  eliminates that risk almost entirely and it’s an excellent choice.  It’s also a good choice to prevent hackers from transferring funds via malware or gaining access remotely.  They would need to gain access to the keys for each multisignature  wallet that’s required to sign the transaction. So they’d need to successfully hack both devices and know that they both are needed for the transaction.
I’ve seen people setup multisig wallets and store the multisig private keys  on the same device...  that’s a mistake, it adds a layer of complexity without adding much, if any security.  
Overall, multisig will defeat just about any casual, or determined bad actor/user from stealing your coin and makes your money significantly more secure than in your bank account!  
Multi signature wallets are more secure in some ways than hardware wallets (IE they require multiple mnemonics or private keys to send the money).  The level of strength or weakness really comes down to the accessibility of the devices that contain the private keys and if those devices can be easily linked to one another (IE your phone and your spouses phone)
If your trying to prevent a repressive government from accessing your funds, and your multi sig setup is your phone and your wife’s phone having hot wallets, your likely going to lose the coin.  Otherwise your pretty damn secure.  
Does that make sense?

Thanks for your reply.  I am aware of the hash power issue, and I should have mentioned it.  My concern is that, after the initial spike in unconfirmed transactions, due to the miner switching, I’ve been watching the blockchain and even with roughly 6 blocks per hour,   New transactions seem to be out pacing the ability to confirm them all.  It seems to me that bitcoin use has simply grown to the point where even with the slight efficiency gain with the minimal segwit addresses, the new users to the network are pushing it past the limits again.  Am I missing something, or is that indeed what’s happening?

I would suggest you can use coinbase to buy all of your coins if that’s the exchange you want to use.  I would also suggest that you store NONE of your coins on coinbase after purchasing them.  
It takes all of 30 seconds to transfer them to a wallet in your custody.  I wouldn’t keep a balance of any money whatsoever in coinbase.  Sure, deposit money and buy the coin at coinbase, but get it under your own wallet immediately afterward. 
That will potentially take a couple of days, as coinbase May lock your funds from withdrawal initially...  this is a prime example of why you DONT want to keep them on an exchange!  The whole point of this technology is to eliminate the “trusted” 3rd party custodian of your money (IE banks, or exchanges).  
If you have a Trezor, just keep it all on the trezor.  You can readily and quickly access it and send it to anyone, any time in any amount, anywhere in the world, anytime you wish without having any risk of  your withdrawal frozen until you answer invasive kyc questions.  
There is no ease of use, or convenience factor for keeping it on an exchange.  In fact, it’s easier to keep small amounts on a wallet like mycelium on your phone, and you can spend/send or receive them anytime you have your phone with you in seconds.  
Using mycelium, etc gives you control of the private key (mnemonic seed). But it’s only as secure as your phone is so keep that in mind. 
Edit : I just realized you indicated that you wanted to do this for short term gains.  If your saying you want to use it for day trading, then keep only what you’ll be day trading in the exchange. The truth is, the vast majority of investors do much better choosing an entry point and holding until their chosen exit point.  Day trading crypto can be a very unkind game.   Crypto exchanges are ripe with heavily  manipulated trade volume designed to eat the average trader for lunch.

Interestingly, the law actually specifically grants the business the responsibility of creating its own kyc policy. Fincen does not even require a copy of the policy when granting an  msb license.  They state that upon request, the business shall furnish it.  
With that said, the cash app process is still far less intrusive than the others in the sector.  No SSN, no copy of ID, no date of birth, etc.
KYC in this sector is far to intrusive, and needs to be opposed in general, but I don’t have a lot of faith in the people to actually take a stand for our rights these days.

The problem with these “limits” is that as soon as you gonto use them consistently, your account gets frozen, and often leads tonyour account being closed, or limits reduced.

A few of your responses are a bit of a stretch.  First of all, I had an account closed from Coinbase due to "tainted coins".  They never froze my account, seized my money, had the police, secret service, fbi, or anyone like that ask me questions.  They merely stated that it appears the the source of funds may have come from illicit uses and that they have chosen to close my account.  They gave me 45 days to withdraw my bitcoin and cash balance and did not let me make purchases or deposits during the 45 day window before closing the account.  
The said the decsion could not be appealed, and that it was final.  Interestingly enough, the source of the coins was actually a KYC compliant exchange thats no longer in the bitcoin exchange business (circle).   In my case, Coinbase didn't know what they were doing, and lost a customer as a result.  I dont miss them in the least bit, and I use bitcoin daily.   
With respect to the coffee shop, almost all hot wallets today would require the use of an xpub key to determine how much you have in your hot wallet.  Each transaction is given an unique wallet ID, and without the Xpub, you cant see the balance of your hotwallet, just the "change output that went back to the unique wallet created for that purpose by the wallet app. 
No doubt that there are some major drawbacks if your using bitcoin without second layer technology for purposes of privacy.  However, those second and third layers are quickly eliminating that concern for those who seek privacy, or anonymity.

I’m not suggesting that bitcoin could handle the transaction volume created by a failed fiat system, but I don’t believe this movement will have that type of impact anyway, and to the extent it can get people to realize they need to start diversifying out of that system, is a benefit for humanity.

Ill agree that the civil asset forfeiture proceedures are draconian, and in the US they certainly violate our constitution.  With that said, any money that anyone has could theoretically be seized in a civil forfeiture, becaue all money has been "used in the commissioning of a crime" at some point within its circulation.  The benefit to bitcoin, is that you can prevent anyone from being able to seize it.  YOu cannot do that with fiat currency!

The problem with your theory is all the way back in step 1.  "as far as LE is concerned, it looks like the previous owner of these coin just moved them to a new address".   The problem for LE is 1) That's not what happened and 2) LE has no way of proving that is what happened.  In most countries, you cant be convicted of a crime if they cannot prove that you committed the crime.  Civil asset forfeiture being the egregious exception.  Fortunately bitcoin fixed the problem of civil asset forfeiture by giving you full control over your own money!  They cant asset forfeiture something that they cannot gain possession of.

Incorrect!   Wallet address’s may get you flagged at certain exchanges, but nothing prevents one from using peer to peer exchanges, or exchanging for another crypto, like monero, and back, or using a mixer...  
You still seem to be missing my point....
When bitcoin is properly secured, it is supposed to be immune from seizure by anyone, or any government.  We know this because the code is open source, and we can see the rules, in text. What has me perplexed, is that in almost every public case of criminal charges, law enforcement seems to be seizing bitcoin.  I’m puzzled by the fact that so many bitcoin are confiscated, considering its relatively easy to properly secure bitcoin to prevent this sort of thing.  
If I were dread pirate Roberts, I think I’d have multi sig, offline generated, paper wallets, stored in sealed containers and buried under ground somewhere safe and away from where I frequented.  Maybe it’s just me, but i figure if I was running the biggest world wide drug, killing for hire, fraud, etc. market, id probably have a pretty sizeable target on my back and forehead...  even if I were just your run of the mill, Russian ransomeware hack, id still be looking over my shoulder and securing my loot...   seems strange that so many coin get seized from these characters...

Your looking at this through an awfully narrow tunnel...  
First, bitcoin is indeed limited to 21 million bitcoin, however, bitcoin divides down into to .00000001 of a bitcoin, making the supply far more available than it would appear.  Essentially, bitcoin would need to be priced at 1 million dollars per bitcoin for a Satoshi (.00000001 btc) to be worth the equivalent of a penny.  That means bitcoin can circulate the equivalent of 21 trillion dollars before its lowest form of value would more than a penny.  That seems to me like plenty of supply!  It’s not like a dollar, where change is 2 decimal points over...  
As for its recent price drop, yes I can see why that would appear significant for new entrants.  However, as someone who acquired over a thousand bitcoins (1200 actually) at an average cost just south of $400 per bitcoin, it’s been an incredible store of value for me!The volatility is due to the fact that its a new asset class, and the ecosystem is still being built.  This is not unlike the internet from 95-99...  there was a ton of volatility in tech stocks, and that lasted until mainstream adoption was realized.  Many of those highly volatile tech stocks have matured into cornerstones of stability within the markets.  
I have used bitcoin heavily since 2013, and it has proven to be an excellent store of value.  I also hold stocks, and precious metals, and if I need cash quickly to bail someone out of jail for example, at 2am on Sunday, there’s no contest, hands down I’m getting that person out of jail far faster if I have bitcoin available than if I have silver or shares of Apple!  
I recently liquidated some assets for a vehicle purchase, I didn’t want to sell bitcoin, so I decided to sell some silver.  Aside from toting around 300 pounds of Bullion, it was a hassle to get it converted to cash. I spent several days messing with it, before I finally just decided to use bitcoin, and I had the car paid for in a couple of hours.  
So, as a store of value, bitcoin has a lot going for it!  You may want to consider experimenting with it a bit...

I wouldn’t be surprised if that turned out to be the case, however at this point the evidence doesn’t seem to support the theory.  
It seems more likely bitcoin was created by Hal Finney, and a team, possibly working for the us intel community.  I think Dorian Nakamoto was involved in some respect as well.  Considering he lived a couple blocks away from Hal Finney, and his name is Satoshi nakamoto...  but really, at this point it’s all speculation.

The problem with bitcoin is its being treated like personal property, and not like a currency m. In fact it is both of those things, and tax treatment really should be determined based on how you use it.  
I use bitcoin as my bank. I pay for meals and gas, and bills with bitcoin I hold wallets that are akin to my checking account, and wallets that are similar to my savings account for long term savings.
It’s absolutely absurd to have to run gains and losses on thousands of normal bill paying activities at the end of the year, and frankly, when used as currency, there really is very minimal gains or losses because your earning it, and spending it and the price goes up and down, and in the end it’s damn close to a net 0 anyhow. 
It’s a different story if your holding it as an asset and being a speculator.  
The thought that I have to list every pack of gum I buy and track if it’s a gain or loss against the dollar, when I’m using it to pay for goods or services is ridiculous!
But then again, the IRS is taking its marching orders from the banking elites, who want to make it as difficult as possible to use as a currency.  They are willing to accept bitcoin, if they can pidgeon hole it into a corner as an asset,m.  They aren’t willing to allow it to blossom into a currency that renders the banks irrelevant, and I’m afraid that’s what the real issue is

This is a point that is so often missed by non industry people!  Bitcoin is divisible such that 21 million bitcoin represents 2.1 QUADRILLION accounting units (Satoshi’s).  Meaning there are 2 thousand 1 hundred TRILLION units of currency in bitcoin, far more than all the money currently in the world, and certainly plenty to handle the worlds liquidity needs...
Put another way, 1 bitcoin is currently divisible into 100 million “Satoshis”.  Meaning if bitcoin was at $1 million each, the smallest unit of measure would be worth exactly 1 cent.

That’s very much debatable.  Different departments within the federal government view bitcoin as a currency, not property. 
If your using the coin to buy and sell goods and services. Pay bills, etc. your using it as a currency and clearly not as property.  The notion that you need to report every .99 cent candybar you buy with bitcoin as a gain or loss is just absurd!

Logic is out the window because our citizens are complacent, and uninterested in challenging the establishment to protect and preserve freedom.  
Crypto is being completely perverted via KYC and other ridiculous restrictions in an effort to put control of your money back in the hands of the same bankers it was designed to bypass.
It’s becoming nothing more than a vehicle to speed up a cashless society where everything you do is controlled by a central power.  How’s crypto any different than the current system if you eliminate privacy and decentralized control!  
Maybe I’m a minority in the fact that I’d rather trust myself with my assets, than a bank that devalues my holdings, makes me get permission to send wires, freezes my debit card when buying groceries in the name of “fraud prevention”, restricts my ability to withdraw my funds in cash on demand, and who make me worry when buying a house that if I do not satisfactorily answer an arbitrary set of questions on what I’m doing with my money, they may refuse to send it to my escrow agent when buying a house.
If they can do these things, which they do regularly, what can’t they do with “your” money?

Not true at all.  It is extraordinarily easy to accept bitcoin as a small business.   If anyone needs help, PM me, and I’ll gladly show them how to do it for free!

There are a number of alternative ways to aquire bitcoin with relative ease, and without ID...
1)goto bitify.com and sell some things on the auction site getting paid in bitcoin.  
2) take out a craigslist ad to sell anything you own, for bitcoin payments.  
3) This one is more practical and allows you to scale to larger dollar amounts: Buy gold or silver bullion with Fiat currency.  Then take the Bullion, and sell it for around spot price for bitcoin to places like veldt gold, or on Craigslist for bitcoin.
4) Goto purse.io and earn bitcoin by filling amazon orders...  This is at a discount of roughly 15%, but no ID needed.

Well - considering bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, I’m quite certain that people’s decisions to HODL aren’t affecting liquidity!  They are affecting supply,  however the good thing is that supply is divisible to a point where liquidity is never really an issue.  So if enough people want to spend bitcoin as a currency, then merchants will accept it as payment. The issue isn’t the hodlers, it’s that the market doesn’t have enough people with a pressing desire to buy things with it.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:00:16
I hope to god your right on your prediction...  because banks do a 3rd thing for individuals as well...  dilute the individuals wealth as a result of their monopoly on creating a debt instrument and inflating the supply of the currency at the banks benefit, and the individuals detriment.
The problem with your theory is that the banks have such vast control over modern government, that simply creating a better alternative isn’t going to be enough I’m afraid!  I suspect it’s going to take an outraged, and determined public to force the issue, and Im not sure we have a public that has the stomach for that!
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:35:24
If it’s used in the traditional sense of currency, IE: traded directly for goods and services, whereby the merchant actually receives the bitcoin as a form of payment, and doesn’t merely have a processor liquidate the bitcoin for fiat, then it wouldn’t have a negative effect on its value at all.
However, most major merchants simply pay a processor to liquidate the bitcoin for fiat at the point of transaction, and in that case, transacting for goods and services is akin to creating selling pressure.

Once you deposit funds into a bank, it’s no longer “your” money.  It’s now an asset of the bank, with an offsetting non secured liability on the bank balance sheet.  in essence, when you deposit YOUR money into a bank, it becomes the banks money and they are in ultimate control of that money, as is indicated in this situation!  They have a contract with you, that gives you unsecured claims to the money...  but of course, you can’t actually take them to court and sue them, you need to take them to arbitration, and use the banks chosen arbiter, who is paid by the bank, and who cannot survive without the relationship with the bank...   in other words, good luck, your going to need a hell of a lot more than that though!
The solution, get your money out of the banks!  Hold cash, crypto, or physical bullion, and you’ll be in control of your own finances.   When enough people do that, the bank cartel will come to realize that they no longer have a monopoly over money, and they will be forced to start actually competing, instead of just robbing from the people.

Also - bitcoin is trading based on a fiat value, and not a value pegged to cheesecake.  So the value is really pegged to the market demand at the major exchanges.. even over the counter trades have limited affect on value in this environment.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:12:15
All of you in India need to defy this trampling of your rights, by reducing your reliance and dependence on the banking system! It will be inconvenient, but it is necessary if you want to be in control of your own finances!  Take as much out of the bank system as you can, and place it into decentralized crypto, on paper, hardware or other secure wallets in your control.  Buy/trade as much for goods and services directly with crypto, and when fiat is necessary, use localbitcoins,  or other peer to peer platforms to exchange in and out of crypto.  I suspect there will not be a liquidity problem doing this, as it will push the majority of crypto holders in Indra to use this method, making liquidity a non issue. 
Whatever you do, don’t let this deter you from migrating to crypto!  That is the goal here, and they are not doing it for the benefit of the people! 
The choice is yours...  Financial freedom of the people, or control by the fiat banking cartel, and a continued erosion of your assets!

If that’s your outlook, you don’t really understand bitcoin well!   Banks can fr was your funds, reverse transactions, seize funds, etc.  you can get hacked FAR EASIER in your bank account than you can your wallet.  
Ultimately what it sounds like. You want is insurance, in the unlikely event that your bitcoin gets stolen...   if you follow best practices, that insurance will come much cheaper than the cost of centralized banking!
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:57:13
Banks dilute your store of value to the extent that you keep cash on hand.  Savings, checking, money market, makes no difference. I’m also not particularly fond of having to answer a damn background check on the source of my funds, every time I want to make a wire transfer. 
I also don’t like the fact that my deposit into a bank becomes their asset, and all I have to show for it is an unsecured obligation by the bank to repay me... considering that they only keep less than 10% of customer deposits on hand, that’s a pretty bad deal!  
Ohh yeah, and they can close your account any time, the whole racket is WAY out of control, and decentralized currency solves the dependency on these criminals!
Just try for a moment to tell me what would happen if you held customer deposits, and tried to pull the same “fractional reserve” crap the banks pull!  Your aaa would be in prison in no time!

"If that were true, they would go after government bonds and other stimulus programs, since they literally are ponzi schemes that rely on involuntary new investors (taxpayers) to generate a return on investment for current investors.
But they don't. So the REAL reason why you have the SEC is to safeguard the government's monopoly on scamming society.
This is why some people oppose regulation. We'd gladly take the chance of losing 5% of our capital to a private scammer over the certainty of losing 30% of our capital to a government protection racket."

Amazon sells damn near everything people buy!   You can buy anything from amazon using purse.io...  NO IM NOT A PURSE TROLL!  You place an amazon wish list order, and publish it to purse with a discount of 10-15 percent off the amazon price.  The order gets filled while your bitcoin are in escrow, and once you receive the amazon order, you release the bitcoin from escrow!  
Works fantastic and saves an average of 15% off amazon prices by using bitcoin...

You might want to look inward toward the technologies current limitations.  Whenever interest peaks, bitcoin shoots itself in the foot due to its inability to scale transactions, leading to long confirmations and expensive fees!   That will quickly kill new user excitement and have long term detrimental effects on the technology!
This has GOT to get fixed, the increase in attention were seeing is nothing compared to the wave that could come, and it can’t even support this lift at the moment.

Well, I disagree.  I think it has more to do with the limited capacity issues still plaguing bitcoin.   Anytime we see a serious lift in transactions, confirmation times become untenable, and fees become unsustainable!  
Bitcoin has GOT to be able to scale its transactions or its new users will quickly get frustrated and bail!

Owning a full node is akin to community involvement in politics.  It allows you to have an input on which development proposals are accepted, or rejected.  It gives you a bit more security and privacy as you can point your own transactions to your node, or run them off your node.  It allows you do make 0 fee transactions, etc.  
If you want something tangible outside this, you need to run a miner....
