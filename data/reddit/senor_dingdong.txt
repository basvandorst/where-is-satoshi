Checked a paper wallet address, and it is also double.  Thank you Blockchain.info for the donation ;-)
I also noticed I have another one of those unconfirmed 1Sochi address satoshi transactions.  I'm guessing it is just a coincidence and unrelated to this outage that just occurred.

You can send any amount of fiat anywhere in the world more efficiently than bitcoin?  I find that a little hard to believe.  Keep in mind, Bitcoin  doesn't necessarily solve a problem everyone has at the moment, but it can solve problems a large population  does have -- those who send money home to less fortunate countries, are unbanked or can't get credit cards.  Imy guessing you are none of those.
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:31:39
Still not getting the point.  I'm saying they ARE associated with bitcoin by accepting it via bitpay/coinbase.  If bitcoin WAS a well-known ponzi scheme/scam, they would not choose to be associated with it at all (meaning, they would not be bitpay/coinbase merchants).

We tested it out tonight -- worked great.  Although it seems like you can only reference the map showing dig spots on coinplanter.com, and it isn't integrated into the app itself.  It would be nice if you could find spots, or be notified of spots nearby, via the app alone.  Nice job!  I plan on planting some at work to see how long it takes for someone to actually dig them up.
Edit:  Additional feedback -- the map on the web site was updated in real time.  After I planted, I checked that my location showed up.  After we dug it up, it was gone.  So that's a plus.
Edit 2:  Another question.  I put a password in, but not a password hint since it wasn't necessary in our test.  If you have a password hint, does that come up on the dig screen prior to hitting the dig button?  Just curious how it shows up.  We hit dig without entering a password and it acted as though nothing was there, so it essentially was invisible (aside from showing up on the map) unless you put the password in first.
@_date: 2014-07-12 02:09:11
Think again about how far away 2140 is.  Do you really think we need to be that concerned about transaction fees and the network 126 years from now?  If you think everything about bitcoin is going to be the same as it is now 126 years in the future, you need to think twice.  Be realistic.

How about you just publicly respond to the repeated questions regarding requiring personal information when the user doesn't have any bank account linked to their coinbase account, instead of continually dodging the question?  If it's required of coinbase to do that for some reason to comply with the law, why isn't that simply being stated?  Is it because saying that would not be the truth?
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:26:46
You're right in that it doesn't make a ton of sense with the way you explain it.  But you're thinking about it the way things are right this minute.  In the future, maybe you earn bitcoin instead of earning dollars which need converting to bitcoin.  Maybe you buy something at the store and the store holds bitcoin rather than converting it, thus saving them some more money and possibly resulting in more savings for you if you use bitcoin.  You need to be a bit more forward looking instead of trying to figure out why bitcoin isn't a huge spending currency right now.

You may not see the problem, but non-techies will.  It reminds me of the earlier early internet, before AOL was in every household.  Nowadays, practically anyone can sit in front of a computer and get online by simply opening up a browser window.  Don't even have to dial-up anything.  It wasn't always that easy.  There was a learning curve that people had to get past, as well as some "dumbening" down of technology and applications to make them more user friendly.  I would be very surprised if the usage of bitcoin addresses like we know them today is still the norm in a few years.

I guess I'm biased being at the company I work for, but I don't really see the big deal with things like this.
Let's say you shop at a grocery store with a "big brother" loyalty card.  They track the things you buy, and people cry about it.  What's the big deal?  If you don't use the loyalty card, you'll get coupons/vouchers in the mail or weekly mailings to your house with coupons for products you don't give a damn about.  But if you take part in said loyalty program, you end up getting coupons/vouchers for products that you actually purchase (big brother, gasp!)  You end up getting more relevant offers provided to you. Don't want them?  Fine, ignore them.  How is that different than ignoring the countless other advertisements that are sent your way every day? 
At least this way, you're actually being provided an advertisement that you might actually find useful.  You were going to buy product X anyway, or you thought about buying it.  Who cares if your grocery store knows what you're buying?  If you knew how much other information about you is out there in the hands of other companies, you'd probably care a little less about what your grocery store knows.

I suppose there is just a certain level of confidence.  You know what you do with your PC, and if you're the sole user, you *should* have a certain level of confidence that you haven't done anything stupid.  No guarantees though.  I don't really have any concerns that I've unknowingly installed a keylogger or wallet stealer, nor am I really concerned that any thief could access my printer and know that I've printed wallets.  Now if I was an early adopter with thousands of bitcoins, then I'd be a bit more paranoid about that stuff!

For those of us who are NOT new to bitcoin, it seems like all the information is there and it should be obvious how to get bitcoin.  But it's really not for a newbie.  It can be very confusing.  I gave up the first time I started looking into acquiring bitcoin because I couldn't seem to find a straight answer.
I thought it would be good to have a beginners guide to buying bitcoin broken up by country/area of the world.  For instance, in the US the most obvious choice is Coinbase.  For someone in Europe, Coinbase really isn't the best option.  There is no one answer for everyone, and if someone can look at the list of options for their region, it would be much easier.  It's not a good idea to just suggest one option, but there might be several options with pros/cons to each one that could be highlighted so users can make their choice.
@_date: 2014-09-15 18:23:00

The people on the other end of the line don't want to be talking to you as much as you don't want to be talking to them.  I'm not defending New Egg, but a company can have the best training possible, the fact of the matter is it's up to the customer service person to not be an idiot.  Everyone has had bad customer service before, and you can't blame the company as a whole for one person's idiocy.

What if that same regulation spreads to that new place?  This is why ignoring regulations and pretending they don't exist doesn't seem like a reasonable solution to me.  While it's fine for a user who can just go about his business as normal, it will have huge effects on businesses that can't just say screw it, we don't need to follow those regulations.

I don't understand your argument.  This is a DOCUMENTARY.   They are trying to reach those who don't already know about bitcoin, so they are releasing the way the want to and the way they think that could happen.   How is this outdated?  Even if they released it a year ago, would you complain that it's outdated because it covered events from the year prior?  These complaints are absurd.  It's their documentary, they can release it the way they want and the way they see fit.  You don't want to watch it because you're mad it wasn't released earlier or for free?  Then don't.

I watched the video and I don't really understand why a customer would leave him simply because of that.  They simply interviewed him about how he accepts it, they never said he was a criminal or associated with drugs or money laundering.  If a loyal customer walked away because of that segment, they're too stupid to know how to even ride a bike.

They have been safe so far.  buy your bitcoin, then leave them there if you want to trust them with your coins, or move them to another wallet where you control the private keys.
 you mean the instant buy verification?  it was worth it to me, i didnt feel like waiting days for transactions complete.  it will still be some time before you can do instant buys after starting the verification process though.

Someone could easily steal your coins if theyre on an unencrypted paper wallet and you lose it.  i recall a post where someone dropped their paper wallet on the street.  fortunately they found it a short time later, but anyone could have sweeped it if they found it and knew what it was.... Most people would have no clue tho.

Was bitcoin worth almost $600 at that time?  No, that's why it was easy to get them for relatively nothing.  Now is different, that's my point.  
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:31:23
Small is relative.  If you've never setup a paper wallet before, it's also a good exercise to go through it, if only just to do it for the first time.  You also didn't specify how you were currently storing them.  If you had them on Gox in early Feb. and I suggested a paper wallet and you didn't think it was worth the hassle, you'd probably feel differently now :-)

There is value for the person running the site.  They get people to watch ads and they pay them peanuts for it, pocketing the rest of the ad revenue.
We're in agreement on your last paragraph.  I'm sure the people that do this type of thing do it once, realize it's a complete waste of time, then never do it again.  But people immediately think "Hey, free bitcoin for just watching an ad!"  They neglect to do the math like you did, which shows you it is pointless.

Not to mention, when a large company like this gets involved, along with new people hearing about it in the news, chances are a large percentage of its employees who were not aware of bitcoin now start looking into it a bit more seriously.

Nicely done.  It's one thing for a single business to take a step out into uncharted territory and begin accepting bitcoin, but these multiple businesses are making a smart move and banding together to do this.

They can afford to give discounts because the insigts they can gain from that shoppers data are worth the investment.  Rewards programs are about keeping loyal customers loyal.  one loyal customer to a retailer can be worth more than ten non-loyal customers.  the reason they want to track your shopping habits is so they can tailor incentives specifically to you.  this makes the loyal customer feel like they are getting personalized perks and offers (because they are) that they wont just toss in the trash, increasing their engagement with the retailer (return on investment).

because people will say it won't work since it is the same symbol for thai bhatt, and will ignore the fact that $ is used for more than just US dollar and the world hasn't ended yet.  Perfect solution is to introduce the double line B into unicode.  If it was there, the conversation would be over.

There are plenty of other symbols that also are in unicode and not used as a currency symbol.  Simply because this one contains B we use it, even though it looks nothing like any symbol anyone had suggested or used up until now?  The "bitcoin accepted here" graphic with the correct symbol is used in countless places -- that should be ignored?  Seems like a lazy way of picking a symbol, rather than getting the right one made available.  
@_date: 2014-09-28 01:52:17

@_date: 2014-03-24 18:35:33
Personally, I don't think we should be using that exact symbol.  I think we should have 2 lines, not the 1 line, through the B, just like in the logos.  People already know it by that, not the other proposed symbol.  Yes, I know, it doesn't exist, but that doesn't mean we should settle on something else simply because it is there already.
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:18:05
Aside from confirmation times, which I don't think is a real problem, your other arguments would likely also apply to any other alt which became as big as bitcoin.  Are you saying other alts have a lower barrier of entry to purchase?  How so?
Although, why are you saying high transaction fees?  A couple pennies is a high transaction fee to send ANY amount of money instantly anywhere in the world?  If you're buying a cup of coffee, then yes I can see that.

@_date: 2014-09-28 00:17:09


That's my point, history is already outdated.


Guess what, those people aren't the mainstream audience they're also trying to reach.


They stated many times the donations were a very small amount and this was not a crowd funded film.  Show me where they stated the film would be released according to your time line and would be "open source"? 
Think of how many years of work went into this film.  If you spent that time working on it, you probably wouldn't appreciate others telling you what to do with it in the end.  If this film can reach a huge audience that is not familiar with bitcoin already, it will be a success in my opinion.
Edit: no, "downvote, I don't care" means downvote me because I know you will and I don't care. You can believe it means whatever you like, I also don't care.

Same with coinbase.  neither are exchanges, but some people might refer to them as such (incorrectly).  being who he is, he probably should not have called them that, but i think he is really trying to reach out to those who are not in-the-know right now, so most will be none the wiser and ultimately are only interested in buying, not trading.

The fees would have been much lower if you bought elsewhere (like Circle), so you can't complain too much about fees when ATMs are well known to not be cheap.  If you needed the Bitcoin ASAP and couldn't buy on circle, then you were paying for the convenience of getting it quickly at an ATM.

A government would never do that because it's transparent.  Could they create their own digital currency?  Sure, but it would still be backed by the government (i.e. nothing), so it isn't any better than regular currency.  Sure, people that don't think twice about that kind of stuff would be fine with it, but the people that look to bitcoin for the same reason people look to gold won't be fooled.

Do this, unless you plan on actively spending your coin.  If you're holding, then this is easiest.

You said over in "The goal is to raise awareness of the usefulness of bitcoins for sending money internationally. All we want to do is get some visibility for the idea and let people know where they can find out more."
Having said that... rather than just randomly think of things that could be sponsored, wouldn't we be better off coming up with an idea that REALLY illustrates the need that bitcoin solves (sending money internationally/other bitcoin usefulness)?  I'm not saying I have the answer, but it seems like instead of just throwing money at a sports team, we could get creative and come up with something that proves the usefulness of bitcoin and gets visibility at the same time.  It could still be sponsorship of some kind, but doesn't necessarily have to be that.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:15:26
You need to think like a business owner -- a publicly traded business owner.  They need to think of their shareholders, and many shareholders would probably be questioning why they are holding magic internet money instead of dollars.  They can't just make a decision to start holding bitcoin until it's more mainstream and "acceptable" for them to do so in the eyes of their shareholders/investors.

I agree that advertising is not a good way to spend money, but what concerns people like me the most (those who don't think you're off stealing funds, and giving you the benefit of the doubt) is the cost.  You've talked about this new forum software being developed for quite a while now.  Are these guys working full time?

I'd be curious what % of half the class that knew about bitcoin only knew about Silk Road or money laundering.  Unfortunately, it's probably a large %.  Either way, sometimes any knowledge of it (even negative) is a good thing... once they hear about it, they start looking into it more to understand what it is, and that is where many will jump on board.

Every piece of software everywhere has small and large bugs.  Since, as you say, it is only a minor annoyance, it is likely low on their priority list.  Im sure it'll be fixed at some point and pushed out with other fixes simultaneously, but they would be doing everyone a disservice if they didn't focus on major bugs first.

You tell whomever you want to get it i suppose.  Who knows, you can make some kind of a game out of it, I didn't create it :-)  People could race to dig up the coins.  You can say, "ok, the coins are at such and such location, the password is blablabla, first one there gets them".  Your lamp post thought was what I was referring to -- making it so only a person at that location knows the password.  Not someone spoofing their location, grabbing coins all over the place that don't have passwords.

@_date: 2014-07-27 19:47:31
I know you didn't say that, my point is you don't get something for nothing.  Advertisers aren't going to sit there and hand over any significant amount of bitcoin for 20 seconds of your time because they know most people are completely ignoring the ads.  Actually, having not even looked at the site, I imagine the ad profit is going to the site owner, who in turn is giving you a small little piece of the revenue.  Ad revenue for one view is tiny, so a piece of that is going to be miniscule. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:47:01
Didn't say you were a shill.  But if you make posts about GAW, to avoid looking hypocritical you shouldn't later complain about GAW posts here.  Clearly shit with paycoin is blowing up, and people here would argue that it is relevant to bitcoin.

Are you being serious right now?  How long after the Internet was mainstream did it take for social media to explode?  6 years is not a long time, especially considering bitcoin was flying under most peoples radars for a while in the beginning.

Ya know, now that you mention it, I read the entire article and didn't even *think* about how they made no mention of drugs or silk road.  That tells me something .

I would argue almost everything you just said is not true.  Managing different addresses should not be a pain in the ass.  Any decent wallet would handle that for you, and it should be pretty transparent.  Maybe not right now, but in the future.
How can someone see what a destination address is for?  Are you saying amazon will have one published address for people to use?  No.  They'd have an address per transaction I'm sure (think bitpay).  Who says you could tell it was amazon?  
Your last example is also flawed.  Your bank account doesn't change for every transaction so it is not comparing apples to apples.

Considering you've posted about gaw here in the past, as steve_lurker pointed out, maybe you should just stop talking now.
Edit: gaw, not paycoin

Well, most businesses don't want to be unknown.

Just want to make sure you differentiate buy/deposit.  It doesn't work that way if you connect your bank account and buy 1 BTC at coinbase.  Once you buy, it's done and the Bitcoin takes 3 or so days to arrive (if you aren't able to instant buy there yet).  If it went down in price, you still only own the 1 btc you bought.  Depositing money is only available in some states I believe.  It's a somewhat newish feature there.  So you could deposit money and buy at a later date.

If you stick around long enough you'll see the cartoon Rollercoaster gif and Mr bean Rollercoaster gif about a million times. I don't really come here much anymore....

Sold one at 4100, then another half today at 7300. If anything, I'm just trying to make back my investment, but of course if it keeps going up I'll regret it.  I certainly see no problem with selling some to make up for what you spent tho.  If it all goes to zero then you'd be glad you did.... not that I expect that to happen.

When I said half in my post, I meant half a bitcoin. Not half of all my bitcoin.

Remember you're also asking about things that aren't going to happen for over 100 years, so I wouldn't venture to guess what's going to be happening then with bitcoin right now.

Fair point, I'm just referring to no more coins being generated, which was the original question.

Not the same guy, but I used kraken to convert to xbt and transfer out.
