Once both BTC and LTC have lightning with atomic swaps then they almost become one super coin in combination. Imagine being able to seamlessly move between BTC and LTC and to be able to pay an LN invoice in either which the invoice issuer can receive in either coin.

OK so lets say you want to run a news web site that charges people $0.01 in real time per unique page view - you have 10k online users viewing one page every minute on average, thats over 166 tx/s. So thats one business that has probably used your entire 10mb block. But you say "premium news site dont work that way - they tend to use a monthly subscription models" well yes thats the point, LN is enabling new business models that simple arnt possible with all-tx-on-chain systems.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:58:52
Not completely free but as the network gets larger the fees will drop (due to higher probability of channels being refiled by reverse transaction flows). In the long term the fees will tend towards the marginal cost of running nodes i.e. miniscule.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:26:02
I think its a risk worth taking, I myself will be putting up a node and funding it with maybe 0.001 btc which I would be prepared to lose. The reason we have to take the risk is that most new money coming into crypto is going in into alts - I've maybe spoken personally to a several dozen cypto nubes in the last month and maybe 1 in 10 is even remote interested in btc. We need to show the world that btc is the future of the internet of money and not the "myspace of crypto" (which is unfortunately the general perception out there in the real world).
Yeah I'm sure bcash fanboys will make a big deal of any misshaps on LN but as far as I'm concerned thats manageable, what isnt manageable is for btc to lose market dominance an be seen as obsolete technology.

I dont see how its any different to a main chain tx between wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:46:56
Exactly, "free" tx coins are snake oil and can never work because there is no set of incentives to grow the network to the necessary scale for it to be secure. Even etherium is having to tread very carefully with PoS because they recognize that it does not solve BGP and so needs a fallback human intervention strategy. Also these psuedo-free coins generally have tx initiators run a PoW which meas they cant scale downwards to high frequency nano transaction is the same way that LN can. Basically with a free tx coin you need some disincentive to spam and that mechanism is probably going to have worse economics and usability to a small fee.

The difference being that an exchange doesn't have to magic up new bitcoin (that 6%) from thin air.

Yes scaling improvements have been made but currently the value of bitcoin is pushing up the price of transactions faster that the improvements (such as segwit) are able to contain it. I dont subscribe to the big block / zero fees model but as far I'm I'm concerned fees over about $5 are damaging to bitcoin. Of course if (like me) someone has made big profits off of bitcoin then high fees are no big deal because they come from profit, however someone buying buying a modest amount of bitcoin right now is going to have a different perspective - a $20 fee on $200 of bitcoin is extortionate to them and may turn them off bitcoin onto something else. If bitcoin fees are allowed to get out of control we will lose some proportion of the current and future generations of crypto investors and users to some other coin and all of us long term bitcoin holders will lose value as a result. Lightning network is needed now, I mean really right now, and even if we get it soon we still need to keep eye on fees because someone will probably pay a $5 to open a channel as a one off or every now and then, they probably wont be happy to do this with fees at $20 or more.

I'm concerned about this myself to be honest. Its now at the point where I cannot recommend bitcoin to new people because I'm embarrassed about the high fees. More than $5 feels like too high to me. Looking at the mempool size increases for recent weeks it looks like the bitcoin network is going to seize up in about a months time.

Factors that give us a sustained bull market:
1) Significant pent up demand, as in a large number of (or deep pocketed) potential buyers waiting for the bottom. 
2) One or more significant new cohort of buyers. In 2017 it was south koreans, japanese and US retail investors.
3) Wider adoption across the board.
In the short term we are over reliant on 1 and 2, we may just to have wait until 3 gets some traction.

It doesnt look quite to good for the supermarket worker who earns $10 an hour and wants to buy $100 of bitcoin. To be worth hodl'ing in the long term, bitcoin will need some degree of grass roots adoption and use and not just among people in the top few % of the income range.

So all of the estimates for a main net beta say "2018" well when in 2018 ?. Personally I think so much is going to happen in the crypto space that we cannot afford to wait another 9 months or 12 months because its just too big a window for some alt to gain some traction as micro transaction coin at bitcoins expense. If we have software which is basically working now then whats the harm in just going for it ? perhaps initially with a cap on amounts that can be held in channels (say 0.01 btc). I want to use LN now, I want to use it for donations and stuff to youtube channels, I'm prepared to accept the risk of losing a few $. We have to move faster than "bitcoin time", I mean the pace of things has increased beyond what most of us imagined right ?, so lets get it out there and start using it.

bitcoin.com is teaching people the valuable lesson that bitcoin is not an organisation or company. Imagine if some sensible person owned bitcoin.com was pro BTC, 5 years from now everyone would treat it as the official mouth piece of bitcoin, now imagine what would happen if some bad actor got control of it and the damage they could do.
However since we already have bad actors in control of bitcoin.com and twitter  bitcoin is forced to learn to fight these social attacks now and that makes it more resilient in the long term. Bitcoin will grow with the all pervasive massage that noone owns it.

\&gt;If I wanted to get paid on the LN from a client, I couldn't even do it, as I wouldn't have enough personal liquidity.
Yes you can, you just let whoever is sending you funds initiate the channel. The next person who needs to send you some might not need to if they can route via the first payers channel, over time as the network of channels grows its less likely that a new person want to send you funds has to open a direct channel. Thats how LN is supposed to work.

\&gt;Do Institutional Investors want exposure to Bitcoin or only exposure to the PRICE of Bitcoin? 
You cannot construct a derivative instrument like a cash settled future that allows more people to go long than short unless the issuer is taking price risk themselves. The only way to allow a majority of people to go long without taking a price risk is to hold the underlying (which is why most ETFs which spot track various markets hold the underlying).
@_date: 2018-09-19 10:02:54
Thats true, I was thinking of more simplistically though to be honest, if someone holding a depreciating currency they are more likely to move savings into a non-depreciating currency (bitcoin) either temporarily or permanently if its very easy to do so, as it would be with an ETF for example. 
Also governments and banks will come under more pressure to not inflate their currencies if they know its quick and easy for people to swap them for bitcoin, or if they dont there will be a flight to bitcoin - the so called hyperbitcoinisation. 
This last point is really what bitcoin was invented for as per the genesis block statement ".. second round of bailouts", the less barriers there are between bitcoin and fiat the better bitcoin can fulfill its original purpose of taking monetary power away from central banks.

Its like betting on horses the bets must balance out otherwise the "house" has to pay the difference.  On the other hand holding the underlying means you can issue an effectively unlimited number of tickets without price risk because when people buy the ticket you buy the underlying with that money and likewise when they sell, you take a small % commission, job done, almost risk free business. From what I can gather bakkt is essentially using one day physical delivery contracts to simulated a backed ETF but without needing specific approval.

\&gt; My argument is that LN is flawed, since it forfeits the most important properties of Bitcoin- direct P2P transaction without trusting a 3rd party. If you forfeit that, why not just use a bank? 
At no point are you giving a third party the ability to move your funds or censor your transaction. Even watchdogs do not need to be trusted as at no point do they control your funds, rather you are relying on a network actor to act in your mutual best interests, its not much different to relying on miners to mine your on chain transaction.

@_date: 2018-08-08 13:49:12
\&gt; I argue it is inherently flawed, and you say it has its limits
No, its just a very specific set of engineering tradeoffs. 
Only by using a transient ledger can you eventually discard transactions when they are rolled up into a netted out (settled on chain) position. Only by being able to discard netted out transactions can you achieve true peer to peer near unlimited scaleability as seen on the internet itself. in order to allow ledgers to be transient  you need a set of rules which allow the channel to be closed by one party where the other is AWOL.
You cant square this circle, ultimate scaleability requires transient data, which in turn requires a level of "liveness" of the participants. A system where every tx is persisted forever (thus allowing unbounded offline periods) can never scale this well.

Unlikely at this point because there have so many opportunities for bitcoin to die and yet its still here. Mid 2015 was probably the time it would have faded into obscurity as general interest was near zero at it had been underwater price wise for a year and a half.
I'm not sure that people who were not bitcoin holders during this time can really appreciate just how bad things were, really imagine it - you have been underwater by 50% for over a year and you dont bother checking the price from one month to the next, and its not just you its countless other HODLers, I swear I went 6 months once without even thinking to look at coinmarketcap.

Your right in that mainstream adoption for day to day use has not materialised (not only for bitcoin but for cyptocurrency in general).
I see adoption timeframes like this:
Store of value: now (low) -&gt; 1-3 years (moderate) -&gt; 5 years (high)
Digital cash / online money: now (very low) -&gt; 1-3 years (low) -&gt; 5 years (moderate)
Dapps: now (zero) -&gt; 1-3 years (very low) -&gt; 5 years (moderate)
For the next year at least bitcoin store of value is pretty much the only game in town.
Digital cash and dapps will come later, dont expect any appreciable take up with the next couple of years, but at some point one of both of these may explode rapidly.

No that isn't a grammatical error I'm in bitcoin for money, not just the money. What I mean by that is that I want to remove the ability of banks to censor and print money and  I want to make a healthy personal profit in the long term on the back of that. Obviously the technology is an enabler for that.
So, no IMO we dont need an endless stream of good news because that only has a short term effect, the long term value of bitcoin comes will come from the degree to which its properties of censorship resistance and low inflation are appealing to people which in turn will drive adoption. We will get ETFs and whatever eventually but it really doesnt matter whether its now or a year or several years time.
If your time frame for holding bitcoin is less than 5 years or so then your essentially playing the worlds biggest game of poker rather than backing a new idea, so I will just wish you luck with that but thats not a game I want to play.

All this talk about fractionally reserving bitcoin using ETFs and and other backed instruments is bollocks, bitcoin is the easiest commodity on earth to verify that the underlying exists as you just ask for the public key. 
ETFs and Futures are heavily regulated to ensure that this does not go on and that if something claims to be fully fully backed than it is exactly that.  There is hundreds of years of reputation of the stock exchanges and markets that is being protected and yet we have people on here who call them crooks yet who are storing their bitcoin with a tin pot (by comparison) company like coinbase who have no oversight, no transparency, and could well be fractionally reserving the shit out of bitcoin right now.
Let me restate that very clearly: **there is way more probability of the current generation of crypto exchanges fractionally reserving bitcoin without people noticing than there will ever be for regulated ETFs and Futures.**
Certified fully backed instruments will be great for bitcoin. They will certainly be a lot safer and more accountable and transparent than any current crypto exchange.

The idea that falling prices discourage spending is clearly nonsense, people buy stuff all the time knowing that it will be less expensive later e.g. mobile phones. Also inflation actually causes a worse distribution of wealth because the entity that creates the new money (banks in the fiat system) eventually end up with nearly all the wealth. Furthermore inflation leads to rent seeking behaviour where the rich buy assets knowing they will increase in value and can therefore charge more to rent them to people who cant afford to buy them.

Well yes of course they none of them are "allowed", the point being that they are poorly regulated so you have no way of knowing if they are cheating.

@_date: 2018-08-15 09:31:17
The ETF will have to buy bitcoin from current holders, and it will have to do so incrementally as people buy the ETF.  Try to imaging how much it would cost to **incrementally** acquire say 1% of all bitcoin, as they buy more the price goes up so each bitcoin they buy becomes more expensive than the previous one.
Even if an ETF becomes the largest single holder of bitcoin (again pretty much impossible) its still relatively benign, as mentioned above, an ETFs buy and sell activity is directly driven by trades on the ETF itself, - a spot tracking ETF must make sure its Net Asset Value (in this case the amount of bitcoin it owns) tracks the overall ETF value very closely otherwise it can wipe out its commission (its profit) very quickly. Hence it has almost no leeway for the fund to trade independently of the actual ETF buy/sells.
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:25:28
ETFs will be a much safer way to store bitcoin than any of the current cypto exchanges. Not as safe as having your own keys but much safer than the likes of coinbase.
The idea that physically backed ETFs can be fractionally reserved or otherwise scammy is just FUD, like all the bullshit around "paper gold", all nonsense, ETF are regulated up the wazoo and the entire viability of stock markets the world over rely in them, many of the world wealthiest individuals trust ETFs with billions of their money. This is why is so hard to get an ETF in the first place, because of all the regulatory requirements. But thats what makes them useful and (relatively) trustworthy.

Its only falkvinge and a few other twats over at bcash that actually try an argue its centralised.
The thing is its a free market and economies of scale dictate that some nodes will become popular hubs, **this is OK, so long as the option to create a direct channel to the other party exists, large hubs cannot engage in censorship, ever.**
Its ironic that bcashers harp on about it - the coin with almost completely centralised mining and node hosting accuses lightning of being centralised, its comedy gold.
Do not worry about this, do not waste effort arguing with bcashers, and they should be worrying about the problems of their own shitcoin and not made up flaws in other coins.

Its simple arithmetic you cant have more money flowing out (your profit above trend) than is flowing in (other peoples losses vs trend).
If it were possible for everyone (or even most people) to make a profit trading then most people in the world would not need to work ever again, we could all just learn this one magic trading scheme and all make near infinite amounts of money with it.

Personally, being a non US resident, I wouldnt use a US based exchange as I dont trust the US authorities not to seize it all one day but thats probably me being paranoid, in fairness to coinbase they have millions of happy customers and the overwhelming likelihood is that you will end up being another one. My personal favourite bitstamp and thats what I recommend to anyone in the EU.
Generally the risks of exchanges and other online services is overblown here, most people get burned because they were careless or stupid, exchanges have even reimbursed most of the funds that have been lost in hacks.
Buy some bitcoin on a decent exchange, take your time to learn about key management etc and then think about storing it yourself once you are confident you understand the mechanics. Remember that more bitcoin has been lost to paranoia and over elaborate or inept personal security (losing devices, losing passwords etc) than actual hacks (if we dont count mtgox which I dont think will ever be repeated).

The economics of mining do not work unless its mostly sunk cost. If a miner was able to sell some byproduct of mining that approached or equalled the cost of the electricity then their marginal cost of mining essentially becomes zero. This means that the cost of attacking the network also becomes zero.

They wont until such time as the token represent an enforceable claim on the business's income or equity. If that doesn't apply then the token is a currency in all but name and as such is in direct competition with bitcoin, hence the bitcoin community will (rightly) do everything in their power to undermine it.

Its possible to steal funds in a lightning by (for example) sending someone money and then force closing the channel with an old state (i.e. the state where you havnt yet sent the money). However the party at the other end of the channel has a time window within which then can submit the later state. 
A watchtower performs this final state submission on behalf of a node that is offline at the time of the channel closure so that it cant be cheated on in this manner.
Its worth stressing that you only need watchtowers if 1) you receive funds AND 2) you are offline for more than a day.
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:37:40
Lightning is specifically designed for small/fast/cheap transactions and it works especially well for consumer-&gt;vendor payments. Typically a consumer would open a channel with a popular ish hub and leave it open pretty much indefinitely or until the channel runs out of funds. Hopefully the cost of opening/closing channels can be kept reasonable as lightning liquid and other future bitcoin tech help keep the main chain from becoming congested.
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:21:52

The semantic nit picking isnt really helping.

Thats all well and good but mesh networks arnt going to take off unless there is a perceived benefit for the average (non bitcoin/cypto) user.

There isn't any review or testing process that guarantees to catch all bugs. Also code reviews tend to operate on a diminishing returns basis - two reviewers will be significantly better than just one, three a bit better than two, four very slightly better than three etc etc. 
Once your at the level of scrutiny and testing applied to the bitcoin code your probably near to the limit of how good you can get at preventing defects in a single code base. Beyond that though there are probabilistic methods such as having multiple version of the consensus code clean-room developed from a common spec by different teams and having all version vote on the final block validity.  This is the kind of approach you would need to go to the next level of ultimate reliability.
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:53:47
I do appreciate the massive effort that went into this but ... from engineering standpoint your idea seems like a very hacky way to achieve some potentially laudable results.
If we really want to dramatically increase the scope of what can be added and changed by soft-forked in the future then I'd rather see a solidly engineered solution via a non-contentious hard-fork now while such a thing is potentially still viable.
I feel that we letting the bitcoin cash'ers make us paint ourselves into a corner with the no-hard-fork-under-any-circumstance approach, I think we could do it once and it would still be "bitcoin"
If we really want these things badly enough then lets do it properly and not by leveraging an exploit.
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:26:16


This is exactly the sort of thinking that bitcoin cash supporters want to drive us towards, to back us into a philosophical corner - the idea that "bitcoin" has an objective definition. 
If it has an objective definition or set of defining criteria then that definition is a point of attack. If "that which never ever hard forks" is part of that definition then should the situation arise there that is essential to survival (such as a catastrophic bug) they we will die because the objective definition doesn't fit anymore.
Bitcoin is what most people call bitcoin, its a consensus, it doesn't have to be unanimous just a very significant majority. All things considered I'd leave things alone, but if there was demand for the features enabled by the forward blocks then I would support that, but I would NOT support doing on the back of exploit and ending up with an overly fragile complicted system just because we want to pay lip service to some self imposed lofty principal (never hard forking in this case).
So I say ... either we do it in a properly engineered manner, or we don't do it.
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:18:23


By tacking a huge transaction load off the main chain it allow on-chain and LN to both be cheaper, so its still a win.

In order for ICOs to be a positive thing for bitcoin and cypto generally, there needs to be some way for holders to be rewarded other than through token value i.e. they need to have some sort of yield or represent an enforceable equity share of the company.
Until that point is reached they are just money printing which serves only to part fools with their money and dilute bitcoin.
This is probably possible with smart contracts but its not gonna happen in highly regulated environments like the US UK or EU, this sort of innovation will need to come from somewhere else.

Think of a lightning channel as a pre payed debit card, the money is still yours but you have ring fenced it for that specific use. There is a small fee for putting the funds the card or reclaiming them but actually using it for payments is free (or so close to being free it makes no difference).
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:37:44
The salient point is whether from a legal perspective the conversion occurs before or after the money is deemed to have changed hands.
Its quite clear in this case that the conversion occurs after the money legally changes hands. Thus from both a practical and legal standpoint the payment takes place in bitcoin.
This also means that the payment itself it would not generate a further taxable event in the same way it would if you converted it to fiat yourself, which might be a big benefit for some people.

A channel fund is a stake in the same way that a LN invoice payment is a transaction i.e. temporarily true until the channel is closed.

There is no proof of this, its pure speculation on the part of precious metal advocates, probably an excuse as to why their investments havn't done as well as they hoped. Anyway pick some gold ETFs, lets say the blackrock or ishares funds, check the audited net asset value of the funds - its about 99.9%of the ETF spot price. Some of worlds richest individuals and corporations keeps billions in these funds, you really think they would do so if they werent backed properly ?.
For all the scorn that crypto fans pour on the legacy financial system, it is spectacular good at certain things, one of them being to establish trust in virtualisations of various commodities, its something that been going on for hundreds of years in stock markets the world over with countless trillions traded without any major scandal. ETFs are just a modern electronic continuation of this tradition which started with paper tickets.

Yep keep HODLing people, reject the traders FUD that you will see in these comments. The traders need you to lose your nerve and join the game for them to make profits. Dont be trader fodder. HODL.

No these were not "free", whatever fiat currency you used is inflating away your wealth with every passing hour with no prospect of a reversal of that trend. I dont know which currency you actually used but pretty much all of them are used for institutional theft of wealth, war and tyranny. It may not have cost you nominal units of that currency but the negative externalities of using fiat are huge.

I think thats a bit harsh, CBOE is an exchange, and while they are part of the financial establishment they are relatively benign actors compared to private and central banks, its not like they are in the business of printing money or anything. Yeah holding your own keys is preferable in ideal circumstances but you could do a lot worse than trusting theses guys, its certainly going to be safer than any of the current crypto exchanges because ETFs have to be independently audited to prove they hold the underlying asset 1:1

Individual LN payments are not visible on the main chain - only channel open and close operations. Well OK if you were to open a channel, do just one tx then close it then it would be but thats a rare edge case.
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:38:37
Mindless fud, you pump many millions into launching a trading/custody platform precisely because you want skin in the game but without underlying price exposure - because you want to be an arms dealer not a combatant.
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:50:36


Within the same layer yes, but this is why a 2 layer system works much better than a single layer ...


LN uses "eventual security". The security can be deferred and applied by the main chain so that LN is free to maximise decentralisation and scalablity. You can only break the security of LN by brute forcing someones private keys (just like the main chain).

Adoption will be slow and gradual for the time being but eventually volatility will reduce as the cap gets larger.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:52:31
\&gt; I said that LN uses unconfirmed bitcoin transactions to move coins around.
"unconfirmed" has a very specific meaning in bitcoin, it means broadcast on the bitcoin network network but not in a block. Your not helping anyone by abusing the term to describe LN.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:43:31
Whats the block reward now ? - 12 BTC ?, well thats 1728 new bitcoin every single days that someone needs to buy just to keep the price level.
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:27:37
Which ever way you wash it LN does not use unconfirmed transactions since the tx's are signed by the counterparty which for the purposes of LN is a confirmation.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:49:39
Its misleading to call LN transactions "unconfirmed" because it implies that a double spend attack can be performed as per a main net non confirmed tx. LN tx's however are confirmed by the counter party within seconds and are binding and irrevocable.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:58:06


Sorry but NO they cannot do this, they cannot issue an arbitrary amount of long contracts to dilute demand for bitcoin because each long position has to be matched by a short position. 
This whole notion that CME &amp; CBOE are trying to damage bitcoin is just tinfoil hatter conspiracy fud, they are just doing exactly the same thing they do for other markets which is to allow people to insure against price volatility. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:21:56
When running a lightning node you are no more or less a money transmitter than when running a normal bitcoin full node. The only different between the two is that a main chain tx exists in eveyones copy of the blockchain whereas an LN tx exists only on the nodes involved in the tx. See what I am saying here ? - that by running a bitcoin node you are facilitating every transaction by validating it, this is not really any different to forwarding a LN transaction.
Anyway money transmitter laws generally only apply when trust that is placed in the transmitter to handle the money and LN is trustless.

UK has not used the shilling since decimalisation in 1971
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:51:56


Yes but its only an issue if your receiving funds - if you are only a sender then any early state replay attempt by your counterpart benefits you not them. If you are receiving funds then odds are you are a vendor who has their own node permanently online or at least not offline for 100 continuous blocks which is the channel force close period.

I dont "know" but it would probably have similar volatility to other highly/purely speculative assets such as silver and gold e.g. if bitcoin can reach $2.7T then I would expect the volatility to be in the same ball park as silver, probably lower if anything because it will be transacted a lot more. And yes I think bitcoin reaching a similar market cap to silver is eminently achievable.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:36:43
Yes massively good, probably the single biggest boost to bitcoin since its inception if it happens.

Theres an argument that its actually better to do the opposite: make it as easy as possible to build ASICs for the PoW, that way the hardware becomes more commoditised.

Eventually but customer-&gt;vendor transactions are where adoption starts, this is use case that can grow organically. Ease of receiving funds is a weak point in LN right now but this will be solved at some point.

For additional security create a small linux vm, use the vm's browser to save the page locally to the vm's desktop or wherever, disconnect vm from network then generate the address
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:52:09
I would suggest running electrum in a vm (with encrypted file system) or even better on a live linux booted from a usb -  looks interesting as its security focused and has electrum installed I think.
Seed backup wise I'm personally not a fan of physical paper and would recommend a encypted open/libra office document with a long but memorable password, then back that up on google drive or dropbox or whatever.
Remember that much more bitcoin has been lost by people losing keys than by getting hacked so don't get so elaborate about security that you put your keys at risk of being lost.

Security in a decentralised network is a metcalf property in the sense that it grows exponentially with the number of economically active full nodes. Given that, trying to maintain a linear ratio as the network grows seems like a fools errand.
