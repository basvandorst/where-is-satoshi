Such as a centralized database?
Is the benefit in having something publicly auditable? Then why not have a database set up with a web page that exposes certain contents of the database?
How would the consensus work? If not POW then it would just be the bank's solemn word that they didn't fuck with anything, right? Just like with a database.

But checking for and handling fraudulent charges requires attentiveness and phonecalls and paperwork and waiting for a new card.
The internet *needs* a way to pay a set amount without worrying about the recipient draining any more than they're supposed to.
Payment mechanisms that involve handing over the keys to your entire vault with each and every transaction--with flimsy insurance/policing procedures for handling theft after the fact--are just asinine.

It's already known that if you use a poor source of entropy for the signatures, then reusing the same private/public key pair will let someone deduce the private key from a pair of signatures. An Android RNG bug caused the theft of a bunch of coins in this manner a while back. If the victims had always used new change addresses, their funds would have been safe.

For reference:
The coins are just amounts stored in a public collective cloud database.
The wallet.dat stores private keys that can cryptographically authorize outgoing transactions for their corresponding addresses. (You can even import the keys into other apps to spend the coins)
The vanilla bitcoin client takes a while to mirror the data. It can only show a balance once it sees up-to-date transactions for the addresses  in the wallet.dat (assuming the wallet.dat has the correct keys, which apparently yours didn't).

All of blockchain.info's encryption+decryption for web wallets is currently done browser-side in javascript. So their servers currently have no access to your private keys (the things that authorize any transfers).
There are a few risks, mostly prevented with common sense:
1. A malicious person at blockchain.info could push out an update to the site with code that harvests your private keys or manipulates addresses when sending. (This can be prevented with the browser plugins that double-check the code, but those also have this same risk.)
2. Malware on your machine could log keystrokes and/or harvest keys from memory contents. (But this is just like with any wallet on an internet-connected machine)
3. You try to connect to blockchain.info on a malicious wifi hotspot or something and they give you a fake site instead. (This can be easily prevented by using https and paying attention to the Url-bar green padlock icons and shit.)
4. Choosing a weak password and leaking your signin-url or encrypted backup. If someone gets the same info that your browser receives, even encrypted, then they could possibly brute-force crack the password. (Note that this would be easier password cracking than most websites, since all the computing could be done offline instead of hitting a server)
5. Losing your password = no recovery. (as to be expected with any secure BTC storage mechanism)
6. (EDIT) The site goes down forever. (This can be mitigated with their backup options, see below)
Personally I feel it's 9.9/10 safe. The fact that they apparently make money from advertising makes me feel better about them being a legit operation. (If they were completely free I'd be paranoid that they're just playing some long game to gain trust before a massive harvest)

Oh yeah, backups.
Make sure you use one of blockchain.info's backup options (like dropbox or email) and they'll send you a backup file after each time you generate an address.
So if blockchain.info's servers are shut down by floods/nukes/obama, then you can use your password with a decryption tool to get the private keys in your backup file and import them into another wallet app.
Like  try your best to keep the backup file out of the hands of baddies.

Does blockchain.info know about your unconfirmed transaction?
Because alternatively, you could use  to make &amp; broadcast a new transaction.
1. Enter private key
2. Popup confirms that you will load unspent outputs from blockchain.info (this is the part that requires blockchain.info to have no knowledge of your transaction)
3. Set up transaction outputs.
4. Sign
5. Send
Only use if you trust brainwallet.org to keep your key safe. To their credit, the source code is typically under scrutiny, it looks like they fixed the randomness issue they had earlier, and they have enabled https.
Change output (to a change address) must be explicitly specified when creating a transaction. Any unspecified remainder of a transaction is what becomes the mining fee. There are stories of people accidentally sending hundreds of BTC to miners because they incorrectly assumed that only their specified 0.001BTC output was leaving their hands.
