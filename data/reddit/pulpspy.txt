I wouldn't trust the confidentiality of the account's password. Ning does not use HTTPS to transmit passwords, so anyone on the connection could sniff the password. This includes Tor exit nodes, which I assume the real Satoshi used.

If he's using Tor, the exit node knows his password. Because no HTTPS.

You can see the banking commitee's upcoming and past meetings here:
The last four were about Bitcoin, as well as the next two. Some people are bring a Bitcoin ATM to the Senators. 
I was the first expert during the linked to session.

Thanks, here are some additional resources.
The three papers cited by Satoshi in the white paper:
1991 - 
1993 - 
1997 - 
Here is the Princeton textbook which describes how it relates to the blockchain (page 15):
In terms of patents, I didn't have any particular ones in mind — I just know the area is encumbered. It is also possible they are all expired by now since its been a few decades. 
Finally, I want to say that I don't think a winnable infringement case could be made but companies just need a reasonable prospect to stop the case from being thrown out, and then settlements often occur to avoid the cost of a lawsuit. 
There is a ton written on the deficiencies of the US patent system but a nice treatment of it is are in these episodes of This American Life:

For the record, I don't think he is Satoshi either: 
He may be a private person but he isn't a hermit. He is in recent pictures (on the left):

Both are good. For two books that cover the same ground, they manage to feature a largely disjoint set of players in the Bitcoin world.
If I had to pick, I like Popper's slightly better (despite his insistence on the Satoshi = Szabo theory). However you can and should read both — the overlap is minimal.

The problem with this chart is that the designer started on the right-hand side and moved to the left. They should have started on the left with a comprehensive list of banks from the 90s and moved to the right.

This section of CSW's blog post weirded me out. I'm pretty sure I originated this idea, I don't know how he heard about it, and I was wrong. 
I noticed the existence of the hashcash/Bitcoin PoW (they are actually slightly different [1] from each other) in the 2000 Aura paper when I was preparing the research for a paper I wrote many years ago called CommitCoin, which is about time-stamping on Bitcoin. 
I told a few people about it -- that the 2000 Aura paper had the idea (not merely using a PoW to deal with spam, but the exact PoW of using a nonce to produce a hash image with a certain number of leading zeros, which is very different from the PoW in either the Dwork/Naor paper or the Juels et al one). I noted this paper pre-dated the hashcash paper which was 2002. 
The problem, which is in the very first sentence of the hashcash paper, is that while the paper was written in 2002, it was describing a protocol that went back 5 years. Later I confirmed that while the protocol varied somewhat over the years (and there were a few variants --- interactive and non-interactive), that idea was definitely there before the 2000 paper. There is another earlier 1998 paper that has effectively the same PoW as well [2] (in fact, this one is formulated as it is used in Bitcoin and not as in Hashcash).
Now how CSW came to learn all this I'm not sure. It is possible he independently discovered the same thing, but I feel this is unlikely. Perhaps someone I told mentioned it on IRC or elsewhere where CSW saw it. I'm not sure.

Nathaniel also tweeted that he was given the original  Gizmodo/Wired CSW "scoop" and didn't bite. 
BTW the last quote of the NYT article is the best. ;)

Would have been a great catch, but satoshi was agreed on in Feb 2011.

A few things.
(1) what is up with the story? The image is clipped and the text version also ends in the middle of a sentence. Is there a full version?
(2) If Satoshi were to explain Bitcoin to someone, starting with elliptic curve crypto is doubtful. It's use in Bitcoin is incidental and is never described in the white paper (in fact the words elliptic curve never appear in it)
(3) Satoshi would never ask if he had heard of a block chain since he invented it. (Although this could be misremembered and perhaps he asked about hash chains).
(4) That said, the Blind Sig Patent Expiry party would be the perfect crowd for Satoshi, a much more plausible place than CRYPTO where some other journalist went looking for Satoshi years ago.

A few other facts I didn't see posted:
Kleiman (DAK) and CSW published a book in 2007. 
DAK and CWS published a conference paper in late 2008. 
DAK posted to the cryptography mailing list, discussing this paper in Jan 2009. Satoshi's thread about Bitcoin's alpha release was posted a few weeks earlier and was an on-going thread (between Satoshi &amp; Hal &amp; others) at the time of DAK's post.
Thus it is highly probable that DAK was aware of Bitcoin during its first few weeks. 
Hypothesis: DAK is not Satoshi but got into Bitcoin early, introducing it to CSW at the time.

My comment in another thread was late and buried so I'm reposting:
