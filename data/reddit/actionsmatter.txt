So what? It does still contribute to global warming. Proof-of-work is energy-hungry by definition and there is no upper limit to how much energy the system can consume. I love bitcoin on so many levels but let's not bury our heads into the sands: let's face the fact that it is not a green innovation!
And don't use the argument that it is less energy hungry that the present-day financial system, because bitcoin does not replace it yet, it adds on top of it. So maybe in the future it will be a better alternative energy-wise but for now it's not and it adds up to the energy consumption of the existing financial system.
Now downvote me for this unpopular opinion :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:12:08
People who don't complain about bitcoin's energy consumption are: 
- misinformed 
- egoist (they don't care about the environment)
- tribal 
- have a dichotomic view of the world (bitcoin is perfect, it cannot has flaws)
- love echo chambers (no one should criticize bitcoins)
- a pack of ostriches! (You know, the head, sand..:)

Yeap, this [local.bitcoin.com]( is just an attempt at riding on the success of [localbitcoins.com]( Some people will type local bitcoin in google and will end up on their bitcoin cash copycat website. Nothing illegal here but it's just another attempt by the bitcoin cash people at using confusion to try to get more people using their coins. 
At first I was irritated by all this but now I'm like 'meh', I don't think they'll last long.

Thanks, nice to hear some healthy questions about the impact of bitcoin on society! In the same vein I'd like to see more discussion about the impact on the environment and ways to mitigate it. We know all the good things that bitcoin brings (censorship-resistance, impossible to inflate etc etc) but our community does not seem great at looking at the potential downsides.

But bitcoin is not replacing the financial system any time soon, if (and that's a big if) it happens, it will take a long time. So for now it's adding to the energy consumption of the financial system.
My question is what is the upper limit of bitcoin energy consumption? If the price rises a lot, there will be incentives for mining more and more, it's like an arm-race with no upper limit (unless the price of bitcoin remains low)... And I fear the consequences of  this profit-driven energy-consumption race.
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:21:06
Don't restrain yourself, lots of transactions and a queue in the mempool is a good stress test for bitcoin! Bitcoin is to be used, for large transactions and for small ones. Not using the network is not the right solution imho.
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:48:26


Thanks! But I'm not sure I understand the caring about not mixing coins... could you give me an example of why or when not mixing coins would be important?

Cool stuff. Maybe you could add an option to click on an URI link that will automatically open the default lightning wallet. (I saw this on another website, it's quite neat).
Do you increase the fee after each new update? As a sort of auction...
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:54:48
Same here. I see 3 possibilities:
1) Bitfinex/Tether is shady and Blockstream people didn't due their due diligence
2) Bitfinex/Tether is shady and Blockstream people are happy to be part of this shady stuff
3) I'm completely wrong and misguided and have been influenced by the FUD: Bitfinex/Tether is not shady at all and Blockstream is right doing business with them
I've my preference for one option but just don't know enough tbh, but in doubt I prefer to be on the safe side and will keep away from all of this! Quite happy to just slowly stacking sats as people seem to say these days.

Points 1 &amp; 2 assume that Bitfinex is shady ok, so then I see several reasons:
1) Ethics - if they have some reasonable proofs that something shady is happening, they decide to not be interacting with a shady business
2) PR, reputation - There is a risk that their brand will be associated with negative news (it's already happening actually)
But I see your point, if 1) they don't care about dealing with a shady business (no ethics), 2) they don't mind having their name associated with them (no fear of bad press), 3) they don't fear they might lose money if they go down, then sure, working with them make sense I guess. But I'll boycott them for that decision.
Again, I'm aware I might be wrong and Bitfinex and Tether are a good honest company and a fully USD backed stable coin (well USD+loans+non-cash reserves 75% backed coin, since they changed their terms and conditions...).
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:18:18
Sounds like it. The level of delusion at r/btc is astounding. Some conflate the fact that it was 'morally right to do' with the notion of 'honest miners', arguing that what happened was following Nakamoto consensus and was not a 51% attack..! Delusion.

If it was to prop up the number of transactions on the network, one would think they would use lots of different addresses to hide it, no?
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:34:53


Fixed it for you! ;)
Any one thinking about day trading thinks that they can beat the market, think that they'll be the 1% that makes money, it's human nature. IMO, day trading or short-term investment in coins in the hope of a 10x is useless for society and soul destroying for the individual (addicted to checking the price, etc). 
Best way to get your 0.57BTC is to earn some money by working and investing that money in bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-05 13:30:20
One of the incentive is that you get a head start in case running a lightning node in the future becomes profitable.
I also think that assuming that human people only take rational decisions based on incentives is wrong, we take a lot of decisions based on other good reasons: ethics (e.g. I want to run a lightning node to help bitcoin becoming more anonymous), emotions (e.g. simple pleasure of being an early adopters of a new technology), future expectations (e.g. lightning will be profitable in the future, so if I learn how to run a node now I'll be well positioned to make profit later) etc
