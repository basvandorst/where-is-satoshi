It's not hard. Buy low. Sell high. Or you can HODL and watch your money get Dusty.

I have never seen Fiat crash 40% in a week by the way. Whether it's good technology or not is besides the point.

I agree with everything you said, but I also feel that crypto is basically just a high volatility stock market. And trading is looked down upon, so if trading is look down upon, what is the purpose behind it? To overthrow the Illuminati? To replace Fiat and the Federal Reserve? People that are using feet aren't going to lose 40% of their earnings in a week simply by HODL.
I'm sure Bitcoin miners aren't doing it because along with knitting, it's one of their favorite pastimes. I think it's safe to say out of the thirty or so cryptocurrencies that exists trading to make a profit is not a bad thing. There's usually a purpose behind a stock, Amazon ships products, Google is an internet Enterprise, the purpose behind cryptocurrency is.....?  Eliminate the middleman?

Fuck you

That made absolutely no sense.

So a Trader who watches the market closely and sells before a crash, loses more than the guy who HODLS during a crash?
Explain please.
