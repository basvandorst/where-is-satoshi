Don't download anything. Create an online wallet on blockchain.info circle.com coinbase.com or the other ones. There are differences, but you will figure it out over time $5

Thank you for posting! I also live in Europe and had the exact same feeling. The image of Americans in Europe was certainly going downhill for the last decade. Ignorance is our worst enemy. The openness and intelligence of the officials in this hearing made me think for the first time in a very long time: America, what a truly GREAT country!

It just caught me. Your analogy to biology is even more interesting than you thought. The whole DNA, the construction plan of life, is contained in each and every cell of a living organism - not just in one "master" cell. Just like everyone in the bitcoin network is in possession of the whole block chain. In that way, the block chain resembles a core design principle (decentralized DNA) of life by mother nature.

Coinbase and circle are more like a bank. If they disappear (they wont), your bitcoins will be gone. Blockchain.info is something else. Its still very easy to use and just a web page, but they cannot actually control your bitcoin. Only you can, with your password. If they disappear, you still have your bitcoins.
anyway, for a total beginner, I would recommend circle or coinbase, because its very safe and you have somebody to talk to.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:00:38
Im sure they are great. Haven't used them so far. Will try out... but to be clear blockchain.info circle and coinbase also have nice apps

Online. Please dont confuse the beginners. Yes, sure if you have thousands of dollars in Bitcoin, you should move them offline. But for small amounts to play around its much better to keep them in an online wallet.

here you go, Bitcoin and all $5
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:20:06
Yes, I would not recommend keeping your Bitcoin on ChangeTip. You should transfer it to an online wallet of your choice.
btw its also a very nice learning experience to transfer funds from wallet to wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:28:44
You're not new to Bitcoin, but you are right. Cheers $5
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:43:49
Thanks for noticing! have never tipped before, so i thought this would be a nice start. I'm amazed how easy it is. It would be awesome if others could join in, so someone would actually buy a XBOX game or something.

thanks man! Already passed it along :)

Create a wallet at blockchain.info coinbase.com or circle.com. It's easier than downloading something and safe enough.
And make it a round sum :) $2 
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:03:13
You are right. Thanks for pointing that out. However, I think it's best to keep it simple at the beginning. "Hierarchical deterministic wallets" are very confusing for someone who is new to Bitcoin, I guess. I was trying to explain the basic difference between a blockchain.info and coinbase/circle. One step at a time.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:26:24
That's awesome!!! Get someone to build a really nice UI. This could be a perfect showcase for Bitcoin. The payphone of the internet. Very easy to understand. Plus, anyone could make use of this.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:02:04
The simple reason why the Bitcoin price should be roughly the same on all exchanges is that if it wasn't so, there would be something called an "arbitrage" opportunity. Traders would buy Bitcoins on an exchange where the price is low and sell on an exchange where the price is high. They would do this as long as the price on the exchanges is different, because they would obviously make a profit.

I dont get why everyone keeps being cynical about the Winklevoss twins. They are some of the best proponents of Bitcoin in the whole space. They work their ass off, invest a lot of money and all they get is laughter and weird facebook analogies. 
I would take any bet that they will be nothing but happy about the Coinbase news. I'm sure their main goal with Gemini is not to profit from trading fees, but to build infrastructure to promote Bitcoin. Don't forget, they own about 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply.

Pass-through shares are traded for about 2 BTC at the moment. ASICMINER does not sell shares! They havent sold shares since IPO.
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:32:47
Whats your point??? Message says "ASICMiner just sold it's first ฿2 share". That's plain wrong. ASICMINER does not sell shares.

Bitstamp is awesome! Fast and reliable. Never had a problem. Id really like to see people moving away from Gox to Bitstamp.
