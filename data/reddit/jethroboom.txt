Did you just merge the hipster and crypto lifestyles?  Don't you realize that without a growing audience crypto has zero future?  For a 'been here since before it was cool' claimant, you sure have your head up your ass.

I personally feel the mods just didn't choose their battles wisely.  It broke rules, but OP was clearly out of his element.  There's a system in place that allows users to vote on whether something is relevant or justified, the votes in this case spoke, but a single mod out weighs 800+ users.

"'I have to sort my books!' she cried,
With self-indulgent glee;
With senseless, narcissistic pride:
'I'm just so OCD!'
'How random, guys!' I smiled and said,
Then left without a peep -
And washed my hands until they bled,
And cried myself to sleep.

I don't try too hard to explain it . . . I still don't entirely understand the technology but I'm getting there.  When people are genuinely interested I tell them what I know, and just emphasize risk vs reward . . . same as with most things.

I'd chalk her up to an anomaly, but a good one nevertheless.

Unfortunately they think they're the 'real' bitcoin, rather than a fork sharing a similar name.

The key is to follow it as closely as possible, and make informed guesses to your advantage.

I guessed 6200 (~18-20% drop) from when we were around 7500.  I'm glad I hit that, not pressing my luck again or any further, but I agree I think 5000 is a strong possibility.  I usually just straight up hold but felt pretty good about being able to capitalize.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:10
$6200 was actually what I decided on myself earlier as well, would be ~20% dip, not as extreme as previous few we've had.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:41:03
The context is percentage, too many people are focused on dollars and cents.

Stop loss, sure it's a term reserved for orders, but the same principal applies.  Same reason mining equipment is cycled and sold off after a certain profitability ratio.  You're appreciating their position a little too simplistically, multi million dollar businesses don't make decisions based on emotion like so many speculators on reddit do.  Unless they're set up on a solar farm in the desert and considering sunk cost, assumptions like this are off base.
Cessation of mining when cost to mine a coin exceeds market value just accelerates the spiral.

Everyone wants this to be a get rich quick scheme, like it's some cut and dry thing, unlike any financial market ever.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:25:02
If they remember that 'little bit' if/when we pass 100k or more will no longer be 'a little'.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:12:49
The best part is OP is trying to write a narrative in some other comments to connect it all as some elaborate truth.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:46:08


You're the one that identified yourself.  OP didn't tag anyone, unless we saw your parent post or someone else in the thread pointed you out, you'd just be another face in the crowd of people saying the same thing you did.

I've stayed this way from the beginning for this reason, or to more easily hide my shame if it fails.  (Time to be honest, we don't *know* what is going to happen, until it has come to pass)

I imagine the vocal population of reddit has little to no experience in finance or investments, it's all lambos and rainbows.  The population thinking for themselves are reading, but sitting on the sidelines.  Afterall, if you put the time and effort into research, it's not going to help you at all to share this with people that did little to none for themselves.  Everyone else is just parroting and looking for reinforcement in their decisions.

If fairness, reddit search is shit, and the faq is a beast that often links to 3rd party sites that seem like ranker lists.  I ended up here, a 3 our old thread, from the reddit search.  What do I find?  One useful comment, and people bitching about new users not searching for their answer.  Doesn't take much more effort to help than it does to scold.

If you're looking for a get rich quick scheme, yes, if you're looking to make money and gunning for an 80+ year lifespan, it isn't long.  Especially considering the potential gains, it still isn't 'too late', it's just up to the individual to determine their own risk/reward.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:54:21
First mover, until we see the roadmap through there is less utility (therefore purpose) than any of the other coins you're talking about.  It is all still purely speculation.  No single coin or asset has widespread enough adoption for anyone to claim more than speculation at this point.  Your pointing fingers at hash power is a classic mix up of causation / correlation.

You realize that your logic can be applied to every single cent you don't put to BTC.  Simply spending BTC is not an immediate opportunity cost.  If you need a pen, you have to spend money on it.  Period.  Spend and replace.

Only because the market currently consists of cypherpunks, speculators, and moonlambohodlers.  If/when the market extends beyond that to Grandma, etc., the concern will be ease of use and fungibility.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:25:57
I think you're missing my point.  The world grows faster and more impatient every day.  More and more people don't care about privacy as a principle.  They shrug their shoulders and install whatever apps and put smart listening devices in their home.  *They* don't care about security.  They want something that is fast and easy to use.  LN could be that, but it's beside the point, which is security and censorship resistance is not going to be a selling point to go mainstream.
