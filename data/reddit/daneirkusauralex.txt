Perhaps a crosspost to  is in order.

Not sure what kind of financial services company you're in, but it is well known that "everyone is looking at blockchain." 
I think your instincts are sound: find the internal group investigating blockchain technology and join it. Then demonstrate subject matter expertise. In the coming years, demand for financial services professionals who truly understand this space will only rise.

I would be new to selling, but I'd love to help. How does one even get started?

There's a reason it's called a thought experiment, you know.

It's interesting how different drivers affect different people, well, differently. 
It seems some have the impression that the intent here was to compel adoption. Actually, the purpose was to draw a framework in which we could understand demand elasticity.
For example, let's say the optimal number in our thought experiment is in fact $50 bucks. Then assuming a scenario where the network continues to grow naturally, become more useful, etc etc - perhaps the environment in which a random person chooses to/ends up using bitcoin is an environment wherein $50 of **equivalent value** is created. I.e. "50 bucks worth of convenience," or perhaps more directly, 50 bucks worth of annual cost/hassle savings compared to traditional methods.

Having the same problem.. very frustrating especially when working with someone who is new to bitcoin.
