January 1, 2018 my dear friend ;)

How do you know that it took $17 and that a lesser amount would not have worked just as well?
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:14:30
Things are different to different people. Just because at this point in your life you happen to use bitcoin as an investment doesn't mean that other people are not using it as a cash. Neither group has any more claim to what it is. In fact, there is a large group that sees it as both.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:30:02
What have you done to improve bitcoin today? Bitcoin is not powered by hypocracy so I am going to guess that the answer is 'nothing'. Please prove me wrong :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:06:08
And write a seed in it or what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:33:06
You only have to get it in the mempool, not in a block. I use it all the time, it is in gyft, egifter, cheapair, just to name a few. The problem was on the user end here, either a bad wallet, phone or connection.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:01:59
Yeah, iota is interesting, fresh, unique, I look forward to seeing howe it scales if it starts to get popular.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:28:00
5 or 6 years ago it was tough, these days it is quite easy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:53:25
Lol, which part? Your opinion is that people are not trying to learn about the ecosystem? Or is your opinion that BCH didn't use the name Bitcoin Cash despite there already being a coin named Bitcoin?
It is going to hurt so bad when you have to look back on these years and try to understand how you could have been so tricked.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:44:41
Can you point to the place on the bill where bitcoin gets banned?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:41:14
On this website people post what they want to and other people either up vote or down vote based on what they like. I don't think this is the kind of site you are looking for, it sounds like you would prefer a site where you get to pick what is on the site, I recommend that you begin your own website so that you can try that out and see if it is as nice as you imagine. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:13:50
I thought so too, then a friend walked around a random bar and turned out it is a good 10% that had some and probably half knew what it was. Sure not a big sample size, but no way that only 1% have been exposed, nowhere close.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:03:00
It doesn't matter what his business is, it still doesn't take weeks to send a transaction with a $100 fee. That is a lie, he is a liar, that is exactly what the definition of lying is.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:53:05
It is better for the ecosystem if there are not con men trying to trick people while they are trying to learn what is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:06:40
Releases it to who? What if they are dead?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:40:34
It is both, an investment and a currency, being one doesn't mean that it cannot be the other.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:16:26
Somebody seriously typed this, thought it was a good thing to say, pressed enter, and went on with their life thinking they just contributed to society. This same mind may be out there preparing our food, driving cars on our roads, watching our children, this is a scary thought to me.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:00:23
All I am saying that what you said doesn't make sense, you said that the ball isn't round, it is blue. I said it is a round, blue ball. Now you tell me that any ball could be round and blue. Yes, you are right.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:59:22
Yes, arguably it is more insured than things that are insured by insurance companies since modern cryptography has a better track record than insurance companies.

They are much more than best buy, electronics is just 1 floor of 7. In Kyoto at least.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:38:54
Because Vitalik(the guy in charge of Ethereum) said so.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:41:54
1,000s? Really? Where did you get that number?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:23:42
It's easy to run fast and cheap when you have few users, but what happens when lots of people want to use it?
Read about scaling, your mind will be blown. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:37:11
Nice insult bro! You must have been quite proud when you came up with such an original burn, I bet you have spent a lot of time developing such a sharp wit.  Keep up the good work soldier!
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:38:52
TIL there are only 500 subscribers
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:38:08
So would you say that BCH is the best at anything?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:44:38
This is not going to end well.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:46:28
The two are not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:42:22
Yeah, this was the big story back about a year, year and a half ago, I imagine that most people at the other sub are too new to even know about it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:28:42
Really wouldn't make much difference, you can already just buy uber gyft cards with btc. I have only ever payed for uber with btc.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:40:32
I think you messed up with you math somewhere.
943,000,614 is the correct answer. Fun fact: this sequence of numbers also appears in pi exactly one infinite amount of times.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:31:44
Btc is the only way I pay for uber. I use gyft, but I think egifter would work too.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:06:35
I guess so if you want to involve a bank in the process of getting an uber for some reason, personally I tend to limit my interactions with banks as much as possible. I can't imagine how it would be easier, all I do is open the gyft app, click uber, set amount, send btc, copy gift card number, paste it into the uber app.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:30:15
You can, buy uber gyft cards with btc. Easy peasy. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:58:34
My "job" is cashing out old coins.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:06:01
That is impossible, rbtc is a pure bastion of free speech where nothing is censored and all opinions are valued.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:06:46
Good point, hadn't thought of that.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:17:23
The long string may be a master public key. It is used to check the balance of all of the addresses(shorter nonsense strings) associated with the seed(lost of words). The master public shoould be kept private so nobody knows how much coin you have, the seed should be kept private so nobody can take the coins you have. You can keep making addresses that are associated with you seed and master public key so that you can only have 1 seed to keep safe, but many addresses for people to send to.
Every address has its own private key(a different long nonsense string) this only gives access to the coins in that address. You want to keep those private. If somebody gets 1 of your private keys and your master public key they are able to figure out your master private key. Most people will have no use for their address's private keys since the seed(list of words) gives access to all the addresses associated with it.
If you get a computer and never put it online, just install electrum via a usb stick, that is very safe. Online computers are more dangerous.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:01:26
I don't think there is any fee from gyft for doing it, if it is it is tiny. The fee for the tx is just normal I think, not really sure.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:07:38
I tried and I was wrong, it says I need to add money to my account. I have plenty of usd but it doesn't convert it for me.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:28:18
Greed is required for btc to work, if that ends up quelled then it is game over. I'm not concerned though, greed is most likely here to stay.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:00:46
I don't have to go through an exchange or bank account, just open the gyft app, send some btc and type the gift card number into uber. Much easier than involving banks, also I have no bank account or credit card or anything, so for me using a bank would be a big pain.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:19:53
I find that very hard to believe as I am not in the USA, I am in MX. I do not even know what part you would think would not work outside of the USA.
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:29:46
It would be a pain for me because I would have to make a bank account. I am all crypto, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:36:19
Ah right, that makes sense, I forget that going into btc would be an extra step for most people, for the most part my "income" is cashing out btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:42:29
I am very comfused, can you please explain what this means before my head explodes? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:05:52
Ah ha, same here, it lets me almost confirm the pickup then says I need to add funds to my account even though I have plenty of usd to cover it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:58:13
Gyft is great, hundreds of stores and customer service is fantastic. The ones I use the most are cvs, target, bestbuy, Starbucks, uber, hotels.com, burger king, whole foods, panera.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:29:49
I have only ever paid for uber with btc, I use gyft.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:40:20
Wow, very interesting, Thanks for that. This is what I have done, I bought a $75 uber gyft card while in the usa and input it into my uber app in the USA and used $25 of the credit in the USA, now I am in Mexico and my uber app has $50 credit still and when I go in the uber app it shows uber cars within .2 of a miles of me but I have not actually used it yet, but I assume it will work fine. Once I actually used it I will get back to you.

Welcome to crypto! :) Read up on the lightning network, if you are feeling especially motivated then join us on it!
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:44:15
Really doesn't matter if it is offline if it is not open source you can not see that they are using a good random number generator. If they know the private keys they are going to create for people, they can get you.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:48:31
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:18:49
How could that possibly be avoided? It is like wishing rocks were not so heavy or something, if is all just part of the package, you can't have up without down, it is a ying yang thing, not 2 seperate things.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:04:13
I just left Japan, I bought about 700,000 yen worth of stuff with btc from bic camera while I was there. It was really easy.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:05:13
An app for buying gift cards, you can pay with credit card, paypal, or bitcoin. There is also egifter, same thing pretty much.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:09:34
Depression is a cloud that follows you wherever you go. As a country, Japan is anything but depressing. I hope you are doing alright :)

The people in China who want to hold bitcoin will still be able to, it is the mining pools and exchanges that will have to move elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:51:36
Lol, it is just what people want to do, nobody has to do it.  It is like asking why people have to try to control the words other people use, it is just something people do.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:51:10
Why do you think it is fast/cheap? Because it has bigger blocks?
The average BCH block size is WAY under 1M, this means that it isn't even using its larger block size to make transactions fast/cheap. The reason it is fast/cheap is that not many people use it, not because of its features. If BTC had been exactly copied and called BCH it would still be fast/cheap.
If you have any questions feel free to ask, your best weapon is inquisition.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:46:34
Electrum on android.

If you hold them in your own wallet then you will have them once the fork happens, if coinbase holds them then you get them whenever coinbase wants to give them to you, if ever.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:31:48
BCH blocks are not full, BTC often are. What I was saying is that BCH is cheap/fast because it isn't used much, it is not cheap/fast because of its technology. If BTC had that few users then it would be cheap/fast as well, any coin would. If BCH starts to get heavy usage then it would be slow/expensive. The thing is BTC has a plan to scale as time goes on and there are more and more users, BCH only has the "plan" to repeatedly hard fork to make bigger and bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:17:14
You can get the gyft app, buy a hotels.com gift card, then use that card in the hotels.com app, works very well. There are a few hotels who only accept payment in person in which case you can not use a gift card, but most hotels work. Btw, gyfts customer service is great.   
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:55:15
What is the growth currently based on?
