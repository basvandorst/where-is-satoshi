Not sure if this is true but I read that passphrases, if chosen by humans, are easier for hackers to predict/guess.. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:07:33
But wait.. the offline computer in this case can be the same computer rebooted with the TailsOS usb right? Or am i missing something? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:47:09
Oh, this sounds like a really smart solution. Thanks for sharing. Never heard of this TailsOS, will definitely check it out. Is there a similar MO for altcoins?

Wow this is big news to me, thanks a lot. I think i understood, addresses are like lines in an accounting book and a wallet's funds address is constantly jumping to the change address (determined by protocol) when funds are sent  and also usually when funds are received (if app follows best practices). So if an app stores private keys instead of pass phrases an old backup is worthless because it points to an old address that is probably empty. One question: if we somehow lose our computer, how on earth can an app derive the "correct" address from the passphrase? If a passphrase can be used to generate multiple addresses, how does the app know which is the "right one"? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:39:40
Yes i understand the best practice for receiving funds, but i am asking about sending funds. When i send funds out of my wallet the protocol (not the app) automatically changes my wallet's private key? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:39:22
But coinbase places your coins in a wallet controlled by them, right? I like to control my own private keys.
The btc ATMs in my country charge 4%. Is this good in comparison to other options? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:49:18
Thanks I'll look into it. But in the scenario i described the app would be able to recover my funds' address, right? Regardless of the "how" you know that it would recover, right?
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:47:28
It's interesting and i think I'll try it but i was told it requires security deposits in crypto, which means:
1) someone that doesn't have crypto yet can't use it to start having crypto
2) requires 3 transactions which for btc rn might be a bit expensive

Thanks for the article. One more question, the problem of taking out just part of the bitcoins from a paper wallet is simply that a hacker may catch my private key or it is also, in addition, that my private key will no longer be valid for that wallet? What i am asking is if when a transaction is made the original key will no longer work for a second transaction and i lose access to the funds that were not sent out. A reddit user told me this and i was puzzled. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:48:35
Ok but how do i buy funds to put in it?
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:48:50
I see. Thanks. And what about Bisq?
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:58:23
Yes this makes perfect sense. I did not consider this security risk when a coin is forked. No problem with the "rambling" lol, i thank you for all the valuable advice. I though i was relatively informed but i guess i will be trying a few wallet types with little money before buying any larger sum.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:30:24
Thanks! Yes i find Electrum features appealing too (from what i read only). Cold storage with Electrum would require an always offline computer right? I guess a hardware wallet would make more sense if I'm going for cold storage with Electrum right? Do you know of a wallet with similar characteristics to Electrum but for multiple altcoins as well? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:30:41
What confuses me is something like this scenario:
1- I install app on computer and create a new wallet with app. I backup my seed phrase in a safe place.
2- I receive and send transactions with my new wallet and don't perform any additional backup.
3- I lose my computer, get a new one and install the same app again and try to recover my wallet with the seed phrase.
4- the app is able to use the phrase to restore my most recent address with funds? How does it know which address to choose from all addresses that phrase can generate? Did it store some info on servers? Or info from online ledger?

Thanks man, i learned a lot with you. Got a much better view of how things work now (until the next big surprise hehe). Thank you for your time and patience regarding all my questions. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:47:51
Oh i see. And what can you say about Bisq? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:13:37
Oh so then for a full recovery, the hot wallet will somehow inform the cold one to help jump to the last correct address? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:42:34
Why is it that coinbase isn't on this bitcoin.org page?
I heard coinbase keeps your wallet for you. You are ok with that? I like to control my own private key. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:28:00
So this means everytime we send coins (from any type of wallet) our private key changes?
So if i use a hot wallet i should back up my key every time i send money? If i use an old backup it won't work?
And when we receive coins the private key also changes or only when we send? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:06:52
Maybe it uses the phrase in conjunction with the ledger to jump from address to address until the last one. But this begs the question: can an offline Electrum also recover everything without the internet connection to consult the ledger? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:03:23
This TaisOS/Electrum thing is what you use for larger sums of btc? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:23:25
You already answered to me on the other sub and i already said i prefer bisq because of privacy. Thanks for the input but it seems to me you have something to gain from the platform you are suggesting because you're spamming and your reddit account is fairly recent. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:13:54
And back to the paper option, do you consider [this method] ( dangerous? The software that generates the random key is open source and uses mouse and keys pressed for additional randomization.. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:36:23
Thanks a lot, i really like the Bisq philosophy and i plan to use it
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:33:03
I don't mean to be ungrateful or accuse anything but it's really odd that, all of the sudden, 3 different users come to this thread to suggest Paxful and the 3 are redditors for only 7 weeks..
