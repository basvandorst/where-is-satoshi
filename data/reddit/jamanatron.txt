I’ve used the site before. I just stick to those with at least 100+ trades with a perfect rating. There are many with 1000+ positive trades to buy or sell from as well and I believe it’s quite safe. At least in my experience it’s been. As long as you use the escrow service they have in place properly (follow the directions) you’ll be fine. Stick to dealing with highly trusted vendors.

Yeah, I transferred about .03 bitcoin to exodus (non Segwit) 2 days ago. It took less than an hour to confirm  and cost less than $5. I’m getting away from gdax as well and all my transactions (3 in total) took less than an hour to be confirmed and since it’s gdax cost a big fat zero. Seeing others post all these high fees paired with  longer confirmation times sounds made up.

Agree to disagree. If you can’t see a use for a platform blockchain like ethereum then this conversation is over. Bitcoin maximalism is a disease that doesn’t grasp the basic concept of supply and demand. There will be too great a need (demand) for a single blockchain to manage the total throughput (supply) required. If you can’t see how smart contracts are in fact, not pointless, then this conversation is going nowhere as your bitcoin blinders won’t let you see anything that isn’t directly in front of your face. There is no industry on earth where a single entity has a total and utter global monopoly. Why would bitcoin be an exception. It’s absurd.

Highest rate of income inequality in its history... Another metric which was identical right before the Great Depression. 
You’re correct, large entitlement programs do just that. I never meant to disagree with that premise. 
I’m not suggesting a particular tax rate, only that taxing the wealthy more proportionately has marked effects on improving the economy. But as you’ve stated what matters is the effective tax rate which is a more complicate matter as it involves enforcement.

I think it’s a stretch to say the effective tax rate was similar to now. The more conservative estimates I’ve seen put it 5-10% above today’s rates. That isn’t similar in my mind and That increase was enough to achieve what was done at the time which proves that a higher effective tax rate (even only 5-10% more)  has massively wide ranging benefits to the country’s economy. 
I don’t know what metric you’re using to say the US economy is the best ever but I hope it isn’t the stock market. The recent trillion dollar tax cut allowing mega corporations to do massive stock buy backs artificially inflate the health of the stock market. The exact same thing happened just before the Great Recession unfolded so be weary of the true state of the American economy.

Nope, full blown socialism isn’t a good idea.  The solution is already being used in countries with the highest quality of life ratings on the planet. They are all forms of social democracy. Capitalist systems with socialist POLICIES mixed in. Countries who use their tax revenues to benefit the vast majority of its citizens instead of a few at the top able to lobby their needs into law with unimaginably deep pockets are leading the planet in quality of life. Weird! The opposite is happening in the United States today. 
That you rely on nothing but petty ad hominem attacks to make your point is transparent. I’m considered successful where I live, I don’t need the help in my current state. Not everyone is so lucky and unlike you, I have no problem lending a helping hand to someone less fortunate as me. I’m also able to see those less fortunate as more than just a freeloading bum. I don’t pigeonhole about half of the earth’s population into such a generalized category and think it is adequate in containing the complexity and nuances of human life. The magnitude of such an oversimplification can not be expressed easily. Most people I’ve gotten to know in horrible life situations have worked just as hard or harder than I have and yet are in the situation they are non the less. The effort you put into life often has little to no effect on your success. Being born into money has, by orders of magnitude, more bearing on your success in life than the work one puts in to being successful. This is a verifiable FACT.

If you choose to ignore the massive differences between a social democracy, which still rely’s on capitalism  vs just straight up communism then you have made a choice to believe something that isn’t true in favor of holding on to a previously held belief.

The only socialism ruining the US is for the super rich. Only oligarchs are subject to the benefits of socialism. Socialize the cost, privatize the profits. The fact that you’re trying to simplify a mass of humans by derogatorily using the word ‘libs’ is quite telling that you are one who has suffered the mental decline of devouring catchy sound bites and incorporating them as facts. Reducing anyone to a lib or a con shows one to have the mind of a simpleton who can’t process a world much more nuanced than their brain allows. Do better.

Tax rates in the United States, at their highest were 90%. Before Reagan (and others) ruined it for everybody these high tax rates (rates above 50%) Lead to the most prosperous years in US history with a booming economy, booming infrastructure and high quality of life.

My main crypto assets are ETH, OMG and BTC. Other than that I’m diversified outside of crypto. You bitcoin maximalists are so ridiculous with your giant blinders on. I don’t know which blockchain will come out on top but there is definitely room for more than just one. It’s absurd to think there will only be one. Where else anywhere is there such a vast monopoly. The market is more than big enough to support many massive projects. Bitcoin will most probably be one of them, but it’s not a guarantee. There are never guarantees. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:10:26

@_date: 2018-11-24 17:11:40

Also, you don’t think BAKKT investor have considered what you’re saying and will act appropriately to protect THEIR interests which may not include a large increase in the price of bitcoin. Whatever you’re thinking, big money is probably already three steps ahead of you and making it look otherwise.

Why would what an internet stranger thinks make me uncomfortable? Thinking one crypto will have a massive monopoly instead of several is stupid for obvious reasons.

Again comparing the entirety of the internet with bitcoin. It’s sad how absolutely farking retarded some people are. Bitcoin’s only plan is as a ‘store of value’ or an ‘alternative currency’. It doesn’t even have smart contract capabilities and won’t maybe ever. Is that all the internet is good for? So why compare the two. Still not an apt comparison but Ethereum is, by orders of magnitude, more similar to the internet than bitcoin. Still not going to compare ETH to it even if it’s been called internet 3.0, and it’s my biggest crypto holding (and think it’s going to change the world). Still a ridiculous thing to do.

Once the technology matures in x amount of time (in other words once scaling issues are solved)  and crypto has a real and solid use case better than any other system is able to offer at that time December peak prices will be a bargain.

I’m sorry but I disagree. That’s why 2FA was created, because of this weakness. There are other forms of 2FA, like you suggested getting a confirmation email before allowing withdrawal (or login) but local bitcoin has chosen the Authenticator app version of 2fa and urge you everywhere on the site to use it. It sucks that you were robbed, it’s a frustrating affair but with 2FA enabled it wouldn’t of been that easy to have bitcoin withdrawn from that exchange. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:12:46
It’s been said several times but you NEVER release funds before receiving payment. It’s explicitly stated multiple times all over the website that you never ever for any reason bypass their escrow service. Localbitcoin accounts are sold and hacked ALL the time. It’s also incredibly easy to falsify your feedback to appear legitimate. Starting a dispute/scam report at this point is almost useless as local bitcoin will most likely have no way of recovering your funds. I really really hope I’m wrong here but fear I may not be.

“The chapters on bitcoin specifically are worth a read”
Thanks tips.
In what world is it a good thing that there would only be one blockchain operating on the whole of earth to service humanity? So why would we move to that end?

Don’t buy it all at once, spread out your buys over the next few weeks or months. It’s called dollar cost averaging and it’s your best friend.

I’m sorry no, it can’t and even if scaling were to be sufficient for any single blockchain.  Global consolidation to a single chain isn’t going to happen and to think it will denies very basic concepts on markets.  Bitcoin maximalism is a disease in thinking.
