Well I do like to collect old coins and money.  I'm guessing old fiat currencies might be worth a lot of bitcoin someday in terms of historical value.

Some things I don't like about Bitcoin and maybe others feel too but are fearful of being attacked on here:    
To me, it doesn't make sense. Without the internet, bitcoins are worth nothing. There is not anything tangible behind them. All they are is algorithmic solutions, supposedly rare (*minus the fact other similar currencies can exist just as easily, as explained below*)   
    
- With no regulation whatsoever due to the decentralized technology; what is to stop other similar currencies from popping up (ie. Litecoin, Namecoin, Terracoin and others) and **what makes Bitcoin any more valuable than them?  - Just because it was first?**

So in other words you are done with fiat.  Can I have whatever you have left in fiat, if any?

You forget one other aspect;  there is no regulation in these crypto-currencies.  So what is to keep others (Litecoin, Terracoin, Namecoin etc.) from being more [or less] valuable from Bitcoin, and vice versa.    
    
Bitcoin doesn't hold any copyrights (due to its' inherent nature) on similar technologies and can't keep them from cropping up, as far as I know..  So, Bitcoin is only valuable because it was first??
Also, with systems like [Ripple]( who is going to even care which crypto-currency is worth more than another? - it all becomes quite nebulous.

Only those three specific currencies?  He forgot Litecoin and a couple others,  he would have been better off just saying "**crypto currency**".
