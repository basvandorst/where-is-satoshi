Get a nautical-themed cashmere afghan.
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:14:33
For full node owners?
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:05:55
Can confirm.  I've lost about %25 of the houses I own that way.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:36:23
So, don't spend your bitcoin at places that will turn around and sell them OTC?
Sure.  Easy.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:23:53
Fiat money controlled by private banks with no oversight -- now *that's* how you do a ponzi.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:27:20
I love lots of things about myself!  Is this the place to list them?
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:48:31
Great product, great shipping speed, and perfect stealth!  I give that article a 5/5!
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:56:22
So, this the first time you've read an article about Bitcoin then.  Thanks for commenting.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:11:02
Yeah, I've noticed you French are real confused about animal sounds.  The dog goes, "wa wa," my ass.
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:56:36
$400 of bitcoin, Mr. Cocaine Volcano?  Tell us, what'cha get?
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:22:56
Wow.  Are we related?
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:52:15
Why do you speak when you have no idea what you are talking about?
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:08:15
One of us will just have to make the sacrifice to go down there and convince them!  I volunteer.
@_date: 2014-09-06 15:35:41

@_date: 2014-11-10 13:56:04
And yet here you are, posting no less.
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:15:07
Do we not teach history in school anymore?
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:08:00
You pants it.
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:28:38
And the price drops $20...
@_date: 2014-07-24 00:01:28
$1 @_date: 2014-11-19 21:32:21
Or, how about an exchange?
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:02:53
Nope.  You pay extra for your third ask.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:27:36

They obviously just don't want anyone, anywhere to suffer even a little bit.  Doesn't it make you feel good that people like that are out there thinking of you?

and that was voted down why?  does someone have a special credit card they don't have to do this with?  I'm getting pretty tired of the fucking shills.  Trolls I can understand, but shills?
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:56:21
Why so mad, bro?
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:22:50
Unless you own eye-bleach, I highly recommend you not to view nude pictures of any programmer/cryptographer.
@_date: 2014-09-03 04:21:07
Don't worry. The thieves will have to reverse engineer the credit card payment authorization algorithm to steal anything.  I mean, that would literally require copying a number 16 digits long.

Yo, give this man a quarter.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:01:58
Thanks for reminding us.  I forgot there were no scams in the statist world.  I'll be sure to think of this when the economy crashes, again.  "Thanks government.  Thanks regulations."

Sometimes I wish that for this subreddit.  *ducks*
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:38:22
Yep.  And then those pools go out of business when the entire network freaks-out about the double-spend.
Yay.  NSA destroys another American business!

This picture was taken by ISIS.  They decided the new Dinar is going to be a basket of currencies comprising of gold, silver, and bitcoin.  They are beheading someone just off camera.

Although one could equally argue that known inflation is already priced in.

Heh, "[s]ound as a dollar doesn't apply to bitcoin yet."  Christ, I hope it never does.

You, you're okay.  This one, real fucking ugly.
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:49:22
You should have a few more than that given how long you've been doing it, Mr. Nakamoto.
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:09:08
Not to disparage your division skills, but that was obviously a reporter's guess.
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:18:25
No, not "flash your computer."  Put those pants back on.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:17:36
We can lock and checkpoint those coins if we really wanted to.  (I don't think the NSA owning them would be enough for us to hard-fork though.)

Oh sure, read the article.

@_date: 2014-07-07 05:54:36
I'm more impressed with the way you said it though.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:24:42

@_date: 2014-04-06 16:12:56
Oh, it was.  You've just never been cool.  Sorry.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:24:05

@_date: 2014-08-28 23:42:24
You're not supposed to touch it.

They said it would only be two weeks.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:56:47
Hmmm...  So do some of the words you're using there.
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:50:04
Good morning, all!
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:11:45
Yeah, damn things are getting expensive.  Plus, you can't return them when they turn 13.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:30:06
We can finally go home!
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:45:13
Dude, I'm sorry to have to be the one that tells you, but the cake is a lie.  I know, I know.  Trust me though, it's better you find out this way.
please console this man with a piece of worthless paper.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:07:41
Its called inflation.  Since 1913, you've lost %95 of the value in your money supply.
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:16:27
Gotta be Swiss cheese.  You know, 'da moon?
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:20:47
Unfortunately, you forgot about the Federal Paperclip Reserve.  They've been inflating our currency for decades now.  Ever since the World Staple War anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:02:34
The first being the direct cause of the second.
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:07:19
We should do something about that.  Think of the children.
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:12:29
And you think they can do this how?
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:33:24
No, simply those you have must be reapplied.  Frankly, it's a bit embarrassing that you went out like that.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:47:39
TL;DR: Sensationalist title.  Large change in codebase gives rise to worry about *accidental* fork.

@_date: 2014-12-11 15:20:59
No.  The word "think" has nothing to do with what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:33:42
God, I hate shills.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:48:20
They will simply reduce the amount of interest they pay on your deposit.
Heheheheheh.  Damn, tried not to laugh when I said that.
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:52:27
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:12:19
Really?  That was your point?
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:28:03
Your idea of "norm" appears to be confused.  You should probably read a bit more before you pretend to be an expert.

Hehehe, very good.  Here, have this piece of worthless paper.  @_date: 2014-03-29 20:02:33
Horrible faux pas. That should be "she."

Until he gives us beet farming advice anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:02:48
That's an interesting characterization.  Tell me, why are you here?
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:39:00
Well, at least to clean them off.  Asspennies?
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:48:04
No.  Statistically they get the same return.  A faster pool will have less variance.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:29:02
In case you hadn't noticed, the whole world economy is crashing right now.    Just look at the price of oil.
People are rushing in to the dollar because they think that's the safest place.  This will change when people realize that the Fed will never raise interest rates or when they outright start another round of QE.
At that point I'd expect both gold and bitcoin to take off.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:12:00
He says, sipping tea with his pinkie extended...

The Honey Beast.
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:29:19
Perhaps you've just landed.
We have this thing here in the states called the NSA.  They do this, 'illegally spy on all American citizens,' trick, which I guess is fine because, heck, we're still doing it.
Then we've got another thing called, 'parallel construction,' where the cops 'protect and serve' us by illegally using the information from the NSA to convict us.  Except the whole trick is they lie, totally knowingly, about how they got the information.
Got it?  Oh, and welcome to Earth!
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:20:17
Would you like one of our new breakfast sandwiches with that?
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:03:03
Yeah, I actually enjoy their editatorialized titles.  I just can't figure out why they spend so much time hating for free.
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:56:01
The dollar collapsed in 1971.  Look up "Nixon closes the gold window."  Nobody went Mad Max then.
Oh, and the Chinese are officially the worlds largest economy now.

Cool story bro.

To the core!

He said it was a "crepes" store...
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:47:28
I know you're a troll, but I'll answer for others reading this thread.
Try googling, 'Libor scandal.'  Thats probably more than 6% of all *fiat* as you requested.  Hell, just google, 'bank fine 2014.'  It won't be 6%, but it involves vastly more than all  bitcoin ever released to date.
Thanks for playing though.
Now, STFU.

The "investment" to accept Bitcoin on any site is about 1 minute to modify the HTML on your payment page and about 20 minutes to sign up to a service like Coinbase.
Normally, you'll just ask Coinbase to pay you in USD (or EUR or whatever) and they handle all the Internet nerd money details for you.
