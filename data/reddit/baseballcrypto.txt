Scholarships are huge, 
But anyone under 25 should be heavy in crypto with whatever money they have right now. Stocks are overpriced. Real estate market is not really profitable for my situation. The only rational choice is to find what is towards the bottom in the market cycle. When the stocks begin to drop next year everyone will throw their money into bitcoin.

Also looks like Adam and Eve double bottoms.

You guys are so gay.
Probably are unhealthy individuals with all sorts of health problems.
Get well soon.
I’m sorry you suffer from insomnia. Sincere apologies.

Those are only four coins I own:)
They have been in top ten ten for long time and will continue to be.

Are we really going any lower than 3k? It is hard to see that happening in my eyes. Im in this for the long term too, not looking to cash out after profits. This is more of a gamble retirement fund.

That’s your speculation you douchebag.
Majority still thinks there’s gonna be one more crash just like 2015. But guess what! It’s not!!!!!!

You will be waiting till the world is over

Double or triple not a big difference.
Sorry your brain is too small to see the big picture. Banks will print out billions this year and shit on your dollars.
As trump would say... billions and billions and billions and billions and billions.....
What the hell has gold done since the beginning of this year....
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:37:26
Good. I’ll get a job. I’m not afraid of hard work.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:33:45
Too late for the Gold standard,
The stock market is already pumped by all the fake money.
I can see reality. You can not.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:55:22
Lol I had 12000 at the time of the post. I used leverage and made tons of money....
Got drafted in 2017. And yes I did just graduate ��‍��
Also 12k btc at that time.. I own alts. Why am I defending myself?
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:37:20
You’re trying to go backwards by going back to the gold standard.... shows me you know nothing.
No need to argue with 15 year olds.
Also answer my question.
What has gold done the last five years compared to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:42:10
I have lots of btc... why do I need a job
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:28:35
Bitcoin in a second.
I’ll come back here in five years and feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:29:55
PayPal stole 500 dollars from me. I hate our current money system so much and that is why I invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:21:02
Lol there’s been major crashes in bitcoin. Let’s just look at last two years....

Who cares,
We’re going to 1 million plus regardless of all these memes, Lamborghini bros or whatever

You can call me.
Don’t judge a book by its cover

Double the market cap of gold is improbable,
Grow up man

My mom died of cancer. I got drafted by the chicago White Sox.
I split rent with my wife.
Keep trying....
I bet my wife makes more money than you
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:25:20
If I listened to dumbasses like you I would be broke
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:48:07
Why post this on bitcoin?
He shits on bitcoin.....
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:22:33
