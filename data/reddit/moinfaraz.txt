If it's not one of those April fool jokes, then we'll probably end up seeing a small pump.

India, Brazil, Venezuela I think there're many countries where BTC trades at premium rates.

Poloniex is a big time sucker! 
I wish I've never deposited BTC in there. I've been waiting for 3 days now and no one from their support team has replied. I'm not even sure if they ever will. I feel like I've lost 1000's of USD by choosing a shitty exchange.

BitStamp allows one to buy BTC using a credit card. They use 'Simplex' as their payment gateway. 
Keep in mind, you'll end up paying more than traditional ways when using a credit card.

I don't expect any better either. The good thing is; BitCoin will be there, no matter what governments stand is.

Who says it's legalized in India? source?

What wallet supports LN at the moment?
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:48:49
Agreed. I'll wait :)

Hmm, isn't that a bummer.

And then I'm thinking of BitStamp where withdrawal fee is 0.

21.co is BS. Unless you're a big shot, it's not for you!
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:18:06
It's not done crashing yet. Just hold your horses. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:02:12
Count me in.

**Changelog** 
*Preferentially peer with nodes enforcing BIP148 to avoid partitioning risk.* 
I'll run it!
