Binance is like coinbase, good for trading, especially altcoins.
If you do sign up for Binance, they have a referral program and I'd appreciate if you used my link. PM Me for it.

is it hard to get a wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:13:56
do they hold payments like paypal? thats my biggest reason. fees i see are pretty low (or none?)
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:25:28

Here is some advice from someone who traded stocks.
Dont try to catch a falling knife - stay on the sideline and see how it goes, SO YOU CAN STAY SANE. (this is worth $ alone)
then, once you see it stopped falling, and has recovered some, get in.
the other option is too chaotic. right now, if this was a stock, traders wouldnt hold overnight/wouldnt hold longer than few hours because you simply don't know.

you shouldn't boast about this. its not balls, you could have bought a falling knife. winners hubris is real

Whats the easiest way to buy coins now? Can I do it though any credit card or are they all blocked? Curious to dip in a bit.

remember reading a book about that time, interviews with folks from all sorts of life. One black guy said "I'll never understand white people jumping out the windows because they lost money. We never had money, so we don't get doing something like that."
Life can be enjoyed if you aren't sick, going with such a strong emotion that you jump is honestly stupidity.
