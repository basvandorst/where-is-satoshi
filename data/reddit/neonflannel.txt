They just changed it back to $3,319 as th ATH. Either they're hiding something or it was just a genuine glitch.  Im not sure what to think anymore.

Then be more constructive and tell him what you mean.  What kind of reply is that?

I would keep as much in coinbase as I keep dollars in my wallet.  Like...40 bucks.  Any more than that makes me nervous.

The current system obviously doesn't work. We, as a whole planet, the human race, need a system that works. Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies are the future. There's no denying it.

It's weird how it works. I'm being payed in fiat to buy another fiat.  It's better than any savings account interest I've ever had.     until a bubble pop :\

Why not? Is it because it supports politics that we all don't like here? I buy it there and move straight to keep key.
Edit* Kay. I looked at a bunch of reviews.  Now I see why.

Yes. I'm going to stop using them asap. Who would you suggest instead?

Its definatley worth being interested in.  I firmly belive it has more potential than bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency, Ethereum is a supercomputer framework that used Ether as its fuel. Maybe one day, bitcoin and Ethereum can be used together in the same digital ecosystem.
