People like you who call crypto a bubble only look at it from an investment perspective. But there is the underlying tech which has real utility, that is being able to transfer money worldwide fast and cheap without meddling scumbag bankers and governments. It all comes down to whether this goal is achieved. If yes, there is mass adoptation and skyrocketing prices, and if there is a hindrance like the chinese stirring shit right now, you can pat yourself on the back for predicting the burst of the bubble.

Tether is still around...

I agree with your second statement. Right now BTC is only used for hodling and that is not sustainable on the long run.
Either SegWit and LN will fix scaling or bust. At this point I'm betting on their success.

looks like the big guys aint selling:
except for  who sold 3000 BTC and later bought it back. Anyone knows who these wallets belong to?

Ethereum and Monero are my two picks right now as legit rivals. Ether is facing wide adoption and the price is blowing up, and Monero is completely anonymous. But I think BTC will still rule the near future because thats the 'brand' everyone knows

This is exactly how I feel. Also if it goes below 9k as was predicted I'm buyin.
