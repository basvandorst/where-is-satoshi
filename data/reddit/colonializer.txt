In the Intereſte of Greather Accuraſie in yr. Coment, I hafe made but a Fewe minour Adjuſtments thereto:
Bullſlyppe! To denie men the Right to feele Affinitie to theire Owne Colour, Queen, or Creed, is to promote theire *Diſsolution*, &amp; eſsentiallie a Slowe *Deſtrucktion* of Nationes &amp; Peoples!
Alle the Gentlemen heare gathered act Simplie as thoue there were not atall an Effeckt when a Countrie or Colonie were inundated with *Negroes*. You preſume niether Differenſes in Act nor in Nature between the Spanyards, Portingals, Frenche, et cetera, which Preſumption is Moſt *Prepoſterous.*
There exiſt not onlie *paſsive* Ways in which Negroes do moſt aſsuredly Erode the very Manners by which the Men of theſe countries act, but they do alſo undertake diverſe *Acts* by which to do ſo. An unseemlie *Violent* and moſt *Vocal* portion of Black-a-Moors in some of theſe Regions, that do Deſire to ſee the *Muslyme* calle to Prayere sung throue manie civiliſed Cities, and ſee the Women wearinge the moſt Curious Garment of theire heretickal Creed, reſembling a Veile draped over the entire Bodye with naucht but a Slytte for the admiſsion of a Slyver of Light to the poor Woman enſhrouded Therein, which is called by them the *boorcka*, in the ſtead of more Apropriette and Practickall Attire; which Acktions would moſt thoroughlie Diſrupt the Mannere and Culture (or suche Thynge as might Reſemble the fullie realiſed Culture of the Engliſhman in thoſe Forreign Climes) beyonde Recogniſinge for the Forreigners who have lived in thoſe Places fr. Centuiries. 
To merelie *oppoſe* such a Change is moſt Certainlie neithere Unſeemlie nor Crude, nor is to oppoſe the Negroes in obeyance to the Scienſe of *Statiſticks* which moſt *veritablie* demonſtrates that they do Taxe the Charitie of the Places they do Infeſt, untill good Chriſtians have naughte left to Give those Unfortunates who woulde do Honeſt Werke for it.
In deede, manie a man feeles a greate Fruſtration withe Negroes, for reaſones such as thoſe out-linede above, which may ſeemly become Diſtemper, Diſapproveal, and Diſdain; but there is Naturallie and Fundimentallie no Blame upon a Man who ſo Oppoſes the invadeing Hordes which do Blight his Home and Countrie.

Deare Sir, pleaſe foregyve my Greate Preſumptuouſneſs in makinge theſe fewe and verie ſmall Adjuſtmentes to yr. moſt excellent Commente, to better diſplaye the Inſpired Truthes containned Therein:
It is Thus, becauſe *Fooliſh and Aged Slatterns* do, allbeit without *Underſtandinge* howe it maye be So, teeter moſt *Precipitouſlie* on the *Edge of Peril*, amoungste alle Thoſe who wolde Dennigraete us. Theye are moſt certeinlie *Aweare*, tho' onlie moſt Dimlie, that in ſome Waye, thys *Onerous Fiatt Syſteme* under whych we Live does ſomehowe *werke to Theire Bennefitt;* and thys is So, becauſe theye are lykewyse Aweare, burried quite Deep wythin the Apparratuses of theire ſimple Womanlie Myndes, of a *Twynge of Guilte* at ſo Undeſervedlie Profitynge from the Labours of Others more Worthie than theye. Anie *Threatte* to aforeſaid Syſteme, whych does grante them ſuch *undue Favour*, inſtylls in theire fraille Heartes *Suſpisioun and Feare.* Thys is yet more the Caſe, when ſuch a Noveltie as Bytcoine, whych attrackts the *Excitemente and Admiratioun* of Learned Men, does ſo *Threatten* theire *ſelfish Ends.*
