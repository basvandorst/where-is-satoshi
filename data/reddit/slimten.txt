The best solution would be for an exchange to offer stock that pays dividends on reported volume. That would nice.

What drove me to decentralisation was the inherent corruption that comes with centralised power. In a decentralised community, we all have somewhat the same oppurtunity for a small degree of power and influence. Many are still inclined to rage against "the man" instead of making a small yet positive contribution. It's learning to humble ourselves to the little we can give but to give it our all regardless. Decentralization is work.
