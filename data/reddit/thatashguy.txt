The thing is- if you're an atheist and tomorrow God is proven to exist, are you still an atheist?

Yeah but it was blockchains own app. Seems a little strange that it would happen. Also I don't know enough of the process to argue a valid point but the funds where in my account for a good 20-30 seconds. A couple of refreshes. What would have happened if as soon as I noticed them I transferred them out to another wallet? I'm sure it wouldn't have allowed me but the thought is still there.

haha, i'm with you there!
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:23:22
Haha, thanks! I'm rich! 
Though seriously- I've only been following bitcoins for a little while now. Exciting. Very exciting.

who better than the inventor of the internet!

well he did once say that he wants facebook to be used as an internet i.d where everything is stored. so it would make sense.

truly i dont think i know what i'm asking. i've googled, youtubed, read forums, printed off faqs. still can't really wrap my head around it. i know what they are, where they come from and all that. 
i think i'm still trying to understand what people intend on doing with them in the future and how stores intend on implementing them. i've read a few posts about companies saying that they cant implement them because they are too volatile and then people all come back saying that the price will level out but...how? there's only a limited amount of coins and if the btc economy is going to work as hoped then the price per coin is only going rise and rise and rise? how does a shop jump on board and start selling retail products? 
i obviously dont know jack about economics but wont it always be a volatile rising currency if it works how people hope? therefore making retail items worth x one day and then the profits on sold items worth significantly less the next day? (of course this is only relative when comparing btc to fiat rates).

:( same here.

Oh the fees! Now I have ocd~ hah

like i said- i dont really know enough about bitcoins to argue but...
What good would all the coins sitting in their account do? from what i can gather bitcoins are currently being traded as shares so already people are just holding onto their coins in their wallets just waiting for a increase in sell value to offload them for fiat or hard profit. i'm not saying this in particular is going to affect the price. my argument is more- 
...i cant even remember.  (i started writing this hours ago and then got caught up at work.)
@_date: 2013-03-20 07:06:42
thanks. i'm sure it's explained somewhere on the site. i'll look when i get home. 
i figured it must be something like that because i could see the amounts and it all added up but i would have thought that the change+my amount would have been handled somewhere else and not within my account as i thought i was the only person who could send money out of my wallet. 
i'll read about it tonight.

decentralized... wut?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:47:04
is that a serious question? i dont know where you live but here in australia (perth) i cant use btc for anything (yet). sure there are a few websites but everything is extremely limited and the conversion rate isnt always relevant. i know it's slowly changing over time but as it _currently_ stands you can really only live using fiat. please correct me if i'm wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:48:52
i totally agree you with. so does that mean you're holding what you currently own in btc and waiting till you can use it for goods or are you going to trade back into fiat in the future?
@_date: 2013-03-23 06:58:05
Im drunk but I totally agree. If it sounds too good to be true... 
Right now it seems too many people are using it as stock. Just pump and dump. A lot of people must be getting mightily rich right now. 
The whole thing just seems good. And with everyone pushing it positives so hard and never mentioning the negatives... Sketchy. 
But I'm in. With my whole 1.029 bitcoins. /sigh
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:27:39
Haha, dammit... Do you think this work? Just hold out and I'll give you the opportunity to...donate. 
But no- not ocd trolling. Was just curious why my own wallet would fluctuate like that since everything I have read have all said coins can't be transferred/returned unless the owner of the wallet returns them. /shrugs
@_date: 2013-03-21 07:53:21
thanks. i didnt know the name of the denominations. i understand that it's divisible to more digits than i have fingers but what i meant was if you can only have 21 million bitcoins in circ and if btc takes off and becomes mainstream and reaches critical mass and all that's really traded is satoshi bits what is stopping people from - fucking.. fuck.. 
let me read the faq.

different wallet for drinking.

but if at the end of the day- i have a family and want security then i'd rather buy my own place where i can paint the walls and rip out and replace things at my own will instead of having to abide by some landlords rules. potential price volatility wouldn't be too much of a concern.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:32:37
i'm newb to all this but doesnt this pose a problem? like.. if at the end of all the mining there will only ever be 21,000,000 whole coins in circulation. Cant someone just come along early and buy a huge number of coins. sit on them. and then essentially own the market sometime down the track? and if bitcoins become as mainstream as people are hoping- it's going to get to the point where no one will be able to physically purchase a single whole coin because the price will be far too expensive per coin and we'll all be dealing with purchasing/trading to the 8th bit. 
i feel as though i'm wayyyy off track.  but eh?
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:17:36
ahh i never thanked you. thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:46:43
and to think.. i was sad when i lost my whole one coin :(

I dont understand why people are saying this. So what you're saying is- every PayPal transaction ever made on eBay or through the PayPal system the buyer can simply claim they never received the goods and no matter what the seller says- PayPal will do a chargeback and give the money back to the buyer? 
I understand there are PayPal scams which happen all the time but I can't see how what you've described would happen else every single PayPal transaction could just be reversed. All PayPal are doing is relying on the honesty of the buyer which seems...broken. 
Or am I missing something?
