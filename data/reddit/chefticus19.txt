I am no expert in economics, but I think the general gist is the buying strength of the dollar will reduce,devaluing the currency. Bitcoin on the other hand will increase in value due to its anti inflationary coding (fixed market cap).

I have a quick question, I am not new to crypto and keep a relatively small amount on iOS app wallets, split between three of them. I have backed up my seed words offline. 
I have never trusted the idea of desktop hot wallets as I have had many pc’s in the past that have got viruses- I assume this why the op lost their stash.
I currently consider my holdings to be reliably  safe as I use trusted and well reviewed app wallets, and believe the iOS operating system to be fairly secure as long as you use your own phone charger and don’t use Wifi networks apart from your own - is this the case or am I being a tad foolish?

Quite frankly I’m not sure you have the stones for this. For you to argue that magic internet money that has the potential to change the worlds finances is a burned down house,whilst it has stayed in play for 10 years and is currently worth thousands of dollars is insane. 
You just invested too much at the wrong time.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:53:35
I was in the same situation, the biggest mistake you made was stopping you dcA as the price dropped, if anything that is the time to be buying. Otherwise you are just buying high! 
Ps I am currently a little up, which after months of being in the red is very refreshing.

You have not lost anything until you sell, a little patience and you have a fairly high chance of actually making some returns.

I really think sending btc as easily as email, cutting out qr codes and long addresses for every transaction is what is needed to get people involved.   Most people in the world with access to I.T. are very comfortable with sending an email.

Go to restaurants and ask for work, they are always after KPs, not great work but usually available and always the possibility of getting promoted to chef work that pays better.

It’s also one of the biggest on-ramps to bitcoin in the world, and therefore has a positive impact on the community, despite your views on their conduct/ practices. Without Coinbase the crypto world would be very different.
