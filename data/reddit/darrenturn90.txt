Why would Corporates, Banks and Governments want to ever use bitcoin's main chain for whatever it is they need to compete for?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:05:45
No. It’s because the code that manages private and public keys on both chains is identical so you can export the private key from a bch wallet and use it in a btc wallet. It’s the Blockchain that is different, and that’s why the bch address won’t receive any coins in the above example because the transaction was presumably sent and included in the bitcoin blockchain not the bcash blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:07
Why would they want to ever use bitcoin for that? Most txs now could be done via ln reducing the requirement on the main chain.

1mb - utilise newer technologies like the lightning network or sidechains to alleviate the strain on the main blockchain (basically clever off-chain solutions), keeping the actual blocksizes down and therefore not making the blockchain grow at a far greater rate and avoid spam.
more than 1 less than 20mb - utilise the additional space, with more transactions to incentivise miners, in the meantime work on the above off-chain solutions to get them to a real-world releasable standard then use them. The theory goes that they won't be ready intime if we don't change the blocksize to something a bit bigger.
20mb - line in the sand?

Except, even in an economy that is powered by bitcoin. Most people would still elect to entrust their savings to a third-party. And as currently the blockchain is woefully inadequate to handle such a level of volume of these transactions, most of these savings will be off-chain - and thereby nothing will be in place to stop the same thing happening. *as things stand*
Bitcoin is a good solution, but its not there yet.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:18:29
Basically, due to the way cryptography works - as long as you can get your signed transaction(s) to someone who can broadcast it via the internet it doesn't matter.
Radio/tv/satellite could blanket transmit the blockchain - and because no one can forge a transaction - you can give your transaction to whoever, as long as they publish it.

@_date: 2015-06-16 00:40:58
Its the risk when you pay for shares. As miners will of course know the "difficulty" of a share before its submitted, so while they couldn't "make a block themselves" with that share (as all they would be doing is making a block For the pool anyway) - they could choose to discard it. Unlike with "prop"ortional payout pools where actual block rewards are shared amongst miners, "PPLNS" or simpler "PPS" pools work on the actual shares submitted - so a valid method of damaging such pools is to submit shares so long as they are not "block finding difficulty" - effectively draining the pool of coins, without submitted your own "fair" share - because all things being equal, you would expect over the long term, a miner of 10% of the pool's hashrate, to find 10% of the pool's blocks.

If you don't want to trust third parties to tumble or mix your coins - then consider using a currency that has goals to be anonymous. Albeit they have a lot lower market caps so don't expect the same volume of liquidity, or support from whoever you need this anonymity for.

I understand perfectly what a scam is. And I agree there are many many alt-coins that are scams. As well as there are cloud-mining/mining pools/exchanges and many other bitcoin services which are themselves scams.
I don't however accept that "because I don't see the use therefore its a scam" is valid reasoning.
Take Monero for example, its aiming to provide on-blockchain anonymity - and would be IMO something that Bitcoin as a project would not focus on (as to be honest, full anonymity is probably going to really piss of Governments etc).
Vertcoin, using Lyra2 which is an easily adaptable algorithm to circumvent ASICs is also an entirely different goal to bitcoin which has become very corporate with massive mining infrastructures controlling the blocks rather than the individuals.
Various PoS coins, that are working on alternative means to secure a blockchain without the need for the power hungry Proof of Work stages (either successfully or unsuccessfully).
Ethereum which is working on a whole new set of capabilities for cryptocurrencies.
Now, if you could explain why all of the above (and the rest) are "scams" - ie "attempting to defraud or swindle [someone] by means of a trick" - which implies consentual knowledge by the developers and operators of that coin - I would like to know.
I'm pretty sure isn't a scammer. But you can make these allegations if you want.
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:38:09
ok, so what is in the genesis block? What is contained in every block, in every transaction of the blockchain...that's right - its Bitcoin. Now it may be p2sh, colored coins, or whatever. Now, on *this blockchain* try putting anything other than bitcoin... go on...
This is Bitcoin's blockchain, and nothing can change that. Sure you can get other blockchains (known as alt-coins), but this isn't them.

@_date: 2015-06-21 10:05:04
Well that's slightly incorrect. What its saying is, with a block size or 8mb (for example) people could run modified bitcoin clients that accept 8mb blocks, but themselves only submit blocks up to 2mb or whatever. There is nothing in the main protocol stopping someone submitting the full size block, as that would fork the network

I still disagree. No exchange or merchant would put their trust in a new blockchain that was powered by 10% of the total available hashrate. They would have absolutely no protection against a new longest chain coming in and wiping theirs out.Miners will have the only say

Its not so much the miners, as the node operators. Stratum pretty much means you don't have to have 40 full blockchain running nodes to run 40 different systems with ASIC miners connected to them.
But if the blocks get to be 20mb each (which would presumably not be any time soon or the size is already too small) - then the space for storage gets that much greater.
Personally, I think that the "race to the top" by faster and faster ASICs is a bigger problem to face than blockchain sizes. It needs to be increased end of discussion. I don't think the reprocussions of that will be that much different at all.
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:46:48

I don't think exchanges would risk the double spend nightmare on being on a separate fork to the mining pools, who if they didn't agree with the exchanges have ultimate power as they make the blocks so every coin that left the exchanges would go missing as it would be on the wrong fork - and they would be responsible.

Addresses are only mentioned inside transactions however. So therefore, when a transaction is sent, every bitcoin client on the network will have to know about every other transaction that contains that address (at least within the block limit) to enforce the restriction. So it would need to monitor at least the last 120 blocks or whatever the maximum "time" limit would be and keep track of *every* transaction in *every one of those blocks* which could amount to lots.

Your assertion implies that you pay for the name and not the quality of the service. Wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds if not more to pay for this benefit may be of use if you have investors or vc capital to spend, but is realistically infeasible for smaller companies. Accredited auditors are as competent and valid and far better value for money. Using the remaining budget for appropriate networking to inform these hedge fund members that they are buying in false security by going only with big 4 approved companies would hopefully get most of the prudent investors on board.

The updates aren't coded into the bitcoin client at all. It is a node owner's choice as to whether or not to "upgrade" to a branch of bitcoin. If they disagree, they simply don't upgrade (or upgrade to another branch say without those patches in).

Here's an idea. (A little technical however)
Create a new bitcoin address. Save the private key somewhere.
Create a transaction in your bitcoin wallet spending all your current bitcoins to that address (except for fee).
Sign this transaction.
Save this transaction somewhere.
Now erase your current bitcoin wallet.dat.
When you need to use the coins, relay the spend transaction - and they will appear in your new address that you saved the private key for.
Until then - there is no private key to steal other than the one that has no bitcoin in.
*Alternatively* - Create 10 transactions, save 10 addresses in 10 locations. Then if any get compromised, simply get rid of the transaction that was for a compromised address.

Some people may not feel comfortable handing over Sort Code and Account Numbers (it happens). Furthermore, it depends on the bank to whom you send the money how "instant" it is. Finally, sometimes the money can leave your account and not appear in their account for hours or days, due to checking - there wouldn't be any information about this to you, just that the money has gone, and the other person is now thinking you scammed them - until it magically turns up.
Finally, what if you wanted to send the money to a different currency? Does your bank charge anyone for any transfers? If not, then your bank sounds great, what's their name?

Well, you can research the statistics behind chargebacks and fraud analysis taken on a per sector basis by mastercard and visa who use such statistics to automatically flag merchants who are receiving chargebacks above the standard if you wish.Or you can run an online ecommerce company for a few years and see where the charges are generally from. Speak to high risk merchant providers who deal with gambling, travel if you want to get a clearer picture.Its the legacy systems that they have to support that criminals and fraudsters target.

Further, this is only an issue if the actual transactions are compromised - in which case the attack would also have to compromise the end address(es) at the same time, as without the compromise of the transaction, the attacker would not know the wallet to which the transaction will be going.

Have to say, I kind of agree.
Changetip is just the same as issuing credits to people - that you can then withdraw in bitcoin.
I don't think you can tip someone one satoshi on the blockchain for example.
Internal credit systems still are far more flexible for micro-transactions than bitcoin due to the blockchain bloat and minimum transaction values. Albeit they do not have the decentralised nature, and can only exist within the entity that controls them.
But ChangeTip is essentially an internet credit system that Deposits and Withdraws solely in bitcoin.

What we need is mining software that handles the moving for them. So you have a cgminer set up for your ASIC, and it keeps an eye on how many new blocks are coming from ghash.io's servers as opposed to other servers (which IMO is probably more reliable than checking the address as that can be changed easier). If the cgminer detects that the pool is over 35/40% of the hashrate, it automatically connects to another pool.

For a start, your son's teacher doesn't even seem to know the difference between a "Ponzi" scheme (ala gaw miners) and a Pyramid scheme.

However, and especially considering the financial rollercoaster of the last-year, no one in their right mind could consider bitcoin as such a scheme.

Wouldn't that be Cyber Monday for digital products? Also, I think that having a company such as Microsoft go from initial meetup to public release in the space of a few months is *very fast*. You have seen their Windows releases right?


So you are outright accusing bitpay of lying here - wow! I would like to see what evidence you have to show where you pull this shit from, seriously.


More likely (as most people read it) - it meant that they already knew about how bitcoin works, they wanted to understand more about how BitPay works - the people they are partnering with - which makes perfect sense.


It's a pretty apt title if you ask me. 
In the same way I could write "Shitty blogger writes crap without references" for your article.

As a blockchain doesn't enforce a "maximum minimum" when your wallet found blocks they would exclude transactions, but all other wallets who found blocks wouldn't. So presumably you had to find all or nearly all of the blocks to make this work.

@_date: 2014-10-30 12:33:01


Not necessarily. Can you give the example you are using to make this statement from?


No all cards have these options, and its usually only Credit Cards that do. Cash doesn't have these options, and often cards have surcharge fees on top of them.


No, people *think* they understand it. Then they complain like crazy when they make a payment to an online store, and their money has been Shadowed - but their payment didn't go through... or that the online store doesn't have their money instantly.. or many many other examples that show people have just been brainwashed with the false simplicity of what they think is going on, and its all at their expense - higher costs, fees, and so forth - this is exploitation.


Multi-sig is starting to prevent this, as are hardware wallets like Trezor. However, there is still nothing that has stopped the constant theft of credit cards from store after store... its not like Card security is improving.


Not for many small business owners, and not for all consumers. There are plenty of cases where this doesn't happen - and this can only happen anyway at the expense of the tax-payer - unless the person who has stolen the money gives it back.. so it creates an imbalance somewhere - again exploiting the naivety of the consumer into thinking they are "protected" by the very system they are paying for in the first place.


This is the number one reason Bitcoin needs to be pushed more.

Interestingly, bitcoin as an exchange medium doesn't need to rely on the internet for transmission or reception. Projects such as broadcast via Radio Waves/Satellite etc are helping with that side of things - and once you have an up to date blockchain - well, simple electronic devices could be used to generate and make the transactions between each other - without the internet needed, it could be done hand to hand - and then validated at a "blockchain" point.

This was brought up at the uk bitcoin meeting a few weeks back. But it is mostly a no issue generally due to a misunderstanding of how bitcoin operates as a currency. Essentially it may make sense to think that you send me 10bitcoin then i send someone else 5. But in actual fact, you are partially spending unspent inputs. Due to change addresses and combinations, after a few transactions chances are that the percentage of coins that originated from a transaction that was stolen is close to 5% or less maybe as they are mixed and swapped and changed with every transaction.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:12:35
What you refer to here isn't a scam however. Its just a "bad idea to invest in something you won't get ROI from now". Back when GAW first started their hashlets/cloud-mining - many people made ROI as they were (by far) the most profitable multipool. The same follows for LTCgear.
The issue here isn't that the ROI makes them suspect - or even that their Paycoin's ICO is a bad sign.
It's that they don't actually sell you *anything* - The Hashlet you purchase isn't a "share in a mining farm" - as their own T&amp;Cs state it uses no electricity. Its a "virtual miner" - in that its a concept that acts as if its mining (at least to the end user).
I haven't seen their massive hashrates on any scrypt or other coins to justify that they are actually mining anywhere at near the capacity of what they should be.
And as for this "POS" cloud-stuff.
I did joke a few months ago (and again more recently) about them (or LTCgear) launching a "mine-pos coins" option - as I don't believe they are actually mining anyway (or at least, not to the scale of investment from 'cloud-miners')

"While I know you think you do not have a liability, no matter what it will be a lengthy and expensive process, regardless of who wins."

Its just the level at which they "make it seem real" - with their hashrates, pools, and marketing that clearly pushes the "mining"

This can be circumvented by having more than one output address, ideally on separate systems. Therefore the hacker would have to compromise both of the output addresses at the same time, or the transaction list and relevant output address - otherwise you could just relay the transaction to the non-compromised address, and the hacker gets nothing.
Having a SEND_ALL functionality in the protocol could further secure this by allowing for chaining of such events (so we create a chain of these transactions through numerous wallets)

Hopefully this thread will answer it one way or another.
As I understand what I have read though, and based so far on what I believe - You have to spend an entire address in a transaction. The wallet merely simplifies it for the user (the wallet is the guy at the counter who gives the cashier the £20 note and who takes the change from the cashier) - but underneath there is a new "change" address created which is handled by the wallet.

His example is even worse than what you have described however.
Let me rephrase for clarify - what he should have said:
So what happens with fiat is that users deposit their physical (or electronic) cash into their bank, where it is essentially lost in the endless myriad of futures/ious and general speculative banking arrangements that the banks have together. They then don't lend out this money, but make up new currency to satisfy the demand for loans and mortgages.
So you can't talk about comparison to fiat, as its a whole fake-volume system.

The issue here is that the miner can know the difficulty associated with their share.Personally, this kind of attack imo is not the right way to go about it. Obviously things like this will happen, but really moving hash to another pool rather than punishing everyone at your current pool is more constructive, even if it doesn't achieve the end goal. Because if bitcoin is about freedom from control, then this action is the opposite, in a similar way that ghash.io control is bad. The attacker decides which pool is bad and attacks. There is no decentralised opinion or consensus

This is all based on the value of bitcoin not rising to avoid this issue. Considering the investment that bitcoin will have at the time, big businesses may indeed pump more fiat into bitcoin at the point of halving in order to stabilise the hashrate for miners.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:01:35
The tradeable value of Bitcoin doesn't have to be in any way related to its functionality, acceptance or ease-of-use.
The value is merely decided by those who own bitcoin and those who wish to own bitcoin.
Now given that mining is highly cost-prohibitive, the incentive to gain bitcoin is through buying it from existing owners rather than mining it - this would seem to lend credence to an upswing in price. However, the scale and requirement for this demand to cause a significant change, in light of the previous 12 months of investment and downtrend - may not show its head for quite some time.

Here you are referring to "Card-holder Not Present" chargebacks - rather than any other form. Now, in the UK at least - VbV (Verified by Visa), and SecureCode (Mastercard) eliminate the merchant's risk for chargebacks, provided the transaction was performed with 3d-Secure enabled for Cardholder Not Present transactions.
This basically means, if its a stolen card - and someone has also made the online transaction using 3d-secure, its the bank (and visa) who carry the risk - not the merchant.
Of course, if you're using a card that doesn't have 3d-secure, or a bank that doesn't support it - then its risky, but for 3d-secure cards at least, there would be no risk to Circle.

I think that the actual complication would not be an attacker/defender scenario - but two different attackers. Being as each private chain is mutually exclusive, Both attackers may be attempting to circumvent the other. 
The issue here however is the marketing required to get the sufficient 51% of the hashrate in order to even achieve this. The miners would not just have to believe in the incentive, but also in the profit compared to loss from a blockchain fork/rewrite - the lost transactions and so forth - and economic fall out that may devalue the coin itself - thus making the reward for such actions need to be even higher (as by participating, the miner may very well be devaluing their reward).
The other issue is that this requires action on the miner's part - whereas most miners are just the "set-and-forget" variety - mining on the same pool for many months without any action. They will have calculated their ROI, and be very risk averse - the "what ifs" as well as the lack of belief in the attackers competancy to muster such a large mining pool - coupled again with the risk of a larger attacker - would make the costs of such an attack being feasible, far higher than any financial gain that could be achieved.

IMO, it will need to be possible to produce CPUs and GPUs "from the comfort of your own home" first. It would still require a lot of technical knowledge and expertise.
But let's play devil's advocate for a second, and presume that 3d-printing has advanced to the point where it is easy to download a 3d-printing file and produce your own low-nm integrated circuit.
Firstly, that would be the end of Intel, ARM, AMD and many of the big manufacturers who provide such facilities right now. The world we are moving into is a far more alien one than we are in right now, if these things become true (and I can't say they wont).
However, by this point, if everyone can make their own ASICs, well then they're not really like today's ASICs at all are they? The point of issue is the high cost, reliance on one or two manufacturers who have time and time again proven their unreliability and often untrustworthiness. Its a wild wild west right now - and thats bad.
When everyone is printing ASICs in their own home in 10-20 years time, probably long after Ghash gets 100% of bitcoin mining, and Vertcoin becomes the only decentralised currency - then maybe ASIC resistance can be dropped, because it will have achieved its goal.

Actually, I thought transactions were based on previous transaction inputs, and nothing at all to do with the "address balance" (which is more of a side product of the sum of spent and unspent inputs to an address, than it is for a checksum). As transactions do not contain "from addresses", but rather the related transaction(s) themselves (these previous transactions therefore contain the "from address" as they are the output address for the previous transaction), I thought that merely one had to check the amount specified was not more than the total of the In transactions had available to them, rather than an address balance.

The step up I beleive is that GPUs can have OpenCL implementations written in software - relatively quickly and cheaply.
ASICs have to be entirely hardware, so expensive and slow. Therefore, I believe, with the right adjustments, and a reliable method of providing these updates across the whole network - A coin can stay GPU mineable while being ASIC resistant.

Assuming there is only a single destination address.

Let me answer this point by point


Its like a public ledger, that each "round" contains a list of all of the accepted transactions that have happened in the bitcoin world.


They are using a provably secure cryptographic algorithm (math sum) that creates a "checksum" - which is essentially a random checksum, and trying to make a random checksum number low enough to meet the current difficulty - which is Very very Hard at the moment. Once this is done, then their pool (or their own client if they are solo-mining which is unlikely) will "Publish the block" with the checksum - and this block contains all of the transactions received by that peer since the last block was found.


They are submitted across the peer to peer network of bitcoin nodes, where each wallet is connected to a few other wallets, and then they are in turn connected to more wallets - so the transaction "traverses" the peer2peer network and is sent to all open wallets.  These transactions go into a temporary list called the "mempool" which all nodes have - it is this "mempool" that is then used to create a block.
Offline wallets when they start up in their "sync" phase, contact these peers to obtain all of the blocks that have been found since they were last operational, Check that the blocks are valid (eg that the checksum thing above matches the difficulty, amongst other things). 


All IDs are available. The blockchain contains a record of Unspent Transaction Outputs - each Transaction has a Transaction ID - and they are chained together. 
The wallet itself is more like a key-chain - it contains a collection of "keys" to be able to spend these Unspent Transactions. Because you can only spend transactions that are sent to the Addresses for which you have the private key for.
Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:21:37
The block will contain all transactions that were seen on the network during the preceeding 10 minutes or so between blocks. So depending on the how busy at the time the network was, there should be lots of coins going to lots of addresses.
Could you care to post the public address of where you expected to receive the coins? And also the Block Transaction that they claimed the coins were on?

Actually, the hotel should have only authorised the amount which they had intended to take, then settled that amount. Just charging an arbritrary amount at a later date - potentially means that they are storing their card details somewhere - and that means serious PCI Compliance issues (most token based payment systems will do this, but I believe that they also require initial amounts to be set).
Of course, you have the case of Continuous Transaction Authorities (those annoying monthly subscriptions for things that you no longer use? - they are CTAs) - which give basically monthly permission for someone to take money from your account - but I doubt its using that method here.

This depends on the type of transaction firstly - Did it have VbV or SecureCode protection? Even if so, there are some circumstances still where the charge can be reversed (there are other reasons besides "Cardholder Not Present" that can result in a reversal, and VbV and SecureCode only protect the merchant against the CNP reversals).
Normally also, the merchant goes through a payment gateway who use an acquiring bank - where the transactions are usually stored up and settled in bulk of the nighttime, and often there can be a 2 or 3 day wait (or more in the EU) to receive the actual funds from the customer.

Based on the thread about the "rumor" I would say that btc-e being shut down is a bit of a misnomer at this stage. From what I can see, the article is mainly about Russia blocking access to the site. 
However, it is advisable to never keep a significant amount of coins with any particular third-party, if only to minimise the loss when an inevitable breach or failure occurs.

Ah ok so to clarify:
Inputs are previous transaction values. 
A transaction can contain multiple inputs and multiple outputs. All inputs must be the exact amount from their previous transaction, and all of the outputs must add up to the total value of inputs (when the fee is included)?
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:17:18
But that wouldn't have any way of limiting an amount (such as a daily spend limit. Or lets say a blockchain rounds limit) - as there could be any number of transactions that pay into an address - and it would be too taxing for every wallet on the network to have to monitor every address of every transaction to ensure that the spend limit was being enforced.

Completely pointless. The inflationary principle is only relevant when you have an indivisible unit - like the Pence of the Pound, or the Cent to the Dollar.

Basically, bitcoin is a global currency that is unforgeable, and has its rate of creation fixed in the software - this means that no bank, government, company, drug cartel, mafia, or government agency can create more bitcoins.
Its a system that operates completely without any central maintenance, and does so in a very secure and fair way.
What this means for you and me, is that once it becomes widespread and used, the strength of the currency cannot be undermined by "pretend bitcoins" (ie fractional reserves) - people can only spend bitcoins that actually exist - and no more or less can be created than is specified in the code.

"hundreds" of customers?

What happens is that cointerra go under and most people lose their money as cointerra dont make 100% profit from preorders, and consequently dont have enough to refund everyone. Then they are classed as not giving back - when all along it was because one person didn't think.How many sales have they made? Do you know? Further, how many people have now received their order and not updated their post to say that they had? If only more people thought about their own actions before posting things like this, perhaps less people would wrongly feel ripped off.

The history of a coin is stupid and shows a real misunderstanding of how bitcoin works. I doubt bitstamp would want any more than your last transaction. Asking for receipts seems harsh. As does other things. But there is no such thing as a coins history.Wallets are made up of unspent inputs which themselves are almost always split up into further inputs and outputs. The term coin is only a visualisation of this expressed when you sum them together. There is no coin as such. Only transactions. And going back even to the receipt transaction could be meaningless as it could have 39 inputs and 60 outputs.

1) If you were to DDOS another pool, owing to bitcoin's quite slow difficulty adjustments - you would not infact be taking any more percentage of the available bitcoin, as you would be infact slowing down the blockchain by the percentage of the pool you ddos (unless you can sustain the DDOS until the difficulty retarget) - then you could allow the pool to mine again, as the difficulty is sufficiently lower.
2) There is no way to "withhold blocks" with your purchased miner that doesn't also negatively impact your own pool. Either you submit the blocks to the other pool, or you withhold them - you cannot submit them to your pool, as it would simply just payout that other pool anyway.

The difficulty only increases as the hashrate increases. If people continue to mine at a loss, then this will continue to happen as hardware gets better at what its doing.
But if there comes a point where that is no longer true, then the difficulty will stay fixed or go down as less miners take part - or at least the cost of the hardware will be more in line, so I have no clue why mining would become history at any point. Even after the bitcoin halving

Just as an idea. All ASICs presumably use the same mining software? (cgminer or some other).

No algorithm is probably ASIC resistant (though some seem interesting, dcrypt, cryptonite and others) - however a Coin can be ASIC resistant, as long as the network is suitably structured, the cost of performing a Hard Fork to an adapted or new algorithm should be quicker and far less than the cost to re-develop such ASICs, making them economically unviable and therefore making the coin itself (not the algorithm) ASIC resistant.

Also then apparently... gold and silver are illegal? As is any other foreign currency in the world.
*Thirdly, as money is the medium of commerce, it is the king's prerogative, as the arbiter of domestic commerce, to give it authority or make it current. Money is an universal medium, or common standard, by comparison with which the value of all merchandize may be ascertained: or it is a sign, which represents the respective values of all commodities. Metals are well calculated for this sign, because they are durable and are capable of many subdivisions: and a precious metal is still better calculated for this purpose, because it is the most portable. A metal is also the most proper for a common measure, because it can easily be reduced to the same standard in all nations: and every particular nation fixes on it it's own impression, that the weight and standard (wherein consists the intrinsic value) may both be known by inspection only.*
I believe that had cryptocurrencies been around at the time this was said/written - then Bitcoin would have been included in this, as it is very divisible, and its intrinsic value cannot be altered. Further it cannot be forged illegally.
*The power to coin money is one of the ordinary prerogatives of sovereignty, and is almost universally exercised in order to preserve a proper circulation of good coin of a known value in the home market.*
Yet nowadays, more dollars are coined by banks than ever are coined by the government. 
Anyway, with that aside -
The *actual constitution* states:
*To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;*
So yes, only the US government can constitutionally make new dollars (sorry banks, it seems that you need to sort out your unconstitutional ways ASAP!)
However, the constitution says that they can regulate the value thereof of "foreign Coin" - there is nothing at all here that states it is illegal to use "foreign Coin" for commerce or for trade. But merely the remit of the government for the *regulation* of such coins.
So Mr ZDnet Bitcoin Hater - why not lobby your government about all these banks that are directly breaking this by making coin? And leave bitcoin alone, as its perfectly covered by the US constitution under "foreign coin".

The issue here that you seem to overlook is that the core factor here are that the devices used to create these systems are accessible to big and small corporations likewise. There is a relatively low level of investment required to actually get into mining asic-resistant crypto-currencies.
Whatever example you give, it is far easier with ASICs to centralise, than it is with non-asics.

Interestingly, Jpc is a pos/pow hybrid (differently to ppc). The pow blocks are of reasonable length meaning pow orphans are rare. And for network prorogation, if you connect to the mining pools nodes, its a pretty fast way of confirming transactions.

Make 2 keys. Place all the bitcoin into the first key. Use a multisig for the second key if you want.
Now, make a transaction (offline) that spends all of the coins into the second key but don't relay it.
Shred/erase the first private key with the coins in.
Store the transaction securely, with copies somewhere.
Store the new key somewhere.
Then the attacker would need both pieces in order to get the coins. As all the attacker could do with the transaction is send it to that address. And there are currently 0 coin in that address.

Well, the $100 has a higher percentage, but there are *more* by volume $20 bills that are counterfeit I believe. 


You may not pay any *direct* fees. But the costs that your green-grocer, your electronics provider, your clothes supplier charge you have to include the costs of the fees that they are paying on your behalf. 
There is nothing wrong with fraud protection - but when the vast majority of fraud protection costs is associated with the actual defects with how cards were not traditionally protected - it seems a bit harsh.


I think you misunderstand fraud protection. So let me ELI5 you.
There are multiple layers of fraud protection. Some are based on the user's demographics, or personal information (such as Linked Addresses, Credit Ratings, Identifiable Risk markers) - this has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual method of payment. This type of fraud protection is available provided you are keeping appropriate details of your customers - and applies mostly to online purchases (rather than face to face purchases).
The other type of protection, is to do with the ineffectual or lack of security methods in the original card system, and its a decades old system that is still full of legacy processing completely removing the additional security provided now (which itself, isn't ideal).


I know, but I was just reminding you of the very short space of time that Bitcoin has existed in. Also, youtube, twitter and facebook are free services. Same as snapchat and it's ilk. Bitcoin is about payment, not about free users so it will always have a harder hill to climb when compared. That is why I was merely pointing to how new it is, not as a direct comparison to an incomparable medium such as a social network.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:21:17
Crazy that people still think of a bitcoin as a thing. All that you have is the accumulation of unspent inputs from loads of different transactions. Unlike notes that circulate. Transactions are one time only deals.

Firstly.. you have distributed copies of this ledger. Secondly, if any bug were to temporarily erase the ledger on their hard-drive - other people will still have the ledger.
You would need a bug to systematically erase every copy of the ledger everywhere. Including offline backups that no doubt people keep.

It depends on the situation. 
In the UK there is a high-street store called "Argos", that would work fine with a 10 minute or so wait. Essentially as you have to wait for the "order" anyway. You get given a ticket number (on your receipt) and a "collection point", then you look at the screen to see where your order is in the list.
Perhaps in the same way as a "money" checking machine, there could be a "double-spend" checking machine, that looks for any other transactions on the network for these coins and if so, it cancels the order? Or such.

I know of pock.io however, let's address Reseller Ratings here.
Personally they deserve 0 out of 10 ratings for the completely extortionate way in which they operate. Their business plan goes as follows:
Hey, you have an issue with &lt;Company Name&gt;? Let us know about it, share it here (because people are more incentivised to post about their bad experiences than their good experiences, without some sort of business run program to reward all reviews).
They then display all of these Undefendable reviews, completely without any fact checking, moderation or chance to reply.
*Then* they go to the company (or the company has a heart attack when it sees this online) and basically force them to pay and sign up so that they can reply to this negativity.
Its extortion plain and simple, as it is forcing a company to hand over money to defend itself, but is allowing for completely unmoderated and opinionated bullshit to be posted by whosoever - without any proof they were even a real customer.

I still don't think that many miners would react in such a short space of time - usually it takes days or weeks for miners to react to a "51%" and usually that is after much prodding and action on the part of the pool.
I think many miners just put their rig on, then leave it - especially with ASICs these days - probably check on it once a day or every few days, or if that - just check that they are being paid or such.
Sadly, people are inherently lazy - so aren't going to maintain an hourly (or even bi-hourly) check on their mining equipment.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:00:37
Its not double spending that you would have to worry about but making 51% of the blocks gives them a lot of authority with upgrades new features, changes, also transaction filtering and such.

1) How do I go about it
You have to sell something for it. You can sell your USD/GBP/EUR or other currencies for it. Depending on your location there are various ways of exchange (localbitcoins, bittylicious, kraken, circle, coinbase and more)
2) Is there only one place to buy
There are many. ATMs, websites, purse.io and more
3) what is the most reputable site to purchase from?
Circle and Coinbase are two of the most renowned places. Kraken has also stood the test of time.
4) Is my money safe? 
In regards to purchasing with the above - I'd say yes. Although if you are planning to purchase a significant amount, you may have to fill in additional "Anti-money laundering" id proofs that they request. This is a legal obligation.
5) I have heard recent reports of hacking
The most recent report (bitstamp) was covered by bitstamp, and no funds were lost by customers.
6) do I receive something tangible that says I own bitcoin?
Not really. If you buy in circle/coinbase - you will have the balance on your account. Where you can then withdraw it to your own wallet.
I'd seriously recommend looking more into this before you invest though.

What does "destroying" mean?
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:42:41
The issue is - the bitcoin network is built to be "push" rather than pull. In that you have to prove you can spend the coins, but there is no rules as to where you can spend the coins, as long as the "output script" is valid. As the owner of the coins, you can choose whatever you want to do with those coins. As addresses, are just a result of output scripts... its not something you can really program into the network.
There is a 3-of-3 with two trusted hosts setup I could envisage, (where they have a two-of three keys that they can use to send transactions, but the exposed key -ie ur key needs 3 of 3) - where you could notify them its compromised, and they could verify your identity and then ask where to redirect the new coins two.
This would potentially solve the above issue, albeit requiring trust for both of the above hosts not to conspire to steal your coins (as they would have full control together) - and/or both get hacked (less likely)

What is this comparison for?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:12:15
Let me correct this for you.


Where they took peoples real funds and bitcoin for mining equipment that, as of yet - they haven't provided any proof that they exist. That it was just a ponzi with investors money helping to prop it up. We know that there were no scrypt hashrates that were increased with their "massive mining farm", and that we couldn't find the "zenpool" or whatever in the bitcoin blockchain either - so *what* were they selling? If that isn't deception, or if you're ok with that - why are you even using bitcoin? 
Then, a few months in for the "Hashlets" - obviously the payments were simmering, so the maintenance fees ended up being almost exactly the same as the "coins mined" *cough* - essentially, it stopped paying out, but justified this with the "maintenance fees".
Then, garza and his crew decided to offer people "hashpoints" instead of actual payments out - essentially turning the "0 return" above, into another "0 return", but one in which they had a plan to get themselves out of trouble.
Hashpoints turned to hashcoin, or "paycoin" as we now know it - so essentially. In the mean time, investment (apparently, though we have not seen any clear claims that I know of from these investors that they have invested in GAW) - and new customers kept rolling in, paying usd and bitcoin into gaw's balance. And in return, getting a completely worthless and new "Hashcoin" and "Hashpoints", that were massively being pumped in marketing and advertising as being "better than bitcoin", "Bitcoin for the masses".
They also promised that paycoin would be $20 per coin at launch, would integrate with Walmart, Amazon - and basically be a fully working currency for the vast majority of their US customer base.
All of a sudden, the "Hashcoin/hashpoints" that people were being given didn't seem so worthless - so people kinda carried on.Investment and new customers flowed in.
Then the initial paycoin launch was a little botched, despite it being primarily a peercoin clone - and allowed for a tiny bit of the currency to be mined by bitcoin miners - the blockchain got stuck once or twice I think, and the paycoin official pool didn't work. Anyway, that was soon over, and people were trading these coins on the markets. Being fueled by Garza's claim of $20 when "Paybase" launches, along with the Amazon/Walmart integration etc.
So we have a coin now, that is getting value from people trading it based on the above promises from Garza. Also, we have a *massive* (by any standards) premine that Garza was in control of, coupled with control of (as I understand it anyway) all the "Orion" and "Prime" controllers that gave people higher staking percentages on their Paycoin - basically meaning you had to have your paycoin in their systems in order to profit more than keeping it in your own wallet.
Anyway, then it launched "properly", and Garza got a bit carried away with market manipulations when he got the coin (via buy/sell walls) up in value on Cryptsy, and started making claims like forget $20, $25  is the basis kind of things. Not quite in keeping with the best actions of a CEO of such a company really. Anyway, that didn't last long - as Paycoin got beaten down to about the $4 mark, where it stays now. 
A lot of people got pissed at Josh's lack of $20 offer. Now he says he will buy the coins at $20, a few at a time and "Honour what they said" - and it seems to many people, this makes it all forgiven.
However, if you read through the story above, you will see how he turned a complete ponzi, into a magical way to get more money out of it - and why there should be no opportunity or support of this completely corrupt process.

Well, we are less reliant on a dominant singular exchange (although the trend of chinese exchanges that fabricate trading volume is worrying). Merchant acceptance has massively grown, even inspite of the falling value - Dell, Paypal, Microsoft (xHamster :p) and so on and so on have all come on board, some more than others - but their commitment to Bitcoin speaks volumes in their underlying belief in the currency.

@_date: 2015-01-16 11:10:33
The whole point here is that they are replacing the real ECDSA with a "fake" one that leaks - and trying to get someone to use their "fake ECDSA" generating bitcoin client.
Its not that bitcoin itself is compromised or any of its technologies therein.

The "motion in limine" was DENIED by the judge to throw out the evidence related to the murders for hire. This means that the evidence seems to be relevant, and not just "bullshit".

Fraudulent usage of your card details is only easily possible because of the easy ability to copy these details from web-browsers, atms, shop card machines and so forth. And has been this way for decades. Don't tell me that Visa and Mastercard have found an unfixable problem - they clearly know how to fix it, and haven't opted to... and we don't know why - because they control those systems.


Actually, if a payment varies slightly month to month, it can sometimes hit threshholds. Also, frequent payments, even if regularly performed can often freeze such accounts.
Also, have you ever had a failed transaction - where the money was "Shadowed" - it won't appear on your nice and (partially inaccurate) online banking statements (if you have that) - the money just seems to have gone out and will magically re-appear in a few days time.


Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes, or the person at the cash desk doesn't understand why they have been given a number to call (because it appears even now not everyone is trained in this). And its a serious inconvenience - that you have no say in or control over. They won't explain what or how their formulaes work - yes you are kept in the dark about what is supposedly *your money* 


Not always. I've had friends who had their cards used in various places around the world without any fraud check - it was only their own vigilance that caught it.


Actually, people who have adverse credit understand how financial power works, far better than those who have never fell afoul of a very tightly controlled financial system. And you seem to be one of the lucky few - I hope you never end up in such a situation.

It doesn't need a substanial value. However, if 1 bitcoin is worth $1, then there will only ever be $21,000,000 available to spend (assuming every last bitcoin is still on the market and being used). Currently, its far less bitcoin than that also as they have not all been mined yet. So if it becomes used a lot - its value Would naturally go up to meet demand.

The rationale of defence here is astounding. I understand perfectly the concept of liberty and freedom - but also understand that in an imperfect world, these ideals get abused by those who don't subscribe to the same general moral code as others.
Based on the above example, lets take Eric Marques instead.
What if his Freedom Hosting child-abuse hosting platform was taking massive trades in bitcoin (it may have done for all we know) - would people also be defending him for providing an "open hosting platform"?
AFAIK he didn't abuse children, he merely provided a place for people to share that disgusting shit. So I guess his defence would be the same?

Let's go through this list one by one


OK, so I'm not of the opinion to disagree here - he was around in the early days and did run a big exchange, so his position initially makes sense - despite being a complete asshat it seems, 1 for 1 so far.


If I recall, these were fireworks or something similar - which in countries like India children possess and set off at Diwali... so I think that's a bit of a "newspaper witchhunt" statement there. Feel free to prove me wrong here though. 
As I recall, Roger has been a very good proponent for Bitcoin, and is a well valued member of the Foundation.


While granted, his actions with regards to facilitating the money transmission with knowledge of its usage isn't exactly the best thing to do, again he has been (otherwise) a good proponent of Bitcoin.


So.. the lead developer, the guy who has probably given more to Bitcoin than anyone else - and you're arguing against him because of vouching for practically the main BTC exchange for years, and a site that I'm not aware is a scam - that one is really pushing things.
Gavin deserves a position on the Bitcoin Foundation by his very actions alone.


I've seen a bit of a witch-hunt (again, this seems a pattern with Bitcoin Foundation members - maybe there is something else going on behind the scenes to discredit these guys?) - But not seen any real evidence that puts this person's character in disrepute. With regards to the sex allegations - wasn't that someone he was associated with (*and not him*) and further - weren't these allegations proven false?

Of course its volatile - No one is controlling it in order to stabilise its value against other Controlled currencies. Its a totally free market without control.
Therefore, its usage needs to control the value - rather than its value being Controlled for its usage.
Its a paradigm shift, and it will get there - when people get behind and finally understand this rather simple truth.
"The spoon" for matrix enthusiasts, that "isn't there" with Bitcoin is the control behind the production of the currency.

Secondly, isn't this value less than 1% of yesterdays total volume?
Thirdly, this is assuming that large operations don't have industrial rates of electricity rather than the "average electricity price".
Fourth, this is also assuming that the current publically available models are used by these large operations, which are most likely obtaining more advanced harder faster than the public market due to their ability to order in bulk maybe direct from manufacturers.

1) I'd like to see some statistics of the paycoin/bitcoin purchased through paybase - as it seems very few people have mentioned this - the ones who said about the $20 price were people who had buys on the order book on cryptsy when they pumped up the market very briefly.
2) So the $20 price manipulation is illegal, and that is the only reason that people bought into this Peercoin clone. If they had guaranteed the price of $0.01.. I doubt anyone would have given a damn about it. So if that isn't deception by false advertising, misleading the consumer and whatever else - I don't know what is. And yes, definitely Garza and his consortium of Lawyers who C&amp;D all and sundry, definitely would have been fully aware of this - either that or they are all incompetant?
3) No one cares about this. They wanted the $20 payout for the hashlets/hashpoints they had spent months mining.

1) Immaterial, many alt-coins exist with that level or more of premining. NXT for example. This alone isn't worth cornering Josh about, as this of itself doesn't make any difference IMO.
2) Maybe they want privacy? Non-disclosures and such
3) They accept it for Hashstakers don't they? Or I could be wrong there... but yeah, thats definitely odd
4) Actually it would better as a "here it was said" (show proof webshot/archive of page) - "Please explain this..." a big list probably.
And I would definitely add, "Where are the blocks you mined with hashlets that people paid USD for"... they should have *massive* amounts of evidence for this.

 Or
The conference organiser has been given suitable information in light of recent events to make a decision to not provide such a platform to such a person.
Due to Moe's post on earlier - I can only conclude that he has now been made fully aware, and rather than making Josh step down (or IMO providing him ONLY a Q&amp;A session where he is not in control) - that he is allowing Josh a platform to further his own - at least highly dubious - agenda.
Maybe he should let Mark Karpeles, or Moolah speak also?

So are you saying that on the re-org the transaction is totally lost, ie not included in any blocks on the re-org?
If so, then how is that any different to just losing the coins in the first place?
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:42:05
My take on this (hopefully may add a few things to the part that you only briefly discussed)
GAW Miners (which originally sold ZEN Miner Bitcoin ASICs) unveiled their "Hashlets" in the summer this year. At the time of decreasing profits in BTC and Alts, Multipools were not doing so well - then Hashlets came out from GAW, and promised to change everything. Initially there profits were 3 or 4 times the other multipools (like Wafflepool etc) - so there was huge demand for these insanely profitable mining pools. Except...
They were "cloud-mining" and you weren't buying a cloud-miner - but instead some sort of "virtual" miner that "didn't use electric" (as read their very opaquely worded terms of service - that have since been re-worded subtley).
With their hashlets (solo/prime/genesis or whatever they call them) you could mine "SHA" and "Scrypt" (and maybe X11 coins but I can't recall) - and the "multipool" automatically traded it for bitcoin payouts.
Since then and until now - they have not provided a single shred of evidence of any blocks found on any blockchain - considering their supposed hashrates and userbase (the userbase is probably real, the hashrates that they would have generated however would have been more than the total hashrate of most scrypt coins) - especially given conversion rates and the massive amount of dumping that would have had to have gone on if they were really multipool mining.
So all this leads to a blackbox - where people just pay GAW in USD (or BTC I think) for a "hashlet" - and they get back BTC every few days as payout or whatever. They get access to their dashboard and their "hashlet" stats showing its hashrate and all nice statistics (albeit without any actual real information such as coins/blocks found etc).
You can also buy/sell these hashlets on their own marketplace that they operate.
After a while, GAW decided to offer "Hashpoints" for these hashlets, so instead of receiving actual bitcoin or usd, you received these "hashpoints" with the promise that they were going to bring out a "bitcoin beating, amazon endorsed crypto-currency for the new age" - where (and this is a fundamental part of why paycoin is a big issue) - they would honour a $20 per paycoin exchange via their new system "Paybase" - as well as Amazon/Walmart integrate etc.
This essentially lead to them being able to take peoples BTC or USD, give them back a worthless "Hashpoint" (in that it had no value outside of their own systems that they had made) - and then convert these months later to Paycoins.. which again had no value other than speculation of their $20 claim.
Its quite an ingenious scam IMO - especially if they were never mining (its also potentially a total Ponzi if it turns out that they were just giving people their own money back) - but maybe they traded it/invested it, maybe even ponzied their own investors to get the consumer's money back - Then created a new coin with speculation in order to regain the actual money that was never there in the first place...

Well, let's assume that the value against Litecoin goes up in the same space of time. Let's assume that the value against gold goes down, but less than against USD...
It is being devalued.. when compared to USD. It is also going up in price when compared to Litecoin.
etc etc..
The valuation there is relative. If you want to use that statement, you have to wait until the actual value in USD is Realised, by selling and converting to USD. Until then, its only "value if he converted to USD now"

A few days back, I wrote a script that analyses all their *listed* investments/payouts and tries to work out how many of each coin they have in their "bank" as it were.
 - this page shows a summary (based on exchange rates) if all alts traded + bitcoin were converted to bitcoin, about their in's and outs. The orange values are averaged 24 hour amounts.
You can also filter by a specific coin (list of coins is available on the balances page)
Should list all of the coins for which - assuming that the last 24 hour average of payments in will continue - after 100 hours, will still have a net positive balance.

Found my old post
Copied from  archived at 
The terms and conditions, contain the following pieces of information.
 If you are purchasing, or have purchased, Hashlets, you understand and agree that Hashlets are not physical devices and cannot be shipped.
So firstly, they are not Physical devices. Maybe then they are virtual.. software inside some super system?
 Hashlets earnings depend on the pool chosen and Payouts reflect respective Pool Payouts. Selecting a Pool does not imply physically or electronically mining at the selected Pool. Rather, selecting a Pool determines a Payout corresponding to a calculation based on the selected Pool’s payout (based on, for example, real-time Megahash/second/day calculations). A Hashlet is virtual software. You will receive Payouts according to the Pool with with the Hashlet is associated
Their definition here of "virtual software" remember is not hardware - and not even electronic. 
As they put it it does not mine on any pool. 
But this is the clincher: 
 You expressly understand the the Company’s sole obligation to You is to Provide a Payout based on the Pool you choose.
So long as they provide a payout that is equivalent to the payout you would have received from the pool you select - they are keeping their agreements to you.
Hashlets are not miners
The proof is in their own Terms and Conditions.
Is it not?

A quick example I can think of would be as follows:
It involves 3 parties. The buyer, the seller and the 'timer' party.
You set up a 2 of 2 (ie it requires both private keys to sign the transactions) multisig address and sent your "AUTH"'ed amount to that address (this is the equivalent of 'shadowing' the transaction as happens on CC/Debit).  The client would have one key. The seller would have the other key.
The 'timer' party then would be some sort of website that generates two transactions - one to send the funds back to the Buyer, and the other to send the funds to the Seller. The transactions are then signed by the buyer and seller, and kept by the timer party. That website would then process the right transaction at the right time (ie after the Merchant agrees to 'take payment' it would process the transaction, or if not - there would be a time-lapse which would run the other transaction).
 it would be important that the timer party is not the buyer or seller (and not related to them)
This would allow a similar functionality to AUTH transactions, but decentralised (in that there could be any number of these timer parties, maybe an open source implementation that anyone can put up).

In that situation, you could potentially (and I'm not up on multisigs to know if this is possible) - use a "two of three" multisig for the two "trusted hosts" - and a "three of three" for your own key. Wherein, you could notify them that the address has been compromised and they could stop verifying transactions. Only when all three keys were compromised then would it be an issue.

Well, you could do it one of two ways. Both of which would have modifications as follows.
The block template would have an additional field (or it could just be added in the coinbaseaux or something) - for the Group_ID. 1 could be Mars, 2 Saturn or whatever that bit doesn't matter. 
Then, mining pools would *fix* which Group_ID they were mining on (as could p2pools, solo miners etc etc). And any blocks those pools find would be set as that group.
If you are worried about external mining power - you could turn these into separate chains. Where the blockhash refers to the previous block hash from that Group_ID. 
No source, just an idea.

You mean "maybe the *exact* transaction inputs that were part of the Bitstamp Hack were used in the next 5-10 transactions *entirely* without any other transaction inputs being joined, and no changes addresses used.
The concept of "tracing bitcoins" other than to/from their immediate payer - and especially by inference 5-10 transactions "ago", is really misunderstanding the way that it works. It would be better in many senses if people forgot about the "coin" term - and started thinking in terms of Transactions.

Indeed, I agree that Bitcoin probably did get a lot of exposure/usage/publicity from Silk Road (A=B).. but that is not a reason to support Ross Ulbricht. The two points are mutually exclusive.

Sha hashes are evenly distributed such that finding ffff0000000 is as hard as finding 0000000ffff. Therefore if you take some base number (a 256-bit integer. So a very big number) that you know on average will take one miner who mines at 1mh/s 10 minutes to get.. Then you can decrease this number if you see on average of the last 2016 blocks that it has taken less than 10 minutes. Thus making the "set" of accepted numbers smaller.. Thus increasing the difficulty.

It's not that they ask for security. Its that they don't provide any subsidy or attempt to help anyone to attain these requirements - most of the "paperwork' could be subsidised if they wanted - as most of the requirements (audited accounts, private investigators etc etc) - have superficially inflated prices.
I could see perhaps a company coming out where you pay then $8000 in total maybe and they provide all the requirements or such by hiring these people / maybe with some vc funding - and having something like "instead, we take 5% or 10% equity in your company" or whatever - which would at least help.

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:30:56
But that's the mistake that people make. Full nodes won't have their bandwidth for mempool capped - if 50gb of transactions are transmitted on the network every 10 minutes, then those full nodes will have to receive and handle 50gb of transactions. The blocksize only means that 1mb of those 50gb will actually get stored and processed - it does nothing for the bandwidth of the full node.

Thats the deep web (ie login here)




And it is absolutely tiny in comparison. There is no argument that it is not. If it were as big as the article by false inference were trying to make it look, attacks on the tor network by running directories and exit nodes would have a completely insignificant effect unless the operation were truly gigantic - and they're not - especially when you consider that MIT was able to exploit the network (at least until it was patched)

Ok, firstly - i'm wondering how you came to your current understanding of things, because it seems a little screwy - so you may need to re-evaulate the larger picture in your mind of how it works.
There only will ever be 21 million Bitcoins created. These can be broken down into fractions to 8 decimal places ie 0.00000001. This smallest denomination is referred to as a "Satoshi". To help with your understand here - a "bitcoin" as it were isn't a tangible thing, and when you perform a transaction - you don't send a bitcoin to someone else. You can split it up into as many pieces (to 8 decimal places) and send it to any address that you wish.
There are more possible addresses than there are atoms in the universe - far far more. Let's just assume for sake of argument (and because of clever people than both of us) that its impossible to just randomly guess a bitcoin address that contains a value (even given the birthday paradox, the chances are just 0).
Now let's go about addressing your questions one by one.


Yes, but they aren't guessable, so unless they have this "string of characters" (which we would refer to here as the private key) - they can't take control of the bitcoins at that address.


The private key is never displayed publically, or transmitted. Although standard practice is to change your bitcoin address (and therefore your private key) after every transaction - this is more of a privacy than security point.


I think you are mistaking Bitcoins, with Addresses. Every bitcoin will be mined, however as said above - addresses are basically infinite (for all practical purposes) - so we will never ever get to a place where they are all (or even slightly) used up.


Ok, so this is how it happens (basically).
You have two keys - your "private key" and your "public key". Now, the public key is like your door number on your house - everyone can see it, and can use that key to send you bitcoins. Your "private key", well that's like the key to the door of your house - only you have it, and with it you can access your bitcoins to send to others. 
Now the process of sending coins to addresses - is known as a transaction. And transactions have to be made up of previous transactions. (ie I gave you $10, so you can give $5 to your friend). However, in bitcoin you have to "spend" the whole previous transaction (ie I gave you a $10 note. You can't change that into two $5s, you would have to give your friend the $10 note, and then get the $5 back from him) - well in bitcoin, while you have to spend the whole $10, you can split it up into multiple locations - Including back to yourself (so you basically give yourself a $5 back).
So when you want to send bitcoin to a friend - this is what you do:
1. Get their public key.
2. Decide which previously sent bitcoin transactions you want to send to your friend
3. Decide where to send any change (incase you don't want to send your friend the full amount of the previous transaction)
4. Make a transaction that contains the instructions for the above
5. "Sign" the transaction with your private key - to verify that its you who is instructing the bitcoin transaction to occur
6. Transmit the signed transaction to the bitcoin network.
That transaction then "spends" the previous bitcoin transactions - meaning that they are unable to be re-spent again (ie That $10 i gave you, of which you now have $5 from your friend - you can't send that $10 out again as you no longer have it).


As said above in the example - it stops being yours when you "spend" it to a bitcoin address you don't control.


No, that's what the blockchain does - which is powered and secured by bitcoin miners all over the globe.


No, because the client doesn't control the system - no one has control of the system. The client is merely a "vessel" for access to the blockchain and for creation of the above transactions so you can obtain, and spend your bitcoins from your addresses.

I think you are completely reading into this an already made storyline.
Bitcoin means that you can decide and have the power to decide. And (have to stop quoting andreas but still!) making money from gold or paper, into pure information (literally a UXTO) - if that isn't revolutionary on a global scale, or at least you don't percieve it to be - then you need to take a step back, but maybe, just maybe - you're missing the bigger picture here.

Consider writing a back-end that produces JSON for you to work with on the front-end. Most pools offer a public API that you can query, so its just a matter of curling those apis and getting back the data you need.

Alternatively, if you're more fluent in javascript than PHP, consider installing and using phantomjs instead, especially if you're happier with jQuery than with an xpath.

Secondly, how about the main fear for the everyday citizen who owns credit cards and this "e-dollar" as it were - Identity Fraud. The fact that someone's identity is publically revealed with every swipe, or every time that they take their chances at an ATM or Target.

Agreed. Bitcoin is still pre-release (not even version 1 yet). This means that fundamental changes can and will take place prior to being it a system that is advertised to work.


That's not bitcoin doing that - it on average takes 10 minutes for a single confirmation, not instant. Consider using some centralised system if all you want is instant confirmations - alternatively, wait until the lightning network is up and running.


You don't have to, but I will tell you today, that if you're not waiting - you've opened up yourself to fraud.


No its not. Its a development project that has a lot of software built on top of it that makes you think its nice and instant and great - but there are fundamental issues that have yet to be addressed.
As I said though, you don't need to know any of that - you are a user, and all you need to know is - the bitcoin you want, doesn't exist, at least not yet.
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:30:10
Well, the only case in which they are the same is if the value is 0 (or negative). Otherwise, having 10 times the amount of something will always be worth more. Of course, it may not necessarily be 10 times more if you are basing the valuation on an actual market rate for instance: 
You may sell 0.1btc for $28 (ie $280 for 1 btc).. however there is only sufficient support for 1btc by selling through orders down to $250 say, and therefore though 0.1btc was worth $28 , 1btc may be worth $260 - based on current demand. But 1btc would always be more than 0.1 in value even in this circumstance.

You know, there are a lot of people saying "bitcoin was supposed to..." - you know what? Bitcoin was never "supposed to" - Satoshi's idea was to create a currency that was pure information, that self-corrected, and that anyone no matter who could participate in. 
Now, as in *right now* we are having this blocksize debate - but the very fact that there are various alternatives that are on the table (either theoretical, or practical) mean that there is no 180, that the table is still open to all players. Want to make a cheap commerce situation? Make a pull request if you work out how.

For any purpose, you as a full node operator desire. 


Yes, including as I said above, to filter out transactions that you don't want to pass on. Whatever that is. Of course, if its just you filtering out these transactions it probably won't make much difference as nodes around you will fill in your missing transactions.


Because - we haven't. Some people believe that the world should switch to bitcoin *today*. As Andreas said - Bitcoin isn't ready, not even for Greece.
It would be a catastrophe if that were to happen... right now.

Actually, removing the intrinsic fact that "10" of something is worth more than "1" of something - *technically speaking* there is no difference between 1btc and 0.1btc other than the value(s) in each UXTO. There is however a difference between spending 10 0.1btc inputs as opposed to a single 1btc input - there is a size and complexity difference, as having to verify 10 transactions takes longer than 1 transaction.
Now, one of the future debates that needs to be worked out is that after the mining reward drops - what incentive is there for miners to continue. But that will happen and be resolved in due course.
However, it takes absolutely no more energy to mine a 0.00000001btc block over a 250000000 block - if the subsidies were coded that way. The mining energy required is linked to the current difficulty - which itself is worked out from the time between the last 2016 blocks - which of course is that large because of the individual discrepancies between the timestamps on the submitted blocks in the blockchain.

So what are they taxing? The USD bitcoin value of total of the unspent transaction outputs that were transferred at the time of the sale? I wonder how well written the definition of what "a bitcoin" is and well written the definition is.
These transactions may not contain bitcoin to the same value, but rather a valued colored asset - Where, as it is written - the bitcoin is what is taxable - so if 0.01$ of Bitcoin were sent... but as a colored asset that entitles the holder to *exchange* the colored asset (like-exchange) for a non-colored asset bitcoin worth $50 (or whatever value the colored asset represents)... there doesn't seem to be any legally enforceable description of this.
Pay using bitcoin pennies and colored assets that represent the values, then exchange the colored asset for the bitcoin later. All it would need is a party to "buy and sell" these colored assets to allow for this. They would surely be covered by like-exchange (as its bitcoin for bitcoin).

Difficulty is a maths sum worked out from the time between blocks so the ten minute average can be roughly achieved over a longer period. It is adjusted every 2600 blocks (I think?) for bitcoin.

Due to the very way bitcoin works - there has to be a fully available history of every transaction, in order for the system to be able to confirm (if need be) that every transaction in the system came from a valid block. Every transaction that exists links to every previous transaction that was used to make it up. The transaction ID and the individual "vout" index of that transaction.
The term "coin" is as you well know an abstract term - there is no "coin history" because there are no "coins", but there are transactions and there is transaction history. So it is just a matter of checking the Inputs for the Output to find out exactly what amounts came from exactly what addresses.

You can have more than one p2pool network that works independently of each other.
Infact at one stage, Vertcoin had 3 p2pool networks, subdivided based on hashrates of their miners to encourage decentralisation.

I think, as with all debates, there are extremes (in both parties, after all there are most likely bitcoin core supporters who are going out and DDoSing bitcoinxt nodes - which is hardly a sensible thing to do).
Andreas understands well enough that either Core, Bip100 or Bip101 - whatever is chosen as the majority, is ultimately irrelevant - the market will chose the best solutions on top of, or with whatever is underneath.
Ultimately, I don't beleive that Andreas is a bitcoin die-hard, but rather a crypto-currency believer - should some other crypto-currency usurp bitcoin, and turn out to the main one used - Andreas' opinions would apply equally. His opinions are more about the completely different perspective on a money represented in purely informational form - and the fantastic possibilities this creates. Whether that is Bitcoin now, or XT, or whatever in the future.

Lets see if I can clarify what I mean.
Step 1) Customer buys "colored asset" from Company X for $250 dollars with $250 of bitcoin - no tax as they are buying bitcoin with bitcoin, therefore like-kind (exact like kind infact). The actual bitcoin value of this asset is about $0.05.
Step 2) I sell a $250 item for $0.05 "if you pay by bitcoin color asset"
Step 3) Customer then transfers the colored asset (having bitcoin value of $0.05) and receives the item.
Step 4) As per requirements, I note down *only the bitcoin value* transferred (as the fair market value of the bitcoin is $0.05).
Step 5) I then sell back the colored asset and receive back from Company X bitcoin to the value of $250. Again a like-kind exchange.
Above, I have complied with all the requirements.
Granted, this is a convoluted process - I didn't say this was a straight forward way of doing this. 
But if someone can point out how this doesn't work i'd be interested.

And no one is perfect. People are always gonna have / do/ think / say stupid or bad things. Hence the need for decentralisation and the lack of a totalitarian regime where few people can abuse their power.
Bitcoin should be about focusing on helping imperfect people achieve a goal greater than the sum - its based around the Byzantine Generals principle - which was about making a system work even in such an imperfect environment. By asking and requiring "whiter than white" individuals, and stonewalling anyone who isn't - its kinda going against the message of how bitcoin works.
Its about limiting control of power of each individual, because we know how people really are. Not how we want them to be.

My understanding of the terms is based on the above diagram.
A centralised system has total control over all things.
A distributed system has equal control over features - ie all nodes implement the same features/all features.
A decentralised system is made up of nodes that contain services that are relatively centralised in their own setup, however there is nothing that they can do to influence the greater system, nor can they stop others doing the same thing (ie making a competing service) - this is decentralisation - this is how BitPesa operates.

Well, firstly - if the private keys are never published its unlikely they would be compromised, also if the private keys contain no coins, again there is very little point in compromising them. The person compromising them would have to be able to send a transaction from them before you get to create a transaction to send from them - and considering you already have the "spend" transaction so you can publish two transactions at the same time - that's almost.
The main issue would be stealing the transactions from you and publishing them. But that would do no good unless they also had the private keys compromised.

@_date: 2016-05-02 19:15:46
Yes, sorry - I guess it should read "If Craig's claim is fake, maybe..."
Personally, I'm leaning towards believing Gavin's word, considering he said this live at Consensus, about an additional check not related to the blog one.
Albeit, i doubt people in this sub would accept the truth even if it were 100% proven, like its almost "sacrilege" to turn satoshi into a real human being
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:19:08


or maybe, that Gavin has seen proof that you haven't?
Come back when you understand that occam's razor doesn't automatically lead to "mole"

You miss the point.If bitcoin itself were anonymous (like monero for instance) you wouldn't need to do any of the above. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:20:33
er ok?

Sidechains are useful but limited as they are inherently based on bitcoin. Monero has anonymity baked into its very core, not added on as an after thought.

Hi Dorian,
Firstly I have tremendous respect for you and how you have handled this very invasive invasion of your personal life.
What is your opinion on the blocksize debate, blockstream having so many Bitcoin core devs in their employment, and the xt fork?
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:20:44
Apparently these large transfers are free in banking system or something I recall someone saying on last similar thread 
@_date: 2015-10-09 23:04:03
It's referring to transactions in which case it is possible to transact that by sending the same bitcoin multiple times 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:48:38
Er.. Its very clear. No generation coins just fees
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:46:29
I always thought the term should be one of a million rather than the term used to describe being the "only one in a million people"
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:14:24
What did you use to generate the bitcoin address
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:47:22
The coins aren't fungible. There is no "coin". Transactions are tracable however 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:30:46
Because there are still dicks out there DDoSing via tor, and XT contains a fix for that.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:51:20
Decentralised means multiple points of centralised systems that work as part of the system rather than one point of control over all the system. Bitpesa is a perfect example of decentralisation.You may be confusing decentralised and distributed 
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:53:30
Deterministic keys work like that. The same on the HZ horizon wallet. Freaked myself out the first time too
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:43:05
Ultimately, I thought they merely needed to know that if their customer is passing on the coins to another money transmitter (ie directly from Coinbase to another Fiat&lt;-&gt;Crypto gateway) that they need this information. Otherwise they didn't...
Ultimately, just send it to your own wallet, use shapeshift, or another exchange along the way.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:02:27
Gambling sites may generate new addresses, but may also reuse old addresses, but presumably accumulate coins into their cold storage - or otherwise transact with these coins that you have deposited. Thereby linking these addresses with another address (a general rule is that if two addresses are inputs in the same transaction, that its probably likely that they are held by the same wallet - though of course its not always true, its a good indicator)
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:29:02
Well put.And it often annoys me that people dont realise this
@_date: 2015-03-02 14:14:10
So is that all that is needed then to instantly work out the balance of every current standard address?This can then also be used to create a pay transaction from any such address, all it would require then is signing..
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:53:50
It's coming at it from a different perspective. Multisig is an extension of private keys, whose to say that also extending how transactions are used isn't more secure? In essence, a P2SH is similar to this process anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:35:37
Probably means invoice?
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:53:11
You mean the transaction and the private key? Compromising the private keys would be pointless, as none of them contain any coins.
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:08:19
I thought mit did. Basically the license that is on the eloipool stratum code.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:53:09
Bitcoin was *never* *ever* meant to be anonymous.
Anonymity can be built on top, as an optional extra - but for those serious about anonymity, they really should look at protocols designed for such a task - such as Monero, rather than bitcoin clones that have had hacked together solutions applied that caused network fork after network fork
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:24:51
For that amount of money, I'd go there in person, with valid ID and not leave until they resolve it? 6 emails for $200,000 - you must be rich if thats all you're doing in 3 months.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:50:04
For legal purposes.. Sure. However for tax purposes no.

Really? So they didn't dump it for usd yesterday... The massive dump was completely unrelated?

When was the triple bonus added, as it wasn't 5 minutes from the end like you had said
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:52:41
Yes, good point. Its the unspent inputs that are the risk

Whether the definition is right or not - A paper wallet is a known and accepted term for what it was describing. When a phrase enters common usage in a specific manner, it is irrelevant what its "most exact meaning" is.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:12:38
Isn't the consensus algorithm still under their control ie to avoid forks

So, if I were to emerge in bitcoin I wouldn't get your spam filters *by default* ? I would have to manually add in "+ljr" to my USE flags?

Can someone please merge in a change that blocks Luke-jr's pool from submitting blocks to the blockchain, so users stop giving him money and supporting his habits?
We could call this +antiljrpool and just you know, Enable it by default as an "improvement"...
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:54:11
Agreed. How is ljr a justified flag. Who besides ljr actually agrees that this is useful for bitcoin? Any other core devs?

Originally ripple labs were ripple, as they had not open sourced their software at all, and held all the code, and XRP.

However most likely they use rolling balances so would have already used the btc transaction(s) he deposited and send him other transactions effectively mixing his bitcoins.. Which potentially down the line they could be liable for
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:35:13
MIT/X11 license I believe is the closest to what you are after. Where people can use your open source software commercially, but they must publish any modifications to your software as open source.
@_date: 2015-11-29 00:22:52
Centralisation of block mining could make Bitcoin a corporate dream.
Block size limits currently prevent Bitcoin being used in any serious way.
The code base for Bitcoin while open source is guarded fiercely with a strong disposition against those who opt not to support the Bitcoin core beliefs 
It's completely different to anything that's gone before. A hackers dream 
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:07:58
Or they took it. Now they are waiting for you to reuse it thinking that no one took it, and are monitoring for funds...
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:08:38
But could they obtain the key once the pin was entered - ie by being near by?
