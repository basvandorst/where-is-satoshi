Bitcoin is a protocol, not an organization. You are free to donate to whatever causes you like. Bitcoin users have donated millions to charities in the past and will no doubt continue to do so.

It probably matters to some people. Anyway, I just thought you might have a reason to think they'd changed ownership. I moved old coins out of the qt client to more securely created addresses once the price went up enough to make it too risky to leave them there. That's another possibility.

Hi cypherdoc, I have been following your posts on the speculation board for several years. Please do not take this post the wrong way, it is a genuine question. Although I would tend to agree with Mr. Voorhees in that it was not an altruistic move and should not be called a "bailout", I would be happy to give mtgox credit where due. 
However, what you are asking for is logically impossible. I cannot provide proof that something didn't happen any more than you can disprove Russell's teapot. I did not make the positive claim and therefore I do not have the burden of proof. 
The best I can do is what I already posted, I looked at all the posts that had Bitomat in the body and couldn't find any updates. I remember at the time that there were plenty of skeptics waiting for actual posts from users. Perhaps there were some in the Polish subforum,  but I never saw anything after the initial announcement.

I think Bitcoin's potential worth is much higher than the current price, so (depending on your personal financial situation) yes, it's a good time to buy.

* In-person trading:

I've never seen "the other side" make any solid arguments. Literally every time I read something by a Bitcoin detractor, they have based their arguments on ignorance or flawed logic. Most of the common "problems" with Bitcoin are addressed in the Bitcoin Wiki FAQ: 
@_date: 2012-10-28 23:17:01
I didn't mention any conspiracy or competition. Businesses pay a multitude of fees to banks for accepting payments and making ACH transfers. Cash deposits and P2P payments at those banks circumvent those fees. That's why P2P payments are not allowed for business accounts and that's why large numbers of small cash deposits cause investigation and the accounts to be shut down. 
@_date: 2012-11-18 17:08:43
To add to this - if you are depending on a price increase to make you profitable, it makes more sense to buy BTC directly and hold. BTW, my guess is the same - it appears that orders piled on long after it would be profitable to mine given the current price and the expected difficulty hikes of existing pre-orders. OTOH, if you are holding BTC, then helping to secure the network by further distributing the mining power is an indirect investment in your current holdings. You can't "lose" even if your personal mining reward is close to nothing.

I wasn't talking about businesses performing a task banks would normally charge for. Let me try this one last time.
The companies normally have to pay a fee -to the bank- to accept payments through that bank. The company then accepts cash deposits -through that bank- as a payment sans fee. The bank has a problem with this. If you still don't understand what I'm saying, I give up - I don't know how I can be any clearer.

They are trying to cover their asses. I can't answer whether or not it's "safe",  (and it might help to be more specific about what you consider safe) but I would strongly recommend against using MtGox unless you are willing to give them all your info and ID. They have a history of freezing accounts and holding funds hostage until whatever reasonable or unreasonable "verification" procedures are complete, and this can happen to you regardless of your activity level. Their TOS is purposefully vague to try and justify this.

No, because MyBitcoin had access to the private keys, while Blockchain.info just hosts the JS client, and only stores encrypted keys. You don't need to trust Blockchain.info the way you had to completely trust MyBitcoin. The only concern is that you're not doing your own due diligence on the client, as addressed below.

Bitpay already offers a 0% fee to non-profits for instantly converting payments to USD and depositing to their account. You can't get a better rate than completely free. Wikpedia has no risk, no cost, no investment required to accept Bitcoin. Spurning Bitcoin is a politically motivated move.

Rassah said it, so I don't have to - this is completely correct. I wouldn't even bother doing this for GPUs that are 100x as powerful as anything you're going to get from recycled GPUs - you will never make enough to make it worth your initial time investment before GPU mining is completely worthless. Even if we pretend ASICs aren't going to come out - it's still not worth setting up with old hardware right now.

The most outrageous comments I see are being made by Luke. I still don't know which username you are attributing to trace. But from just your reply here to me it seems that you are a little overly sensitive. I appreciate your work on this project very much,  and therefore of course your opinions matter to me. You made some allegations and then linked to 3 very long threads that I have no context for. I spent 20 minutes reading as fast as possible looking for the behavior you are describing from anyone towards anyone because you didn't mention who was who. I couldn't find it, and my opinion on what was being discussed aside, I don't see any legal threats being made.

Not necessarily a one time thing. Avalon will certainly be selling more units in the near future...it's true they might not use bitpay next time, as they have switched payment processors every batch. But Bitpay did the best job by far. Hopefully they will get the business next time as well.

Even the mining calculators will fool people who are very new. The difficulty is about to skyrocket, meaning GPU/FPGA hw purchased now will never break even (vs a direct BTC investment, at least.) There is a significant barrier to entry with ASICs - only 1 company is accepting orders and they're almost 5 months behind their delivery schedule, and continue to delay it. There is no guarantee they will ever have a working product, being so far behind certainly makes ordering a risk. 
Bottom line is that trying to get into mining is a losing proposition for newbies. OTOH, if you decide to make a sizable direct investment, buying an ASICs machine is a good way to further secure that investment, by distributing the network power and making it more secure. However, since you can currently only "pre-order" them, that's not yet a safe option...best to wait until these companies are actually delivering.
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:01:27

That's not malicious. It's just poor business. They are unable to make the customers happy and too scared to admit it. Their volume will slowly bleed out as their very limited withdrawals are not supplemented with any new deposits until they fix their problems or fade away. In  the meantime they will continue to have horrible customer service, because apparently that's not a deterrent. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:28:03

Not really. Services like this have supposedly been available for years, at capital  one and chase among others.
