The statement means nothing.  It is basically them explaining how capital assets are treated.  BTC is treated exactly like other capital assets.  The $600 rule is not exclusive to BTC.
The reason this sucks is because its totally unfeasible to use a capital asset as a medium of exchange because of the tax treatment. 
Here Johnny take .25 acres of my land for potato. Seem simple right? Well you have to know the cost basis of that land and report the net gain / loss (loss limited at $3000) on your taxes.  Very hard to do when a capital asset like BTC is designed to be divisible.  
So now when you go to Burger King and order potato for .05 BTC you need to know the cost basis of that .05BTC and report is as a taxable transaction on  your taxes.  That's fine to do once, but what if you eat potato at burger king every day for a year, that's 365 separate taxable transactions. 
The reason why currency treatment would have been awesome (but TBH, this would never happen) is because there is a specific exemption for transactions where the gain / loss is less than $200.  Imgine that, unless you would realize a gain of $200 you don't have to report it on taxes. Can eat potato at burger king every fucking day and the IRS will never know. Want to buy a $10,000 potato? You won't have to report it if the cost basis is $9,800-$10,200. THIS IS NOT THE TREATMENT BTC GOT.

Look at what is happening with MT Gox.  Once an address is known to be yours it can be pretty hard to hide them.  The kicker here is that if you report any transactions to the IRS, they are likely going to be able to figure out exactly what your address is.  Why?  You will have to report the exact date, and the exact amount transferred.  How many people do you think transmitted exactly .071231 BTC today.  Probably only one my friend.

Not an issue, the same is true if you are talking about stock and the IRS has dealt with that for a while.  I believe that right now you can use any reasonable method (LIFO, FIFO, specific identification, average cost, etc.).  There is a strong preference for FIFO as it is the least complicated to maintain over time.  You should use FIFO otherwise you will really bugger yourself over in the future.

We are discussing the former.

The title of this post is misleading.  You are correct that if the total transfer of BTC to a person or corporation is &lt;$600 it doesn't have to be reported to the IRS using a 1099-misc. HOWEVER, that is still a taxable event that must be reported on your tax return. 
Example: I pay Johhnny  $200 worth of BTC during the year for potato.  The BTC has a cost basis of $100. I don't have to report this transaction to the IRS using a 1099-Misc.  However, when I file my taxes I will have to report a capital gain of $100 related to this transaction. [Intentionally]  Not doing so constitutes tax evasion. 
[Edit] 
Edit 2: Yeah, capital treatment really really sucks for widespread adoption of BTC in the U.S.  This was the expected outcome though.  Capital assets make really really shitty mediums of exchange.
