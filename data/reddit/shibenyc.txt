My download is 70 MB/s on speedtest.net.  That's pretty fast, right?
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:04:35
Thanks I'll try that.  I do have other things running, it's my primary machine.  Should I be running it on a dedicated machine?
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:24:27
Ha, yeah, i guess someone has to lose.  Since it's a zero-sum game, right?

The number of transactions per block is limited by block size, not by the number of nodes.  I think Nodes only verify that the blockchain is correct, it doesn't process transactions (the part where you send bitcoins and it gets put into a block).  That work is done by miners but the number of transactions is still restricted by block size, not hash power.

Wow, that's really interesting.  So it sounds like the government's ban on large denominations (to ostensibly cut down on corruption) isn't having an impact on the percentage of digital/non-digital money?

I'm proud of America for sustaining this bull without China.

Thanks!

Are you saying that increasing the limit to 8mb doesn't make it more difficult to run a full node compared to not increasing to 8mb?  Or just saying that it's negligible?
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:01:34
I imagine by controlling the onramps (conversion from fiat to crypto).  This obviously has limitations, but with countries like Indian banning large denominations, it will be increasingly difficult to get crypto if banks prohibit transactions to/from exchanges.

Thanks for the detailed explanation!

I was told it's no longer usable, not sure if it's out of date or no longer available or no longer compatible.
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:23:47
Thanks, that makes more sense.

Is there an upside to a hardfork vs. softfork?  I always understood softfork as preferable for continuity.

I've setup a weekly buy too, but something about the price going up just makes me want to buy.
And I haven't sold any in 4 years and don't plan to.  So I guess that means I won't actually lose money unless it crashes and never recovers.
I also never buy more than I can afford to lose so I won't need to ever sell at a loss (as far as I can tell).
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:27:24
Yeah it is, so essentially most people are at least one step removed from the actual Bitcoin.  Although I think with hardware wallets, you have the private key so you technically have control (but not necessarily verification).  
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:26:59
If you have a chinese account, you would probably need to setup an account with OKcoin or BTCChina to buy bitcoin.  They both limit btc withdraws (I don't know what the rate is).
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:23:18
It might still crash... (not to be a downer) ...pun intended.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:36:41
wow, validation is quadratic? no wonder it takes so long.  That means with a 8x increase in block size, that would amount to an exponential increase in validation time?
EDIT: did Patrick say that if we overshoot a 20% increase in capacity, within 6-8 weeks, no one will be able to join the bitcoin network because validation time increased 16 times??  This seems super important to the blocksize debate, no?
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:30:59
Yup, I've never had a problem getting confirmations with a proper fee.  I literally have no idea why people are having problems.

Hard drive.  I've also increased my cache to use 4GB (out of 8). So maybe that will help?

It's hard to admit this, but trying to time the market is as good as random (most of the time).  And on a bull run, if you take a bunch of random buy and sells, you will lose money.  Just try it with any curve that's going upwards.
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:43:16
maybe other people had the same idea
@_date: 2017-02-19 01:43:56
you had me for a split second, lol

Do you accumulate more BTC overall with this trading strategy?
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:28:31
I guess growth would happen exponentially.  So at some point, it would outgrow the capabilities of a 'common' PC to run a full node?
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:05:47
PSA for people new to bitcoin: Don't try to catch the falling knife!  No one know how low it will go so only invest what you can afford to not touch for the next year or two years.  That way you won't panic sell later and make the price drop even more.
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:01:52
Here's what I found on confirmations.  Looks like it's based on block depth (which needs to be mined).
I'm not sure if there are other mechanisms whereby the peers propagate the transaction.  I think there is, but how it works is not clear to me.
@_date: 2017-02-19 05:21:40
I think what he means to say is that Bitcoin offers a trustless system, but in order for it to work, you must verify the proof through cryptography.
When you use an online wallet or something similar, you're trusting that someone else is verifying the blockchain and so you're not really taking advantage of the trustless nature of bitcoin.
When you run a full node, your wallet runs through all the calculations to verify all the transactions in the history of bitcoin.  every block is built on the previous blocks and the verification your machine does running a full node gives you proof that the bitcoin in your wallet is in fact 'real' and under your control.

Really appreciate you putting this together.

This is super ambitious.  You need some serious partnerships to get it done ( legal, finance, tech ) in all the countries you want to accept currency from -- so you can withdraw from their bank account. Or you should open an account with every bank you want your users to be able to use and have your user transfer money into that account.  How you get that money out of that account/country into your personal account so you can buy bitcoin with it is a very difficult problem.
If anything, this just proves how arcane and backwards the banking industry is.

Because we have these channels, we can send coins back and forth between ourselves.  And when we're ready to settle, we publish to the blockchain?
Does that mean for me to send bitcoin to you, we would need to store bitcoin with a shared channel or network of channels?
The coolest part for me is that even though it's off-chain, it's still trustless.  I find that pretty magical.
Thanks for taking the time to write a detailed and understandable explanation.

can you make a chart of this?

Thanks for writing this excellent post.  I'd like to learn more.  Are there books or other references you would recommend?
