Hey there. 
Did you know Coinomi is one of the most secure wallets to store your funds. Being in full control of your own private keys at all times makes it even more secure. Also when sending BTc (or any coin for that matter) You are in full control of the fees you pay, You can read more about the cost, or lack of it, when using Coinomi here:  [

Hi Cryptocronix, Saving his phrase in his Gmail account is indeed an attack vector. Nevertheless, If he has any further questions or any information to add then please ask him to reply directly to his open ticket so we can keep a single ordered line of communication. Thank You

Hi Pipdotcom, the Android version of Coinomi uses its own keyboard instead of the system one, exactly to prevent "smart" keyboards from learning and transmitting your seed. It doesn't "spellcheck" the words, according to what you type it suggests words from the BIP39 list it has stored locally (

Hi undadatunda, Coinomi does not track any user information including IPs so there is no way for us to know exactly who/where the broadcasting of the transaction was from. Please click this link to find out more about our [privacy features](

Hey 24Miles, You said.


If this includes you sending him your recovery seed. Please be sure to use a new one in the future since this one has now been shared which is an obvious compromise of your security. I am sure you understand this, but I just wanted to point out that you should immediately stop using that phrase. :)
