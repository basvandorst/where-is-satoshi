don't you think the third or fourth dry cleaner would have to make an application for a loan to the bank. The banking officer, who wants to keep his job asks "don't we have 3 or 4 already? You won't survive.  I won't back you - too risky".

What potential business owner will put up their house to collateralize a loan on the eighth dry cleaner in town?  Your world seems to be filled with idiots and many, many dry cleaners.  Different from my world.

what collateral does a dry cleaner have?  They don't own the store.  How much are you going to sell those hangers for?

So a house in Tunisa is about TND40K?  So US$16K, or 1BTC?

Just looks like someone taking about $500,000 out of the Bitcoin market at 250...  
Not even very well.  If there was that much push, they should have let it run higher.

Perhaps I don't see what you see.  I see two charts.  
On the first chart is Price (on the right hand scale) and volume (on the left hand scale).  You have circled in red, a 30 minute span of time where price held at $250/B. During that time, about 2000 coins traded.  
To me, looking at the upward trend, a seller stepped in for half an hour and unloaded $500,000 to willing buyers.  
The second chart appears to corroborate this.  You have a series of of offers to buy (only a few at 250, and up to 750 if you lower your selling price to 241), and you have a huge wall of sellers (1,000 coins at 250 and then another large wall of sellers at 254).  
So buyers got to the point where they had to pay $250 to get coins.  After half an hour of buying they realized the price wasn't going any higher and that a large seller appeared to be in place.  Buyers backed off and price retreated.  
This looks like any other market, except usually the sellers are not so brazen in telegraphing their intentions.  
What do you see?

wouldn't he need the whole exchage to himself?  There would be millions of sellers ahead of him willing to sell at lower prices,  he would never get a chance to buy at 1000 the exchange would fill him at a lower price.

One thing to keep in mind with "value is subjective" one thing that the US Dollar has is a little note on its face "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private"
If I owe bob $500 and I offer to pay him in 10 tons of coal, he can refuse.  With the debt outstanding bob can sue me even though I offered him 10 tons of coal (worth $514 today).  I could offer him Bitcoins, but maybe he doesn't have an account, so he rejects the payment.  But if I offer him $500 in US dollars and he rejects that.  When I stand in front of the judge and say I tried to give him $500, then the judge can tell bob to take it as legal settlement of the debt.
