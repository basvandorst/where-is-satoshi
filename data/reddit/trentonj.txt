That's why, if I ever happened to make that much from Bitcoin, I would only sell little bits at a time. Maybe $1,000 or less each time, and then go to an ATM to cash it out. I would never risk something so huge

I keep doing this lol. Went from I believe 250 to 500, sold before a small crash, put the 500 back in when it was at a low and go it to about over 700, sold as it was crashing again. 
Hoping I can keep doing this until I end up with 1BTC haha

So it’ll constantly match the value of the dollar?
Man whoever came up with this idea is a genius. People will be buying this up like candy! /s

What is bitwage exactly? Can't get a good clear view of it from their website, just says "work from overseas"

That's what I did, it's encrypted with 7zip so if someone managed to somehow break through my 2-step authentication and find the files, even those files are encrypted as well.

$60 over an entire year? Not shit talking the website but that's like a tiny, extremely small dust mite of a fraction of a Bitcoin for an entire year.

So basically put it on a flash drive instead of Google Drive correct?

You can thank me for that. After 6 months of not touching Bitcoin I finally decided, fuck it, I’m gonna put a good chunk of change into it for old times sake while the price is low.
Literally 10 minutes after doing so is when it tanked
And this happens literally every, single, time, that I buy. And ever, single, time that I sell it skyrockets.
Back in early 2017 I had a good chunk of Bitcoin that I had for a while but the price was just sitting there and not moving for months on end. Decided, well it hasn’t moved in months I’m just gonna sell to pay my bills and then rebuy when my next paycheck comes.
I sell, boom, price skyrockets and keeps growing for the entire year to its highest point in December of $21,000
I think at this point I single handedly just control the price of it. Don’t believe me? Give me a date and time, I will sell my Bitcoin (or buy) and you can watch the price fluctuate accordingly depending on which one I do. It’s infuriating
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:18:36
Yeah, that’s kind of the point!
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:01:08
Wouldn’t the growth of bitcoin also cause the growth of alt-coins?
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:55:28
That isn’t saying much. Trading chickens for bread is more like Bitcoin than some corporate rewards system..

Damn, what the hell happened to this sub since I’ve been gone? That is absolutely ridiculous. Being hyped for the price going up isn’t me “manipulating people” into buying or selling. I guess price changes can’t be discussed on here anymore, cause ya know, that’s manipulating people into buying and selling.

I put in $500 last night before I went to bed and sold off when it started falling a few hours ago. Made a decent amount from it. Had a lot of money in Litecoin and Ethereum Classic as well beforehand and sold off at the top. 
Feels good. Now debating if I want to put money back in while it’s low
Edit: Confused about the downvotes

Short bear run? We’ve been having a bear run for the past 6-12 months. We get 24 hours of a bull run and suddenly it’s too much. Buckle up buckaroo!

I’m betting it’ll be about how “It’s the perfect tool for criminals” and how “less secure it is than banking” and things of that nature.

I did scan another paper wallet to watch only. I'm starting to think that could be it. It was actually posted on here. I think that's the problem.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:37
Same thing happened to me! I'm rushing to put it all on a paper wallet before it's too late.

Sorry, I just bought some so it’s going to plummet now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:59:09
Is it..
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:28:14
Typo! Ive done a couple months worth of research before jumping in.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:46:58
I never really had anything to begin with though. I only had about 0.00002 Bitcoin, where it now says that I've received multiple payments to reach up to a little over 1 BTC, then somehow I sent the BTC to someone else. So I kind of lucked out, but then got robbed? One payment had a note that said "Every little bit helps.."

Thank you! I actually have come across your website before. Its very neat and useful!
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:12:13
Are you sure? Just about a week ago I bought $5 worth on there and it verified and everything.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:24:39
I remember the 10th time you posted this.
Glad to say Ive made it as far as 15! Once its April and youre still posting this, I'll be gladly saying I saw it within the first 10 times.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:17:04
Most definitely if many others did!
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:46:18
Decrypt the private key on bitaddress.com and then scan the new private key. I had the same problem!

When I try using PC, it will tell me I have insufficient funds when I don't! It's so frustrating. I don't know of any other way besides Blockchain I can sweep my paper wallet.
