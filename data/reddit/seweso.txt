As long as Bitcoin increases its value by a factor of 2 every 4 years then security continues to be paid by mining fees, and doesn't need to be covered by transaction fees.

I get that the word has been tainted and that people belief it means something else. Fair point. 
But people and ideas have been deliberately been vilified on certain Bitcoin fora for a long long time. Simply using different words isn't going to fix that.

So if Core (dev's/supporters) say most transactions are spam and not actual transactions, we all think this is just dandy and not a problem. But if someone else says the same thing in a different context it is wrong?
You can't have two completely different narratives depending on the context. Depending on whether you are defending small blocks or bitcoin's success.

@_date: 2016-04-15 10:48:27
Yes, LN should be able to work with any blockchain which supports the necessary contracts. In theory that should allow you to instantly convert one crypto currency to another (or towards side chains). 
What should also be possible is that you send Bitcoins, and someone else receives another cryptocurrency. Or where you convert LN transaction to on-chain transactions using an intermediate. Handy for when you locked up to much of your BTC.
@_date: 2016-04-19 12:30:29
True, but such discounts are just miner policy. If those policies are detrimental to Bitcoin as a whole you would expect them to get changed quickly. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 09:03:37
Even if everything goes as smoothly as possible, even then it was still very risky, stupid and it split the entire community for no good reason at all. 
Maybe it was just a coincidence that as price/transaction volume went up that we hit the limit and everything went downhill again (around the beginning of march). 
We will find out in the coming weeks/months when we have definitive proof that Bitcoin's growth is really stunted by all this nonsense. As the next fee-event is just around the corner.

I don't consider Bitcoin a failed experiment, but it sure feels like we hit the snooze button. I stopped using Bitcoin, and I have no interest to promote its usage at the moment. I'm just waiting for what will unfold in the coming months. Like a silence before the storm. 
And looking at trading volume, bitcoin's price and difficulty I'm probably not the only one who feels the same. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 20:15:28
The only thing you might consider unsafe is huge transactions take too long to validate, but that is exactly something which you can fix with a soft limit. So i'm missing the point you are trying to make completely.

I haven't actually seen definitive proof of spam, except with the whole coinwallet ordeal. But for the big wave of transactions around the beginning of march, I have seen nothing which couldn't also be negligible and/or legitimate transactions from a HD wallet.  It is kinda hard to believe someone was spamming the network for months and months to reach some kind of spam crescendo (as tx/s was 2.6 before, 3.0 during and dropped to 2.2 after the "attack"). Or maybe you believe the attacker only needed to add 0.4 tx/s on average to create problems on the network. Which is also not a comforting thought if that is all it takes. 
So go ahead, check the data. Or believe whatever you want to believe.

It is called a fork because all existing clients would stay on the current trajectory, and they would not follow the fork. A fork is not a disaster. It just is. Not good or bad by itself. 
If we had planned a hardfork years ago, it would be the safest thing ever. The community would still be together. We would happily anticipate the halving together. We would not need to fear growth and success, so we could still enthusiastically promote Bitcoin's usage. 
And people who are afraid of growing the blocksize might advocate lower soft-limits. And if a majority agreed those soft limits would get enforced, maybe even with orphan limits (where a minority of miners need to step in line and can't create bigger blocks than a certain size). 
So no, forks are not inherently bad.

Yes, but isn't doing a soft fork first and then a hard fork to clean up better than doing a hard fork to begin with?
The only problem as I see it is that if segregated witness validation fails catastrophically that there isn't actually any way to go back to the old validation. 
A soft fork would create a false sense of security, which would get it deployed and activated faster as if nothing bad can happen.

SW is very good. Mostly because it squashes malleability once and for all. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:26:22

1. We are already running into the limit
1. It takes a lot of time to do a hard fork (safely)
1. I see [fees rising and getting more erratic]( for my transactions
1. Bitcoin can't handle any significant growth at the moment 
So there are real cost associated with not upgrading the limit. I don't think anyone would disagree.
Now is there a cost to upgrading the block size limit? I think that's a resounding NO. Because the limit in no way forces blocks sizes to go upward (it only artificially forces them to be smaller). 
There is a cost to having bigger blocks, but there are enough mechanisms for Miners to keep blocks smaller (soft limits/orphan limits etc). No small miner could force a majority to mine on top of huge blocks, and a majority of miners need to be cost effective, are conservative and risk averse. The accidental selfish miner theory is simply not realistic.  
The upside of the block size limit might be that we are forced to fix some scalability issues, although actually running into scalability issues would have probably done the same (with a lot less drama). Thin blocks/IBLT/Weak blocks start to make real sense when the block size increases. 
Blocks can probably grow comfortably towards 4Mb. Certainly if by the time an increase is activated IBLT/Weak blocks are also in production. 
Ultimately it should be the market which decides what it is and isn't comfortable with running (cost based). If the block size is increased now you would probably see almost no difference whatsoever except that transactions fees become less erratic. You could have the exact same average block size and still come out on top (also same orphan risks, bandwidth, storage). 
Although we will never see how terribly unexciting an increase would be because it will simply take too much time for it to get activated. By that time the pressure to create bigger blocks (because it reduces cost and adds profits) would be too big to resist for miners. Which would only proof that the cost of having the limit was higher than the cost of bigger blocks. Although this event will probably be misconstrued if it would ever happen.  
And its actually the small blockers who scream that the sky would fall when we increase the limit. As if the 1mb is some magical limit preventing us from certain doom. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:14:50
Sorry i called a hub disappearing collapsing, maybe that's not the correct term. Although it still collapses effectively. It just takes a while to get your coins back. Which means that if Core locks up coins automatically this can get ugly very fast (when trusting just about anyone).
I don't see how having an incremental cost would be an argument against efficiency of scale. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:14:34
We were talking about running into the fee market. But you are still talking about how things work before the Fee Event. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 11:44:19


As if we have experience with soft forks this big. As if bugs in SW aren't going to be disastrous. 


Someone should explain how that can realistically happen. If nodes and SPV clients can be on a completely abandoned fork without alarms going off then it seems we already have a huge security problem. 
Seems like a "it can happen therefor it will" logic, which is very prevalent in the small block community. 


If something has a significant cost then these transactions should be rejected (policy based) or they should be offset with enough fees. These are all soft limits. And not really exciting for such a hard fork. As if miners are suddenly going to create huge blocks or something. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:48:15

Don't we need to trust that the core dev's mean what they say that block propagation is an issue which needs fixing? If we have block propagation solutions in place and they are still stalling with the next increase then we are certain it is really about control. 
One thing which isn't discussed often is whether the blocksize limit might accelerate bitcoins software development. Maybe we will look back and see that this thing caused our Cambrian explosion. 
Doing the easy thing (increase the limit) might not force us soon enough to do the hard thing which is needed anyway eventually.

Lets do more technical solutions to cater to the contrived mental hangups of a small minority. ;)
The code changes look incredibly small. 
Is this removing only witness data like Segregated Witness? Or is this really also removing certain transactions? 
And if you remove certain transactions, don't all transactions eventually get tainted and become impossible to add to legacy blocks? 
What would be cool if legacy blocks are summaries of normal blocks. So of a transactions goes from A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. A legacy block only sees transactions going from A &gt; D.

Its the trend not the amount i'm worried about. And its a flat fee, as in I need to pay that even for 10 cent transactions. I'm not worried about my use cases because its usually big enough amounts, i'm worried about uses cases which will move to alt coins if fees become to high (and that those were the ones which were going to define Bitcoins success).


Source please. It might have been a good DDOS protection, but it has always been much higher than actual transaction volume (as it should be). Fact is that its function is changing. First it already creates more erratic fees (as predicted) because Bitcoin can't properly handle peak volume. (Also notice that bitcoin can handle peak volume with bigger blocks without increasing the average blocksize!). And secondly it will create an artificial market for fees, where fees change from the lowest fees people need to pay (cost based) to the maximum people are willing to pay (bidding to still get included). 
 
I don't understand why I would be the extremist if I want Bitcoin to remain the same.

@_date: 2015-12-21 13:31:16
I figured there would be something, but is it comparable? Can it simulate Bitcoin faster than realtime with multiple miners/use cases? I'm currently creating thousands of blocks in just a few seconds. 
And it was only a few hours of work. I was away this weekend to a vacation home with very bad internet connectivity. Those are the moments where you create things like this ;)
I'm actually only simulating just enough of bitcoin so I can simulate the fee market. So its more about simulating behaviour of miners and use cases. 
What I've seen thus far is that fees rise sharply when miners want to add more transactions but can't. Although I must say that I modelled the cost of adding a transaction as the same regardless of blocksize (the first transaction added to a block has the same cost as the thousand's).
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:20:34
Why do you feel the need to vilify instead of accept that there are people with different opinions. Occam's razor and all.

How? You would need a LOT of hashing power to be able to fake fast enough confirmations/the correct difficulty.  
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:00:05


Not really, any block created by the old software would be considered valid by all nodes which are not upgraded. And all transactions of SW would seem valid at first by non upgraded nodes (for zero conf). 
You also realise that any hard fork also only needs a majority of miners? (not a super majority).
And activation of SW still needs a supermajority to activate. So its really not that hard to prevent activation. 


Because old wallets actually do that? Does anyone inspect the script of the coins which are sent to you? 


Because they are the attacker? What is the point of sending it to themselves if their blocks get orphaned anyway? 
The reason we are in this fucking mess to begin with is a severe distrust of miners who are supposed to mine huge blocks against their own best interest. But for SW all miners will suddenly play nice. And suddenly incentives are weighted in the pro's and con's. Isn't that a little off? 


No you could not, at least not so easily because you need to connect a SPV client to your own nodes. Now a SPV client only needs to be connected to non upgraded nodes. It just means that "only miners need to upgrade" is false. 
Fijne kerstdagen!

New question for the FAQ:
**"Is it true that if the network reverts back that all SW coins are spendable by anyone?"**
For instance when there is a bug in the SW code and all miners choke on it. Or when the non SW hard fork (re)gains enough miners.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:26:25


Not really. Blocks only become a tiny bit bigger if you use SW transactions. If a majority doesn't care to use SW transactions (or deem the risks too high) then the block-size won't change as much. 
Its also possible that the type of transaction which falls of is exactly the type which doesn't really benefit from SW (lots of transaction data vs little witness data). But thats just conjecture, someone should look into that.  


Users who do not upgrade are a problem if you need the space. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:22:48
No. Its the same thing as SW does. All nodes can still validate the extra blocks which do contain A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D transactions.

If that is not formalised then we actually don't know how many eyeballs have seen a piece of code. There is room for improvement there. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:03:07
Just like a soft forking Segregated Witness you could create transactions which are spendable by anyone on the old chain, but are still validated with separate witness data. 
So you have a chain with A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D and with the correct signature data. Which is validate by miners. But on the old (1mb block) it looks like A&gt;D. 
Then you give discounts based on the compression factor which can be achieved. And would also be smart to give discounts to transactions which reduce the UTXO, but thats another matter.

Isn't creating transactions with multiple parties a trick Lightning itself needs to learn? That would make Lighting more complex by definition. Although I don't know enough about what kind of replacements RBF allows. Maybe it's already too broad in what it accepts. I would think you would only need to mix an input of the receiver into the transaction. Everything seems easier when you don't know everything. ;)
@_date: 2015-12-04 07:13:35


The 1mb block size limit **IS** the experiment. Bitcoin has grown without being affected by a block size limit for years. Lets not turn this experiment around.  We are experimenting with creating a market for fees by introducing an artificial block size limit.  Something which already incurs cost onto the network (irregular fees, longer confirmation times, less transactions). 


Obviously i meant bandwidth in the sense of usage. And bandwidth is an arbitrary constraint on most internet connection anyway. Do you think a mechanic always needs to come over to upgrade bandwidth on a connection? 
You have only shown that you don't know what you are talking about. And you seem to be twisting everything around (or parroting).

An attacker has a much bigger chance of success with much less flooding if transactions are evicted based on fee. 
Let's assume 100% of miners max out at 16Gb. Then you need to flood with 16Gb (plus a little bit) worth of transactions to effectively evict your low paying transaction with a 100% chance. With a random eviction algorithm you would have a near 0% chance of evicting your transaction. If you flood with 32Gb worth of transactions you would be at 50% chance. 64Gb = 25% chance etc. 
In your example you seem to flood the **entire** mempool. But in that case it really doesn't matter what eviction policy you use. 
Its simply more realistic that we merely bump into these limits, then fee based eviction is a really stupid idea. Unless you don't value zero-conf anyway. If you value creating a market for fees more than you do zero-conf then it makes total sense.
And these are not strawman attacks. The amount of times that I heard "You should not use zero-conf anyway" on from core dev's is staggering. Their actions show that they don't value zero-conf, and that's also literally what they say.
Don't forget that a fee market has been introduced with zero consensus, that's what makes me wary.

That's not really weird considering the following:
1. Its hard to know what chilling effect the block size limit has had already. In a way not doing something because there is no problem is a self fulfilling prophecy (for which the only question is to what extend). 
1. It was called an emergency then because there were no contingencies in place for when we would hit the limit. Now we hit the limit and wallets "simply" increase fees. A [comment from the bread wallet developer]( is pretty telling in this regard. 
1. That is also exactly what I see with [my transactions]( fees going up and getting more and more erratic. 
1. We complained that a fee market would be introduced without any consensus, and it has. 
I concede that there are not many concrete complaints about the sky falling. Not a lot of people having problems with confirmations, not many people complaining about too high fees. But this is still just a matter of when, not if. I personally always said problems could start as early as at the end of 2016. The fact that it didn't happen doesn't mean it wasn't smart to plan according to that prognosis (and it was and is still irresponsible not to do anything).  
If the cost of hitting the limit (as we do now regularly) is still subtle doesn't mean its any less important. Its also the principle of the matter (reintroducing the hard limit to do something it wasn't designed for without consensus).
Its the most vocal core developers who want smaller blocks not bigger. Its those developers who claim that most transactions nowadays are still mostly spam. Its those developers who claim to have no problem with $10 transactions. Its those developers who say things like "you shouldn't use zero-conf anyway". Its those developers who don't include BIP64 or double spend relaying. 
This is still not just about the block size limit. This is about Core showing their support for Bitcoin as a payment system as it is now. However rudimentary that might be compared to Lightning. 
I believe SW certainly does a good thing by adding a creative block size increase. That certainly gives hope. But that has its own timetable, which is simply too slow. Its also bad design/planning to conflate two unrelated changes like that. The planning should be BIP101 (or comparable) &gt; IBLT/Weak blocks &gt; SW  &gt; Double spend relaying &gt; Lightning. 
I would also really like to ask the core/blockstream developers questions about Lightning. How, why, when etc. They are not the best at communicating.

The point was that the users who need bigger blocks and the people who care about bigger blocks might not be the same group of people. A "tragedy of the commons"-like scenario. 
Although I must admit that if its really important to increase blocksize everyone should care. 
Getting forced to use a completely new type of transactions might not really be the best way to do it. But lets leave that as a homework assignment ;)

@_date: 2015-12-08 12:36:33
BIP100 makes sure that whatever is accepted is predictable. But miners only need to announce what they will accept and that problem is already solved. There is no need to have a dynamic limit to do that. Its certainly not good to let a minority determine the block size (or prevent a change). 
I think the market is best suited to choose a block size. So without any hard limit. A market would already not allow 100Kb blocks and it would certainly not allow 100Gb blocks. Bitcoin would get overtaken by altcoin if it can't handle enough transactions, and Bitcoin would implode without decentralisation. But would Bitcoin automatically converge on the ideal block size, or does it really need a block size limit? 
This reminds me of the moral landscape by Sam Harris (link)[ Morality also has lots of discussion and disagreement in the middle about what is good/bad, but not at the extreme's.

That would be a resounding **NO**. Of course it is not worth it. This only adds insult to injury by completely giving in to the idea that hard forks are impossible. If we keep hacking away like this Bitcoin will be overtaken by a coin which has a better design.

@_date: 2015-12-22 12:40:53
Please, as if average is a good indication whether we hit the limit or not. 
We hit the limit if miners want to create blocks but can't, even though there are still miners which can but won't (not to mention empty blocks being mined).
Don't be an idiot. 
  
@_date: 2015-12-28 10:33:59
Same goes for edge cases which trigger more 32/64bit differences. Or windows/linux/osx differences. 
Creating alternative implementations can be more valuable and completely offset the risk of accidental hard forks. Having a substantial amount of hashing power behind every client would at least make sure they can still limp around (allowing for time to do a fix).
Also, if Core allows for weird edge cases which aren't useful. Maybe we should make it a bit less flexible. Even if that takes a hardfork to do so. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:30:40

That's a nice way of putting it. Because I have seen people say things in line with "X can happen therefor it will" without any regard of incentives. So its nice to focus on incentives.
For instance regarding "bigger blocks can happen therefor it will", it is actually never properly explained in terms of incentives. Why would miners actually create bigger blocks if that would hurt decentralisation? I must say I have heard people claim that somehow the tragedy of the commons would apply, and that they believe in some accidental selfish mining of sorts.

The majority of miners can orphan those veto blocks. So its not really a veto...

There isn't any amount of fees you can pay to fit more transactions in a block. Someone pays more, someone else falls off the blockchain completely. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:55:05
A soft fork always cripples nodes who are left behind. A hard fork is clean, and a soft fork is messy. You have it backwards. Bitcoin is MUCH more agile and clean if we can keep everyone up to date. 
And the need for a **fast** fork  is completely contrived obviously. We have been begging for a simple upgrade for YEARS. 
You can't pretend that a SW soft fork is in any way simpler or cleaner than a simple blocksize limit increase. You just can't. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:11:52
Why? You state all this as a foregone conclusion, but I don't see any logic in what you are saying. 
A miner has 10 minutes on average to catch up. And even if he doesn't he can keep mining onto headers and still not miss a beat. 
Or are you talking about Gigabyte blocks and dialup connections or something? 
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:41:42


Which one?
You clearly don't know what you are talking about, because you don't even realise that  the concept of the "real" Bitcoin isn't nearly as clearcut as you think. 
Maybe you should look into the previous hard forks we've experienced. 


I develop software for some 22 years now (from when I was 12). And I don't say that it can't be a huge effort. I'm saying that if it becomes popular, then that should not be such a big deal.  


It doesn't matter what you would call it in your head. In reality it would be "Bitcoin" and maybe "Bitcoin original" or something. 


Yes exactly. Just like we have to hope they continue to mine at all. Or not do 50% attacks. 
You can't selectively disregard incentives when it suits you. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:46:40
Shouldn't we also mention SPV mining / mining empty blocks on top of headers before download/validation? 
It has got a bad rep, but it also makes block size completely irrelevant. And by extension orphan risks and its supposed decentralisation effects.
Isn't that the most pragmatic (and coarse) solution? It makes empty block a bit more suspicious, but that is already a reality. And SPV mining is stupid if you always do it, but if you switch whenever you downloaded/validated a block I don't see a problem.

Why does the legacy chain need to see C? Maybe I don't fully understand you or vice versa. So I'll add some explanation: 
Legacy :
1. A &gt; D (spend all, no signature needed)
Segregated Transactions:
1. A &gt; B (with segregated witness)
1. B &gt; C (with segregated witness)
1. C &gt; D (with segregated witness)
Fully validating nodes would check both legacy and ST blocks. For easy validation the legacy block should be deterministically generated form the ST block so that validation is quick and efficient. No multiple ways of compressing transactions, that would be annoying.

It is the truth. And I don't say that core's deviation is ill intended. I understand their vision, and for some part I even agree. But they still see consensus as something to be decided amongst themselves. Obviously this is not a problem of their own design, this is started with the dissolution of the Bitcoin foundation. 
With a lack of leadership which actually represents all users a clash like this was bound to happen eventually. Could have been over anything. 
A perceived conflict of interest by Blockstream employees (which happened to align with Core's new direction), Mike mentioning retarded things like red listing. All those things don't really help keep a community together. Maybe people who are draw to a trust-less currency already have trust issues to begin with ;).
Don't forget that Bitcoin attracts people with wildly different backgrounds. Libertarians, anarchists, geeks, nerds, entrepreneurs, investors, hoarders, first adopters, spenders. (did i miss something).
So what i'm saying is that the split was always there. It just needed a spark. Doesn't mean I put all blame at the core dev's, far from it.

If someone is downloading movies for his/her entertainment then its pretty stupid. You indeed could call it Spam. If they are downloading censored content and need to stay anonymous to stay safe 
But that's the thing, you can't really tell. And you shouldn't be able to. That's the point for both Tor and Bitcoin. I mean you wouldn't go about promoting red-listing or blacklisting for Bitcoin right? 
We could have an honest discussion about spam. Although I would not call anything spam as some kind of foregone conclusion. You first need to asses what is and isn't valuable for Bitcoin as a whole. Then you can talk about how you can make promote the good stuff, and make it more expensive to do stupid stuff. 
And if we have done that, and we have consensus on that we actually want to do something. Then you would design how you are going to do that. And that also means you could in theory appropriate the existing blocksize limit to do that. But anyway you need overwhelming consensus to do that. 
Getting forced by a minority who veto/stonewall increasing the limit is definitely not good. Going against the community. Forgoing consensus completely. Misappropriating the blocksize limit. That really does way more damage than good. Hard to say how much, but definitely not good. The stress alone makes the cost way to high. 
Bitcoin and Tor and not completely comparable. Bitcoin has anti spam measurers. To be precise it was born from the anti spam measure HashCash. And things like coin-age are good ways to prevent spam and still provide free transactions for instance. And there are probably more things to come. 
Adding transactions to the blockchain incurs a cost (storage/orphan risks/decentralisation) and this simply needs to be recouped. If a transaction pays its dues then it should be fine. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:24:52
There are soft limits in place. Its not like the blocklimit is all that is preventing blocks from getting larger.

@_date: 2015-12-11 14:41:16


I do, but by definition that cost should not have to be covered. Or should become a professional node. If running a full node becomes a service (which you can pay for via bitcoins) then I'm all for it. Its just that amateur nodes would then become professional nodes. 
Running a full client is important because that gives you more security. But if you are dealing with so much money that that becomes an issue then I don't pity you for needing a more bandwidth. 


If bitcoins security depends on amateur nodes then I guess all is lost already. Then we really need to fear bitcoins success. Because if bitcoin becomes a bit too professional we would have too many professional nodes :P. 
With SPV you (currently?) need to be sure you are not only connected to an attacker. Although even then the cost of an attack would be so high that its unreasonable for most use cases. 
Bitcoin's security was never absolute for anything. There is full client 6 confirmation security on one end, and zero-conf SPV security on the other. I can see those shifting because of larger blocks, but not significantly. But maybe I missed something which makes an attack a lot cheaper when there are less nodes. 


You are right. I'd say that the (perceived) cost of switching to another client is simply bigger than not having a block size increase. Things which don't help is the cost of forking (bitcoin doesn't do git very well), the fact that they contribute a lot of good things and because the protocol is currently defined through the core implementation (very unhealthy). All this makes preventing a certain change fairly easy. 
With great power comes great responsibility. You can't just apply the process for developing software to developing a protocol, or to running Bitcoin as a business. 
You can't lead and do character attacks, you can't lead and no denounce censorship, you can't lead and then only decide by yourself (or between dev's and miners). You either step up and lead, or you step down and accept whatever some broad consensus mechanism. 
I have seen developers get promoted to management functions. Its not pretty. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:51:01

Even without a limit blocks can be bigger/smaller. BIP101 makes sure the limit gets out of the way, doesn't suddenly prevent miners from implementing sane soft limits. BIP100 is an complicated solution to a simple problem.

In reality it is simply not efficient to do Lightning with anyone. It was always the idea that anyone could be a Lightning Hub. The question is: will they? 
And if collapsing channels incurs significant costs. Then is there really no trust involved? 
The argument for Lightning probably goes like this: You don't need to trust us, so it doesn't matter that it is completely centralised. 
Just because something can be decentralised, does that mean that it will? Bitcoin's architecture is still decentralised, but we still have "OMG centralisation" discussions. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:07:49
So collapsing channels does not incur any cost? Funds would not be unspendable for any significant amount of time? And you don't have to pay extra settlement fees? 
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:42:01
Maybe you should not use RBF for zero-conf transactions and just pay a high fee? I mean the point was to get it added to the blockchain quickly in the first place right?
Allowing replace by fee after a certain amount of time still adds uncertainty for zero conf transactions. 
We could also create RBF transactions where you are only allowed to add fees. Maybe by simply not allowing any edits in the first output or something. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:47:31
Well for one thing not simply increasing the blocksize limit causes a lot of development effort to focus exactly that.

@_date: 2015-12-28 11:01:32
I think you are right, and that Unlimited is more a thing for nodes than it is for miners. The very conservative and risk averse nature of Miners which would allow the blockchain limit to be lifted is also the reason why it might not be a good idea for miners. It does introduce uncertainty about what is and what isn't accepted. 
But if everyone ran Bitcoin Unlimited, at least miners would not need to worry about whether their blocks are accepted economically. Being ready for bigger blocks is a good thing, and running XT or BU isn't nearly as dangerous as people make it out to be.   
If you only have miners on board you are still nowhere. A super majority of miners can't create bigger blocks at the moment.

The outcome was to pretend SW is a scaling solution. And focus on getting orphan cost under control first, that is what Miners want before a blocksize limit increase. 
For me it feels like miners use the blocksize limit to force a solution regarding orphan costs. And I don't really know whether that is such a bad thing, but I'm also not sure it's a good thing. 
Not doing a simple increase switches the orphan cost from miners directly onto the entire network. Probably way better than only having the subtle cost of decentralisation (not so measurable). 
On the other side miners are for profit, so they should already have enough incentive to fix orphan risks. Why should anyone else fix that for them (for free). (Or am i mistaken and are there miners investing in software development?). And miners are never forced to mine bigger blocks, a removal or increase of the blocksize limit would not change that.

Of course, the "everyone has everything" method can't really be the best way of creating a worldwide system for buying both houses and coffee's. I'm just saying: let the market decide. 
It not technically impossible, it just has an associated cost. 


With a merchant which uses Bitpay i'm paying 0,36% above daily market value on average (the euro amount compared to the bitcoin amount + network fees converted using the daily average bitcoin price). I'm doing average transactions of 19 euro's, so that would make CC fees something like 2% or something (1.5% + 0.5%)?  Pretty competitive already. Although with bitcoin you would at least have 1% fee for buying. But all those are completely obliterated by the steady gains Bitcoin makes. Which makes buying things with bitcoin a no-brainer for me. 
Not actuarial but more anecdotal. The 0.36% calculations covers 14 transactions over the span of 6 months.

No that is wrong. Its the most valuable fork which defines what Bitcoin is. 
Imaging that all exchanges, all nodes, all payment processors, all wallets stay with Core. Now imaging 51% of mining power to create &gt;1mb blocks. 
This is an extreme and unlikely scenario. But really the only thing what would happen is that Bitcoin loses 51% of its hashing power. 
Miners do **NOT** have control over Bitcoin. They can choose to follow where the economic majority takes them, and they can choose to throw away all their hashing power.

Jtoomin / Gavin
Kinda hard to have missed that. Or do you only visit &gt; It's not the perfect size, most of the devs think that anything less than 4mb is probably okay. The tensions related to BIP202 are more about the fact that hard forks are dangerous and that 2mb is not that much of an increase (in terms of keeping up with Bitcoin's growth curve) than it is about the actual proposal itself having blocks which are too large to be safe.
Not doing an increase because it's not big enough. That's a good one.
And hardforks are hard if you never do them. Its really not rocket science. A simple increase would have been the perfect way to test the waters. 


That's three year old software. And who said we should have had 1mb blocks in 2012? 
Do you think the blocksize limit is the same as the actual blocksize? 




I meant it needs 100% participation if it wants to be 100% effective as a blocksize increase. So we saying the same here. I just don't think that can or will happen anytime soon. And most transactions are probably not at risk of getting ejected from the blocks anyway, so why would they upgrade? So this still screws over the little guy. And the whole reason to upgrade the limit in the first place was to make room for growth and maybe assume that small transactions can be important for Bitcoins future (maybe even build a market for use cases Lightning can take over).
And not upgrading does incur a security risk. Don't think you would disagree.  


I don't think CLTV coins are spendable by anyone on pre 0.11.2 software. Not all soft forks are created equal. 


Exactly! Its called an attack. A theoretical attack. If a hard fork is dangerous because of theoretical attacks, then a soft fork like SW is also dangerous if it allows for certain attacks on people who didn't upgrade. 


Good connectivity and smaller blocks doesn't seem like the same thing to me. And how can you ever take into account something that erratic? If the GF becomes twice as slow, do we also reduce the blocksize limit to 500Kb? 
If miners in china value their investment (and they do) they would be wise to use stratum (which they also already do). Or they promote/invest in things like thin blocks, IBLT and weak blocks. 


The dos protection was (probably) about preventing a single rogue miner to fuck up the system. One lone 1mb block would not have been such a big deal. And if you need to protect yourself against the majority of miners fucking things up then you have bigger problems already. 
If a certain size blocks are not good for the overal network then a majority of miners would not create those blocks. No hard limit needed.

What is the idea? If the idea is to do something as drastic as introduce a hard limit to do something it wasn't designed to do. To do something it has never done. Then by god give us that idea. Give us a design and a plan of what we are doing. You own up to the very thing you are steering us into. 
Whether it is a brick wall, or whether it is more subtle (does it matter?). It will have significant cost, and it will completely stop Bitcoin's growth. No clue how you could argue against that. 
Maybe you should read the OP. 
The small blockers (who want to keep the 1mb limit at this moment) are a minority within a minority. They say things like that we don't need an increase for **6 years**. They say things like that $10 dollar transactions are fine. We are pleasing them only because enough people wrongly believe that by default not changing something is always more conservative and safer then doing something. This is the ludicrous notion which allows us to be hijacked by a minority. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 20:59:14


That moment has come and gone already. We are running into the limit daily. The question is more when it is really going to hurt adoption. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:37:23


If there is a cost aspect to increasing the blocksize then at least have that debate. Larger blocks have been tested out extensively, there is no inherent reason why blocks need to be 1Mb. It would also be a huge coincidence that a blocksize limit (which wasn't designed to limit **actual** volume) to be the perfect size somehow. It just doesn't add up. 
We have been doing fine without a limit and suddenly we need one. And why on earth would miners create unsafe blocks to begin with?
Why are you defending an indefensible position which is only held by a minority within a minority? 


Of course it is. Did soft limits just suddenly vanished or something? 
Have you actually seen that miners still miner at 750K? Or am I seeing that wrong? 


Because they don't actually say when we can realistically expect an effective block-size increase. Mostly because they can't predict when miners are going to switch, nor when wallets are going to adapt SW, nor when users are going to start using this new type of transactions. 
Mark my words: 2016 will not see an effective increase to 2mb because of Segregated Witness. 
Although I'm cheating a bit because that would need 100% participation and that's not something that's ever going to happen. ;)


It does when it wants to be an effective blocksize increase. And it does when everyone wants to be 100% safe. 


That is hopelessly naive and would leave everyone open to attack. Full nodes can't be super important when arguing against a blocksize increase, and suddenly become irrelevant when you argue for SegWit. 
Doing a hardfork leaves people who didn't upgrade open to new attacks, although weird if anyone would still take the security of a fork without miners serious. 
Doing a softfork like SW leaves people who didn't upgrade open to new attacks. 


That all depends on what you are trying to do. For instance removing the blocksize limit doesn't **actually** do anything. It doesn't force anyone to create or accept bigger blocks on its own. It doesn't force a completely new, rushed and untested way of creating and validating transactions upon everyone. Not to mention that such a small and slow increase would still force an artificial market of fees upon everyone.
Bitcoin Core has been screwing over wallet dev's, payment processors and so many users that it is insane to expect people to cooperate and accept SW as some kind of solution for scalability. When in reality it adds (5-10%) overhead at the one place it matters most: block propagation. 
For instance if I ask for bigger blocks, is it appropriate to force me to create transactions which are spendable by anyone (with the old software)? 
The reality is that Bitcoin has still been effectively hijacked, you just have stockholm syndrome or something. Do you really want to align yourself with Luke/Peter/Greg? Do you want bitcoins growth get defined by the need to run full nodes on cheap raspberry pi's? Or do you want to limit growth to cater to full nodes within the Great Firewall of China (when stratum works perfectly fine already)? Do you want to limit Bitcoin's growth because of a limit which wasn't supposed to do anything close to what it does now? 
Do you want that? Or do you just feel like making excuses for other people?

Miners have always been responsible for what and how much to add to the blockchain. If you want to change that then argue that case. And also explain where that responsibility moves towards. 
And I do see that miners don't want that responsibility. You saying that as a miner isn't a surprising position. 
I think that it is actually Gavin and Mike who promoted setting sensible defaults. While core dev's just sets them without much though without realising miners won't change them.

Well that's an unexpected poetic response &lt;3
But although we have a trust-less decentralised currency, we still need to trust whoever wrote the code (or compiled the code). We should not beat around the bush and admit that trust is involved and needed. 
I think that the trust created by bitcoin itself can flow towards other actors. From mined blocks to miners, and from miners to whatever identities which are valuable for the Bitcoin economy. Like deterministic build servers, code reviewers, developer, etc. The entire software development process should be able to move towards a fully distributed model. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:25:58


Now you are simply lying. A huge majority (90%) of miners mine full blocks. And even after we lift the limit you would still see 750 blocks and empty blocks, which proofs that we don't actually need a hard limit. 


My personal experience of buying things regularly is mostly 2015. But there is enough information out there to know that fees per transaction have always been related to fees/volume, and still are. 


Price variance is one thing. Now fees are have variance related to transaction volume (from one block to the next). So with the price staying the same you still see variance. Needlessly so I think. 


Of course static fees where sub optimal, and dynamic fees are better. Just not for paying for an artificially scarce resource. One which clearly doesn't solve price fluctuations at the moment. 
The rising fees I see personally are also present when I [disregard the BTC price]( I can indeed see a drop in fees initially, but later I even went over that same limit. Fees should go down not up.  
There are two options 1) Without the block size limit fees would be the same 2) Without the block size limit fees would be lower (and more predictable). 
If its (1) then that proofs that the block size limit isn't needed. If its (2) then we are indeed incurring an artificial cost upon the network. 


Did you read the remark from the bread wallet dev? Dynamic fees were necessary because of the block size limit.  Would/should a dynamic limit be added regardless? Yes. 
But that's like saying its Ok to hold a gun to someones face and forcing him to do something, and then later saying its ok because he would have eventually done the same thing anyway. It doesn't remove the force part, nor the questionable ethics involved. 


Yes, that is possible. But lets plan for success though. Or lets just plan for anything, a plan is definitely better than no plan.  
I think keeping the 1mb out of fear (of decentralisation) is bad, and you could say increasing the limit out of fear (of throwing away important transactions) is also bad. But if we increase we would still have the fear and cost of decentralisation, and that would still bring down the average block size. Keeping the limit is a sure way of not having the ideal block size.  


I didn't say small blocks forever. They are talking about $10 transactions, 500Kb blocks now and no increase in 2016. That's not a mischaracterisation. And the problem is not exactly what they say, because they can and will change their pov anyway. Its the fact that a minority within a minority has control over when and if the block size limit is changed. So if i'm mischaracterizing that's because not all core dev's actually share that extremist view, but clearly that doesn't matter much. 


That's exactly how I feel. The market should decide. But that means Lightning should compete fair and square with the exiting Bitcoin Payment system. And personally I like federated side chains much better. Expanding the Bitcoin network instead of tacking a new network on top. Bitcoin already has a huge network effect, any new network has to climb an uphill battle. 
I would:
1. Add service discovery to bitcoin, so nodes can advertise certain services
1. Add a web of trust, so that trust flowing from miners/proof of stake can flow to untrusted parties (through liabilities, locking coins etc)
1. Add federated wallet service, so anyone can create multi-sig wallets with double spend protection 
1. Add co-pay protocol to wallet service, so you yourself can also use multiple devices/people to sign for transactions
1. Add side chains, so certain federated wallets can send coins off-chain
1. Add channels, so people can lock up coins before they are allowed to send anything 
Maybe I should read the Lightning Paper, because maybe these things are actually included...
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:10:40
By who? I haven't seen community wide consensus.

You can't mention payment channels as if they already exist, or as if they were always part of the "plan". At least say something like:
"This is what payment channels (such as Lightning) are [going to be used] for."
You are being a tad dishonest here. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:32:34
Because a block size increase should be implemented ASAP to be activated in Q1. And SW should take at least 6 months. 
If the big opponents of bigger blocks suddenly have no problem with bigger blocks via the creative accounting trick of SW, they really should not have a problem with a simple block size increase. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:32:14
I should have added the words "quickly enough" I guess. This software needs to be written in core, it needs to be added in enough wallets. This is not something which can alleviate the current pain we experience of the block size limit.  
Although, maybe this makes people more comfortable with the idea of an increase. Which can help to fix this problem short term. 
You have something to add?
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:37:52


"Bitcoin Core" is just a name. Any new version still needs to be adopted. And you are not allowed to promote client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus.
Just fucking add Bitcoin Core to the rules. Don't keep weaselling yourself into stupid inconsistent arguments and just say it. 


Because code complexity and its implications can be gauged by looking at the number of lines. 
Start being honest instead of twisting everything to fit your narrative. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:01:03


Because if a fix (which doesn't solve the propagation issue) is suddenly ok with Gregory/Peter/Luke-Jr then there is definitely something fishy going on. 
Also its bad design. If you build something it should just do one thing. Just like you shouldn't add unrelated riders to legislative bill's. 


More tx throughput is a side effect, it was definitely not the goal of SW. 


It should NOT be advocated as a way to allow more tx throughput, because that might make it seem that we are done. Raising the block size limit is way too important to just let it ride along with an unrelated change. They both have different needs in terms of timing. Conflating them is really stupid. 


We have been beaten so senseless with small block propaganda that we are happy with an increase to 2mb. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:53:14
Can you tell me why miners would say BIP101 is too fast when it doesn't force anyone to mine that big blocks? It sounds really counter intuitive that miners would give up their freedom to mine bigger blocks. 
Clearly all miners are very conservative and risk averse. Which means that they should not need a blocksize limit at all(!)
What are your thoughts?

The people who said the scalability conference was going not going to lead to any concrete scalability solutions. 
The point of the OP was "will this establish a truce?". So if you point to a list of core dev's who were probably already on that side of the divide then that clearly doesn't really help with a truce. 
Although maybe there are people on that list who were pro block-size increase through a hard fork, and now they are pro SW. Would be interesting. 
Seems like that list was designed towards people who believe doing an appeal from authority is sensible.

Segregated Witness is no scalability solution and it should not have been presented as such. It does some creative accounting to increase the blocksize limit. But such an increase should not have been a side goal. It's not good software design to conflate two unrelated issues. The discount SW gives to witness data should be carefully considered, and should not be distracted by having another goal in mind. 
 
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:25:46


So SW conveniently **chooses** not to count witness data towards the blocksize limit and suddenly it is a real scaling solution? That's just creative bookkeeping :X. 
And no one said BIP101 is the ultimate and final scaling solution. Even Gavin admitted that it simply kicks the can down the road. Just like SW does (regarding the blocksize at least).
SW is a mealiabilty fix presented as a scalability fix. 
Disclaimer: SW does help nodes with limited hardware do away with witness data altogether. But then those nodes don't contribute to the security of Bitcoin anymore. Although it was always debatable if losing some amateur nodes was really an issue.

Segregated Witness doesn't just need to be implemented, tested, deployed and activated. It also needs to be implemented and deployed by wallets, exchanges, payment processors, merchants and services. **And** SW transactions need to get used sufficiently to get an effective increase. A "small" detail missing in the roadmap. 
Best case scenario is we have an effective increase in 5 months? 
@_date: 2015-12-26 15:00:00
Well paying more does work if a lot of transactions would simply stop trying to get on the block chain and aren't vital for bitcoins (future) value.
If everyone is willing to fight to stay on the block chain then fees will rise very fast. 
I would think that not knowing what would happen is enough to want to be conservative and therefor raise the limit. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:31:04

Well, if you do baby steps and let bitcoin evolve then you don't need to start from scratch and fight an huge uphill battle to get "popular". 
Like add things in this order:
1. Add service discovery 
1. Add trust model(s) / calculations for nodes 
1. Create simple escrow service 
1. Create simple coin join service
1. Create green wallet service
1. Create payment hub service (lightning)
1. Create side channel functionary service
This model of adding modules (which are not specifically build for a certain purpose) is should be better than tacking an entirely new network on top of Bitcoin (like Lightning). If a plugin has more uses then its more likely to get adopted. Although you could argue that Lightning is better at supporting services with micro payments. On the other hand, trusted/invested services might not feel the need to be supported.
The point is that federated wallets should be much simpler than Lightning, so it would make sense if we get those first. And if not, why not?

So if a bug creates two separate forks, neither is Bitcoin and both are alt-coins? 


It does make you wrong. Because if you step into a store which accepts Bitcoin and you try to pay with something which isn't considered Bitcoin then you fail. Because you are wrong. 


There are problems in Bitcoins architecture and code which make merging harder than it needs to. This needs to be addressed. It needs some cleanup. 


If nodes do not accept blocks from miners then the blocks generated by miners are worthless. For any hardfork nodes need to be ready before miners switch and activate a fork. 
Bitcoin is whatever is accepted as Bitcoin by a majority of users (exchanges/merchants/users). That's the ultimate form of consensus. That's the bare reality. 
So miners are the last to upgrade, but that's not really a definitive vote. Everyone signalling that they are ready for a certain hardfork is a vote, weighted by their importance within the Bitcoin economy.

Its not about discussing, its about you doing a bit more research. I'm still taking my time to answer and point you in the right direction. 


So both forks should be abandoned and bitcoin left as dead? 
A fork is literally a fork. For instance all 64 bit computers can be on one fork, and all 32 bit computers on the other. Or all Linux machines on one, and windows machines on the other. Which one is correct?
What about if a bugfix creates a hardfork. Is the fork with the fix the correct one, or the one with the big gaping security hole? 
What if there is a new feature which everyone loves, even you. Would you reject it just because it needs a hard fork? 


I know, and thats is bad/sad. But I prefer bitcoin unlimited anyway. 


I don't know this Richie Rich person, maybe he has good intentions. Were are the newly minted coins going towards? ;)
No just kidding. If Bitcoin gets hijacked and turned into something bad then I would not want to call it Bitcoin. I'd probably add some bad adjectives to describe it. 
I'm just saying that if Bitcoin changes for the better because of a hard fork, even you would be on board. The consensus protocol doesn't need to be completely fixed.

The graph is daily transactions vs daily transaction fees in dollars divided by the number of transactions (from blockchain.info). 
I made the graph expecting something else. Some evidence of hitting the block size limit, but I don't really see that. If you really hit the limit you would expect transaction volume to stay the same while cost per transaction rises. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:15:50

And who made anyone king of Bitcoin to force through a blocksize limit and decide for everyone that we need to increase fees now. Not in a year, not in two years but now. There has been absolutely **no** fucking debate about when to introduce an artificial market for fees. Worse yet, there hasn't even been a debate whether we should do that at all (although i think we should do that one day). And even worse is that there hasn't been any debate or design about **HOW** to introduce a fee market. As if a hard limit would be the best way to go about doing that.
The cognitive dissonance is so huge with you people that it boggles my mind. Keeping the 1mb block-size limit is an indefensible position however way you cut it. 
It would be an insanely big coincidence that 1mb is somehow the perfect size at this moment. A limit which was clearly not designed to do what it doing right now to a small extend and within a few weeks/months to a huge extend.

When the friends are miners then no, but the discount would be perfectly valid for a group of 8. The discount would even be bigger if those 2 friends leave and go eat at an other restaurant (altcoin). 
When the friends are developers then I think the project defines consensus rules and should or shouldn't allow a minority vote to stop certain edits. That's just policy, they can do whatever they feel like. 
When this project is leader in terms of the Bitcoin protocol, because the Foundation collapsed, by force of censorship, character attacks, by being well funded. Then it's an entirely different matter. 
The process for core dev consensus, and the process for protocol consensus are conflated. Not by choice btw, hard to really blame someone for it. 
So now you have a Blockstream CTO who acts like the Bitcoin CTO (and is allowed to). But he talks way to much up his own alley to be trusted. I would start to trust him if he advocates things which do not benefit Lightning. Gavin in that sense is WAY better. Just too bad people felt the need to discredit him so much. 


I just looked at max block size to conclude that they turned it off. 


I don't think we should model or design Bitcoin based on the need for amateurs to run Bitcoin without cost. It is a ridiculous notion. But still one which resonates with people who have a strong desire to be important to Bitcoin. One which makes even more sense if you consider that a lot of people can't contribute by mining, running a node is all what they have left. So I understand, but I don't think that anything of value will be lost of a few amateurs are unable to continue running Bitcoin full nodes (although arguably they can still throttle how much they contribute). 
So again, I understand but I sincerely disagree. 
The cost of bandwidth (and storage) is dwarfed by the profits from mining and the profit of doing business in the Bitcoin economy. There is not really a debate whether or not professional nodes can cover the cost of running nodes, or is there? 


We don't need to model that cost. You let the market "model" that cost. 


Any significant increase is a good test whether existing market forces already keep the block size down. Although I personally think that the limit has been a lot bigger than actual volume long enough that we have enough data to substantiate that claim already. Even the blocks now which are not full collaborate that story. 


Me too. But I believe miners are risk averse and miner consensus would follow actual consensus. The activation code in BIP101 shouldn't create two bitcoin forks. Even without activation code there should not be a significant fork, because no miner would create a &gt;1mb block if that is guaranteed to get rejected / orphaned (or a block for which he can't get paid). 
I simply don't subscribe to the idea that Bitcoin needs a centralised controlled hard block size limit (to limit block sizes). If the block size induces extra cost, then that should limit its size already. And even if you want a centralised controlled limit at least make it a flex-cap. 
On principle alone I reject BIP000 because if there is anything that doesn't have consensus its that.

No they are not. Putting data in bitcoin is very valuable to businesses. They won't care if it gets a little bit more expensive. 
And you only need one OP_RETURN to store everything you need. 


They were able to put data in the blockchain anyway. Now at least its structured and visible. That change was in no way a sign that it is somehow allowed. Although I think that allowing or disallowing anything in a decentralised system is very weird. Weren't we "anti-censorship"? 
If you think blocks are only big because of spam, then you might be sorely mistaken. The fact that transactions don't pay a lot doesn't mean they are spam, nor unwilling to pay more. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:23:44
SW and BIP101 aren't in the same ballpark. One is an optimisation (not a solution for scaling) and the other is a solution to scaling (albeit not the ultimate solution).
We are so happy to have Luke/Gregory/Peter on board with an increase that we don't realise that we have been trying to please their personal beliefs about what's best for Bitcoin. When in reality **everyone** wanted an increase. Its like being in an abusive relationship. 
SW is not a solution just like Lightning isn't a solution because its simply not there. BIP101 is. Actually any simple block size limit increase is a better solution. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:07:54


Well I can for arguments sake to show that your remark doesn't hold water:


This would apply to accidental forks, emergency bugfix forks, non contentious forks and contentious forks. 
You are using a lot of misdirection to make your comments seem correct at face value, but not in the context. You talk a bit like nullc, in a good and bad way. And not actually answering questions I asked. 
So again: is a non contentious hard-fork also an altcoin? 


Who cares? BIP101 doesn't force anyone to create bigger blocks. It doesn't need to take full responsibility for everything and anything for so many years in the future. 


Stop with the altcoin bullshit. If bitcoin has &gt;1mb blocks then core doesn't suddenly stop developing. 


XT doesn't diverge so much from core that that is a big issue. If the longest chain has &gt;1mb blocks that guarantees continueed development. 
BIP101 can not and will not activate without overwhelming consensus. Don't pretend that somehow two viable chains are going to remain which need independent development. Its not realistic. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:46:40
A large majority was and always have been in favour of increasing the blocksize. There are only a few blocksize extremists amongst us which are somehow allowed to stonewall and thereby divide this entire community. 


What difference makes going from 0 to 1Mb compared to going from 1Mb to 2Mb?  We have years and years of data from growing block's. 
You missed an important extra advantage: Actually getting experience with a planned hard fork. Although clearly we should have planned this years ago. Even if it was just increasing it to 1.1Mb. The experience alone would have been invaluable. 
"Lets wait as long as possible so a hard fork is even harder". And then lets pretend that that is safer and more conservative. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:12:55
The reality is that [these]( are the fees I paid this year. Although I'm pretty sure fees would have gone up without the blocksize limit. Not sure if it would have been this high and this erratic though. 
I'm not doing the whole blocksize debate here. Lets just say that a blocksize hard limit would never have been introduced (or lowered to 1mb) if there was none (or if it was much higher). 
Read my comment history. I'm not some screaming extremist. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:02:07


Oh are we going to do an appeal to authority? 
Because you seem to be susceptible to authority I will gladly tell you that Bitcoin isn't based on adam's POW algorithm, it uses that POW algorithm. It could have been anything really. 
And you value the opinion of someone who joined Bitcoin late 2013 (after the big bubble) over Gavin? Of all people those two cannot be further apart in terms of authority within the Bitcoin space. 


Maybe some actual data on that would be nice. Now it just sounds like FUD. 
Pretty effective actually, because it has completely turned people around and against hard forks, BIP101 and Gavin himself even. Maybe you should read [this]( post and see how we as a community felt about doing a hard fork. 


Increasing the blocksize should not be controversial at all. There is literally no-one who wants to keep the 1mb limit forever. This is only about when and how. 
If you feel this need to please literally everyone with every change which needs a hard fork you essentially stalled development. You gave everyone a veto. 
And if we do a softfork then suddenly everything and anything can get pushed through? No need for consensus really. And lets pretend soft forks are only roses and sunshine. Lets pretend that the risk of the Segregated Witness soft-fork is so much better than a simple hardfork like raising the blocksize limit. 
And whats even easier is keeping a feature which was intended to do something entirely different and turning it into something else. That surely doesn't need consensus (or a proper software design). 
Because keeping the blocksize limit, although that even prevents the need for a hard fork, isn't dangerous at all? Its not like destroying the community is of any consequence. Again, read the article and think about what really got us to this place.

@_date: 2015-12-12 23:19:17


Average block size seems to indicate that there is more than enough room to spare. Is it possible that there are other forces which keep certain transactions out of the blocks (and increase fees?). 


Doesn't that depend entirely on your policy? If you don't say what policy you run then that value is meaningless.

New question for the FAQ:
**"When will SW effectively increase the limit to 2mb?"**
It seems like this is entirely dependent on testing, activation and when wallets and people actually start using SW transactions. Has there been any communication with wallet developers about how long this could take? 
@_date: 2015-12-26 15:53:01


I don't. I think we should have an honest discussion about the cost of not raising the hard limit. Even if 99% of transactions are spam but that enables people to rise from poverty, then I would definitely say its worth it. Those are things to strive for. And maybe even at the cost of some decentralisation.

There used to be a lot more individual miners. We have had DDOS attacks. And we have had flooded mempools. But I would need to dive into that more to be sure. 
And it is possible that we are going to lose a more amateur nodes before we gain enough professional nodes to offset that loss. We will see a shift to more professional nodes. But it is also possible that things like Lightning provide enough monetisation to run full nodes by anyone (although that would still make it a professional node in my book).  
I still see people talking about buying raspberry pi's to run as nodes. That is not really a recipe for success. No clue why we should want to keep those around.

**Will this prevent synchronising/sending blocks prior to mining or make it much harder?** 
@_date: 2015-06-09 09:15:05
The best solution: 1) put in a 20Mb hard limit which comes in effect in 6 months. 2) Make a soft limit of 1 Mb the default. 3) Begin writing code so that hitting the soft/hard limit doesn't crash any client. 4) Make sure clients can actually increase transaction fees if there is congestion on the network. 
This means that in normal circumstances nothing would change. But if the shit hits the fan then miners can increase the soft limit. :D

And SW is going to take a long long time. It needs to be developed, tested, released, get a majority of miners AND then finally it will take time for users to actually start using it. 
And the last one is a big one, because if the network switches back for whatever reason then all SW coins are spendable by anyone. 
Much more simple changes to bitcoin have taken years to mature. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:02:16
You do realise that if the economic majority doesn't accept bigger blocks then miners who switch are simply throwing away money. Because of those incentives 75% of miners switching and activating a fork should actually represent the economic vote. 
Maybe you should read what I said on github [here]( Because that was mostly a response to you actually. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 08:50:15
Well its very aggressive for those moments where we are already hitting the limit. There is such at thing as peak load ;)
@_date: 2015-12-03 07:22:51
If big blocks are bad for everyone as a whole. Then the majority can orphan bigger blocks. That's what i'm saying. 
And even the smallest of miners would be able to orphan bigger blocks. His chance of doing so is just very small. 
But I don't think its really about the little guy. When we are dealing with the great firewall of China you would have two big groups of miners causing each other pain by creating more orphans. This should be enough incentive to make blocks smaller, or create more efficient block sync algorithms. 
Miners would care less about the little guy. Although even if the perceived value loss is big enough then bigger miners would still take note. 


Seems to me that you only need the hash and pow to build on top of a new block (with reasonable assumption that you are not mining on top of garbage). That would reduce block size related latency to zero. 
You keep talking about bandwidth, but its about latency. Miners would adopt a new block synchronisation/validation algorithm if that causes more bandwidth but reduces latency. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:15:20
Before hong kong most miners voted for an increase. There has always been a small minority within a minority which didn't want to upgrade. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:36:39
Hasn't this whole selfish mining thing been debunked already? Miners wouldn't shit where they eat, and miners mining on top of not yet downloaded/validated blocks makes propagation times already irrelevant. 
Whether we have a real or imaginary problem is something we can find out in reality. It might hurt a little. But there is 5 billion dollars worth of incentive to keep Bitcoin rolling. Maybe it needs to hurt a little before more efficient block propagation software arises.

The biggest criticism is that it is being pushed as the only block-size increase. So SW itself isn't contentious at all. Conflating it with a blocksize increase is. And turning it into a soft fork and not a hard fork is. 
Preventing SW from getting adopted gives more leverage to get an actual blocksize increase implemented. 
~~The reason BIP101 was contentious and deemed dangerous is because it could create two forks. Guess what SW can do?~~ [Edit: I think i'm wrong here. I should eat my own words. ]


Yes, because we should not increase the blocksize limit because we might lose fully validating nodes. And now its fine when all node stop validating fully?


No but it would accept a transactions which spends a anyone-can-spend transactions without the witness data. Any miner with a little bit of hashing power can create a block which even dupes you into believing you have one confirmation. And a majority of miners can even fake as many confirmations as they want on SW transactions. But that's more a "it can happen therefor it will" argument which small blockers always make (like when arguing that a majority of miners could create huge blocks).

Just like nothing in Bitcoin is completely safe. Any confirmed transaction can be double spend. Its simply not reasonable to assume that will actually happen. Same goes for 0-conf, just at a different level. 
If you can make assumptions that a block doesn't get orphaned, then you can also make assumptions whether a transaction will get added to a block.

Would normal bitcoin transactions get upgraded to Lightning transactions automatically? If the funds you want to spend fit into the locked funds of you and the person you want to transact with. Seems like a usability nightmare. The concept of having funds in a wallet seems more intuitive and easy than when you need to lock up funds. 
Although you can simply call a locked channel a wallet and be done with it. Maybe even create federated hubs to lower the chance that a hub will close down on you. 
But in reality people will simply used centralised services because you don't have to trust them anyway. :O

The slippery slope is exactly what you describe. If they can do X they can do Y. 
For me this is not evident at all. But I have a completely different view on both the block-size limit and the 21m limit. Just because you see them as equally fundamental doesn't mean that they are. 


Notice the part where it says "without any argument". 
If Bitcoin needs some centralised guardian angels who censor, DDOS nodes, and demonise their opponents to protect Bitcoin then isn't all already lost? Who would want such fragile thing anyway? 
In reality these guardian angels are doing way more damage than good. They should really get some perspective on things asap.

No definitely not, SW should be a hard fork. We should not be so proud of working around the contrived idea that hard forks are almost impossible. Its still technically briljant and smart, but still weak on a higher level. 


Not much higher tps and with a long roadmap. And the other advantages you would also get with a hard fork. 
This doesn't even help Luke-jr himself to run a full node. Not in the slightest. 


I have talked a lot with Luke-jr. And I actually have a lot of respect for him. He is very honest and I get where he is coming from. I understand all his arguments, and I disagree with him. To a point, because I too don't think we can create bigger blocks indefinitely. But we can make them a lot bigger now, and we can at least follow Moore and Nielsen. 


The 1mb is completely arbitrary. That number is random. There should be absolutely no reason for Core to stall exactly at that point. There is simply no way that makes any sense.  And 2Mb is already a huge compromis. 


If you believe that then you misrepresent a lot of people. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:07:58
Create market for fee by running into a brick wall, or carefully design one? 
If the idea is to create a market for fees, would you add a hard limit to do so? Would you even need to do anything to introduce one? With orphan risks, and with off chain solutions which are around the corner. 
Not running into the limit now seems like a good plan actually. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:42:06

If one side of your argument is theoretical doesn't mean you forgo any sense of reality for the other side which isn't merely theoretical. 
I really hope that I don't have to lock up coins for Lightning with just one random untrusted entity. If that concern can be tackled, then great! If I can lock up coins with multiple nodes, so no single node disappearing affects my channel then I would happily lock up all my coins. We should just call it a Lightning wallet (easier to understand for most people), and this wallet should also be able to create normal transactions in the beginning. :D

The adoption model and the development model are two different things. But building things incrementally and from the bottom up by making it easier for existing wallets to integrate new things. With Lightning you can't just install something extra and expect your existing wallet to suddenly have Lightning capabilities. Its also weird if a wallet is connected to nodes and then it needs to connect to completely different nodes to enable Lightning transactions. And who is going to decide what coins to lock up and with whom? 
I like evolution more than this revolution we are seemingly having. Core is disenfranchising a lot of developers mostly in the wallet/payment sphere. I don't see myself using Lighting if its some new App, and I don't see wallet developers integrating Lighting any time soon. 
Lets see what Gavin has up his sleeve. :O

Why would anyone remove signatures and not move them outside? I read the Lighting paper and it really seems to do that. Maybe I was reading that into it. It's just too obvious to do it like that. I actually never understood why the signatures where there in the first place. 
I will also concede this point. I was wrong twice.

Lets just answer my own question here. If any miners remain on the old chain they will create invalid blocks but not create a fork because they would still mine on top of the longest chain. 
I was being stupid. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:37:59
IBLT is much smarter than thin blocks because it lets you reconstruct missing transactions without doing any round trips. It's a very smart system. It should definitely be mentioned.

XT is defined as Core + a set of patches. So based on that I guess XT should add everything. I don't see an objection (yet) to anything Core has produced. Would be nice if Core added at least some code from BIP101 to make it easier to merge. Although I don't think XT is going to win over any significant number of miners anytime soon. Miners are simply too risk averse to do that. 
So SW seems like a real improvement, but I will reserve judgement when its actually finished. And I would definitely not consider the number of lines to be an indication of complexity and possible consequence.
It would be best to argue for a one time increase to 3Mb (activated as version 5, and at first soft limits should stay at 1Mb and &gt;2Mb blocks should get orphaned). If we can rally everyone behind that (or anything similar) we might actually have some kind of chance to get that implemented in Q1 2016.

I believe transactions are a little bit bigger, splitting the data into two places adds some overhead (and some backwards compatibility cruft because its a soft fork instead of a hard fork).
Not counting the witness data part of transactions towards the blocksize limit **is** a discount. On top of that SW can give a discount on transaction fees when witness data is segregated. What I'm saying is that the discount % should be carefully chosen to have the correct incentives. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:08:02
They soft fork? You make it sound like a simple decision. In reality its developing, testing, deploying, activating (getting enough miner support). Then it also needs to actually get implemented, tested and used by wallets. And then it needs to get adopted by actual users.
And it needs 100% adoption of all users, as in ALL transactions need to be SW transactions to have an effective 2Mb limit.

Read what I said again. 


I can agree with you there. Proofs that we should not do appeals to authorities then. 


Wow, that is a really beautiful example. I think that actually cuts to the core of it. I also really actually use Bitcoin as a payment system. That really changes your perspective on Bitcoin a lot. And it is kinda magical. 
I'm also a little involved in other payment systems like PIN and CHIP, for public transport and small systems for private companies. The trust involved is insane. It is basically security through obscurity all the way. Bitcoin is kinda magical in that sense. 
And most core dev's might see Bitcoin more as a settlement layer. But disregarding people like they are doing now is just plain wrong. It's really not ethical.
Imaging two people looking at an abstract picture, one sees a building, the other a person. One thinks the other is an idiot for seeing a person, and the other is open to the others view. Who's the asshole here? 


That's pretty much the opposite of data and a perfect example of FUD. 


So I just say I don't subscribe to that notion that such a thing is at all likely to happen. It always seems like (small) blockers always disregard incentives. Probably also the case here. 


We can all reject reality all we want. But a majority of miners want an increase to at least 2Mb now. And you can only do that with a hard fork now. Even core wants to eventually do a hard fork. The only thing we don't agree on is when. 


If no other blocksize increase is going to be created then BIP101 still has a big chance of gaining traction. And if XT has failed, why does it still enjoy DDOS attacks? 


Strawman argument there. XT doesn't create gigablocks, it allows gigabyte blocks in what 20 years? I also don't subscribe to the idea that if miners can make huge blocks that they automatically will. Someone should really explain how those incentives work. 


Has Bitcoin already become a religion? What does pleasing every single bitcoin user have anything to do with the 21m limit? 


Depending on the (economic) impact that too should be designed and agreed upon. For instance if something can be exploited there needs to be a discussion about it. 


Action and reaction. Maybe maybe something else happened before that. I will leave that as a homework assignment ;)


I dont particularly care about XT. And BIP101 is definitely not dead. And it doesn't need to be adopted to have served a purpose. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 09:56:52
I like the idea that if a miner wants to mine blocks bigger than is deemed healthy (I would follow BIP101 sizes) that he needs to lock up part of his block reward for an X number of years. So for a block which is 20% larger you need to lock up 20% of your reward. So if you want a flex cap that might be a nicer way to do it. 
Although I personally think that bigger block already incurs enough cost upon the network (network/storage/orphans/devaluation because of centralisation) that no hardcap or flexcap is needed at all.  Removing the limit would accelerate growth and increase the demand for a propagation network.

@_date: 2015-12-29 22:34:52
You know what you are partially correct. Things can change which leads us to a need to limit block-size. Satoshi envisioned that all nodes would be miners, and that nodes could move towards data centers. But things do change. 
The question is that if you at one point notice that we need to limit the block-size. Wouldn't you do research about the best way to do that? 
It could be that a hard limit is the best way to do it, and even that 1mb is the correct value. But I've never seen anyone make that argument. Doesn't that strike you as weird?

The irony is that we need a blocksize limit because miners can't be trusted, because of (accidental) selfish mining. So soft limits alone are not enough. 
But on the other hand we see miners giving control to Core. Doesn't that by itself proof we can trust miners? 
And if core dev's like soft changes so much, then why not soft limits?
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:17:52


That miners set sane soft/orphan limits. 


A simple orphan limit should do the trick.

@_date: 2015-12-13 10:53:22
What? Pretty much everyone mines empty blocks. And chinese miners actually mine bigger blocks on average (which determines total orphan risk). 
Mining empty blocks still secures the network. So why is it so wrong to do so? I don't see the problem.

Would be nice if RBF had some flavours/settings to announce what kind of changes are allowed in a transaction. This all or nothing thing might be good because RBF is less invasive now (no hard fork needed). Stagnation vs Conservatism.

Putting code into production ahead of any schedule isn't testing. That's just throwing it out there. Has anyone tried to break / exploit it? Has any majority of miners ever run the software? How does this affect optimisations to send/synchronize blocks prior to mining?
And sadly it's hard to test BIP101 on testnet if people are actively trying to prevent that from happening. Although having a mining war on a hard fork is also interesting. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:16:20
If you would do something similar like SW when designing the system it becomes totally bland. It only becomes interesting if you incorporate it as a soft fork in the current design. 
It is special because it is working around artificial limitations: the block size limit, fear of hardworking and signatures which should not have been inside of the transaction in the first place. 


It is and it isn't. The protocol still needs to change, code needs to be written. Certainly not something which should be added on a whim. At least payment processors, wallet dev's should be on board. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:33:36
The number of full nodes the market is comfortable with (or the lack thereof) might not be the same as what you individually are comfortable with. There is also the question whether a more successful bitcoin wouldn't attract more professional nodes.

That's a false dilemma. The fees I pay are not equal to my valuation of Bitcoin.

I don't follow your logic, but tell me where you disagree with mine:

1. If some transactions never confirm then fees only determine who never gets confirmed
1. So pay more and kick someone else out

I would find it very interesting to see what happens below the default min relay tx fee. Whether transactions fall of for other nodes should not matter when representing your overcomplete mempool. If you show these transactions as belonging to a certain category anyone can conclude that they are probably gone from most nodes.
Better yet would be to simply log when a transaction is added the the mempool and when it is added to a block. That way you can reconstruct what the mempool would have looked like at any moment.

The question is: Is bitcoin more valuable when any business can jump in without a lot of up front cost? I think that's a very valuable property of Bitcoin which it should retain. I would wager that the market would agree. 
So you don't need to indicate anything to anyone because the question is already answered before you asked. 


Don't they get different chains from different nodes? Seems like the whole reason they shut down is because they detect a conflict between nodes. And if both chains are different but still contain confirmations on the transaction you received, then what is the problem exactly? Maybe there is a limitation to the current SPV implementation? 


We have Gavin, he is really a very good guy to lead Bitcoin. Too bad people thought it necessary to piss on him.

Squeezing out competitors and centralising devalues Bitcoin. That is shitting where you eat.

And I don't see anyone call internal Coinbase/ChangeTip as payment channels. Not decentralised means it's not (yet) a payment channel. Or at least that should be the going definition within cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:10:13
Consensus already is whatever client everyone runs. That's just the reality. From Bitcoins perspective everything is fine. It's us humans who feel like we don't have any control and feel the need to make ourselves heard to somehow push Bitcoin in a direction. 
The cost of keeping the block size limit is simply not high enough to force people to gravitate towards one solution (or there simply isn't a solution good enough to stick out). 
Although I must say that censorship can remove the sense of urgency regarding the block size. But I don't see a lot of block size related problems in other bitcoin forums, so I guess we are still good. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 13:27:26
Ok, a government seizes 51% of mining power. They can mine and earn a profit. Or they destroy the very thing they seized by using it to execute a 51% attack. And what are they exactly going to do? Double spends? Only mine empty blocks? And how long do you think it will take for new miners to come online to prevent this attack? 
Its so much more easy to make Bitcoin illegal with a law and shut down exchanges than it is to go after miners. Its just not realistic. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:30:35
Paying attention in the sense that they distrust them, then yes. Or paying attention to mining pools who want to keep 1mb blocks just so they don't have to upgrade their network connection?

What is your point? F2Pool and Ant pool's average block size are the highest of all miners. And Antpool mined a full block right after.
Just pick and choose 2 blocks which fit your narrative. You have no clue what you are talking about.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:29:19
Whether you can run a node which doesn't validate signatures and whether the network can handle bigger blocks are two entirely separate issues. I wasn't talking about the former, my apologies if that wasn't clear. 
The security of the network is important. That means miners are important, to a lesser extend full nodes and to no extent partially validating nodes. I also think nodes are a non issue because a more successful Bitcoin would have more total nodes not less. And we should not cater to the node specs of the lowest common denominator. That would be a costly mistake. 
So SW isn't a scaling solution where it matters. I don't think that is debatable. Although stating that fact is certainly downvotable. Typical again. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 11:47:56
I still think we should get rid of the blocksize limit entirely. There is no reason and no consensus to start using it to force miners to limit actual transactions volume.  This remains true now just as much as it did years ago. 
I feel very conflicted about calling SW a success. When it effectively caves into so many demands of the hijackers. Or better said that it works around certain contrived mental hangups and trust issues of a minority within a minority of core dev's.  


Lets make that years not months. 
And it's hard to make a decision how to introduce a hard limit to do something completely new. Because we were truing to appease our hijackers. We couldn't decide on anything because in reality there was nothing to choose. (not being allowed to discuss also didn't really help). 
Fact remains that without the blocksize hard limit (or a much higher one) we would NEVER ever introduce one now. Raising or removing it is still the conservative thing to do. 
We should applaud Pieter for his work on SW because of its own merits alone. We should not celebrate it for its block-size increase. SW can stand on its own. 
Thanks Pieter! 
@_date: 2015-12-06 19:53:05
I like BIP101, I think its still way to conservative (a hard limit should get out of the way). But sadly it has been vilified to death already. Its WAY more likely that a simple one time increase will be added more than anything else.

@_date: 2015-12-27 20:19:02
1) Well the problem is that BIP101 doesn't attempt to alter the protocol without overwhelming consensus. 
Because if you take incentives into account then miners would actually be the last to upgrade, making 75% of miners represent an overwhelming consensus. 
2) Also that statement is very dangerous because it means that any controversial issue which needs a fork can **never** get addresses.
Its a stupidly broad statement which would cover a lot of changes which core wants to implement. 
Although its possible that means consensus among core developers. But that would admit that development is hopelessly centralised. Which is their prerogative but still very ironic. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:22:55

@_date: 2015-12-09 22:19:10
Sorry but that's just rubbish. SW just happens to increase the number of transactions because it chooses not to count signatures for the block size calculation. 
Its like you see the magic trick, you know how it works, but you still think its actually magic. 
SW is a increases the effective block size limit because of some creative accounting. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:29:38
Isn't that the same problem as we have with SW? That too adds more data to blocks. 
Segregating Transactions doesn't need to add such an overhead if you just make sure you don't do it when it doesn't help so much. And you should not duplicate all segregated transactions, just the ones which are compressed. 
This is definitely not my worst idea ever ;)

We are talking about stupid hypotheticals which got us into this mess in the first place. 
A blocksize limit hard fork should have been implemented years ago. There would be no significant number of miners on the old chain to get it to adjust **ever**.

Although i want an increase, on principle I would not want to slip it in like that. 


Yes its the when part. 


I [found it](  It was you.

Your actions and the things you say make perfect sense with good intentions in mind, so I have no reason to suspect foul play. I even defend you / core dev's on issues when needed.

1. 6-9 months seems hopelessly optimistic for SW to actually effectively increase the block-size limit, as it needs 100% participation to do so. Not to mention that forcing people into a certain solution is a dickhead move. 
1. 6-9 months actually seems doable for a hard fork if we plan it now
1. Rushing SW as a soft-fork is definitely safe right. Its not like if witness validation fails and all miners choke that we would have a problem.

Obviously not. SW isn't implemented, not tested, not deployed, not activated and it will take a long time before anyone is going to make SW transactions (which are spendable by anyone when SW gets reverted).

Does it need to be that complex? If you have some reddit/github/bct usernames you have a nice start, and from there people can vote and vouch for each other. 
If you divide getting consensus up in separate steps it becomes way more easy
1. Get consensus on how to find consensus (this method?)
1. Get consensus on who is important enough to be part of the consensus
1. Get consensus
If you have some group you can give them questionnaires to find hangups, and whip up votes.

I was personally thinking that the way fees could suddenly rise if transactions are more willing to upgrade their fees than get kicked out of the blockchain forever. And because we can't look inside people's head it would be best to look at transaction volume. 
Someone sending $100 would be more willing to pay a higher fee than someone paying $1. 
Historically bitcoin transactions paid something like 0.008% fees per transaction. But what if we assume everyone is at least willing to pay 0.1% fees? Lets assume that they give up before paying more than that. 
This would mean that fees are defined by the cutoff point (where transactions fall off/give up). 
So grab all blocks, sort by transaction volume (a little guesswork) and look at what fees would at 500Kb/600Kb/700Kb/800Kb/900Kb. That would represent what it's like when transaction volume increases.

This is by far the most stupid post on If you think keeping the blocksize limit in place is such a smart move. Then why not promote lowering it?

I wanted to add that I believe consensus is something you recognize when you see it. Its leadership and people who follow. So this definitely applies to Core. They are doing a tremendous job. 
But a new leader can step forward, and people can start to gravitate towards a new fork. 
There is nothing inherently wrong with both options. And given how much leadership Core has shown in resolving issues. It's still likely that they will also provide a solution to the blocksize limit which attains overwhelming consensus. Whatever that solutions might be.

Until Bitcoin's value suffers from the blocksize limit then you are indeed correct. So until people start complaining about unconfirmed transactions and/or too high fees then there is no problem with the blocksize limit. 
What is more true for you 1) That you know actual transaction volume which is not spam (not valuable for bitcoin's value). 2) That you want to know actual transaction volume by really running into limit. 
I'm personally more in the "fake it till you make it"-camp. And that its better to run into the limit when we actually have alternatives then at this moment.

We humans like to feel in control. But when it comes to Bitcoin I think that just an illusion. Holding the hand of a freight train to protect it when crossing. 
If bitcoin has value because it is usefull, then any degradation in its usefulness should hurt enough to cause a counter reaction. 
On the other hand if this train is already out of control (completely overvalued by hoarders) then maybe it needs to crash so that only its usefulness remains.

You go on and try to import a private key with SW coins into an old wallet. See how far you get. 


You do understand that if no one uses SW that it is as if it doesn't exist. That means no effective increase.

You can fork with any nr of miners. Confirmation time would just be super slow.  But if you anticipate a low participation you could just hardcode a difficulty decrease after the hard fork. Easy peasy.

[these]( are the fees I paid this year. Goes from 0.002 to 0.033, that's a factor of 16. I would not call that just a little. 
Although I must admit that as a whole fees seem to still be constant at 0.008% of transaction value, and haven't really risen in relationship with transaction value. 
Its hard to really get a good view on the cost of the damage of not raising the blocksize limit. Just looking at the blockchain definitely isn't the entire picture.

Is this an issue about ability or about willingness? Isn't this the core issue about blocksize also? Perfectionism vs. Pragmatism. Did you read the article of OP? 


Why would the kind of transaction you eliminate first have an influence on the number of transactions which are evicted? The only point in random eviction is that it makes it a lot harder to execute a targeted attack. Although I must admit that maybe having more security due to more fees might actually be nice.

Yeah, i clearly remembered wrong. 
And I think that your views are extreme, definitely when they are not backed up by anything. Even more-so when they don't correspond to reality. Because we don't have to wait to hit the limit, because we are doing that everyday. 
If you can't quantify the cost of upgrading the limit, and you can't quantify the cost of keeping the limit (or lack thereof) then your opinion is baseless. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:58:23


You have got to be shitting me. The main reason for not doing a blocksize limit increase was orphan risks for miners and the resulting centralisation of miners. 
How exactly does SW solve this issue? 
Did you know that with SW blocks actually get bigger, not smaller? With the same number of transactions its still 5-10% bigger. And obviously if everyone uses SW then you still have bigger total blocks with the same orphan risks. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:08:29

I have been saying this for months and months already. That if you re-appropriate an existing feature to do something completely different that you need a solid design to do so. And obviously also get the necessary consensus to implement it.

I am a software developer, don't no why that matters in this regard. 
If you do a hard fork which is beneficial to Bitcoin as a whole then the value of Bitcoin will rise. 
A hardfork which lead to two viable forks is in fact dangerous. Its just not realistic that a fork which activates with 75% hashing power is still contentious enough to end up with two viable forks. 
The problem I see with people who want to keep the 1mb limit is that they selectively seem to forget incentives. "Miners would create huge blocks"... but why would they do that?  "Miners could activate a contentious fork?" ... but why would they do that?
A severe distrust of miners. That's what it is. Which is weird because everyone needs to trust the majority of miners not to stage a 50% attack.

No it will be bootstrapped when there are transactions which either can't be confirmed ever but need to, or when there are transactions which need fast confirmation but can't get into the first block. 
So in reality that can already occur when there are miners who want to create larger blocks but can't, there are still miners who simply refuse to add transactions and some blocks are still empty (to counter latency induced orphan risks).
Blocks don't need to be mostly full, average blocksize could be 700Kb when this happens. 
 
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:36:31
Ok lets compare a simple blocksize limit increase hard fork with a SW soft fork.
With SW you need new software to safely accept transactions. With a hardfork you need new software to safely accept transaction.  
In terms of safety they are not so different. 
Forcing everyone to do a simple upgrade seems much better than forcing everyone to use a completely new type of transaction. That either takes a long time or it is irresponsible as hell.

Malice and incompetence. Us humans tend to not understand how someone else doesn't understand the same things we do. Or even worse have different opinions than us. We therefor erroneously conclude that something must be malice, because to us that makes more sense. 
If however you are aware of this, you tend to see how incredible stupid people can be. We are such subjective creatures. We can be insanely religious about the smallest things. To a point that we can completely identify with a certain believe. Which is dangerous because it enhances confirmation bias greatly. 
And however hard we fight against we will always remain prone to confirmation bias. 
Most of the time this wisdom comes with age, with honest introspection about your own failures. People who discover that being right is less important than being happy. Ego vs. Emo. 
There are people on both sides who think there are malicious people at play. Which is definitely true considering the censorship, ddos attacks, spam attacks. But those seem to be reactionary, and not at the heart of it. Actually its probably the people who assume malice who do the most damage. 


This really shows that you don't understand what is happening. Its not a lack of passion and devotion which causes an apparent increase of trolls. Its the opposite. 
Although there are probably buttcoiners amongst us fuelling the fire. Most damage is probably done by people who feel like they have something to lose.

I don't think any amount of knocking is going to actually shut down any of those miners. Certainly not mining pools. And bitcoin would survive even a 90% drop in hash rate, it might need a hardcode difficulty adjustment but it would be fine.  
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:53:57
If the majority of miners are hugely invested in the future of Bitcoin this centralisation is actually not such a big deal. What is a bigger deal is "miners doing stupid shit to get a little bit more efficient". 
So now it feels a bit like miners have propagation issues with bigger blocks, and blocks shouldn't get bigger before that is fixed. 
But maybe the best way to fix the centralisation is to let them get hurt. If mining is more about passion than efficiency then you get completely different miners involved. So crashing Bitcoin's value would be a smart move. Because maybe Bitcoin's value is simply too high at this moment anyway.

@_date: 2015-12-11 16:17:41


I think it becomes intuitive if you consider the extremes. If blocks become so big that only one node can process them then Bitcoins value would drop to zero. The security and therefor value of Bitcoin is related to the number of nodes/miners. If businesses can't reasonably run their own nodes then the value of Bitcoin goes down. So every single transaction adds a cost and delivers a certain profit. Businesses and miners therefor should come to some kind of consensus about sensible transaction fees (and soft/orphan limits).
 
I don't see a problem with that. Although I understand that some people find that scary. 


The max value of Y is the value which lets the most nodes run a full client while handling the most transactions possible. 
The only caveat is the stupidity of miners not actually acting on the devaluation because of decentralisation, or when users don't care and bitcoin doesn't get devalued accordingly. 


I missed that completely! Weird. But I don't understand why a full node would work and an SPV node doesn't. Were there all kinds of nodes who were on different chains? I mean if a full node can choose one chain then why can't an SPV client do the same? Also an SPV client should not stop working, it should notify the user of a problem and still use the longest chain. Seems like a usability problem, not a security problem. 


You can't really solve a leadership problem with developers. For the block size limit anyone can become a leader who gets everyone behind one proposal. Its more a matter of when that will happen. 
And in terms of development it would be nice if the community can pay for the development themselves. Would be cool if we can develop a decentralised system to fund Bitcoins development. :)

Cool. 
And if you really are serious about removing spam. Then make that case. Don't veto a blocksize increase to do so. If you can't win an argument one way, don't sneak it in via BIP000. 
If it is important and valuable to increase fees, why havent miners done so already? Why don't we see mining pools which implement such a policy attract more miners? 
Actually the best way to really simulate hitting the blocksize limit is getting miners to slowly lower their soft limits. If nothing of value gets lost then you where right and we all should stop screaming. If it does cause problems and a devaluation of Bitcoin then know what to do. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:30:34


From a users perspective "import private key" would have definitely stopped working. And I would personally consider security an important feature which you don't want to suddenly lose. 


A what reason? 


Because upgrading the blocksize limit is so hard. And do we really want so many people to keep using older version?  
I mean lets cater to Raspberry pi's in terms of money, lets cater to Luke-jr's shitty internet connection and lets cater to the great firewall of China. Lets add catering to people who don't want to upgrade also? If bitcoin is defined by its smallest denominators then we will surely get overtaken by altcoins. 
SW is simply too complicated to be taken serious as a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:21:25


Mine wasn't cherry picked and yours is. I'm aware that causation doesn't imply correlation. 
If you actually have counter arguments or evidence that Metcalfe's law doesn't apply then i'm all ears. 




Intuitively I'd say that 1 million dollar moved in one year is equally valuable independent whether its one transactions or spread out over daily transactions. But honestly, i don't know. Just a guess.
So the longer you are HODLING the less value you add to Bitcoin. 
I must admit this whole blocksize debate always felt like HODLERS vs SPENDERS. Security vs Utility. 
Luckily you understand that turnover is important, and therefor utility is important. So we can agree that the blocksize limit needs to be increased.

No it should move forward, definitely. I just want it fully baked and uncompromising. There is a unique opportunity here to really move forward by doing some re-engineering. SW can stand on its own without an increase. 
But if the discounts given to witness data also gives it an incentive for fast adoption, then i'm perfectly ok with that. 
If you present the discounts it gives as anything but an incentive for adoption then you are being a tad dishonest (maybe naively so).

New question for the FAQ:
**"Why is a contentious soft fork like SW any less dangerous than a hard fork?"**
It seems that upon activation it would still create a hard fork. And nodes/wallet still need to upgrade so they don't become vulnerable to new attacks.

Throwaway bot checking in, can confirm.

SW only increases the block size because it is designed not to count signatures of SW transactions towards the blocksize limit. It's a creative way of slipping in a block size increase. 
The other creative accounting trick is making SW transactions cheaper (by not counting the signatures towards bytes for fee calculation). So thats a smart way of promoting the usage of SW. (can be a cheap new point of attack)
So it's ingeniously clever. Maybe mostly because it unites everyone. It's a politically genius.

We had fixed fees for a long time. Those fees also rose because of the rising BTC price. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:05:48
Adding more fees just means someone else is not getting his transaction confirmed. 
Also weird that blocks are full. Because Luke-jr just said it would take another 6 years before we would start bumping into the limit.  I don't know what to believe anymore.

I have rarely seen developers become great managers. But still many people think that if you are good at one thing you will be good at everything. 
So, the question for you r/eragmus is this: Do you think ideas and proposals should stand on its own, and get judged by their own merit? Or do you believe that a trust-less decentralised currency still needs trusted developers? 
@_date: 2015-12-04 11:00:29
Any change, like the reject all blocks with the wrong version number (after activation). Or even make it a requirement that the first block after activation needs to be bigger than 1MB. Its not rocket science.

Do you plan for peak load or for average load? Bitcoin is not working fine, fees go up, confirmation times go up, fees are unpredictable and it's getting worse. 
A blocksize limit is the most stupid way to keep average blocksize low. It needs to get out of the way, that's why we need something like BIP101. BIP101 is already a compromise, removing the limit altogether would be much better. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:29:19
And higher fees == more transactions (or the other way around). But that would mean that a block size limit is going to seriously impact its value. Or that a sudden price increase can get us to hit the limit with full force at any moment.
I think .

Well, if we all feel like OP_RETURN's should be reduced then we can add a policy to give all OP_RETURNS a penalty. Count every byte twice for instance. If there is consensus around that idea then miners should add that. 
Don't think that will happen. But we can have that debate. 
And if you are so adamant about OP_RETURN spam. Why haven't you promoted a data-only sidechain? It doesn't need complicated pegs. It just needs one bitcoin transaction per block to rubber stamp one side-blocks filled with just data. 
Or do you think that would be a "natural" progression when fees get higher? 
@_date: 2015-12-04 10:26:18
The way BIP101 is build you are indeed correct. BIP101 specifically gives a minority of miners a huge vote to stop it from activating. And even after activating it can be rolled back by a majority of miners and everyone would indeed be on the same chain. 
But that power is given explicitly by the implementation. Doesn't mean miners always have that vote. 
BIP101 doesn't need checkpointing or a different POW to achieve a successful &lt;50% fork. It just need to add a small change which is incompatible with the small-block chain. It can even automatically adjust the difficulty to reflect the number of miners who switched initially. Not that it matters because if the small chain coins are unsellable **ALL** miners would switch eventually anyway (as was my original point). 
So yes, they can take Bitcoin hostage to a certain degree. But that would hurt Bitcoin's value, so it's not likely. 
The realistic scenario is that an economic majority (exchanges/payment processors/wallets/miners/etc) gravitate towards one solution. And then everyone follows. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:58:05
Well the same can be said about miners creating huge blocks. The incentives for that are also not there. So it would be a bit weird for Lightning promotors to suddenly take incentives into account when it suits them, isn't it? 
The argument from small blockers has always been "something bad can happen, therefor it will, and we need to take that into account". So I would say that that also should apply to Lightning. 
And if you see how much bad blood the Core dev's have generated I would not be surprised if Lightning gets attacked and that its trust-less model still dies.

Its not a mess. Because this simply means that even for a soft fork like this you need broad consensus and you need everyone to switch. The difference between a soft for and a hard fork a simply not as great as they want us to believe. 
Or core dev's have simply painted themselves in a corner by claiming hard forks are so dangerous. Maybe look at the things i'm posting in the [Capacity FAQ thread](

Miners themselves don't have a definitive vote by themselves, but they should represent the bitcoin economy. So nodes/exchanges upgrade, and then miners follow. I don't see a problem with that. 
What you are saying is having centralised control over a decentralised system. 
You can't add a flag day if you don't have consensus about it. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 08:54:34
So SW should count the entire block (transactions + witness data) towards the block size limit? 
And another question altogether for you. I know you did an analysis of transactions fees, can you run that again? Or is there a live version somewhere? I can't find it (or something similar).

If core sets in motion this change they should take responsibility for this change. They either own up and communicate their plan. They do the conservative thing and upgrade the limit. Or they take a step back and let someone else do the dirty work. 
Anything else is irresponsible. Anything else is morally corrupt. 
They can't act like leaders and then berate, belittle, demonize everyone who wants to follow another path or simply disagrees. And then not own this huge decision they are taking for the entire community.

I will bite. If a transaction has been seen by a supermajority of nodes. What exactly is an attacker going to do? 
If bitcoin is valued for its zero-conf then they become valuable and more secure. Any attack on zeroconf by a miner would mean a devaluation of his own livelihood. 
Zeroconf is like a self fulfilling prophecy which goes both ways. If we don't believe in it (and divest in it) then it becomes less valuable and useful. If we believe in it (and invest in it) then it becomes more useful and valuable.

1. So given high enough fees this is practically impossible then. 
1. We should NOT evict transactions based on fee. In dutch we have an expression "wie het kleine niet eert, is het grote niet weerd", translates it goes something like "he that can not keep a penny shall never have many ". ;)
1. Miners should not be running off an Raspberry PI's. And some indication as to the size of the mempools of the biggest miners would be helpful for determining zero-conf's security. 
1. We should introduce CPFP, that would allow a merchant to cement even the lowest paying transaction into the blockchain. 
If we can gauge the cost of certain attacks then this can lead to pretty specific advice on whether to accept zero-conf, or 1 confirmation or multiple. Would be nice if that is build into wallet software. 
And if we take zero-conf serious we might want to penalize miners who include double spends (the more obvious the double spend, the bigger the risk of getting orphaned). 
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:26:30


Ok, there is a bug in Bitcoin which really needs to be fixed but needs a hard fork. Does that also mean the changed software is an alternative coin? 
And let this be very clear: We are not talking about the inherit difficulty of doing a hard fork. This I understand, and is perfectly fine and more than enough to protect the scarcity and thus the utility of the coin. 
We are talking about adding extra difficulty to doing a hard fork by vilifying any and all hard forks. And by extension its developers. 
This is not needed, uncalled for, childish and like I said dangerous. 


BIP101 is tested extensively, so I don't know what you are talking about. You know what doesn't have any testing? The 1mb limit. Not in terms of why it's needed. Not in terms of its risks. Actually there isn't even a proper design for it. 


Yes, lets do an appeal to authority. Why would I care what they think about whats best for Bitcoin's economy?
If they want to contribute to an actual debate where the cost of not upgrading is put against upgrading, then I'm more than willing to listen. Because that would be the way to go about it. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:19:47
That's just how it is designed because its a soft fork. It replaces the normal signature with a script which is spendable by anyone and then putting the actual signatures outside of the normal block. That's why old nodes will accept the block, because for them it looks like someone spends coins which are spendable by anyone. It is safe when a majority of miners actually do validate the signatures which are stored outside of the block.

That's an important part of it. I never really understood why people think miners would create bigger blocks than the network is capable of handling. If anything miners have shown how incredible conservative and risk averse they are. Have you actually seen how slow they were with upgrading their soft limits? (and still are!)
If there was no blocksize limit now (or it was much higher) and the 1Mb was really somehow a magical limit which we should stay under then things would probably look exactly the same (in terms of blocksizes). And we would have less fierce (!) discussions about miners needing to upgrade their soft limits.

If having a hard limit induces a significant cost upon the network (chilling effect, less growth) any fees which miners might miss should be offset by an increase in valuation.

That is correct, with just one OP_RETURN per block you can rubber stamp any and all data. But that also means the use cases are not zero, but they are still near zero.
Businesses are already building non-monetary applications around Bitcoin whether you like it or not. You can personally deem that as spam, but the entire eco system should still have the final say in what is and isn't valuable. 
You can't look at the amount of fees which are being paid nor the transaction value and know whether something is spam or not. If these transactions are willing to pay more they are not spam, and they are not going to go away. And if transactions do not go away then fees will rise significantly. And that will also kill a lot of monetary use cases. 
The big question is: What makes Bitcoin valuable? Are these transactions you deem "spam" important for Bitcoins value and growth? 
You know what is not possible, betting 21 million on Lightning and by extension on cheap transactions. And in the same breath say that low value transactions are worthless. So until Lightning arrives blocks should be able to get bigger (and no not to the extreme). 
You are personally responsible for tearing this community in half. Do you realise that?

That doesn't work for SW addresses. I'm not trolling just because you don't understand something. 


Your sentence was a bit weird. Now I understand. Will respond accordingly. You also don't have to assume i'm trolling if I don't understand something. You should try Hanlon's razor sometimes ;)


If the discount doesn't offset the risk, or the inconvenience of needing a P2Script then that might be problematic. The thing is that the people willing to use SW transactions might just be the ones who fall off the blockchain. The people who are already on the blockchain might not care about SW. 


I am a software developer, not a bitcoin developer btw. If that's what you are thinking. Maybe look at [this]( post i made a few days ago. 


You are presenting a false dilemma here. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:51:12
Started watching the video, its a bit much and not on topic off the bat. It's also hard to keep watching someone if he makes false statements about block-size and fees. 
So you mean 6 degrees of separation style? Because if you need to have your wallet always online would not be very handy. Seems like that would still move identities/wallets to a central location. 
If you have federated lightning enabled wallets, now then we are talking. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 23:35:09
I envision mostly additions to the protocol, not changes of existing functions. You can add functions which need a hard fork, but still be completely backward compatible (with wallets/payment systems etc).

Sure that also happens.  I should also mention that the "bad" behavior is not executed by all core devs. It's not like it's a policy. 
But all that doesn't absolve them from their responsibility.

1. Take a step back and announce that this is up to the community

Something which you call a forking threat, I would call an actual solution. The fact that you call it that is pretty typical. Been too much on maybe? ;)
BIP101 wasn't dangerous then, and it isn't dangerous now. The only thing which made it dangerous were people planning to actively cause the fork to activate prematurely. And people who planned to stay on the smaller fork longer than need be (although that wouldn't have lasted anyway).
And who is responsible for the software fork (XT) if Core was the one who started to stonewall? That's like getting thrown out of the bus and then people start to complain that you dare to stand back up. Its ludicrous!

We had a fee market where people could pay as little as possible and still get into a block. Hitting the limit would completely reverse that so that people start paying huge fees to still get into the block.
If everyone just gives up on getting their transactions confirmed we are golden. If not we are royally screwed.  
Imaging you have 11 people who want to use bitcoin but we have space for just 10. Fees will rise until someone gives up entirely. 
So what could happen is that we go from paying the least amount to paying the maximum amount (what peopler are willing to pay) to get into the blockchain.

Indeed, miners can in theory hold the network hostage, force a change or prevent one. But if they are on the chain with unsellable bitcoins then they will still need to switch.
Miners are working for Bitcoin. They are providing a service (securing the network) and automatically get paid in Bitcoins. They can't just do whatever they want. That's why their personal opinion about the block size is less relevant than their "economic" vote. For instance miners can say they prefer BIP100 all they want, but that doesn't mean they would switch without regard of the rest of the eco system (they could but that would be highly irresponsible).

Nodes should be the first to upgrade. If nodes haven't upgraded then miners are literally throwing away blocks because they would be worthless.
If the economic majority has upgraded then miners can follow. 
That is also the reason why BIP101 isn't dangerous at all, because miners need to follow and can't (afford to) lead. There are literally no incentives for miners to stick their heads out. A vote from a miner is therefor a representative vote.

A blocksize increase hurts a little bit more for miners outside of the GFW than inside, but **only** if miners actually keep waiting for blocks to download and validate (before starting to mine on top).
So what is more likely, that a blocksize increase causes centralisation, OR that it forces more efficient propagation algorithms into existence, OR that the pressure increases to find cheap energy sources outside of the GWF?
If bitcoin centralises in China that could even force Chinese miners to look for locations outside of the GWF to mine. What sensible miner would want to shit where they eat? 
I understand the perceived problem, but even if it's significant then i'm positive a blocksize limit isn't the answer. That's like cutting off your leg because you are afraid to fall.

Putting a cap on block-size also removes the pressure to fix block propagation problems. Putting a hard limit is also the most stupid way to create an artificial market for fees.
There is absolutely no way you could argue that the blocksize limit was designed to do what it does now: create more and more erratic fees and/or confirmations, and create an artificial market for fees (within a few months?). 
You could personally agree with the hard blocksize limit, but even then forcing it upon a majority which doesn't agree is still plain wrong. Its wrong in the sense that its an asshole move, its wrong in the sense of software development and its wrong in terms of economics. 
Its an asshole move because there simply is no consensus to re-introduce the hard limit to do something it wasn't designed to do. 
In terms of software development you actually should design something before you build it. So if you really thought you needed to keep average blocksize down, at least create a design or anything that shows the best way to solve a particular problem. Most likely is that a hard limit would be the last thing you would consider to solve this "problem".
In terms of economics it also doesn't make any sense. Or better said, its just wrong. If increasing average blocksize induces a cost then at the least have an economic argument about the cost of bigger blocks vs. the cost of stopping growth. Never seen that argument, and certainly haven't seen 1mb as the conclusion. 


You do realise that the 1mb is not a small squeeze, its pretty ruthless. Fees will go from the least people need to pay, to the maximum they are willing to pay (around the cutoff point). Currently around 500,000 BTC is moved every day paying just 40BTC in fees (0.008 % per transaction). Do you think these transactions are or aren't willing to pay more fees to stay inside a block? 
If bitcoin's value goes up, the number of transactions rises. What do you think happens when there is no more room for extra transactions? Will bitcoin's value still rise? 
No one really knows for sure what will happen. If enough people can give up on using Bitcoin completely without being important to Bitcoins value then everything could be fine. But again, how do you know? Seems like not knowing is enough to not want to do this experiment. On the other hand Bitcoin is a big experiment. Maybe it's interesting. ;)

Its like thin blocks (by Mike Hearn) plus some extra data so you can reconstruct missing transactions without doing round trips. 
Thin blocks is sending only hashes of transactions, because you probably have most transactions already anyway. 
If you want to solve latency you don't want to retrieve the missing transactions later (round trips are expensive).

So to be more specific you download just the header. So you SPV mine when a new block is found with an empty block, and after downloading/validating you mine filled blocks. 
Now how would block size still affect these miners negatively? Would this still cause centralisation? 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:03:53
You would need a very large catastrophe to have any effect on Bitcoin. Even if 60% if hashing power disappears that would be no problem. On average it would take about 2 weeks and then everything would be fine. And that's discounting all the miners who would jump (back) in. 
If you are worried about Bitcoin after such a catastrophe, maybe you should get your priorities checked out.

Actually a trust profile is very interesting if you want to gauge actual consensus amongst users. 
Have you ever considered that ChangeTip could be more than what it is now? I mean Bitcoin is trustless, but if we want to do any kind of voting we have no clue who is who within a certain space (like Bitcoin). 
With ChangeTip you already have a system where you could vote for representatives in the Bitcoin space using existing trusted accounts (for instance you know who u/Theymos and u/GavinAndresen are). If important representatives also vote you can combine that with a Google PageRank like algorithm and you have a pretty objective view of who is important within Bitcoin. 
And if every vote costs you a cent (or more?) that should cut back on spam.

I hate the censorship, but hiding scores is a good thing. The scores create dangerous filter bubbles in communities. Comments are not necessarily better or worse depending on the score. The popularity of a comment greatly affects its score (which is a shame really).  
A subreddit should show these filter bubbles. Because realistically you have different subgroups in Bitcoin. Small blockers, big blockers, hoarders, buyers, to the moon guy, libertarians, buttcoiners. Your up/downvote behaviour should automatically place you in a bubble, but reddit should make that clear. And you should be able to switch.

Why do you feel the need to misrepresent other people like that? 


If the shit doesn't hit the fan then that would not even matter. If it does, then it would be active in record speed. 
A year is actually very unlikely for a 2mb increase with such overwhelming support.  And you do realize that even with SW activated mid-2016 that that still isn't an effective increase. All wallets need to be changed, and all users need to create new SW transactions. 
And if SW is faster than a hardfork then great. But can we please bet on two horses? 
And by the way, it might be good if SW has time to bake. Rushing it because its also a blocksize increase would not be wise. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:18:45

A scaling roadmap which doesn't actually say when we can expect some kind of scaling? Where increasing the blocksize is somehow connected with segregated witness which should have its own roadmap? 
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:50:08


Exactly! And the average speed the network is comfortable with and the maximum speed (for peak usage) can be completely different. We can solve erratic fees without actually increasing the average blocksize(!). 
Its also possible that the "natural" limit is not much higher than 1mb. Its actually very likely that miners would keep running their software with 1mb limits for a long time. But at least then they **can** upgrade if needed (or when they want to experiment).  
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:10:04
Consensus in bitcoin is whatever software the majority of people run. So whatever software/protocol lets you send/receive Bitcoin with the most other parties. Everything else flows from that reality. 
So you only need a system so that everyone knows what software everyone is going to run next. So everyone could put their faith in one reference client, that's perfectly fine. If enough people do that then there is no problem. 
So in reality we already have a consensus system. Its just not formalised and it can create problems when this reference client does anything contentious (like keeping a block size limit which was supposed to be easy to upgrade). 
So if we want a more formalised consensus system which is better than just following one reference client we first need overwhelming consensus on that. (overwhelming consensus should not be hard to gauge). 
I would personally just let miners vote, because I believe they already represent the economic majority. But not many people would agree with me on that. The funny thing is, that if you let miners vote then more people would want control over that vote. That by itself might make mining more decentralised. 
You can also let bitcoin stakeholders vote. Maybe that's the best. Just pick a block in the past and let people who owned bitcoin's on that date vote for specific issues. Maybe older coins should have more weight? 
I do know that its stupid to talk about consensus when there is no consensus about what that even means. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:36:39
I don't think its the number of nodes that matter. If stakeholders switch then you have to switch also or the node will simply be ignored (not a big deal actually). 
The bigger problem would be lots of people who are very conservative with changes. You still see many nodes on 0.8.6 i believe. 
But there is no need to experiment and go super fast with bitcoin. Features can be tested with other coins first ;)
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:17:07
Well i can't talk for any miner, but its possible that miners want to see actual bitcoins asap. Its about trust. Which also explains people going to the big players.

@_date: 2015-06-09 08:57:13
Most people will have coins on both side of the fork. And you should be able to send transactions to both. Its the value of newly mined coins which is most interesting. Actually the whole fork is super interesting.  I already want to grab a bag of popcorn!

@_date: 2014-01-14 14:28:35
If by right you mean whats best for Bitcoins value. Then yes. GHash is heavily invested in Bitcoin. They stand to lose way more than they could ever gain from blocking certain blocks. 
Its not about trust, its more about laziness and stupidity on the part of miners. But ultimately they too are invested. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 09:56:35
You got it completely reversed. If people only hoard then it isn't actually worth anything. You can't even hoard if other people don't spend (for the most part).
Think about it: If people only hoard then the only available bitcoins would be the ones being mined. There would be no buy/sell, and you would essentially only buy POW, which is completely useless on its own. You buy because you **know** you can actually sell later one. And you know this because bitcoins get sold every day.  
So hoarding is just very slow buying and selling. The faster you do it the more we all need (and then you can't really call it hoarding).


@_date: 2015-12-22 09:48:31


What is less bad? Do you think a rushed soft fork is any better than a hard fork years ago? Do you think an accounting trick is better than raising the limit in a simple manner? 


What is the point of having scaling benefits not at the level it was needed in the first place? Like the most important one: block propagation between miners. 
SW is good, and it does good things. Conflating it with a blocksize increase by giving discounts on certain data is not good. 


Because you are conflating two things which need their own roadmap and pace? Because the design of the discounts given should not compromise on anything just because it was already sold as a blocksize increase. If it is a clean design, and the discounts give an effective blocksize increase I'm fine with it. 
Under-promise and overdeliver. 


Regarding SW I don't think he agreed that it should be a soft fork, and I don't think he agreed with adding a blocksize rider. 


Yes lets do the failed android model of software upgrades instead of the apple model. And lets pretend full nodes are suddenly not important when that was one of the core reasons a blocksize increase wasn't allowed. 


Look into the things he says and does. He is definitely not a beacon of light. He only responds very selectively to the things he can reject, simply ignoring everything which puts him in an awkward position. And he needlessly pisses on a lot of people by assuming bad faith. 


Who said anything about popularity? I think they are trying to be popular with SW in particular. 
Just look at [this]( and tell me that isn't cringe worthy? 
Presenting SW as a scalability solution is a slap in the face.

Well actually what they could do is make everyone announce the block by themselves. This way you can't lose a block when there is a short ddos.

It's been a long time ago that I had a statistics class in school. So my math could be off. But is it true that a pool with 30% hashing power has a 30% raised to the power of 6 = 0,0729% per block chance that they mine 6 blocks in a row. And does that equal 0,0729% times 6 times 24 = 10,5% chance in a given day?
Wait that can't be right....

Just create an bootable usb drive with linux, don't use it for other things than bitcoin. And never plug it into your computer while your normal (windows) operating system is running. 
Your usb linux system can be used online, and is at least much safer than windows (especially if you don't browse the internet and install other apps).
Like i said, your not protected from rootkit-virusses which can also infect linux and target your bitcoin wallet (highly unlikely). And given the secure nature of linux, an networked attack is also unlikely to succeed.
This is a nice cheap secure way to actually still use the bitcoins you have. Offline wallets are more secure, but without the convenience. 
Just don't forget to still make backups of your wallet.

I have thought about it, and physical coins still work the best (where one coin equals one soft drink, two coins is a beer etc.). That's what they aways use at big festivals (lots of noise). 
So if you want to use bitcoin just make sure you can buy coins through a machine with bitcoin.

If bitcoin is only popular as an investment doesn't mean its useful as a currency. I'm not arguing that Bitcoin isn't useful though (because it is). 
The article makes it sound like its price is directly coupled with its adoption rate as a currency. And that its volatility is a sign of succes. That would only be true if all investors valued bitcoin based upon its usage as a currency. Which of course they don't. 
Currently I pay around 1 euro extra on a 20 euro food order if I pay with bitcoin. I do this every week for 8 weeks already, so its not only anecdotal evidence. Bitcoins volatility is something which adds extra costs to real life usage of bitcoin. That's not some kind of myth which you can argue yourself out of like the article does. 
On the other side (more anecdotal) i have a girlfriend who tells me every week not to spend my bitcoins because they might be more valuable. So i'm being tempted to become just an investor and less of a user.
I just think its a mistake to pretend that bitcoins volatility doesn't negatively affect its usefulness. Because if we are mindful about it we might be able to stabilise it more. Maybe by trying not to focus on the value of a single Bitcoin so much. Make it irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:59:42
Currently its highly technical and for noobs its far easier to lose all their bitcoins. Dollars which are stored in a banks are insured even in cases where you were tricked into giving up information. 
In theory bitcoins can be safer. No other party than yourself could access your bitcoins. But you need to fully trust yourself and know what you are doing. I would argue that most people are not smart enough to handle bitcoins safely. Or that ease of use negates safety or vice versa.

Password? Why would you need a password? Cold storage simply means keys which are never stored on an internet connected device. So you can generate them on an offline computer and export the keys to a hot wallet when you need them. 
Just make sure you make backups of all your keys, on paper or usb drives. 
Memorizing passwords would be the worst way to secure your coins. 
And if you ALWAYS have to transfer from cold storage to your hot wallet you are also doing something wrong. The point is that you keep enough coins in your hot wallet which you actually need on a day to day basis, and never more than you are willing to lose. 
If you really have a lot of coins AND need to move them a lot then you simply need to invest time and money in a safer hot wallet.

A full node isn't some kind of vote. Value is. If there is an exchange on one side of the fork, and another exchange on the other. The side where (newly generated) bitcoins are worth more wins. That doesn't have to be the one with the most nodes. People will then be forced to switch or switch back. 
This is so interesting that I almost want it to happen. 
In practice bitcoin will probably be dead during a hard fork until there is a consensus by most bitcoin exchanges/payment processors. Then the rest follows.

A mining pool with more than 50% hashing power could: block transactions and double spend its own transactions. 
If a mining pool wants to block a transaction for a longer time it also needs to block **all** blocks mined by others. Thus making it very visible what they are doing. 
If a mining pool wants to double spends a transaction, they would have to build a secret block chain. This would slow down the network at least by a factor of two. So it would take at least **two hours** to get to the six recommended confirmations. Even before the secret chain is released miners could already have abandoned the pool. 
Any attack by a mining pool would be suicide for that pool. A small bump on the road for bitcoin.

Exactly! If Bitcoin ever moves away from the current mining algorithm to a proof of stake algorithm.

Bitcoin does not need to (directly) solve all problems. Where did the idea come from that bitcoin needs to solve your point 1, 1, 1 and 1. Bitcoin can completely fail in a lot of ways, and be the worst solution for a lot of problems and still be a success. It doesn't need to do POS (although I think it can). It doesn't have to keep your files save, that's always up to you (or some third party you trust). It doesn't have to have to be forgiving for mistakes, gone is gone also has its value. 
Its like complaining about a telephone because its not like a letter, complaining about a car because its not like a horse and complaining about the internet because its not like the fax machine. 
Bitcoin is something else. Most importantly a platform. And on top of that platform businesses can create whatever service you find lacking. But the freedom underneath stays, driving prices down by fostering competition. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:53:47
That's simply not true. With 50% (and everything less than 100%) you would need to reject entire blocks mined by others to continue to block a transaction. Its impossible to block certain transactions alone. And its impossible to block a transaction indefinitely.
You make it seem like transactions can be blocked without anyone finding out. AND you make it seem like bad transactions can go through, they can't. With all the mining power in the world you can't *vote* for a incorrect transaction to go through. 
So in theory its possible to block a transaction, but in reality its not. There is no possible way for a mining pool to block or reverse a transaction without a total collapse of that mining pool. Because those actions would be highly visible and it would be suicide. 
The only realistic scenario is someone hacking the pool and making a profit by gambling on the BTC price drop. But that effectively also destroys the mining pool and would not matter in the long-run.

This bitcoin address will exist for all eternity (at least in the current bitcoin protocol its not possible to reject transactions). So maybe best to turn it into the official address (or automatically forward everything) and make a private one for yourself. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:54:41
Wouldn't it make way more sense that cex.io has WAY more mining power and they pretend to have mining power from normal miners also. That way you will scream at the miners not them ( or less at least ).

Most importantly, all those things an attacker can do  constitutes to a very public DDOS.

Bitcoin developers can't push new versions. People choose to upgrade. And who would choose to run such a version? It's open source, anyone can see if a backdoor has been added. 
And if for some reason it's only found out after coins where stolen everyone would just revert back to the old version. 
The old version would actually reject all blocks with illegal transactions, so it would be clear something is wrong immediately.
Edit: what point is there to steal coins which can be stolen? Even economically it doesn't make sense. The bitcoins (on that branch) wouldn't be worth anything anyway.

Let's forget that it's impossible for large parts of the internet to get disconnected in a way that you would still need a system like bitcoin (and not just go back to bartering). 
What would be the reason NOT to let the separate networks merge? The value and advantages of one global bitcoin network far outweigh any advantage separate networks can ever have. 
Does not make sense times two. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:30:30
Developers make mistakes. Always. Its almost impossible to write bug free software. If you think it is possible then you have NO idea what you are talking about. Testing and developing are two separate things. If the developers ALSO have to test everything to a degree they are not even capable of, then the development would grind to a complete halt. Is that what you want?
Its very disrespectful to place these insane high demands on opensource developers. You either pay with your time or your money, or you shut up. That's how i see it. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:19:08
Yes, but you can't build on top of that block. You need to build on top of the previous one which didn't have the transaction.

If extreme growth in usage causes volatility doesn't mean volatility is always caused by growth in usage. Volatility could very well be caused by a whole bunch of day-trade-retards who do not even look at the actual usage of bitcoin.  
To state it differently: Is bitcoins adoption as a currency hindered by its usage as an investment?
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:03:51
They think that people bought bitcoins directly from the creators. So they hold your real money, and you can redeem bitcoins for money with them. That's the only way their statement makes sense. They think bitcoin is exactly like a bank! :X
You always have to remember this when people say Bitcoin isn't innovative, or just a bubble etc. etc. People don't get how bitcoins are issued. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:22:14
Do they check those records with the buying party?
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:01:58
So your FAQ says you only need to pay taxes when you sell bitcoins. But then later it says you also need to pay taxes if you buy something with bitcoin.

Well its to prove ownership. The transactions/data you have should match up to some secret evidence (which hopefully is not destroyed). 
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:45:30
Of course. But it's very hard to quantify those potential losses and gains. I would guess that most innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem can be possible within the structures of the AML's. And I also think that allowing AML's to be circumvented is a very bad thing. That's just my personal opinion/view.
I'm just arguing that not allowing money laundering doesn't cause any innocent people to suffer. Certainly not more than would normally be possible. So its simply not in line with what Franklink etc said.
Doesn't mean there isn't a pro privacy argument to be made. And that old laws prevent us from going forward. And that more freedom equals less human suffering and more happiness. 
 
As i see it the cats out of the bag. We will always have black coins/dark wallets and we still have AML's. Those can and will coexist.

What difference is running such a node going to make regarding the 'power' of the bitcoin core developers? What exactly are the core developers going to do? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:13:14
What would happen if you could build up interest based on owned bitcoins. And you can spend this interest only to decrease the difficulty for the block you find?
At most you should only be able to do like a 50% decrease in difficulty, and that would also cost 50% of the block reward in interest. 
So a decrease of 10% of the difficulty costs 2,5 bitcoin etc. 
The interest rate should be as low as possible so this isn't something everyone can use by default. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 08:34:04
It would be highly expensive and only DDOS the network temporarily. A small change in the bitcoin code would render it completely ineffective (like  moving to Scrypt). 
But I also think governments actually like bitcoin because of its pseudo anonymous nature. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:00:59
Mining bitcoin would be more anonymous than buying bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:23:15
You forgot about an important one: scarcity. Bitcoins are not created out of thin air to represent the total value of the Bitcoin like with stock. Bitcoins in that sense are not comparable with stock in a company, and for a large part the perceived value comes from the actual cost to create them via mining. 
In case of Bitcoin, the actual cost of making them equals the perceived value. 
Bitcoin is a product, a platform, an investment AND a currency. Don't evaluate it just as an investment. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:03:52

And bitcoin IS still an experiment. A thing people seem to forget. Trying to see what happens when the limit is reached might be more valuable than changing things out of fear. 
Maybe NOT changing the 1Mb max block size will ultimately lead to more innovation, like side chains or things we havent even thought of. :)
@_date: 2014-01-20 11:09:06
How can you be certain your armory client isn't already cracked/hacked? Going offline would still do nothing to protect your wallet from an attack. 
I really don't understand this fascination with going offline. As if thats the ultimate foolproof security. 
And how smart is it to use Windows if you want a secure system?  
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:26:36
Hell no. The only thing he could have done is make the algorithm more memory intensive. But don't you think people would have seen that as very wasteful? Wouldn't that have hurt its initial adoption?
And if you look at Scrypt you simply see that the hardware is lagging behind bitcoin because its less popular. If bitcoin had scrypt we would be at the exact same point as we are now. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:03:38
You need to create your own hardware and software to be 100% sure your bitcoins can't be stolen. Because how would you ever know that the bitcoin wallet software or hardware doesn't have a backdoor?

This article sound nice, and it's probably exactly what many people want to hear in But it fails to differentiate between bitcoin as a currency and as an investment. Bitcoin can be completely unusable as a currency and still be volatile because people buy/sell bitcoin as an investment. 
All investors can be wrong, and bitcoins popularity doesn't proof its usefulness at all. Also see: 
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:06:56
That's not the same at all. The total value of their cattle is not at risk from such a scheme. 
The problem is that potential revenue is viewed in bitcoin, but in truth people value bitcoin in relationship with other currencies (or simply how much you can get for it in products/services). 
All miners are also invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:33:40
1) In everything which is negative about Bitcoin gets downvoted. A lot of news never gets on the frontpage.
 
2) People don't like fractions, so its easier to get a LOT of dogecoins. 60,000,000 Dogecoins sounds WAY better than 0.0001 Bitcoin.
3) Dogecoin has scrypt. So its easier to mine with normal hardware. And maybe a lot of Litecoin enthusiast switched to doge?
4) Dogecoin is less serious, people like to have fun. 
5) Faster confirmation times make it seem like its faster when in fact 1 hour confirmation time is still 1 hour of processing (which is actually much weaker for doge than bitcoin obviously).
Bitcoin had a lot of supporters, it was fun to mine but now its grown up and not so fun anymore. Mining is hard, many ex-miners might even feel screwed-over. Bitcoin's price is pretty flat, and people want the excitement.

Of course, people are actually paying the developers via XRP. And they should be payed if Ripple has/creates value. Its like an IPO where they slowly giving out stock which destroys itself when you use it :P.
Without XRP ripple could actually still work. They could have chosen to destroy Bitcoins for every transaction. They could have added mining to the client-software. Ripples idea to use trust based networked debt to send money could be separated from XRP. But they didn't.

Of course bitcoin needs investors. But how many investors base bitcoins valuation on its actual adoption as a currency?

Gold is not more natural than Dollars. And something which is natural is not naturally better than something artificial (see Naturalistic fallacy). So i think we need to focus on different words than natural vs. artificial. Like central vs. decentralised, forced vs. free etc. 
Dollars are bootstrapped by gold, and became successful simply because it was more efficient than gold. Later the dollar was hijacked into something else: decoupled, centralised, controlled, forced etc. 
Bitcoin is not only bootstrapped by dollars, its bootstrapped by a lot of currencies. And it can do a lot of things more efficiently, and most importantly: it can't be hijacked.

What exactly is the difference between a hosted wallet (with client-side encryption like blockchain) and a desktop client? The only difference is that a web-app can automatically update its code every time you use it. But like just like a desktop app you need to trust the person who created/compiled the app. 
What zomdifros actually says would give a user MORE control, and more security than when you just use a simple desktop client. Multisigs could give you perfect two-factor-authentication even for hosted-wallets.
1 key hosted + 1 key offline backup + 1 key personal device, and you need 2 keys to sign a transaction. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:03:05
Funny thing is that anyone could change the protocol. But having the majority of the mining power would not help you one bit to get people to adopt it. 
On the other hand if the people who consider bitcoin to be of value would all choose to adopt a new protocol then that's effectively the new bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:46:35
You mean bitcoin mining pool centralisation? Because that doesn't have much to do with bitcoin itself. Or do you mean switching to a proof-of-stake algorithm?

Thats not a good comparison, these peanuts were exchangeable for games so they clearly already had value. 
And it simply took effort/time for people to get them, and time is of value for people. 
People won't simply hoard anything that's scarce. Bitcoin is simply in its own league. No inherent value (like these peanuts). 
If I simply created a limited nr of seweso-coins no-one is magically going to pay anything for it. 
People consider bitcoin (and other alt-coins) to have value because it actually costs energy to create them.

Automated processes can and will negotiate bitcoin addresses behind the scenes. That's what payment protocols are for. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to solve every problem. Its a platform. We just need some extra standards. Maybe even an payment  request by email-protocol. But anyone can start something like that. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:27:18
People who disagree probably  still have enough other reasons to join the new fork. Its not like they HAVE to stay on their fork. ;)
Only miners can create extra large blocks. And miners are always invested in the value of bitcoins. Which miners would want to actively destroy that value by generating bogus transactions in every block? 
Does not compute. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:57:42
Winners take all? that's not true. If you have a smaller share you simply get less, not nothing. 
Actually it doesn't really make sense that everyone joins the biggest pool. Maybe if people didn't pretend p2pool is a good alternative. Just joining another pool would be enough already. 
Ghash probably has a lot of mining power from cex.io than people think...
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:08:19
I think 20% is low, because it seems that miners can believe that they would earn more money if there is some kind of market for the correct transaction fees. That not only the bitcoin is a scarce product, but also the transactions itself. 
Wouldn't that create a scary situation? That no normal person could actually add something to the ledger? At least not as freely as they do now? Wouldn't that create exactly the scenario you are afraid of? Who cares who can actually download the blockchain if no one can write to it? So many questions :P

Going further than Krakor and stating it more harshly: Miners are NOT in control of the system. All users determine which bitcoin have value. And thus they determine what software miners should use to make a profit. 
We (bitcoin stakeholders) let them work for us. We give them control but only because it suits us. Because proof of work gives us security and its a good way to initially distribute bitcoins. But that IS going to change. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:22:57
I'm trying to analyse your POV, and it seems like your entire argument hinges on a slippery slope: If blocks increase, then miners get more power over the direction of bitcoin, therefor they can do whatever they want. Increase block rewards etc. 
Is that a valid summary of what you think will happen?

A trusted offline computer, or any other offline device which can create private/public keys for bitcoin. 
An old computer/printer is the easiest.  But a cheap android phone can also work, if you don't use it for other things. 
You could also create a linux installation on an usb disk to do all large bitcoin transactions with. That would not be safe if there are root kits on the computer, but its probably safe enough. 
Trying to be too safe can also result in catastrophic losses. Forgetting passwords, losing backups etc. etc.

Look at the whole debt ceiling debate. If a country as big as the US can hold a nation hostage with something like that. Then this is peanuts. 
But thats what it is actually about. People holding other people's money hostage every time they  oppose the idea of raising the limit. Who are these people?

* Confirmation times could also rise because the Hashrate stays the same but a lot of miners wouldn't be able to mine.  Given a big enough crash, miners might switch to an alt-coin and Bitcoin might never see a confirmation again...
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:27:01
You mention Ripple, so there goes any trust ;). 
I personally think side chains are very interesting, but they should stand on their own. No one should hold the bitcoin network hostage by failing to increase the block size just to promote another agenda.
The block size limit should be high because we don't want to touch it, ever. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:58:46
If bitcoin is dead, then block stream is also dead. There is no argument for destroying bitcoin.

I'll take uncertain doom instead of certain doom any day of the week. 
And I agree that the design of bitcoin should level the playing field as much as possible, foster competition and remove as much friction as possible. 
I simply don't share your fear. If bitcoin would change into the thing it tried to replace then i'm certain all value will be lost. Therefor that shouldn't be possible with rational actors.

That's like DDOS-ing your own bank. What would that eventually do to the value of bitcoins? Would any sane miner do such a thing? 
The important question is: what gives Bitcoin its value? If that includes its decentralised nature. And I think it does. Then the answer to the above questions would be: Bitcoins would de-value, and therefor no sane miner would do such a thing.

@_date: 2015-05-08 20:17:36
Why would anyone let the hash rate fall down to zero? I expect certain stakeholders to invest mining/extra transaction fees to prevent such a thing from happening. 
So I could personally buy something with zero transaction fees, but the webshop adds extra transaction fees on top of their transactions.
And doing nothing to force everyone into a big transaction-fee-marketplace is definitely not a good thing. It just feels wrong. Let some miner do that with a soft limit and don't do that with the hard limit. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 11:22:37
There is no economic value in a 1Mb chain. Even amongst Core supporters there is just a minority who really want such a thing. No economic value == no security == dead. That's why even a POW change doesn't help. 
Because it is not CoreCoin against ClassicCoin. It is 1MbCoin against 2MbCoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:16:21
Oh classic was the right side. Oops. 
Well the idea that Classic needs to develop more than just the 2Mb increase is not really a choice when Core dev's stop their work. Classic could have been a one time fix and leave it at that. 
Classic challenges the notion that one dev' team is in control but then it still needs to assume control itself? Weird
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:23:43

@_date: 2016-01-29 15:18:07


Yeah, people keep repeating that line. I don't buy it. If you can show me how bigger blocks are dangerous **and** at the same time miners would create them without regard for consequences, then I'm all ears. 


He checked if blocks that size were safe. Not if a blocksize-limit was safe. Blocksize limit != blocksize. 


All cost inflicted against a blocksize-limit increase is going to eventually lower the price of Bitcoin (relative to its potential value without the limit). So all threat's of leaving Bitcoin development by Core dev's, threats of changing the POW algorithm, threats of DDOS attacks, threats of violence, personal attacks, demonisation, threats of staying on the old chain by miners. It all adds cost, which will postpone an increase, and thereby devalue Bitcoin, and thereby decrease its security (but hopefully just temporarily).


Like i said. If the cost of not having an increase (soon enough) is higher than the cost of a HF then it will happen. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 09:57:42


Technically they do, economically/realistically they don't. But that should also apply to soft forks. 


Interesting, but how would you do that?
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:48:25
This proposal simply kills the original chain, and brings forth a new chain from its dead corps ;). Which might still be better than a hardfork. But still kinda brutal. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:29:44
Donate to other pools. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:13:49


Miners are invested with millions that they can't afford to just do things on a whim. And supporting Classic and actually voting to activate a HF are two different things. They probably still hope that they get Core on board. But even without Core's support they will do what makes the most economic sense. 
Being dismissive and calling that just politics or whim is just handwaving. It would't kill you when you really tried to understand the reasoning behind it. You could even check Bitcoin Classic's code to check whether it is at least safe. 
It is very simple actually. If Core only seeks consensus amongst developers, then at one point there will be a mismatch between what is technically the best and what is economically the best. And in this case that is only about timing and the perceived cost of running into the blocksize-limit.  
Obviously there is also a lot of "we hate blockstream-core" going on. But that doesn't seem to affect those who are invested. 
So listen to miners, listen to people like Erik Voorhees, Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin. They all sound perfectly reasonable. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:16:33
There is nothing in Bitcoin which prevents miners from only creating empty blocks.  And yet it still works. 
Without incentives Bitcoin would not work at all. So why forget them selectively when talking about certain subjects?

No, it stops the nodes from getting any confirmations at all. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:48:41
They are valid, that's the whole point of a soft fork. That it seems valid for older clients. If it would be seen as valid older clients would reject the transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:48:00
Because I can't pay with dogecoin anywhere? And you do understand that if people switch to alt-coins that Bitcoin's value goes down? 
Imaging BTC fees increasing by 5%, and Bitcoin's value dropping by 10% because of people moving to alt-coins. This means that fees actually dropped by 5%, and that therefor security of Bitcoin is reduced by 5%. Which should in turn make Bitcoin even less valuable. 
In reality there is an optimum blocksize with optimum fees which create the most value/security for Bitcoin. This is definitely not attainable with an arbitrary artificial limit which was originally designed for something completely different. 
Reducing Bitcoin's utility is definitely not the best way to increase its value nor its security. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:42:14
Yes and the same can be said about Github. But no one would use Github ever again if they faked statements of users like that. Consider.it is bigger than just that page for Bitcoin classic. And the Toomim brothers probably value their reputation. 
Also, I'm not suggesting that that consensus system represents the entire Bitcoin economy. Far from it. Like I said. It is for internal consensus forming where it is nice that things are open and easy to use. 
I personally would like a distributed system with a web-of-trust kind of system. But I have talked about it here a bit and there doesn't seem to many people interested in it. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:22:07
Blocksize limit != blocksize. 8,000 Mb is in 20 years(!), and Bitcoin unlimited isn't actually unlimited except when its configured as such (which no one will do).

@_date: 2016-01-24 08:46:51
Ok tell me how you would double spend a transaction with the following characteristics:
1. A reasonable fee (which under normal circumstances gives a fast 1-confirmation)
1. No double spends detected for 2 seconds
1. Not Opted into RBF
1. The transaction is for $25 or less
Is that completely insecure? Or would you have reasonable security?
You should also remember that Bitcoin itself is reasonable security, because you need to assume the majority of miners are not out to swindle you. 
Your line of thinking is what would have prevented Bitcoin from ever existing. And scary enough, this is the line of thinking Bitcoin Core dev's also seem to have. It is one of the things which has caused a split in the Bitcoin community.

Maybe a stupid question: Would it be possible for nodes to add some kind of orphan risk by delaying blocks which they deem too big? Would that force miners to mine smaller blocks? 
This would even be possible for the privately owned relay network. Or is that evil? 
And it would slow down confirmation times for users, which would hurt innocent bystanders. But I would figure that for miners to know that this would happen that that could already be enough incentive to lower block-size. Its a bit of an extortion tactic..

Oh, jtoomin != toomim? Confusing. Not related? Are you the guy who went around the world to talk to miners then? Or is that also the other guy? 


That is re-introducing the 1Mb as means to limit actual transaction volume. It doesn't have a design because Core thinks its not a conscious decision. Not doing something is some kind of superior action which therefor need to be explained and doesn't need consensus.

@_date: 2016-01-31 15:20:58


Sure. Luckily everyone is in agreement that the blocksize limit needs to be raised. There is still disagreement on the how part, and a little bit regarding how much and when. Consensus seems to be forming around a 2Mb HF. But we will know for sure when we see important parties actually switching. 


A 50% / 50% split is not possible. There is no viability of the old chain whatsoever. 


Ok good. And then i'm very interested to know how your fees are behaving. You don't see a trend like [i do?]( I use Breadwallet btw.

@_date: 2016-01-24 19:04:19
Those are facts at 90% activation. Under the weird assumption that 10% hashing power remains on the origin chain. That gives 10 times longer confirmations, clocking in at 1 hour 40 minutes on average. That also means 10 times less data, 1Mb per 1h40m is like 100Kb blocks regular confirmation time. 
The reality is that it won't be nearly 10%, because as a miner the sooner you switch the less money you will lose. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:58:53


That doesn't make sense. Just because something isn'd paid for directly doesn't mean a node can't be a server. For businesses who rely on Bitcoin it would make sense to host (or pay for) full nodes. That should already be sustainable. 
I see no problem with that. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:46:07
Yes i heard. Secondly I just think its worth it and you don't. But maybe bitcoins are way more valuable then they should be at this point. Bitcoins can move so fast that we don't actually need so much. Would be nice if it crashes more to kill a lot of stupid hoarders. :P
So i almost agree with you, just think that superfluous is an overstatement. And if you know something better, i'm interested. 
And power consumption is definitely not proportional to the networks value in the long run. With the continues halving of the mining fees i mean.

@_date: 2016-01-21 11:45:24
True but there are more pro's and con's to different soft and hard-forks. 
A hardfork is always less complicated than a soft-fork (given the same intended goal). A soft-fork has subtle hard to understand consequences when not upgrading. Soft-fork need hard-forks to clean up cruft in the code/protocol. Hard-forks do not ever need soft-forks.
And everyone upgrading isn't necessarily bad anyway. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:13:05
Depends what his role is. If it is only uniting everyone behind a shared goal, and not about control then it should be fine.

You can fear something as much as you like, and vilify Coinbase all you want. But that doesn't make what you say true.

@_date: 2016-01-30 14:20:55


No, the software license protects developers from exactly these situations. 


And that license would also apply to Classic dev's. 
The level of control which people complain about regarding Core are related to well being awesome at coding, but also all kinds of threats and attacks which puts them more-so in a position of power. Albeit not absolute power. All this control only adds a cost to the network if it results in sub-optimal choices.

Nothing will happen to your bitcoin, except maybe go up or down in value. 
There might however be people who want to proof that a hardfork was dangerous by actually making it dangerous. Like continue running older nodes and mining on the &lt;1Mb chain. Your non upgraded SPV wallet might stop working, and you should definitely not use an non-upgraded full client.  
But if you have an upgraded full client (or you connect to upgraded clients with your upgraded SPV wallet) then everything should remain functioning throughout the switch. Bitcoin would not miss a beat. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:18:04
Until we have something else, bitcoin will have to do. Its the currently the best thing...
@_date: 2016-01-08 13:42:37


Because people look at scripts when they receive fund?? 
The problem is with a contentious SW soft fork you create all kinds of security problems for people who didn't upgrade or SPV clients who connect to non-upgraded nodes. 
A non contentious soft fork isn't as dangerous, but the same can be said about a hard fork.

The idea of decentralised development and thereby governance also encompasses wisdom you mentioned. It encompasses and includes Core. Even if they want to exclude themselves from that picture. 
Likewise Core's scalability plan doesn't completely exclude on-chain scaling. And it does embrace emergent consensus. 
These two views are not completely at odds with each other, which makes hardliners in both groups seem like asshats. And then I'm not even talking about the tin-foil hatters :O

First, they can not veto anything. They can only increase the perceived cost of a change by threatening to leave, or with other threats/attacks. 
Because it has always been about cost. The cost of doing a hardfork vs. the cost of not upgrading the limit. 
You also must realise - people seem to forget - that a more valuable Bitcoin is a **more** secure Bitcoin. It would most certainly attract more miners, and more full nodes. Not saying they are not improving scalability/security technically, just saying it is not that black &amp; white. 
The core developers seem to have no clue about economics and incentives, or conveniently forget about them. If you drill down on their arguments of why they are against any increase it always comes down to cheap transactions or that most are spam anyway. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:23:31
Then we still set a precedent. And from a software perspective there would be not a lot of difference anyway. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:45:30
That would be [Auxiliary blocks]( which allows coins to go back/forth between legacy blocks and auxiliary blocks, old nodes would simply see spend-all transactions going in/out (like segwit). And with an economic majority having upgraded to the new blocks/coins you can then inflate the new coins. 
If you have an economic majority who would want more inflation (which is pretty crazy to begin with) then they could also hardfork and not care about whoever is left behind. But this is a nice eye-opener regarding soft vs hardforks.

Let me rephrase that: Was this absolutely necessary or would a simple max transaction size not be sufficient? 
People asking for bigger blocks != people asking for bigger transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:51:27
I don't think the tragedy of the commons applies to blocksize as it is not an finite resource which we can run out of. A tragedy of the commons works because even the last fish still has value. For bitcoin the last transaction added to a block which is the nail in the coffin in terms of total centralisation should be worth nothing. Or virtually nothing. 
And if that is not the case, and a majority of lunatics hijacked Bitcoin to be something completely different then it would have probably already forked already a long time ago. Although I don't think that is likely to happen. 
So if Bitcoin has value because it is distributed and trustless that should mean that a majority of miners can't fuck that up without consequence. 
I think the number one reason Bitcoin becomes centralized is overvaluation by hodling. So when Bitcoin's value is disconnected from its use. And one of the best ways to correct this would be to keep the blocksize limit. We would find out what the real value is by removing spam, and a Bitcoin that is worth less would hurt large miners the most.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:13:52


Well doesn't everyone fish out of the same pool. All miners getting the same Bitcoin and all.


Some users want this. More specifically users who don't believe SPV is secure enough. 


Amen to that! I just think that 1Mb is no trade-off at all. That just an arbitrary number. If anyone has the data/calculation which says that is indeed a magical limit then I'm very interested. But until now I have never seen anyone show that work. 


The last block (which is mined non centrally) would be worth absolutely nothing. Or should be worth nothing. 
You also have to realise that in Bitcoin we can fork to create bigger blocks. But we can also fork to create smaller blocks. If the economic dependent nodes suddenly switch to another POW to break up the control of miners then they are done. Finito. Their control over Bitcoin's future was just an illusion. Because they are employed by us. We can fire them.
Another thing to realise is that once blockreward goes down and gets replaced by fees, that the number of transactions becomes much more important. Any collapse in the number of transactions would hurt their income directly. The entire Bitcoin economy could go on strike just to teach miners a lesson. In reality the mere idea that this is possible should keep them in line.

This is stupid. A mere 20% of hashing power can already simulate a 95% activation percentage by abstaining to vote, and only start to vote at 75% if they were so inclined. 
The idea that activation % equals the number of miners which will still mine on the remaining chain is ridiculous anyway.

Maybe that is the reason core dev's say all zero-conf is bad because they think people simply don't understand how/when it can be safe. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:17:39


I don't agree on that definition. Miners are invested so much that they should represent the economy. And thereby follow and not lead. Miners should not even be able to activate a softfork or even policy changes without economic consent. Every change has risks and costs associated with it. 
The whole reason I mention the "you can change anything" thing is to make people realise that soft/hardforks are not so different at all. 
Consider for instance a softfork which puts all validation of signatures in a separate data structure. If miners start validating this new datastructure and there is some exploit then that will have consequences for Bitcoins value. Worse if they need to go back to an older version and coins are suddenly spendable by anyone. 
Same goes for Opt-in RBF. If people perceive this as dangerous then this already has an associated cost. That alone should cause miners to be reluctant to add it. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:59:07




Kinda feels like adding an increase to 2Mb via SegWit is an admission that it is needed in the first place. So why didn't they do any proper planning with advance notice years ago? 
They could have even planned an increase to 1.1 Mb as a test. Anything is better than doing nothing at all. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:45:01
Sometimes things are not as dangerous because people are aware they are in fact dangerous. This also applies to hard-forks. The more dangerous a chain fork is, the less likely miners would switch. This is exactly what we saw with XT, and exactly in line with what miners are saying.

Yeah that is a weird remark. Even if it was a misquote but he still meant that Core would get replaced, that would still be ludicrous. I certainly hope they are not going to stop. 


Well, things are getting put in place to prevent the things he said are going to happen. Dynamic fees, RBF, SW. And on top of that the market might just more subtly slow down. I think it is still going to be hard to make a hard case against his predictions. And it is kinda sad to want to kick someone after he is down. 
There is no doubt in my mind that Mike was genuinely concerned.

Not necessarily. Not all soft forks are created equally. You can just have legacy transactions in the old chain, and new transactions in the segregated chain. That would in no way reduce the old nodes in functionality.

What code needs to be refactored? Lightning runs on top of Bitcoin. Its not like core wallet functionality changes. A lightning enabled wallet is an add-on. 


Lightning needs wallet developers on board. Do you really think they are going to build all new wallet software for all mobile devices? Are we all going to switch to new software created by just one entity? Doesn't that scream centralisation to you? 
And on top of that Lightning suffers greatly from the network effect. No users = no growth. The Core have gone through great lengths to alienate a huge chunk of the Bitcoin community. Not only wallet developers.

I think you know that that is not the reason full nodes enforce a max block size. At most you are guessing. 
Running certain software, and agreeing with every single rule the software has are two entirely different things. 
You should change your sentence to "That's why it is a good thing that full nodes enforce a max block size". Then you are not projecting your own opinion onto others (and appealing to  a fake bandwagon effect). 


Transaction makers should be forced to add enough fees to get into blocks (or give up). And miners should keep blocks reasonable to keep the network healthy. Saying there are no incentives would be a huge understatement. 
I always wonder what kind of blocksizes you imaging when you say these kinds of things. 2Mb, 8Mb, 20Mb, 100Mb or even 1Gb blocks? 


Yeah, that's because its super cheap. Also why economically dependent nodes are not going away anytime soon. Pretending that they will is just spreading baseless FUD.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:57:03
No, you can do it in a way that can't be detected by old nodes. It needs most people to use the new chain, but old nodes would continue to function as if nothing happened. Auxiliary blocks with extra miner reward in the auxiliary block would already do it. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:42:44

I believe there are more cost then just high fees. A divided community. Failure in governance. Which leads to a lack of investments. Lower price etc. 
What is worse? I have no idea. I actually want to see what happens when we run into the limit. But on the other hand it is very likely that we will never run really run into it, as it would simply devalue Bitcoin first, and thereby prevent transaction volume to increase.

True, but I don't think that is going to give anyone a huge edge. Getting transactions 20 milliseconds earlier gives you about one transaction extra per 25 blocks on average? With fees being about 0,000125 BTC per transaction, would mean a 0,000005 BTC profit on average. 
Doesn't sound very exciting. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 13:04:48
Isn't it better to do this as in a way that only upgraded coins go into the new chain? So that old nodes/coins still work? So that it isn't a soft-hardfork?

You went from home mining not being possible to equating Miners with the FED? How does one follow the other? 
If you want to decentralise mining you introduce new mining algorithm's. Not entirely new ones, but which run side-by-side. You might even want to introduce new algorithms ever 6 months or so. With the only requirement being that it needs to be able to run on commodity hardware. 
Something else which would work is kill Bitcoin's value so that professional mining hardware ends up on the street. 
Or that everyone starts mining again and takes a small loss. 
Or mining hardware becomes a commodity and everyone can join in with comparable efficiency of big mining factories.

The reality is that even the Core dev's know this is an economic change. They just brush it off with "we have done changes which affect economics before". 
And I've heard it all before. Smart people creating technically superior products blaming stupid people for not understanding how their product is better. But the reality is that companies like BitPay, CoinBase and even SatoshiDice have made Bitcoin big by making things easy.

I understand. They can change whatever they like because old nodes consider all SW transactions valid anyway. Its almost like a remote de-activation switch to let old nodes skip certain validations. 
So what you are saying is that they build Segregated Witness and then make sure its more easy to de-activate validation in the next software upgrade? So Confidential Transactions can be added after SW is deployed?

Classic is scary? First 20Mb was too much, then 8Mb was too much and now 2Mb is too much. While Core dev's signed off on 4Mb. Isn't that a bit weird? 
And how many chances do we need to give them? They have had years to add an increase. Alternative clients are created because Core keeps saying No. Why would we give them one more chance when they keep saying No? Doesn't compute. 


Classic is not about throwing everything away what Core does. Opt-in RBF is considered very contentious and it seems it has anti-consensus (more people are against than for it). And Segregated Witness seems to be too complex and would take too long (as a blocksize limit increase). 


Dont spread baseless FUD. A hardfork which activates at 75% means that the remaining chain is dead. In the best case scenario (that 25% of miners stay on the original chain which is very unlikely!) you have 40 minute confirmations and only 1.5 Mb worth of transaction per hour!  While the 2Mb chain has a capacity of 9Mb per hour. 
Furthermore most transactions will be valid and accepted on both chains. That means that the longer we wait to switch the more transactions there will be, and the bigger the backlog on the old chain will be. The chance of the old chain dying grows bigger and bigger everyday. 
Although I would say the chance of the old chain dying is already near 100%, looking at the fact that there already is global consensus to do a hardfork.


Again with the FUD. Choosing 2Mb and choosing Classics development model are two different things. Also don't know what is scary about that list. 


Clearly almost everyone disagrees with that assessment. People probably don't like seeing things like [this]( Bitcoin slowly becomes less usefull, not good for its value.

Ok, what is the cost associated with this attack, and does that cover the gains? 
The gain is $20 dollar and how much do you think the contract costs? So how many times would you need to do this? And would that cover the resulting loss in Bitcoin's value, and the thereby the loss of revenue for the miner?

I think custodial wallets where you don't have access to your keys is a very stupid idea. But people are allowed to make that choice by themselves. I see how having a wallet with USD can be more convenient. 
I don't see how bigger blocks have anything to do with custodial wallets. You could be afraid that they want to ultimately push people into those. But I don't see how that would be a reasonable fear. 


Well honestly if consumers can't run full nodes there would be no problem as they could still run SPV clients. But even if that's not possible, and given that Coinbase isn't the only wallet/payment service then Coinbase would still be better than PayPay. Because the underlying protocol would still allow permission-less innovation, which should also prevent vendor-lockin and promote competition. 
So Bitcoin being in the hands of only professionals isn't such a big deal really. It would be better if anyone can run a full client. But that's also an extreme policy. Zero tolerance policies are never good. 
If Coinbase does take over the entire market then Bitcoin original would still exist. The idea can never die.

If his goal was to raise the limit to something which is definitely "safe" then maybe you could say he was wrong. But maybe he was wrong in trying to re-introduce the limit to do something it has never done in the first place. 
So Gavin was twice wrong, so clearly he was right ;)
Trying to get any specific number is wrong. The 1Mb limit was arbitrary and got out of the way, a new limit should have done the same.

No single entity can prevent a hard forks also. And that's true for a lot of things in life. 
An economic majority can prevent spend-all transactions from getting accepted. And a majority of miners can prevent a soft fork from becoming active.

No, not everyone agrees there. But most positive news about alternative clients is censored in this forum. Therefor it might seem that consensus isn't forming. You have to filter out the extremists though, but you have those on both sides. Annoying, i know.

No but seriously. If I didn't know the 1Mb was completely arbitrary and not designed to do what it is doing right now, I would be more supportive of SW. Or if it arrived a year earlier or something, or transaction volume was twice as low.  
But I'm still open to SW being the fastest route to bigger blocks. 
I also must say that I have a colleague who creates the most complicated solutions to simple problems. So i'm kind allergic. When it comes to software development I always try to KISS.

Yes as explained to you [here]( already.
I will humour you with some extra explanation, but you should know that just because you don't understand doesn't make it untrue ;)
Think of it like Segregated Witness but now you also Segregate Transactions. Where the new type of transactions are in a new block which is not validated by original clients. Old nodes still function as normal. Transactions can go to/from the old blocks to the new blocks.
New blocks simply have their own coinbase transactions which create more coins. 
Not terribly exciting. Doesn't work without anyone being exciting with this idea. But that applies to all forks.

Well it will only affect the value of your Bitcoin's. Hard to say whether it will go up or down. 
Because everyone is aware it is dangerous a hardfork will only happen when everyone is on board. Or at least the entire economy and all miners. And that means no split. No 4x reduction in price like some Debbie Downer's pretend will happen.

If Classic is just a few patches, they can grab SegWit at the push of a button. It is not rocket science until Classic becomes more than patches on top of Core.

Softforks can add cruft to the Bitcoin protocol forever, which you can prevent with a Hardfork. And softforks only solve the problem of not having/giving enough time for everyone to upgrade, it is not a technical solution to a purely technical problem. Softforks **only** solve the problem of nodes not being able or willing to upgrade their software (for whatever reason). Almost all change to Bitcoin can be done via Softforks, even raising the 21 million limit. But there is nothing you can add via Softfork which you can't add via hardfork. But there are things you can do via Hardfork which you can't do via Softfork (like add nonce space). 
Softforks are good at certain extensions, and can be deployed faster. Whether faster is always better is another question. 
People also seem to think that Softforks are better for contentious changes. Which is weird, because that would make it a technical solution to a political problem. 
It is like "We don't like politics, so let's work around it. And create a solutions which has a Rider just like a Bill in politics."
Segregated Witness as a Softfork is truly like a Bill with a rider. Some want a block size increase but might still be on the fence regarding SW's complexity and risks. And some want SW but don't want a blocksize increase. Politically it's genius. 
But it is a tiny bit weird to have Core supporters complain about politics when they are very much apart of it. They are just masters at coding, others know how to actually talk to people ;)

Considering all Core dev's signed an increase to 4Mb, I figure 2Mb should not be such a big deal. Or at least not big enough to split Bitcoin in two. 
On top of that, the risks and cost of a split are so high that it is more likely that a hardfork doesn't happen at all, and that it needs overwhelming economic consensus before miners dare to vote for activation.

If you have a group of volunteers who let anyone veto anything then you are guaranteed not to weigh any security risk against other potentially more beneficial changes. If only developers can contribute that excludes 99% of the community and takes away their voice. 
This is upsetting to people, and rightfully so. 
The governance structure of Bitcoin Core might not be a person, but it still acts like a dictatorship. It is very strict, very unforgiving and it is the opposite of being democratic. And it still has subjective values it maintains above all others, fungibility being the most important one (the rest flows from that). 
This works fine until you need to choose between security and growth. Or better said perceived security vs perceived lack of growth. Because it is also not nearly as objective/scientific as people on both sides claim it is. It is not a guarantee that growth is really (going to be) limited with Core's scalability plan, and it is not clear that increasing the limit has measurable security implications. Because a majority of transactions might really be spam which does't contribute towards Bitcoins growth. And growth by itself might increase Bitcoin's security (more hashing power + more full nodes). 
So maybe Core is a meritocracy, but what constitutes merit is still subjective and up for debate. And only giving developers gives a major preference to technical issues and not nearly enough consideration what the rest of the community wants or needs. 
You must also understand that the consensus process which Bitcoin Core uses deflects all responsibility for the actions of Core's as a whole. No single person is responsible. They can just point at the process, and pretend that it is completely fair and unbiased. And that anyone can join in. When it is obvious that that is isn't the case at all. 
The holy trinity would be to have all three. 
1. A benevolent dictator, in the form of a person or a very strict process
1. A system to gauge economic consensus, and at times multiple clients to use emergent consensus 
1. A system in place to measure merit as objectively as possible (to gauge technical risks/benefits, actually create/test solutions)
Core has 1 and 3. Classic has 1 and 2. In my honest opinion.

Can't buy anything with Changetip. I see Adam Back ramble about off chain solutions which supposedly already exist, yet I can't use them anywhere. 


That's not what p2p means. 
You know that a datacenter is just a place with better and cheaper internet connectivity right? Nothing prevents you or your friends from owning a server in a datacenter. It is just cheaper and more efficient and more professional. Running a server from home is simply the most expensive and inneficient way to contribute nodes to the Bitcoin network. 
And using a professional node can't be considered a middlemen, it should not need any trust, and it certainly won't cause any lock-in. 
What you are probably thinking about is the doom and gloom scenario's as painted by certain Core developers. Where Bitcoin is controlled by a handful of people. This is not the same as "Bitcoin moving to datacenters".

You can't replace things with a soft fork like that. Well with an evil softfork/soft hardfork you can. But that's not what we were talking about. 


Anything which can affect Bitcoin's economy needs global consensus. The idea that it somehow doesn't is promoting carelessness. 


"If X can change, then anything can change" sounds like a slippery slope argument. And I could say the same about Soft-forks. Because you can change anything with Softforks, even increase the 21 million limit.

You will know it when you see it. [Mempools]( only growing and getting above 100Mb from natural transaction volume would be a pretty solid indication that blocks are full. 
Also if fees rise sharply as you can see [here]( would be a good indication that blocks are really full.

So do you think we are walking next to a slippery slope and 1Mb defines the edge? If we take one step on the slippery slope we slide of completely? 
The thing is, I believe decentralized system are superior and cheaper than any centralized system. And that's from a technological perspective. Everyone having all transactions is a really good way to scale a read heavy database. 
You know what is dangerous? Having just one Bitcoin client which everyone uses, and then having one company making it closed source. 


You should learn to pick your battles. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:20:57


The old client never sees more than 21M coins. And more specifically that's not how Bitcoin works. It checks the coinbase transactions, not the 21M limit. 
This is obviously not going to work if everyone wants to use old coins more than new coins. 
Imaging 10 million BTC moving into the new chain, but the new chain has 10 million + an additional 10 million BTC (making the total number of BTC 31 million). Everyone can freely move coins to the old chain, but not more than the 10 million which was moved to the new chain.

Subjective. You should read OP's explanation why it doesn't seem safe at all. 


That is simply not true, SW might get deployed in April but it needs people to actually create Segregated Witness coins before it the it has any positive effect on the block size.  It also adds overhead of 10-15%. So you get less transactions by using more space by doing Segregated Witness as a Softfork. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:24:00
That would be an argument not to choose 90% for activation. Although you can make this argument at any %.

What about policy changes/softforks which has economic effects? 
What about the fact that you can change anything with Softforks? 
What about the fact that the only really bad thing about a simple 2Mb hardfork is that people like this do think it is ok to fight it. 
Compromise all the way down to 2Mb and it is still contentious? While Core has signed off on 4Mb already? 
Arguing for keeping a minority of Core developers in control to force economic changes upon a majority is somehow fine, because a majority is not allowed to force anything on a minority?

Really the fact that transactions even have multiple inputs/outputs is one of the best things which increased Fungibility. And I think Satoshi didn't even do that for Fungibility :). 
The fact that people can do CoinJoins already creates Fungibility for everyone, because even if you "CoinJoin" with yourself it could have been with others. :)

Opt-in RBF is highly controversial and attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus. So should this post be permitted? 
I'm still waiting for a definition on consensus or even what constitutes the protocol.  
Protocol: "the official procedure or system of rules governing affairs". Seems like in Bitcoin protocol might even mean more than just its network protocol. 
And I definitely think we should not be careless about changing miner policies. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:01:54


Exactly! 
And Bitcoin might just be the first artificial evolving organism. We have only the illusion of control. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:54:50


Not everyone agrees on that. Chance of a split vs. a chance of SW being too slow (and creating a fee event) or too fast (and having exploits, forcing people to revert and having spend-all transactions up for grabs). 
It is not so black and white. 
Betting on both horses seems to be the safest route to me. And for both goes that betting on them means betting on the the safest version of each, and then one will simply be faster. 
So for a hardfork there should be broad economic consensus. And Segregated Witness needs to be thoroughly reviewed and fully tested, and should be adopted at its own pace.

How did you figure that? I extrapolated the data it should be at 1Mb around august 2016. Did we look at the same data? 
Edit: Obviously 1Mb is not even feasible. We probably run into the limit much sooner (at 800-900Kb). So it can be as soon as June.

A majority of miners asking for a 90% activation is a bit weird. That's like saying that they don't trust themselves :P. If they don't like where the vote is going they can aways stop voting. 
And 75% is more than enough. Because every miner vote means that they believe to hardfork is more valuable than not to fork. Therefor it should represent the economic vote. 
Imaging ever 1% of miners being invested for 1 million dollar. Now imaging you and your wealthy friends putting 90 million on the line, but then you allow people with only 10 million invested to block you. 
Miners voting isn't a normal voting process. It is more akin to having shares in a company.

And because you can make reasonable assumptions about certain transactions. Like do you see double spend attempts, what is the transaction amount, are fees high enough and is RBF enabled. It is most definitely not just about trust. 
RBF is mostly handy for low fee transactions, for which zero-conf was already very risky. So in my opinion Opt-in RBF doesn't change a thing. It actually makes it more clear what can and can't be replaced. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:29:02


I don't. Currently blocks can't even become larger than 30Mb. My point is that there are already natural limits.

Pretending that everyone who wants an increase wants to compete with VISA only using current tech is wrong. A straw-man. It would even include all supporters of Core's scalability plan as it also includes an effective blocksize increase. 
Scaling Bitcoin with current tech does **not** prevent off-chain / level-2 solutions. It just means they need to compete fair and square with Bitcoin itself. 
Building on top of / and from an existing Payment system would actually be easier than starting from scratch. Creating a LOT of negative PR against solutions like Lightning is not really a smart plan anyway.

This will not create an artificial market for fees indeed. But if Core really wants that, then maybe they should write a BIP for that. 
Other that that this should cover everything. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:09:26
Just because someone thinkgs the potential cost of a hardfork is percieved to be greater than the cost of a softfork or policy change doesn't mean everyone agrees with that assessment. 
Not all softforks or policy changes are created equally.
In the case of Opt-in RBF going firmly against the community it also has huge political cost. A reality Core dev's tend to want to ignore, but a reality nonetheless. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 11:06:15
It is actually very simple. If the (perceived) cost of doing a hardfork through an alternative client outweighs the (perceived) cost of not doing any block-size increase then it will happen. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:59:51
Creating an RBF transaction with such low fees that your transactions might never confirm -for whatever reason- is really counter intuitive. Think about it.

Yes, but why would a miner care how fast blocks are propagated to normal nodes? 
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:55:10


I asked because I wanted that to be clear, so we don't argue different things. 
I think we can easily remove the limit altogether but then we would still run into the limit not much further down the road "naturally". I'm pro BU and I think BIP101 is very conservative. But that is also because I don't think the blocksize limit is the only thing stopping blocks from growing bigger. If all the concerns of "small blockers" are valid then that should already force blocks to be smaller. 


If the main Bitcoin client becomes closed source that would make it virtually impossible for competing clients to exist. It would be hard for any competing client to claim compatibility when there are unknowns. 


Community funded miners. That adds decentralisation by itself, **and** it reduces profits of all the other miners (forcing them to quit or to divest). 
Another option is drive the value of Bitcoin down, which would also force miners to quit or to divest. Amateur miners / subsidized miners could pick up the slack because they are not only in it for the mining fees. 
A good way to drive Bitcoin's value down is keeping the blocksize limit at 1Mb, or at least until the next halving. 


If you want to do a cost based analysis then that would be wonderful. Just stating some uncompromising view doesn't really help anyone. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 08:31:20
While that is very impressive, that is a library, it is not Bitcoin.

Honestly, which one follows which? 
Do people who disagree with a SF SW automatically have a flawed understanding of Bitcoin and/or what's important for trust in a brand new growing currency. Or did you first determine who has a decent understanding (etc) and therefore value their opinion more?
So exactly when and why did you decide/realize that people like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Andreas Antonopoulos, Roger Ver, a large majority of miners and a lot if Bitcoin wallets/businesses had a flawed understanding of Bitcoin?

Yes it is. Obviously. It actually came forth from me making fun of Segregated Witness and taking soft forks to the extreme. 
Extreme times, desperate measures. 
And this isn't some measly upgrade to 1.5 Mb, this is limitless. (You can even change the block reward like this)

"Steal" is a big word if you send them coins which they clearly accept. 40 minute confirmation time should tip them off that something is wrong, getting alerts and all and it being one of the biggest events in Bitcoins history. Hard to miss I would say.

Isn't it weird for a majority of miners to say a majority vote isn't enough. Won't they be there when the vote happens? 
They can rescind their vote if the vote is not overwhelming enough for their taste. 
They have at least 2 days to determine if it is safe to continue voting, to see whether the miners who don't vote just abstain or represent genuine risks.

Because any time someone will complain about fees being to high, they will be advised to use SW transactions. Any time someone complains about slow confirmation times, they will be advised to use RBF. If anyone complains about not having a full validating client anymore, they are advised to upgrade to the newest Core release.
SW will not have overwhelming consensus before a hardfork is planned. And therefore any implementation of SW can not be promoted.

Its not deleted, it is simply [closed]( His proposal (disguised as a pull request) is also openly debated [here]( It is still there for everyone to see. 
I actually thought it wasn't even such a bad idea. Ultimately miners work for us. Changing the hashing algorithm (or just threatening to change it) could get miners back in line. Because they are working for us, not the other way around.

**Is it possible to replace an RBF transactions with a non RBF transaction?** 
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:40:45
1. Yes, if a part has only a fraction of the miners the confirmation's would slow to a halt. You could however assume that no one is able to double spend on both sides, so in theory you could accept zero-confirmation transactions.
2. There is no majority in bitcoin. And the network would correct itself automatically. You don't need to do anything (except probably wait for the network problems to be fixed).
3. This is so completely unlikely that its not really worth going into. A small fork is possible (given artificial blockades by a government) but even that is not sustainable for a long time.
If a hard fork would ever occur the market would decide the value of coins on both sides. But most probably one side is worthless, and the dominant/normal side remains unchanged. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 13:10:16

Bitcoin moving to datacenters plural is not a centralized Bitcoin which isn't p2p. Maybe you are accidentally creating strawman's out of my argument here. 


Bigger blocks with more capacity. 


Pushing segregated witness too hard and too fast as a blocksize increase, or having an increase too slow and too late. You can go wrong either way. A devils dilemma created by unnecessarily marrying two unrelated things. Which is simply bad software design. Or it is in reality a carefully crafted solution to a political problem, and that is why it has riders, to make it interesting enough for all parties not to object. But in reality developer consensus != global consensus. 
The problem with a hardfork blocksize increase was that it only kicked the can, and wasn't a scalability solution. So what is Segregated Witness as a Softfork exactly? 


What? that doesn't make sense. Explain? 


Good that pretty much no-one disagrees about raising the limit then. 


I just hinted at you aligning more with hodl'ers than spenders. And if you create higher valued transactions, then that fits that picture. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:04:30


Non of these have adaptive an block size. You have one which has deterministic growth, one which uses emergent consensus and one with a fixed limit. Maybe you should have added the version of OP? ;)

Well you could create code, and tell miners to run the code. They should listen to their economic master ;)
If we say they can run whatever code they want, they will. If we collectively say they can't, then they can't. But that wasn't really my original question. 
Would an alternative client which reverts/prevents Opt-in RBF from functioning be more or less controversial in your eyes. 
Also [this]( is interesting (seweso there is me). I personally don't like people being anti Opt-in RBF because of the wrong reasons (thinking it is going to kill 0-conf). 
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:38:13
In this case probably the number of inputs. Every time you receive funds your wallet generates new addresses. This means that when you create a transaction it has to grab coins from one or more addresses. 
So if you spend a big amount it might be able to use one input, and then you spend another small amount which can't just use one input anymore. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:33:03


Those are already detected and de-prioritized. 


This lie is being repeated so much that people start to think it is true. It is not. A majority of miners wouldn't create huge blocks, and a minority can't. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:21:16
Core can just merge the change from Classic in due time. 2Mb should not be an issue if they all signed off on 4Mb already. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:47:21
It's funny how everyone would agree that creating a minority chain would not affect Bitcoin at all, but at the same time think that some miners staying on a minority chain would be so much different. Or that staying is realistic at all for a significant hashing %.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:59:05
Donation-ware works perfectly fine for a lot of projects. Whether it would work for something like adding Lightning to wallets is another matter. Depending mostly on demand and how much work it is. 
The crux is that I think Lightning should be simple to add. Because I think mobile wallets should not have to re-implement the hub/server part of Lightning.

@_date: 2016-01-12 09:47:55


Last I heard coinbase isn't a miner. Nodes being ready for larger blocks is not dangerous by itself. 
With as much power as you (and Core) have you should not need to silence people like this. You only need to explain the danger of a contentious hardfork. 
Allowing alternative clients = Yes. Allowing the promotion of contentious forks by promoting miners to switch before global consensus = No. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:15:36


It is about what could happen, not about what will. And not actually having to fear the thing we want to happen. 
Whether the (perceived) cost of not upgrading offsets the cost of upgrading I don't know. But that is surely something which the market is better at discovering than a bunch mere mortals.

I think our opinions are not that much different then. We are indeed in desperate need of a secure off-chain solution. Lightning seems to be our best bet.

@_date: 2016-01-17 15:07:10
Classic can fork from any version of Core they want, and revert anything they want. 
Reverting Opt-in RBF is on top of their list it seems. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 09:00:12
To be honest it doesn't keep Bitcoin decentralized, it just lowers the cost inflicted by bigger blocks by a large margin so you can theoretically have bigger blocks at the same cost. 
On chain scaling can and should not be limitless. But at least we don't have to stifle growth in absence of layer-2 solutions being ready. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:29:59
Tacking on all kinds of things to a so-called scalability solution is not really smart. Everything pushes back the planning and adds more risks. So either decouple, do SW properly and in its own timeframe and plan a separate hard fork. Or make SW lean, mean and focused.
The other problem with tacking on all kinds of things **and** making it the only scaling solution is that it forces an all or nothing approach. Its like adding riders to a political bill.
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:41:39
I've been saying this for a long long time already. And we don't need to allow SPV mining. No one prevents anyone from doing that. 
If we didn't have a blocksize limit we would see all kinds of solutions emerge, this would be one of them. 
The biggest problem with this solution is that miners would be free to create bigger blocks, which the "small blockers" like [Theymos]( do not like. 
Normal people want bitcoin to grow, and if block propagation is an issue then we solve it. But if we solve it there will be another problem. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:59:10


But what if you still allow legacy transactions? If you design segregated transactions just like segregated witness (also putting the new transactions in the segregated blocks, and maybe even doing a two-way peg). Would you then resort to blocking all blocks with spend-all transactions? 
I actually don't want to argue raising the 21 million limit, because that would be stupid. Its more a thought exercise. But a soft-fork like this to raise the block-size would be nice. 
(And I hope you don't think i'm annoying. I have a great deal of respect for you. :)
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:02:44
Doing this at UTXO level is indeed better than at block level. But it would not work for inputs which might not exist yet at all. It doesn't allow a node to proof that the input doesn't exist. Which a binary search merkle tree could do. 
There actually seems to be a patent for binary search merke trees:

@_date: 2016-01-26 08:06:06
Are we still pretending this is merely a technical issue and not about economics? Risks are cost, cost is economics, economic changes need economic consensus. 
Even comparing a 2Mb to a 1.6Mb increase is about economics. 
When you really dig into Core dev's and its followers)opinions it always boils down to "cheap transactions" and "spam". Which is simply not their place to decide. Or better said, they can add cost by being obtuse and make as many threats as they want. But at the end of the day, economics is in control.

The only way forward is to close down the Bitcoin Foundation and create something new. Something more fitting to a decentralized currency. 
Call it the "The Distributed Bitcoin Foundation" or something. Start with getting consensus about what constitutes consensus. If we have that then we can attract funds, make decisions and move forward. 
Ultimately the foundation should have/be a big transparent Bitcoin multi-sig wallet. The only question is: who controls it?

Relying to a now deleted comment:


Why does it need to completely replace Core? Or will their ego's be so severely bruised that Bitcoin classic dev's suddenly need to take over all of Bitcoin's development? 
Can we be grateful for all the things Core has done (and still does) but not agree on everything? Why does this have to be an all-or-nothing game? 
Bitcoin's Core dev's ability to code is not diminished because of their failure to govern, just like their ability to code doesn't give them the ability or right to govern Bitcoin. 
And we don't simply brush off their technical reservations for a hardfork. Just because we dare to take on the risk, doesn't mean we are not aware. 
Segregated Witness might even give us an effective increase sooner. Doesn't mean that betting on two horses was bad.

I wasn't dismissing their weight. Just that on a technical level it would not matter much what code you run if both essentially do the same. 
And if we can force Core to adopt a change we want, we can do it again. That is still power to the people, so to speak. 


But if the vocal opposition keeps repeating a falsehood, then it just seems like a bandwagon. From my perspective it looks bad. 
Although pushing Opt-in RBF without any consensus is also bad. If no one asked for it then it should not get added.

Kinda odd if the community has to go to such great lengths to get the increase it has been asking for months if not years.  Kinda odd if no matter what we do its not right. Add SW, don't add SW. It doesn't matter.

A mere 15% can also refrain from voting until 75% has been reached to simulate a 90% activation limit. If they think that is safer. 
The safety of the entire Bitcoin network depends on just 50% of miners. If we can't trust the majority of miner we have bigger problems. Trusting them to be safe is a minor thing.

Maybe read again. The argument was "Bitcoin probably can't be a settlement layer first before being a payment system". 
It's more that introducing a artificial market for fees might go wrong. Not a this definitely goes wrong. 
And the whole thing gets a bit weird because settlement and payment system are not so black and white. All arguments are very fuzzy because everyone interprets it differently. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:03:39
First, there is no cohesive community where whatever one person says applies to the entire group. Grabbing one comment as if that applies to me is weird. 
Satoshi was also comfortable with nodes/miners moving to datacenter, and I don't see why that should be an issue. A more successful Bitcoin would be a more professional Bitcoin, and by extension a more secure Bitcoin. Saying Bitcoin is better when it needs to be run by amateurs from home is just weird. Up is down and down is up? 
Because Bitcoin cannot scale indefinitely in its current form. does that mean it shouldn't scale at all? 
You do realise that the scaling plan of Core is not that much different than doing an 2Mb HF right? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:14:43

I personally think that merged mined &lt;1Mb coins vs &gt;1Mb coins is much safer. But if people really want to create a split over a measly 1Mb at least make sure people can transact between the two and miners don't have to chose. That way it is only a market decision.

Some miners seem to already run some form of RBF. Probably not the full version, but still. 


Not really, wallets only need to add a small check. They could even ignore RBF transactions altogether until they are confirmed. 
I see the advantages, but if i'm a minority then this change should not be rolled out. I believe **that** is the most important thing about RBF. But if miners want this, then it is hard to stop them as it is only policy.

@_date: 2016-01-18 22:07:30
No it isn't a security flaw. It just shows you can change anything with Softforks. 
With [Auxiliary blocks]( you can change anything in the new block format, but still be able to move coins back and forth between legacy blocks/auxiliary blocks. If enough coins are in the new chain (big if) then coins can inflate on one side more and still be able to move back&amp;forth.

@_date: 2016-01-01 22:27:16
I asked you more questions than just this one. But at least this is on topic.


Completely agree. A cold hard fact. 


But the reason miners can't vote for a hard fork is the reason they can. It's safe because it's not safe. 
Its comparable to what I do with my expensive and beautiful motorcycle &lt;3. Sometimes I put it in public view of people (outdoor café's), where I don't lock it properly and I leave my helmet/gloves with my motorcycle, and then I go somewhere else and leave it. Anyone could just grab my motorcycle and walk away with it. But it's safe (for me) because its not safe (for a would be thief).
Is that unorthodox? Yes. Does it seem unsafe? Yes. Does it work? Yes. 
I feel the same about Bitcoin as a payment system. But also regarding finding consensus and moving forward with hard forks. 
That's why BIP101 is safe. Because premature activation (before economically dependent fullnodes have upgraded) is dangerous, that is exactly the reason why it would never happen (miners not shitting where the eat and all). Promotion of running BIP101 nodes isn't dangerous, because that just signals being ready and helps in finding economic consensus. And even promoting miners to run BIP101 isn't dangerous because it's just not something miners should/would do before nodes have upgraded (although it is still stupid to promote such a thing). 
It does depend on rational miners being rational. But it should also work on a trial and error basis, but that would put a temporary dent in bitcoin's value. 
Maybe we already agree but I just call a miner vote as "representative voting" and you would call it "voting for activation".

Then they really be just an alt-coin, probably with no value, therefor no security. The chance of that lasting long are slim. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 10:06:37


Yes, and this is part of the big schism, and very important to understand. I think more usage leads to a higher price, which increases security. You might think we only need to focus on security, and that increased usage diminishes security. I've always said this is between hodl'ers and spender. 


Agreed. But this is what passion does. If no one cared that would be worse. 


Incidentally that was also Satoshi's vision. And if the alternative is the need to rely on amateur nodes which are ran from home, then that is also very weird.  And moving to datacenters and making the network more professional doesn't not mean you can't run a full client at home. And looking at BIP101 you really can't say that Gavin wanted to move to datacenters ASAP. The only difference is control and trust. Giving this economic control to software developers is very counter intuitive in my view, and it will definitely lead to sub-optimal choices, and therefor a less valuable Bitcoin. Not to mention their actions also dividing the community. 
No clue why anyone would say: "Yes lets give me a less valuable Bitcoin because I'm a hodl'er, yes and a side-order of less security please". For me that makes no sense at all. 
There is no fundamental gap op opinion here at all. It is not like people who want bigger blocks don't understand or acknowledge the risk of too big blocks. It is a cold hard fact that Bitcoin can't scale with its current architecture. Bigger blocks increases all kinds of costs, this means it won't be economical to add all transactions.
And people who want smaller blocks even understand that we also need to scale on-chain. 
There is only a difference in values and timing. 


The economy decides already anyway. Only thing we can do is give it options, and delay things and thereby add cost (with threats and coercion).


Seems you described powerful economic forces. These are indeed in control. But in a "what they do/want needs to add value kind of way". Not in a "they have weight so they can do whatever they want". 


At some basic level Bitcoin development isn't technically centralised because anyone can fork. In reality it is not that black and white. As you see all kinds of threats being made against people who dare to defy them. 
The reality is that their governance structure and processes lead to suboptimal choices, because they always value technical concerns over economic's. This is also literally what they admit, that they can't reach consensus on a blocksize limit increase via Hardfork. But the fact that they can't reach consensus, doesn't mean the economy can't. Those are at odds with each other. 
This is also because of a diffusion of responsibility. But in reality they all share blame when their process fails us. 
Not allowing competition is always a dickhead move in my book. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:05:10


We were talking in the context of the economic majority keeping blocks smaller. Then the fixed block size limit only works if they actually want the 1mb limit. Not the most flexible solution ;).

Sure but I don't claim consider.it is perfect. But for self governance and gauging opinions it is fine. And there are ways to make it better, verifiable, open source etc.

It doesn't pretend to be more than consensus regarding Bitcoin classic itself. Actual consensus is still emergent consensus (whatever software people run).
So I don't really get your point. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:15:42
The auxiliary block simply can create more coins. So not all coins can move back to the old chain. 
Lets say you have three people A, B and C. A stays on the old software, B and C move all their coins to the new chain (lets say 100 BTC each). Now C is a miner and he gets 50 BTC mining fee. Now C is able to send 150BTC back to A. This is possible because 200BTC was taken out of the old chain, and 150BTC put back. B can now only send 50BTC back to the old chain. 
Question is whether this is evil. But it is definitely a proper soft-fork (not a soft hardfork). 
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:00:05
There should have been a discussion about what is consensus means in the first place. There are so many words which are thrown around as if they are anywhere close to being clearly defined. 
What it seems like is that developer consensus is fine for softforks, which is can then seek emergent consensus in the network. 
But for hard-forks a whole different type of consensus is demanded. Core developers not being on board seems to mean that there is no consensus. 
This gives Core developers a veto against doing hardforks, and maybe it gives any minority a veto. I guess doesn't see the danger in that line of thinking. Because now it is the blocksize-limit, but what about something he would agree with. Would he then still like giving a minority veto powers? 
If he continues down this road he is going to end up on the wrong side of Bitcoin's history. As someone who singlehandedly decided what consensus should mean for the entire community.

No, pools can't do whatever they want with their own farms, because they have an obligation towards investors. Even adding some kind of centralized control would be a severe risk, and totally unnecessary for something like Bitcoin which is already decentralized. (big miners will have multiple farms which operate independently). 
And pools can't obviously do whatever they with regard to miners who join them voluntarily. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:24:26
If miners can not survive on miner fees alone one thing could happen: the mining deficit could be subsidised by businesses and individuals. Individuals would mine and not care about losing a little (and do it out of love). And bitcoin businesses would see it as a simple expense. 
The profitability of mining by itself causes mining centralisation. 
The simple solution would be to drive the price down, for instance by keeping the 1mb limit. Or if individuals and businesses who believe in Bitcoin invest in mining hardware (preferably the most efficient kind so that losses are minimal). 
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:10:15

So reddit sucks that it allows this shit. Or that majority rules. 
I would have downvoted you, were it not for the "coercive sneaky hardfork" remark which is a bit much. We are either coerced into a fee market by a minority, or a minority is coerced into bigger blocks by a majority. Hard to find moral high-ground there, don't you think?

No you are absolutely right! If the value of Bitcoin drops then the security would also drop because you would have less miners and less nodes. We really must be wary for the Bitcoin price to go down because we run into the limit. And one thing we must really look at is altcoins going up in price and bitcoin going down. Because that would signal that we are indeed hurting Bitcoin's price. Because historically (and logically) the price of Bitcoin and altcoins was related in the opposite way (up = altcoin more up, down = altcoin more down).

The idea that their ability to code gives them permission to govern is ludicrous, but so is pissing on everything they do because of one disagreement between them and the Bitcoin economy. 
Although they should be ridiculed for stating that "if a hardfork can happen to raise the limit to 2mb, then anything can happen". Because don't forget that they signed the Scalability roadmap which states raising the limit to 4Mb. To now claim raising to 2Mb is so bad when they signed off on 4Mb is madness. 
And don't get me started about soft and hardforks. Because you can change the 21 million limit with a Softfork. Pretending that fooling old clients into not validating additional functionality is always better than clean hardforks is ridiculous.

Source and proof please. In reality all arguments against increasing the blocksize-limit also reflect cost in increasing the actual blocksize. With current tech blocks can't even become bigger than 30 Mb, because of orphan risks. Miners showing caution in increasing the limit also proofs that incentives are there to keep block-size down.

Miners are already not adding all transactions. Miners still seem to be running with 750Kb limits. And miners seem to even be behind not raising the limit itself. 
There is simply no way that miners can create larger and larger blocks without consequence. If bigger blocks have an associated cost, then this cost needs to be accounted for by miners. 
What you believe in is some kind of tragedy of the commons type of situation. But blocksize isn't some finite resource where you suddenly have a problem if blocks go over a certain level. 
What is also possible is that the level of centralisation the market is comfortable with does not align with yours. Although even if they are not that far apart, then this is still about who controls the limit. 


It is a choice between growth which can lead to more decentralisation by itself, vs a non compromising view on decentralisation and a centralisation of control. 
Clearly letting the market decide is the correct choice. If only because centralised control is unsustainable for a decentralised currency like Bitcoin. 
The only thing you accomplish is tearing up the community and ending up on the wrong side of Bitcoin's history. 
I think you want everyone to still be able to use Bitcoin, without fear of censorship, but higher fees could do exactly the opposite by raising the barrier to entry. And the fee market might become a dangerous bubble by itself, fuelled by the false notion that higher fees means Bitcoin is more successful. This is a dangerous fallacy. Although I might be taking your views to the extreme, as you probably do regarding bigger blocks ;)

You guys realize that transactions are going to be valid on both chains for some time right? Send one transaction and you move both "coins". Only when you mix coins with newly minted coins your transactions will be rejected on the other chain. 
So you have 4 times slower blocks, transactions from both sides end up in both. So according to my calculation your confirmation time would be: never. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:20:18
"stolen" is a big word if it is allowed, but yes. 


Depends how you look at it. From the pov of someone who considers the old chain as the one true Bitcoin its not inflated. But from the pov of the economy old chain + new chain == Bitcoin, then coins are indeed inflated. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:28:38


Yes it would. All coins send from the old chain to the new chain become available in spend-all outputs. So sending 150BTC back would grab 100BTC from B and 50BTC from C spend-all coins. 
An old node would accept such transactions just like they are going to do that for SW transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:05:06
You want Core dev's to admit that there is an economic argument to be made? While they do their best to keep repeating that it is just a technical decision. That objectively speaking choosing a SF SW over a 2Mb HF is always better, no discussion, no economic or community consensus needed. Good luck with that ;)
Everyone with half a brain knows full well that it was and still is a subjective risk assessment between the two. That this isn't a black and white issue. 
This is about risk, thus about cost, thus something which needed economic consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:57:59
A limit on transaction size is actually something you **can** remove easily. At least if it is a soft-limit, not a hard limit. Sometimes I know what I'm talking about ;)
Edit: This time I might have been talking out off my ass ;). Ignore this entire comment please. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 10:29:29
How would you use that to attack someone? Make sure someone thinks a transaction didn't went through? 
And why don't nodes sent proof that certain transactions do not exist? As in "I looked here, see it's not there". Isn't there some kind binary search merkle tree?

@_date: 2016-01-30 10:20:09
Sorry, but it doesn't matter if the real cost of a fee-event is high or not. There might be a 10% chance of a big fee-event, a 20% chance of a medium fee-event, and a 90% chance of subtle fee-event. It doesn't matter. 
Potential risks all have a cost and need to be accounted for. Even if certain event's won't happen, it is still due diligence to take them into account when making decisions. 
For instance a 500Kb limit is even safer right? But you understand that a less valuable Bitcoin is actually less secure right?

@_date: 2016-01-17 13:41:20
If he defines "protocol" like that then yes. But clearly miner policy is also something which should see scrutiny and can deteriorate Bitcoin as a whole. 
In the most broad sense Bitcoin's protocol does include miner policy. And it should. It is very essential. A predictable miner policy is a more usable Bitcoin. 
That makes even policy changes something which need consensus. They have real world economic consequence. If only (in the case of Opt-in RBF) it forces wallets/merchants to invest significant development effort, and that if Opt-in RBF is released too soon it has real world security/usability consequences.
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:36:41


No, that's wrong. 


You are proving my point that it is about cost actually. You just perceive it as gigantic unrecoverable cost. But looking at how consensus is already forming around doing a hardfork means that most don't agree with you. 
The biggest reason why a hardfork is contentious is because it could be dangerous, and it could be dangerous because it is contentious. See the circular logic there? 


I'm not saying there are no tradeoffs. I'm just saying the tradeoff is surely not at 1Mb, that's just a random number Satoshi chose. If the cost of adding more transactions is higher than the added income then that already limits the blocksize from growing indefinitely. For instance with current tech we can't grow beyond 30Mb blocks. So there are definitely "natural" limits in place. 
I'm just arguing against arbitrary artificial ones. BIP000 is the worst BIP we never designed, never asked for and has no consensus whatsoever. Are we really still debating this nonsense?


Bitcoin would not be killed, its value would simply drop and an alt-coin would take over. Further more if you think introducing a fee market isn't something which needs economic consensus then you are truly lost. 


What you are basically saying - which seems to be a recurring theme for Core dev's and their followers - is that you are smarter than everyone else. You can't win an argument? Just say that that is because you are smarter. Because that will surely help.

I guess you mean the people who want bigger blocks are the 10%. But that is very unlikely. Its probably the other way around. The problem is that there are a lot of people just lurkers/followers. Lots of people "trapped" inside forums controlled by one entity. Lots of people who simply still run Core nodes, not as a conscious vote. 
Looking at different voting systems (reddit, consider.it, miners) it is clear that a large majority want bigger blocks (even if it is just a little). 
If a Yes needs overwhelming consensus, but a No doesn't. Then it is not really weird that some people get offended and angry. And if policy changes and soft-forks get pushed through without any consensus at all, then that adds insult to injury. 
Not to mention Core dev's saying Bitcoin is whatever software people run, but still not distancing themselves from blatant censorship of software which actually want's to gain consensus of their own. 
It's either cognitive dissonance or malice. What do you think? 


If you are comfortable with Bitcoin getting overtaken by alt-coins which can innovate. Then fine. 


There is the nirvana fallacy again. 


I don't join in on stupid slippery slope arguments. If you want to explain why a raising the block-size limit is comparable with raising the 21 million cap, then I'm all ears. I don't see it.

I don't love arguing. I love explaining things. And I like to go against the stream. It gives me no pleasure to be in an echo chamber and preach to the choir. I can do more good here. Create some mutual understanding. 
It is a bit sad that in order to fix a short term problem, there needs to be a full development plan, and all processes need to already be in place. Any project which is starting out can be shot to pieces immediately because of things which are missing. These things don't suddenly appear in perfect order. Any good person would actively support competition. But that's just my pov. 


All big projects which are the result of democratic countries? But you are probably doing a "design by democracy" strawman. 
The only thing I do know is that any governance model which gives everyone a veto will eventually run into issues. It is a form of diffusion of responsibility, which can be debilitating. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:12:20
I calculated 2 weeks on average because you need on average around 1008 blocks (2016 / 2), at 20 minutes per block on average that's 2 weeks.  Your calculation was a little bit less coarse than mine but you still at just 17.5 days for the difficulty to adjust (1008/2.4/24).
You are talking about a doom scenario. I think its a huge opportunity for miners to jump in. Because difficulty is going to be adjusted down, so mining becomes a lot easier (eventually), and thus more profitable. 
The reality is that its about belief. If enough people believe that Bitcoin would be lost in such a scenario than that becomes the reality. And if people think Bitcoin is going to survive then it is going to. Both self fulfilling prophecies. 
So the question is, if we lose 60% of hashing power. Would you go around the community and proclaim the end of Bitcoin and try to persuade everyone to turn their hashing power to alt coins? Or would you join in and ask people to start mining (again) and hang in there? 


This is actually the most important part of it. And deserves its own post I would say. I am also still optimistic that blocksize is going to be increased. But if that doesn't happen your scenario is suddenly much much more likely. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:56:54
So when can you consider it stable? What if someone has a zero-day which can completely crash SW validation?

Opt-in RBF is highly controversial and attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus. So should this post be permitted? 
I'm still waiting for a definition on consensus or even what constitutes the protocol.  
Protocol: "the official procedure or system of rules governing affairs". Seems like in Bitcoin protocol might even mean more than just its network protocol.

In euro's I probably put in a total of 400 or something. So yes, i'm a spender, not a hodler ;). Does that explain my POV?
And i'm not a supporter of a quick hardfork. I'm a supported of finding economic consensus. Whatever shape or form that has. Support means:


In the same vein I support Core. 
So basically I support fair competition. So i'm more against all kinds of attacks against alternative clients, like censorship, DDOS attacks, personal attacks, and all kinds of threats.

@_date: 2016-01-12 12:40:04
Why? 
You might be able to argue that legacy coins and &gt;1mb coins are not equally fungible, and that that by itself is a huge problem to all coins.

And they have no right (or chance) to do that without consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:01:37
The new chain has its own coin-base transactions. It's like fractional reserve. If there is no bank-run on old coins then there should not be a problem. 
For instance if the old chain is only 1Mb and the new chain is bigger, that could already incentive transactions to move to the new chain (less fees etc). 
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:22:14
Even Gregory proposed to do a simple hardfork first which isn't contentious. I would be very happy if they did only a 1Mb increase just a test. The decentralisation sky is definitely nog going to fall if they did that. 
Although maybe - just maybe - finding out what happens when we hit the limit is more valuable than not hitting the limit. But on principle I still think that is an action which needs consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:41:18

"A simple hard fork" is a hard fork which is relatively simple. Its also about implementation and not per see about deployment. 
You have simple hard forks and complicated hard forks, and simple soft forks and complicated soft forks. And a simple hard fork might still be harder than complex soft fork. 
Although for in the case of a Segregated Witness soft-fork and a Blocksize increase hard fork, I think the block-size increase wins in terms being simple in implementation **and** deployment. But that is very subjective. 
We don't have enough data on hard forks to substantiate that. It should be a priority to get some. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:39:22


No I didn't want to imply that. Dictatorship was in the context of Jonathan Toomim being the dictator of Classic. So dictator for your specific client. I don't think anyone is forced to run their code, or anyone's code. 
But there is an aspect of "if you do X very good, that should not imply Y being good". A bit like: with great power comes great responsibility. Even if that power isn't unlimited. 
If I drive the car, should I be able to choose the music? It is a bit like that. 


I also see good reasons for everything they do. Their plan is technically very good. My objections are more about communication, leadership, giving a voice/vote to the community, and making an honest cost based assessment. 
I see Core dev's making economical arguments, talking about spam transactions and cheap transactions. At the end of the day it really boils down to economics and not just tech. 


You do realize Jonathan Toomim is a miner right? You do realize that Bitpay is pretty a very important economical player right? You do understand that Gavin is also not someone to dismiss as being unimportant. And this all started with the **rejection** of BIP101. Actual code. 
And do you think miners run Bitcoin Core? 
The reality is that no-one can contribute anything controversial to Bitcoin Core. Not even the Core dev's themselves. 
So you are dead wrong. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:40:25
True, but sadly there can be in-between situations where Classic does not get 100% right away. Where the majority of the community forces  a minority to upgrade. 
But one thing is for sure. The most popular and valuable cryptocurrency will be Bitcoin. It was probably unstoppable from the moment Satoshi left. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:36:22


Fees do seem to [rise]( though. But mostly in the low-end range, but that is to be expected. And even for normal transactions fees are getting more erratic. This is not really something you can deny. But mainly look at the cost of getting into the 2nd block. This forebodes what fees for getting in the 1st block is going to look like. 


If everyone like you thinks it is not urgent, then that becomes reality. If everyone does think it is urgent, then it is (weighed by economic influence). Your single personal opinion by itself isn't really important, except if you represent a large chunk of the Bitcoin economy. 


Again, that is cost based. Perceived cost of doing a hardfork &gt; perceived cost of not doing an increase or doing it only via SF SW = Hardfork now. 
It doesn't really matter what you think about it.

It is a valid script in the eye of older clients. That's all it knows. There is no "what is this banana thing?" algorithms in Bitcoin. A transaction is either valid or invalid. There are no "this block is valid but this transaction is still suspect" algorithms. Would be weird if there are two types of validations. 
This is a problem for 0-conf, this is a problem when some miners still create old blocks (which do not validate witness data), and this is a problem for SPV clients which are on a attackers chain. In all situations an attacker can spend other peoples SW coins. 
Creating such new transactions is another matter of course. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:09:10


But that's not really blocksize related. If they wanted to they could already prevent all Bitcoin traffic, causing a (temporary?) fork. With a big part of the Bitcoin economy on one side, and a majority of miners on another. I don't really know what is going to happen, but that is going to hurt pretty bad.
There is not a lot we could do to mitigate such risk. Except maybe try to circumvent the Great Firewall altogether. 
What we can do is already make sure we have a plan to control the damage, like:
1. add a checkpoint to Bitcoin software for the first block which is available to Chinese miners 
1. promise to divide miner revenues with orphans at the same level
@_date: 2016-01-09 10:03:58
It is actually possible, they could do a soft fork side-chain already. Where only summaries and transactions to non upgraded old-addresses are put into the old blocks.

So if Core refuses a certain fix and the everyone wants it, then we should just give up? What exactly are you suggesting? That core developers are in complete control? 


There is no losing implementation. If there is economic/miner consensus on raising to 2mb via hardfork, and it seems like a hardfork is inevitable then Core can (and probably will) add an increase themselves as well. 
You might not be comfortable with such a thing. But that is how Bitcoin was designed. 


It is always "[the other side]( which is divisive right? ;)

Refuting a strawman by doubling down. Without being a store of value you can't even have Bitcoin as a Payment system. This is a ludicrous statement anyway you cut it.

Just because he doesn't make economical arguments doesn't mean there aren't any. And he makes them all the time. Transactions being cheap, no-one being prevented to use Bitcoin etc. 


At one point the developers chose to develop for the most popular/valuable cryptocurrency.

Exactly! I'm still waiting on the design of BIP000.

Why would you ever give a random 5% of miners the power veto any change? What exactly makes them so important? 
Probably the reason you like this is because you don't agree with this particular change. But imaging the tables being reversed. There is no block-size limit and the Core dev's want to roll out a hard-fork to introduce one. 
At what % do you think such a change should be activated? 
Would you want just 5% of miners to not see the danger of bigger blocks and be able to stop it indefinitely?

All nodes can make a reasonable guess per transaction per block wether the transaction was replaced just by having seen an earlier one.

Conceptually it is already more complicated. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:56:53
Well judging by the mood on Core's Slack and the fact that they were talking about changing the POW, I'd say not good. There seem to be irreconcilable differences. 
Again not from the round table but from the Core/Classic slacks: 
One side says "We want global consensus from (and interaction with) the community on software at the least for changes which have economical consequences, whether they are deployed through mining policy, softforks or hardforks. We wanted a blocksize limit increase for years, and now we want it ASAP, we think trying to get consensus on a 2Mb HF is still a good way to go about it, but we have no problem when real consensus forms around SW."
 
And the other side says "If technical decisions can be made by popular vote then Bitcoin can no longer guarantee its security, decentralisation, scale and thereby it's permission-less nature. If such a hard-fork were to happen we would be forced to change the POW to make sure there always is a Bitcoin which stays true to those ideals."

@_date: 2016-01-14 10:17:25
No of course. Time wrap seems like a bug, would be nice if you could squash it. 
Ultimately this is about comparing two chains. If you also consider any other metric than amount of work you might actually tip the scale the wrong way to allow &lt;50% attacks. 
As far as I can tell huge re-orgs are major events in the Bitcoin world, whatever the cause. Maybe we don't need an algorithm but rather economic consensus which one is correct. Add one simple filter to the software and a chain is suddenly worthless.
And the funny thing is, merely the idea that a small software fix could completely wipe out an attackers chain should already demotivate an attack in the first place.  
This is also something which is relevant for when the Great Firewall completely shuts down. At the moment we reconnect we might want to choose the chain on the economic side of the wall, not the one with most hashing power. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:30:18
Thanks! This is very enlightening.

@_date: 2016-01-30 19:07:41
Read the article, and I didn't really find a clear cut way to "save bitcoin's node network from Centralisation". 
I also never understood how someone would fool an SPV client with a fake chain. Seriously, how would someone fake 6 confirmations with the correct difficulty and confirmation speed? Wouldn't that need an insane amount of hashing power, which makes you lose out on 6 * 25 BTC = $57.000 worth of mining reward, and which if the attack became public would devalue the very currency you are mining in the first place. 
How can you ever expect to steal more than the attack costs? 
What do I miss here? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 09:23:40


With things like letsencrypt.org it becomes a lot easier actually. Clearly not everyone cares about encryption. So having default encryption would probably have resulted in bad encryption anyway (because of the same people who would not have cared enough).

@_date: 2016-01-26 20:06:08
Very insightful! Why are people down-voting you? 
@_date: 2016-01-11 09:54:18
A no against a normal increase in 2016 then. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:09:48
And miners are now heavier invested than ever. Their vote should still be representative. Probably even more so than before (being vulnerable to bot-nets and all). 
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:36:27
That still doesn't make sense. So you had a transaction with enough fees to get confirmed quickly under normal circumstances then this transactions should not drop off all mempools when there is a surge. If you do zero-conf you care less about confirmation times, don't you? Why would you care if it takes longer if your transactions is already accepted? 
And on top of that natural surges are not likely to happen so quickly. 
If there is a surge or blocks are full we have bigger problems than RBF becoming popular. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:33:07
As I understood the legacy blocks will be empty, are they not?  
Edit: yes they are.


This is why it is an soft hard-fork because it still essentially destroys old clients. In a different way than hard forks, but still.

Zero compromise is not doing a simple hard fork to get the experience with doing hard forks. They could have planned an increase to 1.2 Mb. 
Calling what they are doing zero compromise is not trolling, because it is a fact.  
Please show me the data and research which says 1Mb is the correct limit at this moment.

@_date: 2016-01-21 09:59:01
Because that can only be done via softforks.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:41:32
Not really. The possibility of forking should be enough to not give one client full control over Bitcoin. Combined with the fact that the code is open source. If it wasn't then we would be screwed. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 12:48:16
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:42:19
If Core's code has merit it should still be considered. I hope people don't hold grudges. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 07:53:07


No, the core-dev's essentially said no to an increase for years and years and seemingly never wanted to compromise
And the fact that people think that blocksizelimit == blocksize doesn' mean Gavin was wrong with his 20Mb proposal, it means he misjudged how much distrust there was against miners (probably due to a lot of propaganda). 
20Mb would not have been an issue because miners would not suddenly create 20Mb blocks. Real cost to bigger blocks would have kept them down anyway. This is something people seem to not realize, not want to realize, I dont know. Its weird. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:16:18
That is just rude and unnecessary. Core still has the best Bitcoin developers there are. We can disagree with them on one important point and still not have to hate them for it. It is not like they are completely wrong. Doing a increase to 2Mb isn't even **that** much different than their scaling plan.  
All their concerns are still valid. Dismissing everything they say, and everything they create would be a grave mistake!
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:48:23
Considering a theoretical attack is one thing. Steering the entire Bitcoin economy into a direction without consensus because of it is another matter all-together. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:10:54
Well, isn't that ironic ;)
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:42:21
So you are saying there are economic incentives in place not to create bigger blocks? So are you promoting Bitcoin Unlimited here? Not afraid of Theymos? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:52:33
But that doesn't make sense. If the only reason a hardfork is contentious is because it is a hardfork which might be contentious. Then that reason is weird. 
No one wants to have a split. And with 75% activation that's also unlikely to happen. 
And the "this thing which we don't like can change via hardfork, then everything can change" is also ridiculous. As you can also change anything via softforks.

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:02:29
Are you a broken record? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:28:44


True, luckily there was never even a hint that something like that would be added or has been added. What was added is node prioritisation, where Tor nodes were given a lower priority in case of a DDOS attack. You know the ones specifically against all non core nodes. You seem a bit misinformed. 


Opt-in RBF is actually also not as bad as most people think. Its not going to kill off zero-conf for instance. And the development effort for payment processors/merchants/wallet dev's is also minimal. Contrary to popular belief. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:10:24
Like XT classic isn't some kind of power grab. Maybe the community should first get consensus about what constitutes consensus? 
Bitcoin Classic is probably going to implement a 75% vote between miners (like BIP101). Which you could call emergent consensus. 
But maybe they are going to act more responsible by getting enough of the economy and miners on board before they promote miners to vote?
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:37:08


No, what makes you say that? 


No, that is also blatantly false. No level of **want** to contribute to Core would make you a Core dev, and no contentious issue will ever be added to Core. Irregardless of the weight of your vote. 
And having developers with votes weighted on the number of commits to a project making economical decisions is stranger than gauging support from everyone/miners/developers/businesses to guide development. 
Guess which one is better at delivering what people actually want?
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:50:02
Sure yes, it's good when its optimised. No developer really sleeps well if they still have important O(n^2) algorithms to solve.

By their regular employer. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:49:55


It's not an idea. It is positioned as a principle, something meant NOT to be changed. It is actually the most voted principle on there. Maybe do some research yourself. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:54:32


Because that uncertainty already exists? Clearly defining what can and can't be replaced isn't a bad thing for zero-conf. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:57:38


You can't keep using software which doesn't work anymore. And who would live under a rock, but still use Bitcoin, and not see the big message which says you need to upgrade, and not care about confirmations? 
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:52:21
That would be expensive, with very little chance of any gains. 
At 10% hashing power remaining (unlikely), it would probably take more than an hour for a block to be found at all. With Core (or a Core) version forking off by themselves to a new hashing algorithm would make it even weirder to stay in the old Core version. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:04:46

@_date: 2016-01-15 08:42:11
75% of miners being stupid is not realistic, they can't afford to be misinformed. And not following the economy would be suicide. Unsellable mining rewards would kinda kill it even when a miner is "not aligned" with Bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:00:32


Yes it is. The more hashing power the more a miner is economically invested. And that makes a miner represent the economy.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:08:48
No, maybe yes, old blocks would need to be supported forever because you need to be able to download them later. Although maybe validation can be skipped for old blocks. 
I recently saw Gregory Maxxwell say something like "the longest chain != bitcoin", so that would mean you can't just grab the longest chain and forgo validation. 
Not a clear answer sorry ;)
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:07:27


Because they hate these stupid discussions.
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:11:19
A contentious SW soft fork is one which causes arguments and is therefor likely to not to get universally adopted. Or it is contentious because it activates at a dangerously low threshold. Contentious because it is complex and pushed way to fast/hard. Contentious because it is/has a blocksize rider. Contentious because it is the only blocksize increase planned by Core. Contentious like how XT/BIP101 is described by "small-blockers". 
I'm just countering the notion that a soft fork is always much better than a hard fork. If you sell SW as a blocksize increase then its definitely not safer than a simple increase via hard fork. But not all soft forks are created equal, just like not all hard forks are. 
If Segregated Witness is positioned as the only blocksize increase, it should at least honestly get compared to simple blocksize increased through hard forks. Conceptual discussions about the soft forks and hard forks help no-one. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:46:50
Whatever your opinion, any decision which has economic impact needs economic consensus. The choice to go with a Softforking SW instead of a HF might be the best thing but not including the community/economy in that decisions was very wrong anyway. People are rightfully upset. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:20:02
I added it also to consider.it [here](
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:24:26


There is no right and wrong. There is however one choice in terms of blocksize which brings the most economic value. No amount of debates is ever going to give us the best value, except if we trust the market. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:11:58


Would that not be a reason to not confuse technical and economic decisions? 


If Bitcoin doesn't follow actual economic consensus, and isn't driven by what people actually want. Then it is by all means already doomed. 
Bigger projects have fallen from greater heights because of the Stack Fallacy. Technically superior != most valuable. Not by a long shot. 
If you are a long term holder, you should aware. And at least broaden your horizon and honestly look at alternatives. There can be no downside to looking right?
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:48:10
That's why I asked a question if they were just trolling ;)
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:18:25
Because people were asking for bigger transactions? 
People were asking for bigger blocks, so I really don't see the appeal for bigger-blockers. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:42:27
This is all so ironic. People hammering on a hard limit on blocksize, but refusing a pragmatic limit on transactions. 
You can't argue against raising the hardlimit because we can't have a hardlimit on transactions. The blocksize hardlimit **is** a limit on transaction size. 
Obviously improving scalability of transactions is nicer. But come on. Be reasonable here. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:25:37
Of course. But even with that in mind, a leader who can transcend that would be better than no leader. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:01:06
Sure, I agree. Bare-metal consensus for Bitcoin simply means whatever code everyone uses.

@_date: 2016-01-18 06:50:41
I think that is a bit much. But creating a new governing structure for Bitcoin would not be so bad. 
What I like to say is that Core's inability to govern should not diminish their coding abilities, like their coding abilities didn't give them the ability (or right) to govern. 
I definitely don't really care about bruised ego's. If they care about Bitcoin they won't see this as getting fired. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:19:11
So you believe there is consensus on doing a 2Mb hardfork, and that Opt-in RBF and Segregated Witness as a Soft-fork are both contentious (and don't have consensus)?

@_date: 2016-01-31 15:06:07

A pow with lower difficulty can not be considered "the best POW". Anything less should be too easy to produce, anything too hard is almost impossible to create (for the same block you ultimately mine).

@_date: 2016-01-31 20:22:04

You do realize you can change anything with a soft fork right, including the 21 million cap?
@_date: 2016-01-14 09:42:34
It seems like things being possible and forgetting about incentives is also what got is in the whole blocksize-limit debate. 
Clearly that is a dangerous mindset to have. A little bit of realism and pragmatism is very important to have. 
For instance the "selfish miner" theory might have done more damage as a way to increase fear within the community of growth, than it will ever do in practice. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:13:56
I would not claim a hardfork is without risk. And if the hardfork isn't contentious amongst the Bitcoin economy, then there isn't a lot of risk involved anymore. Pretty straightforward. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:38:51
Exactly! No core developer however much code he/she writes should give authority to make economic decisions for everyone. It is also unlikely to be the best decision anyway. Also 1Mb being a completely arbitrary limit and all. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:31:08
Doesn't this prevent older nodes from functioning at all? Why not make it actually backward compatible? Why do all transactions need to move from the old blocks to the new? 
Something like this seems better:
@_date: 2016-01-05 13:49:49
Its not really likely that a wallet makes RBF transactions default but not offer functionality to manage and take advantage of RBF transactions. 
Overall its also more likely that RBF doesn't become the default for most wallets because it makes things way more complicated. It is way easier to just be generous with fees to prevent actually needing RBF. 
So Generous + No RBF, or Cheapskate + RBF. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:23:59
I already saw this one floating by on reddit. I thought it was a joke to make fun of Soft forks being safe. 


Doing so much work just to kill off old clients like that. Seems like a hard fork does pretty much the same thing except you need a supermajority for it to have the same effect. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:40:31
Very well done. Very neutral indeed. 
send 1 biertje
But, to add two more important details:
It is also possible to increase the blocksize limit through a softfork, but that would add significant complexity. It would be like Segregated Witness on steroids so it can also segregate transactions. Old nodes would continue to function as normal and would not see the &gt;1mb transactions, but they can still transact to/from newer nodes and new addresses. 
And to make it even more complex, a blocksize increase can also be implemented with a soft hardfork. This means that older nodes would only see empty blocks and therefor cease to function. 
Both these softforks have the advantage of not splitting the network in two. But like all Softforks they add unnecessary complications and cruft in the software and protocol. 
Small blockers tend to favour Softforks, Bigblockers tend to favour Hardforks.

Choosing SF SW over a 2-4-8 HF without economic consensus is no governance model at all. There is no logical reason why emergent consensus is fine for Softforks and not for Hardforks. That is a risk based assessment, thus about cost, and therefor an economic decision. 
If you are really defending a governance model, maybe you should try to explain what this model actually entails. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:30:40
I'm not against SW, just have my reservations doing it as a SF and doing it fast. And I personally don't think there are purely objective arguments on either side. So disagreeing with certain arguments is in reality a different subjective value assessment of risks. And risks == cost, cost == economics, means economic consensus is needed. 
There is no point in disagreeing with a risk assessment. You can try to run the numbers and proof a 1Mb-1.6Mb Bitcoin is more valuable in the long run. Making an honest economical argument with data to back it up. 
This has not happened. Because the argument is framed as purely technical. I don't know what is worse, Core dev's being clueless about economics or that they push their own agenda.

I see nothing wrong with Jeff's patch. I fully agree with him actually, that would have been perfect if that would have been added. 


Well clearly we couldn't. Which in retrospect makes Jeff's case, not break it. 
But i suspect that wasn't the point you wanted to make ;)
I'm one of the few people who believe that the block-size limit should get out of the way actual transaction volume, and that soft limits and orphan limits are WAY better for making sure blocks don't become dangerously big. 
The closer we come to the limit the more we believe we need it. Weird.

Using Bitcoin to create ASIC hardware would probably be the slowest and the most expensive way to go about it. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 09:48:50


The longest valid chain would not be rejected. Only if the old software did a hard fork by themselves, but that would make it new software, not old. 


I don't want to troll the developers, or bother them, or paint them in a bad light. They seem to be very consistent actually. And they are entitled to their opinion. And I even stick up for them and their ideas on other forums (and getting downvoted in the process). 
What I have issue with is Theymos and his moderation tactics. He is the one who claims hard forks are bad because if you can change the blocksize with a contentious hard fork, you can change anything (even the 21 million limit). 
And as an extension I have an issue with developers not distancing themselves from him. There is some cognitive dissonance going on there. Although censorship also isn't nearly as bad as many people claim. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:31:19

I don't think it is likely that the majority of miners are the spammers. My idea was more like a definitive way to make it very clear by nodes that they wont accept certain block sizes. (for whatever reason). 
Spammers are in my book people who spam the blockchain. 
If you are talking about selfish miners who spam huge blocks then that is another story. But they would also not need to create bigger blocks to selfish mine in the first place. They could use blocksize as some kind of plausible deniability thing, "Ich habe es nicht gewußt!"-kind of thing. But then being openly nefarious would kinda defeat that. 
I don't think there is a clean way for the economic majority to force miners into compliance.

Consensus seems to mean multiple things: developer consensus, emergent consensus or broad community consensus. Depending on the context these things change. 
Core dev's / Bitcoin.org seemed to tweak the needed consensus arbitrarily, but I see there could be a clear policy. Would have been nice if they explained it like this:


Is it possible that core-dev's didn't want to admit that you can literally change anything using soft-forks? Scared of opening a pandora's box? I mean look at [this]( post over at Buttcoin linking to a post of mine.

Bitcoin can definitely scale to 2Mb, I didn't say it could grow indefinitely. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:19:38
1. I think its stupid to try to predict the future, or how much we need to cater to amateur nodes for that matter. Moore and Nielsen's law completely obliterate the idea that keeping the 1mb limit somehow kept the barrier for nodes the same. When in reality it lowered the bar. Catering to amateur nodes which are already running for years is in my opinion ridiculous. Given that everyone wants to upgrade the blocksize limit, I would say the market agrees. 
1. I think he wanted to argue that centralisation has a cost, but that a zero-tollerance viewpoint might not be reasonable. I tend to agree. And like I said, I think the market agrees.
1. The number of amateur nodes who drop out does not need to offset the number of new nodes but they might still be able to handle more SPV clients. A more professional network would have less but more capable nodes. Don't think you could disagree with that.
1. You seem positive about bigger blocks here. :D. Bigger blocks are indeed mainly needed for surges.

What is the problem with creating software but clearly stating that running the software is at your own risk? I mean being risk averse is nice, until calcifies development. 
I mean, you also might not want your children to have sex yet, but wouldn't you give them protection anyway? 
The code dev's create software, the economy takes on certain risks. That is already the case anyway. Because Core can only increase the cost of increasing the limit, but not prevent it. Incidentally, the cost added by core always ends up devaluating Bitcoin, and thereby decreases its security. 
They are not helping at all.

Core dev's saying that Bitcoin is whatever software everyone runs, and then at the same time have Bitcoin.org do things like this. That creates a huge backlash against the Core dev's and probably against Bitcoin as a whole.  
I implore you to do the right thing by doing one of the following things:
1. Allowing the promotion of alternative clients (maybe draw the line at promoting miners to switch/activate hard forks before a large majority of economic dependent nodes are upgraded)
1. Create a good way of finding broad consensus  (make an effort in finding the people who are important in the Bitcoin community and bring them together, and actively steering Bitcoin in that direction)
1. By plainly admitting that r/Bitcoin and all your websites are behind Bitcoin Core and its current scaling plan (still giving you the freedom to change later on)

@_date: 2016-01-12 11:05:54
You must also know that a soft hardfork can be countered by a software update to "old nodes" which will simply reject the new blocks (by detecting they are upgraded) and then still create hardfork.
My argument against that would be that that would be a conscious choice to fork, and would at least leave no-one accidentally on a dangerous fork.

Bitcoin can be a success in a way which still unfairly undermines certain businesses. 
And Blockstream with its core dev's is by definition a "conflict of interest". Although that word has a negative connotation which is not always warranted. 
If you ask me "Are core developers going against the best interest of Bitcoin because they are employed by Blockstream?" then I would definitely say that that is highly unlikely. 
"Is it possible that the interests of Blockstream negatively impact certain aspects of the Bitcoin community?" they I would say yes to that as well.
"Is the net benefit of Blockstream positive or negative?" The amount of development work sponsored by Blockstream is so huge, that it is almost impossible for it not to have a positive influence. And the split in the community is not due to Blockstream but due to the action (or inactions) of individual developers and Theymos specifically. 
People who want to assume malice and see weird conspiracy theories are going to do so regardless of circumstances. But there is definitely room for improvement. A statement against moderation of alternative clients would be nice, by either Blockstream or Bitcoin Core dev's. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:56:11

I will assume users == miners and fee market == current fee market, else it doesn't make sense. 
The whole reason why there will be an artificial market for fees is because miners are willing to add more transactions but unable to. That's doesn't seem to be true ATM. 
And you can't really say that there already is a market for fees because they haven't started to rise significantly (still at 0.0009%).

I'm for a "hardfork dry run" but I think that should have happened a year ago. 
And you as a developer can make all the calculations you want. Your technical opinion does matter a lot(!), and even your view on economic's is valued. But any type of risk assessment is about cost, anything which deals with cost is about economics. Same goes for growth projections obviously for potential gains. 
You, and your fellow Core dev's have wrongfully assumed this is purely a technical issue. Or worse know full well the economic change event which has been / will be deployed by doing nothing (or doing too little in terms of blocksizelimit increase). 
So even choosing between 1.6Mb and 2Mb (assuming that they have the same timing) is an economic decision.
Core dev's and its followers can add more cost on the Hardfork side by making all kinds of threats. Threats of leaving Bitcoin development, threats of DDOS attacks, threats of POW changes, threats of making a HF more risky by refusing to upgrade, sybil attacks, personal attacks etc. But eventually that dam is going to burst anyway. 
You can choose to be on the right side or the wrong side of Bitcoin's history here, and help defuse that needlessly dangerous situation. Because even doing nothing reflects badly on you. 
Doesn't mean you have to go with popular opinion. But a statement like "Although we believe doing a SW SF is better and less risky, we will get behind a HF once a majority of economic dependent nodes have switched. We will make sure that even something we don't believe in will go as smoothly as possible." can go a long way at restoring peace. By using a carrot you regain control over the situation(!). That might even give the ability to steer the definition/perception of a safe HF (how many nodes need to have upgraded, or what businesses are important to be on board etc.).  
It's like giving your children condoms and having the talk: you don't want them to have sex, but if they do, they should at least do it safely. Right?
And this all isn't cause by Mike Hearn stirring up weird ideas. There are way too many nice and very smart people in the HF camp to make that unlikely. I like to think I'm part of the nice and smart people. And you must know that I never follow popular opinion. If everyone goes left I always evaluate for myself. And I do know all the risks/cost involved in upgrading the limit. I know, and I **do** care.

I would go even further and say that the tactic employed now is almost the worst way to promote Lightning. In terms of goodwill, and in terms of the ability building on top of Bitcoin growth, and in terms of transaction fees. 
If you want Lightning to fail, keeping the blocksize limit is the way to do it.

It seems to me that people tend to selectively forget about incentives. If you forget incentives then you would indeed be correct that a majority of miners can't just run a hard fork and that everyone needs to follow. Any miner running a fork which isn't economically accepted just throws his hashing power away. But this contradicts itself. 
What makes the whole system brilliantly designed is because miners **are** invested in Bitcoin economically themselves. That is what makes the whole system work. That's what makes a miners vote a representative economic vote.
I've heard people even say "If we could trust miners we would not need Bitcoin in the first place". The cognitive dissonance is huge with some people, it is really scary. 
If I see the distrust of miners dripping from the arguments of Core developers (and Adam Back) then everything starts to make sense. The fear of hard forking, the fear of bigger blocks, (accidental) selfish mining.
The core developers say things which really make me think that they would have NEVER ever build anything like bitcoin with those attitudes. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:59:01
Ok thanks! 
But don't think there is beauty in the idea that you can have your 500K blocks, and others can have &gt;1Mb blocks? I mean it doesn't solve mining propagation issues, but it does make sure people can keep running full nodes on limited hardware/bandwidth. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:39:16
Can you also describe these rules in a way that they are compatible with emerging consensus? 
For instance P% miners needed for a vote, and at least an B number of blocks before the hardfork is activated/enforced. 
Or do you categorically believe that miners could gain a certain % of votes without care for the Bitcoin economy?

Democracy usually allows everyone an equal vote, consider.it for classic is not that. Having any type of dialogue with users is a vast improvement than back/forth platforms like reddit. But still not perfect.


Better :D


I just recently subscribed to the dev mailing list. But the opposition to Opt-in RBF caught the dev's by surprise gives me the indication that it wasn't fully supported by everyone outside the dev's. 
And telling users to listen to technical discussions when it's about economics is weird. The choice for instance between a HF increase and a SF SW isn't merely technical. Something went terribly wrong there.


If there were no blatant attacks on competing products/services I would agree. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:51:25


Not really because that is not how it will work in practice. The lower the number the more careful miners need to be with voting. 
Voting by miners is a vote to **start activation** of the hard-fork. Consensus should have been informally reached before that. Or do you think that miners can only communicate through the blockchain? 
Anything above 50% should actually be enough. Because voting isn't some kind of election where the result is unknown until the election is over. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:10:07

Of course not. If alternative clients can implement a blocksize increase, Core can surely also do it. There is no technical reason why a hardfork is hard. There are mainly political reasons ATM why it is hard. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:20:28


And that is important and valuable. But know that a Bitcoin which is more valuable is also more secure, and is therefor more sound, not less. 
Your argument to prefer a technically more sound Bitcoin to becoming more mainstream doesn't seem to apply when going from 1Mb to 2Mb. It will start to apply at some level. But that to is an economic decision. There **is** an equilibrium to be found.

No its not. Just like HTTP isn't a core change of TCP-IP.  The only way its a change for wallets is for the UI, but that's probably not where the most work lies. 
Lightning is hard on the server side. That's the part which deals with routing and shit. The nodes do the heavy lifting mostly. The nodes deliver a service. 
Then you need a SPV wallet, create some special transaction to open a channel and then you talk to your node and ask him to do stuff for you. 
Obviously this is an oversimplification (and some wishful thinking) on my part. But at least it shows that it is **not** a core modification of existing wallets. 


Yes, its very handy to have a service which needs to always be connected on a device with limited battery life and connectivity. You are a fucking genius I tell you!
The whole point of Lightning is that it doesn't need trust. So why would you need to run your own service? 


Ever heard of this thing called the network effect? You can't have a explosion of any sort before wallets implement Lightning. Lightning is completely worthless (for wallet users) when no one uses Lightning. 


Yeah, I noticed. Its not just a mess. It is also very wrong for the most part.

The simplicity of BIP102-as-softfork is definitely very nice. But it would not satisfy people who are adamant on staying on the old chain. Getting forced onto the new chain immediately will probably cause a lot of resistance, although if that resistance never was of any economic significance then that should not be an issue. 


No extra transactions needed in my proposal, maybe because I don't do any mapping, is that what is different? Or maybe I just call it differently by calling it just witness data, like SW. 
Never seen the this proposal, so I still claim some smart points for myself ;).

@_date: 2016-01-20 10:43:29
And most crap we see (or are going to see) is because of their attitude. 
The main reason a hardfork is dangerous (or less than ideal) is because the atmosphere they created. DDOS attacks, personal attacks, censorship, people who will continue to mine on the 1Mb chain etc. 
Its like saying abstinence is the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and std's. Or telling a kid not to ride his bicycle because it's dangerous, and then kicking him to make sure he actually falls.

Old nodes would be none the wiser. Coin goes out, coin goes in, they can't see whether there is still another coin now alive on the other side. 
It would fall apart if there is no demand for the new coins. 
This would only work if an economic majority and a majority of miners are like: "yay!! Inflation!!". But not everyone needs to be on board.
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:10:09
A hurried hardfork simply has a greater cost associated with it. Just like a hardfork to a client with a lesser known dev-team. Or when it is perceived as firing Core dev's. 
The cost of not doing an increase only rises, so at one point there will be critical mass one way or another. 
That doesn't mean people throw caution in the wind.

Let me give you the text from the homepage, so you actually know what you are talking about and you don't do accidental strawman arguments:

I heard Luke say something else I think. Anyhow, we are down four dev's. 
And I understand their reasoning, I just think it is completely flawed. As they chose to work on the most popular crypto, but they don't want the majority to choose anything. They think that developer consensus within a framework which is susceptible to stonewalling is all the consensus you need. 
To me it is clear that doing Segregated Witness as a Softfork isn't just a technical solution, it **is** a political solution to please mental hangups of certain Core dev's. If it also made the most economic sense we would all have hailed it as the ultimate compromise. Sadly it is perceived as too little too late (or too complex and fast). 
It is still possible that at one point SW is going to look like the best thing to do first. But if this is because of threats and attacks. Then this will put a damper on Bitcoin's price and on future relations.

I don't see how one follows the other. Furthermore 1) we had fixed fees then, and dynamic fees now. 2) The price of Bitcoin is wildly different now. 3) Transaction volume is now comprised of less wannabe hodlers as during that peak.
High fees by itself is not a sign of success. Actually if you see fees rise and Bitcoin's value drop, you need to be worried. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:37:19


Not really difficult to imaging because we had years to experience what it's like not to have a limit. I think it went pretty well. Miners could have mined a lot more transactions, but they still didn't. And you still see miners with 750Kb limits. 
You would almost think that the hard limit isn't the only thing keeping blocks smaller. Who would have thought! :O
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:26:14

So miners have always been able to pad towards 1Mb but they were silently waiting in the dark until the hard limit would be raised, and then strike?

@_date: 2016-01-24 09:16:38
The cost of bandwidth/storage. The abundance of future cheaper off-chain solutions. And the indirect cost of diminished security because of miner/node centralisation. See, now you had me repeat the reasons anyway :(
Whether you are comfortable with the blocksize the market is comfortable with is another question. But it is certainly going to give us the most valuable Bitcoin, and therefor by extension the most secure Bitcoin. 
Mix in some IBLT/weak blocks and fraud proof and the future of Bitcoin looks very bright in terms of Scalability and Security. 
But stunt Bitcoin's growth artificially and arbitrarily and you will certainly get a less valuable and thereby less secure Bitcoin (less transactions, less nodes, less miners, less users, less businesses). And remember that the unwillingness of Core developers to raise the limit (and care for Bitcoin as a payment system) has completely tore the Bitcoin community apart. Those effect on the price can't be negligible. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:29:57
If the majority of people wanted to change the 21M limit then this would happen anyway. Because Core nor any client is in control and is able to stop such a thing. 
And yes, you can stay on some minority chain, or fork away with different POW. But that would make that (in the eyes of the people) the altcoin. Bitcoin isn't synonymous with any specific implementation nor should it be. Bitcoin is always going to be the most popular, valuable and therefore most secure Cryptocurrency. 
And the community seems to unanimously agree **not** to want to change the 21M limit anyway. So this should come as reassurance.
If you think: But hardforks are so hard, therefor you can't change the 21M limit. Then I have news for you: You can change anything with soft-forks, even the 21M limit. And no, not via soft hardforks but through a proper softfork where old nodes keep functioning as if nothing happened.

@_date: 2016-01-12 15:33:15
You can make reasonable assumptions about just about anything. Like if you have one confirmation that it is unlikely that it will get orphaned and your funds double spend. Even 6 confirmations isn't completely secure, but you take a calculated risk. 
In the same way you can make a calculated risk regarding zero-conf. Does it have enough fees? Is it an RBF transactions? Is the transaction propagated throughout the network? Do I see double spend attempts from nodes (which actually relay double spend attempts)? Do I earn more money by making spending Bitcoins easier and faster than by preventing a few fraudsters? 
This isn't security through obscurity at all! What is and isn't possible or likely is pretty well known. 
Not everyone who makes a different value assessment than you is automatically wrong. Show some empathy and understanding here. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:21:01


From the point of people upgrading there would not be a lot of chaos, just the ability to create bigger blocks. It is very likely that Bitcoin's value goes up, not down. Economies tend to like (potential) growth ;)

That is brilliantly simple and smart! That's like the definition of a WIN-WIN. A user doesn't feel like he is paying fees at all, and the merchant gets better zero-conf transactions.

What exactly is the difference between that and Core? I don't understand your point. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:29:14
Well that's not possible with Bitcoin anyway. I have to trust the majority of miners. 
What exactly is so different about me trusting that the random nodes I connect to are not all controlled by the same entity which sends me the coins? 
And if I buy any large amount of Bitcoin I just send it straight to a paper wallet. I can manually verify it in so many block-explorers. 
I also trust that I'm statistically unlikely to be the first to get scammed. So if until there has been a successful SPV attack in the wild, I think I'm good. 
Although I very much like the idea that there is a full-node option. The fact that the person who sends me the coins has a hard time even knowing what kind of wallet I use is also extra security for me. Sometimes a little bit of security though obscurity does help :D
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:30:50

So, what should someone do when they see spend-all transactions coming in? Clearly not upgrading has serious security consequences. 
When I run a non upgraded wallet then **anyone** can send me a transactions which I think is valid but in reality isn't. A truly honest person would not call that "without disruption".

Are you serious? 


An assumption based on the fact that most people arguing the thing you are arguing for do that because they don't agree with raising the block-size. I should not have stated that as fact, I will change my wording. My bad, sorry. 


I wholeheartedly agree with that. And my conviction that 75% is not dangerous is strengthened by how slow adoption for BIP101 was. Miners have really shown themselves to be very risk averse.
If miners would have switched that would have meant there was indeed consensus. 
Was it stupid for people to promote miners switching to BIP101 before consensus was reached? Yes. Was it dangerous? No.
It was stupid because it was naive to think that miners would switch before at least economic consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 16:05:32


Nope. Are you kidding me? A reduction in security is no impact? 


No clue what this means, as there is **always** expected behaviour. Without it Bitcoin fails. 


No, also not guaranteed with Softforks, as you can move the currency to auxiliary blocks. 


No, Pretty sure it is about more than just nodes. 


The hard-fork itself doesn't create two ledgers, miners who create a block on either side create a ledger. And do we suddenly need to be afraid of extra ledgers? 
There have been alt-coins which forked from Bitcoin, should we be afraid of those extra ledgers? 
@_date: 2016-01-31 16:33:32


No, this is all me. I never copy / paste anything. As I actually know what I'm talking about. 


There is always an impact. It depends entirely how the softfork is build whether the impact is big or small. 


I'm trying to break this echo chamber so that wrong information isn't repeated ad nausea until everyone beliefs it to be true. 


Bitcoin is and always will be the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency, which makes that not confusing at all in practice. The fact that you might be confused which one is the correct one doesn't mean everyone is.

@_date: 2016-01-06 12:10:11


That seemed like a definitive no against increasing block-size. And this seems to be at the core of people who do promote keeping the 1mb limit.
What people fail to understand is that we traded security through decentralisation alone with security from miners who are insanely invested (millions of dollars worth). So before a rogue miner could wreak havoc and destabilize bitcoin. Now even the smallest miner is invested and can't do jack shit. 
People who only look at decentralisation are missing the bigger picture. Bitcoin is more secure now than it has ever been. 
I've heard people say that just a few people control all of bitcoin's mining. But do you really believe that someone who invested millions of dollars worth of mining equipment doesn't have a responsibility to make sure even his own mining operation is decentralized? 
Maybe what helps is if you imaging a huge miner as just an investor. So if one investor owns 20 mining farms, doesn't mean any single person gets control over all these farms. That would not be a wise architecture from a security perspective.
Looking at a huge miner as one single entity is a weird thing to do. 


Chinese miners can and do use Stratum to fix propagation issues. So the issues would probably be almost nihil for the most part. (For &gt;1Mb and &lt;4Mb at least). 


Well honestly I don't know how big the implication of running into the blocksize limit is going to be. If I have to make an honest guess is that I think nothing substantial is going to happen because a lot of transaction could really be considered spam (they won't raise their fees but they would slowly disappear). But there is a small chance of a huge fee-event. 
Current fees are like 0.009% of transaction volume. Its not hard to imagine that a lot of people are willing to pay MUCH more to stay on the blockchain. The fight to stay on the block size could change fees from what people need to pay (cost based) to the maximum of what people are willing to pay. That could be highly destructive for Bitcoin. 
So you have a low chance for a very destructive event. Which I think should be taken into account. 
But what might be even worse (and more dangerous) is a more subtle and slow fee-event. Where growth slowly dwindles, and where people perceive seeing rising fees as succes. And that could result in a bubble which eventually pops. And then afterwards people say: maybe actual transaction volume **was** important.

If Classic can take over, then Core can always take control back. The idea that a vote for a 2Mb hardfork is a vote for running Classic forever is a bit weird. Don't you think? 
Why would Core take responsibility for an 2Mb increase if then can sit back and watch? They believe that if it goes wrong that they are vindicated. Which is weird because if it goes (a little) wrong it will likely be because of people who (think they) act on their behalf. DDOS'ing, attacking people, keeping the original chain alive. The Core developers seem to have no clue how badly they are shooting themselves in the foot.

If we could not make reasonable assumptions like that about people then Bitcoin would never work. 
Mining has become so difficult that even the smallest miner is invested. The days of having to fear rogue miners are long over (which was probably the reason why the blocksize limit was added, and also the reason why we don't need it anymore now). 
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:01:48

The only relevant question is: Do you trust miners? Maybe more specifically, do you trust Chinese miners? Because lets be honest here, there is xenophobia at play here. It's not even that subtle if you really look into it.

I'm well aware. But i'm not talking about the blocksize limit as a DOS protection. I'm talking about people not compromising at all in terms of using it to limit actual transaction volume. 
The devil is in the details.


Because I state that it can be, not that it definitely is. It is about opening up to the mere possibility that losing nodes doesn't need to be a net loss. 


Yes, this is exactly what it is about. Because to me you are clearly stating a false dilemma. Because Bitcoin can certainly be both. Satoshi seemed to understand that. Why don't you? 
Look I understand your fear. The fear of corporate takeover. And I do share that same fear to some extend. And keeping Bitcoin small is probably the best way to keep it in the hands of amateurs. But that simply means another alt-coin is going to take its place. 
Taking Bitcoin by the hand and trying to protect it when crossing the street. That's like trying to hold the hand of a freight train. Its not going to work.
The reason why that doesn't bother me is because I'm convinced that it is Bitcoins decentralized nature which gives its most of its utility and value. So value driven innovation should not be a bad thing. 
And the point I was trying to make is that taking one step into a certain direction (even if it looks like its heading towards a cliff) doesn't mean we are going to fall off.

SW has overwhelming consensus, but not in the form as a soft-fork and as the only way to increase the blocksize limit in 2016. You should visit other forums sometimes. 


When is that ever an argument for anything. You can increase the 21 million limit with a soft fork. Hard forks and soft forks are not as different as you think. Doing a soft fork without consensus would be pretty bad. 


If you like cake, would you therefor always like to have it shoved in your face? Its about how and when, and a lack of consensus forming. 
An official statement from wallet dev's would be nice instead of a list of dev's who are working on it (working on and condoning everything around SW are two different things obviously). And an official statement from exchanges, payment processors and important merchants would be nice. **THAT** is consensus. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:03:49
It is not mine.  It is probably over-represented by people who like Bitcoin classic, but it still says something. No one claims it is some perfect way to gauge consensus. 
What would life look like if we stopped trying anything just because it is things are never going to be perfect. You know what would have never gotten of the ground? Bitcoin itself. 
People who fall for Nirvana fallacies are not the people who would have created Bitcoin in the first place. ;)

I think showing core-dev's stance on blocksize as some binary statement is a tad disingenuous. In reality they have certain numbers and dates in their head to keep the 1mb limit, or how high and when to upgrade. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:59:15
Yes and I responded to him. He was wrong, or didn't fully read/understand what I was proposing. You can send coins back and forth. As I already described. 


Imaging Bert and Ernie both having 10 BTC each. Ernie use the Segregated Transaction version of Bitcoin. Bert is still on the old system. Elmo is a miner on the new system, he earns 1 BTC on the old chain and 9 BTC on the new one. Now Elmo sends Bert 10 BTC, from the new chain to the old one. 


It is not a legitimate concern because no one actually wants to increase the total supply. It is just a fun way to demonstrate what is possible with Softforks. 
It is fun, because people like Theymos use the fact that you can change the 21 million limit via hardfork as justification for his moderation against any software which attempts such a thing.

If a lack of full nodes becomes a problem then miners should already have enough incentives to lower the block-size. But it needs to be a real economic problem which affects the value of Bitcoin. So it can't be FUD from a minority ;).
And if the lack of full nodes is an economic problem, then economic actors should be encouraged to add more nodes.
Personally I don't see the problem here. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:03:11
Every branch and feature in Git is a Copy+Paste. There is no difference in methodology when Core dev's create a feature or when anyone else creates something. There is literally no Core dev which started from scratch on the Bitcoin software, and they all started with first doing a "copy and paste" before adding their own bits and pieces. 
So your remark is a bit off.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:13:37
This won't work as there are probably more people who want the fork to succeed. They would simply match your money and then some.

I don't consider it as more than what it is, they don't advertise it as more than what it is. You only think it is advertised as more, and then bash it as not being that 2 seconds later. 
That is called a strawman argument. If that makes you happy, fine by me.

@_date: 2016-01-31 16:59:11
Yes! We are getting somewhere. 
Miners who support proposal X and miners voting to activate a fork with proposal X are two entirely different things. This is not something a lot of people understand. 
This means a miners vote to activate a hardfork should represent economic consensus, with the caveat that miners are in fact following economic consensus. But it is so unlikely that they don't that we do not really need to mention it. 
Bitcoin is dependent on honest miners anyway. If we can't trust a majority of miners we have bigger problems.   


In terms of public support, you most definitely can't. In terms of the real activation, you can. Just not with 100% certainty. 
A mismatch is so costly that it is also more likely that miners are cautious to a fault. So a vote for activation is more likely to be representative of economic consensus, than not voting.

Well that is possible only if people create a transaction, that takes days and that they then give up immediately. Which might happen for some. But most can probably afford to pay more, and will do that until fees are too high or confirmations too slow. 
It is not likely that the fee they are willing to pay isn't significantly larger than the fee they need to pay ATM. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:40:59


I agree ATM that the 21 million limit should not be changed. But I'm not a fan of absolutes. Because I don't have a magic ball which can see the future. Do you know whether this thing will work without inflation? Because we don't really have proof about that yet. 
And changing the 21 million limit, and changing it significantly are two different things. 
And Bitcoin classic asking about these Core principles which define the "social contract" and actually changing them are also two different things. 
But I understand your fear. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:44:38
Oh no obviously there should be a limit on certain transactions. But those fixes have already been made. I think I saw one getting merged into Core even. 
Optimising certain algo's and preventing certain attacks are two different things. 
So no that attack won't work. And suggesting it clearly shows your flawed character. Maybe you should work on that. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:31:59
Emergent softforks are nice because nodes are not forced into it. But that is exactly what is wrong with SegregatedWitness, because people are forced into it. Because it is the only block-size increase (in 2016). Although that's probably more a matter of principle and not because "the sky is going to fall".
You also have to know that emergent consensus forming in terms of nodes running alternative clients is by itself not dangerous, no hard fork is going to happen without miners on board. And emergent consensus regarding miners is safe because it is so dangerous, miners being risk averse as they are.
If I were you I would make it more clear what "consensus" means in this sentence:


The problem with that sentence is that there is no mention of an exception for soft-forks or policy changes. And you are going to make that exception. 
 
It needs to be something like: 


Preferably link certain terms to the relevant terms so people actually understand what they mean. 
Edit: Changed causes softfork to activates .  
Edit2: Maybe it can be simpler: 


@_date: 2016-01-14 18:30:30
The integrity of the Bitcoin network being aversely affected which will reflect in Bitcoin's price. Selfish mining in whatever form doesn't work because miners would not shit where they eat. Don't you think? 
If you believe Bitcoin's value is only speculative and not related to actual usage, then you might think that bitcoin can become completely centralised with no ill effect. Seems like you would consider it worthless, and I would consider it worthless. 
If you can find enough people who would still like such a Bitcoin, then maybe you have a point. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:56:43
You can repeat what you are saying a million times, doesn't make it true though. 
Miners want to be connected to other miners with as little hops in between as possible. Why would they want a normal node in between? When is that ever going to be faster then when miners peer with each other directly? 
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:28:38
Clear double spend getting accepted by miners are very visible and damaging to Bitcoin as a whole. If you call that "without recourse" then ... well... i don't know what you are thinking. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:29:50


Yes you can. You move say 10 million to a two-way pegged side chain (spend-all addresses on the original chain). And then you are free to create 10 million on the original chain again. 
If all coins are used in the original chain then no-one can move their coins back. Small price to pay really for "free" money ;)
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:01:46

@_date: 2016-01-15 14:34:28
To run a node with opt-in RBF software is the choice of miners. 
Marking a transaction is the choice of the sender. Of course dependent on whether your wallet actually gives you that choice
@_date: 2016-01-12 09:58:47
The force needed to increase the blocksize without Core's support will cause an equal cost to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. 
Imaging someone preventing you from leaving a burning building by holding a knife. You can wait till the person leaves, but at one point getting burned is worse then getting sliced. You either get burned or sliced. 
Getting burned is transactions getting prohibitively more expensive and confirmations more erratic **and** the reputation of the Core getting shredded, getting sliced is the huge damage to the ecosystem if we ditch Core/Bitcoin.org and all backlash. 
Waiting is very costly, even though you think you are being smart and conservative.

It seems like you are very smart in a lot of ways, but you still overlook certain important aspects. I've seen you say things which are technically correct but still completely miss the point so many times that its pretty mind-boggling. 
First the strawman: Not everyone who disagrees on your scalability plan is only focused on Bitcoin as a payment system. As if you can even separate that from anything else?!? Weird and disingenuous. 
Appeal to authority: Basically you said again, with a lot of words, that you know best. 
I'm still waiting for an honest comparison between the 2-4-8 scaling solution which had consensus vs. your scalability plan. If you take it upon yourself to make economic decisions you at least need to take into account all costs, and all risks, and this includes perceived cost like goodwill and a community which remains split in two. 
Maybe you don't care (enough) about the price of Bitcoin, but a lot of people do. Trade-offs which have economical consequences are not yours to make, nor is consensus amongst just developers enough.

Yes you can. Spend-all transactions to the rescue. Did you read the article I linked to? 
If someone tries to move coins to the old chain but there are no spend-all coins left then that transaction would be rejected. 


True. 
If Segregated Witness effectively increases the blocksize, then this increases the effective inflation. It both needs transactions to switch to segregated blocks for it to work.

You take what I say and then interpret it in such a way that it is technically false. 
Conceptually SW and a 2Mb hard-fork are obviously not incompatible. There is nothing in SW which depends on a 1Mb block-size. You know this. 
You also have a weird concept what constitutes Bitcoin. You are free to have this opinion. But not to force this opinion on others. A Bitcoin which doesn't hardfork is one which only adds complexity. Which will be its undoing eventually. 
Most people value a Bitcoin which can adapt. And that will be the most valuable Bitcoin, and therefor that will be Bitcoin. It doesn't really matter if you think some rules are set in stone.

@_date: 2016-01-01 12:55:39
Not agreeing with Satoshi on some things is one thing, disagreeing with how core incentives work is a completely different matter. 
You can't say that miners follow the economic consensus but still not allow them to vote for hard forks like BIP101. 
You can't steer Bitcoin away from being an Electronic Cash System without taking responsibility for it (with design + consensus). 
You can't invoke Satoshi when keeping the blocksize limit as if he always meant for it to limit actual transaction volume, and then not allow people to correct you on that by invoking Satoshi and then suddenly claiming its not ok to appeal to authority there. 
Its either incompetence or malice here. 
Edit: I must be completely honest and admit that the fee market which is going to be introduced by the block-size limit will also be created organically eventually anyway. But an organic limit will always be better because it can grow with technology and will therefor always be superior to any artificial limit. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:20:04

Bitcoin can't be ruled by any mob. It's value is simply too important to ignore. So no Core developers or "Mob" can change Bitcoin in any detrimental way.
The only thing which rules Bitcoin is the Bitcoin economy. 
You also understand that you can change anything with Softforks also? Even the 21 million limit?


That was simply a proposal which was too vague. That's why I voted against it. It is also already covered by things like fungibility.

Except going by statements of a lot of businesses and miners. But support and support are two different things. I would not be surprised if things still turn out differently though. 


I don't even think core dev's are bad. I think the governance structure of Core leads to a dangerous preference **not** to change certain things. Which can lead to economically sub-optimal choices. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:42:16
This only works when everyone agrees to increase the inflation rate, for whatever reason (added security, or to donate mined coins to charity by some voting mechanism, or to fund Bitcoin's development). 
But it's mostly an effective way to counter people who say "if you can change X with a hardfork by popular vote, then you can change anything". 
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:24:57


That makes it sound like 1Mb are created magically and miners just "find" them. As if it is not some conscious choice to create one. 
The reality is that there will be a lot of perceived risk of creating a 1Mb block that not many miners are going to risk creating one. We might see miners running with 1Mb soft limits for a long time actually. 
If we would have switched years ago, everyone would have seen that the blocksize limit actually wasn't needed. The longer we wait the more the limit seems to actually do something about actual transaction volume. Feels more and more like we actually need it. 
Weird.

This is a side-chain, Lightning is a channel which needs locked coins, this doesn't. 
And this is a soft fork, where summaries/compressed transactions get written to the old block (ever x blocks?), and where transactions to legacy addresses also get added to the old block. 
I don't think you can just say it is exactly what Lightning does. 
The code needed to run the new side-chain would essentially be a copy of Bitcoin (initially), it should not be a completely new code-base like Lightning.

Yes I agree. But people who offer and promote a certain solution don't need to take those into account. They should be able to promote anything they want. It would be weird if they need to wait for consensus from certain groups before they are allowed to promote. That sounds like what a totalitarian leader would say. 
Seems like consensus has been formed around a 2Mb increase. Might need some more official support, but we are getting there.
And miners have no choice but to look at developers/nodes/merchants/payment processors/wallets/exchanges/services to determine whether it is safe to cross that hardfork road. 
If you understand the dynamic you will understand that 75% is indeed safe. Even the first miner voting for this hardfork should do so only if it is safe. Therefor 75% is definitely safe.
But I understand your reluctance. There have been many people promoting this idea that you can rally support for BIP101 by getting miners to switch first. Which is like asking a huge group of people to cross the street without looking. Would some do it? Yes. Would 75% do it? No!

This is based on people who were there, i have no specific source. And it is based on the fact that it was the lowest increase out there at the time. There were more people against it because it was too low than too high. Jonathan Toomim's consensus census after the fact also collaborates this.

Sure I get that. But there is no dialog possible between me and this official Core entity we are talking about.

There really is no denying that there are subjective and cost based arguments which are relevant. And if I knew where I could ask these questions I would. 


So case in point then. You gave an example of something which changed to become non-controversial before it could be added. 


Well if Core does a fantastic job except on one point, and accepts all changes except contentious ones, you would expect people to complain about it that one thing. Don't you think?

Those who use it can't do anything about those who don't care or see it as too big of a risk. You must understand that the people who need bigger blocks and the people who can afford to pay higher fees are two entirely different groups. 
It is unlike that even 50% is going to overlap anytime soon. Increasing fees is probably much cheaper and less riskier in the near future.

If Core's supporters are this childish and clueless, then you are doing Bitcoin Core a huge disservice. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:20:29
Another question. Emergent consensus by promoting certain clients is fine for softforks, but not for (soft) hardforks right? That's where you draw the line in terms of moderation. 
And the definition of soft hardforks is anything which significantly cripples older clients. Right? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:24:04
Their "framework" for consensus - if you can even call it that - is for Bitcoin Classic's future roadmap. More a what-if when it becomes successful. To be clear, you do mean [this]( right?
Any software project can choose their own system to reach internal consensus. This seems better than what Core uses on Github. I like the fact that you can quickly filter on different type of groups. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:54:06
Weird, I think if a contentious fork succeeds that that is a major success. It means the economy is in control and not some set of developers. 
Don't you think that software developers making economic decisions is weird?
@_date: 2016-01-04 08:50:11
Miners going to another fork is a DOS attack on the original chain, and it's effectively a hostage situation. And one with a clear demand. Every block the miners create is one they can't sell until the economic majority caves in to their demands. 
Obviously percentages matter. I was imagining 90% of the bitcoin economy opposed to a certain fork, and 75% of miners switching to that hard fork anyway. Because that really shows who really has the power. 
It is also important to imaging something which is important enough for the economic majority to hold out on. If its an issue like a blocksize increase people might see it as leadership from miners, and as something positive. If it is a change which is very controversial and which is deemed as very bad, then you can imaging that no one is going to give into the demands of attackers/miners.

That's exactly the point. But I would remove the "merely" because if Core would kick the can it would allow the community to finally come together. 


Running into real scalability issues and running into an arbitrary artificial limit are two entirely different things. Champagne is the last thing on my mind considering the state of affairs.

XT also had Mike Hearn spouting a lot of negative energy into the universe. It had a lot more changes which were easily used to confuse the debate. It was 6 months earlier with no clear signs of congestion yet. It tried to get miners on board before there was consensus. Most people were still waiting for the scalability solution from Core. Now we know Core's solution is wildly more complex than a 2Mb hardfork, and is either risky because it is implemented too fast, or risky because it is too late as a block size increase. 
On top of that every day that goes by a hardfork-blocksize-limit-increase is going to be easier and less risky. Because transaction volume is increasing, making the cost/risk of not increasing more evident, and because more transaction volume makes the 1Mb chain less viable. And of course because every day consensus is forming more and more.

Do you also pull the handbrake and stop in the middle of the highway just because your need gas in 300 miles? 
We have only two options regarding re-introducing the 1mb hard limit as a means to limit actual transaction volume:
1. It's the best option at this moment
1. It's not the best option at this moment
If core thinks its the best option, then they should publicly state why they think this is the case **and** inform everyone about the why, the what and the consequences. 
What is not ok is just pretending (silently) that this isn't a major change in Bitcoin's direction. Because within this whole debate there is no doubt that that is an indefensible position. But if the Core developers really think it is, then at least say that. 
So let them explain why this isn't a huge change, why we need not worry about increasing transaction volume, why the cost changing the hard limit is bigger than when we would change it. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:54:57


Gavin seems to be against it now. Weird. 


Depends on your definition of protocol, like I said. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:05:56
The 21 million cap is just an example of things you can change with a Soft fork, just to show that anything can change. The ability to change the 21 million cap with a hard fork was an argument against doing any contentious change. So this should therefor also apply to Softforks. 
Would be be comfortable with a Softfork block-size increase (not a soft hardfork). Is that something which can be promoted? 
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:21:20


And yet even less is advertised with SW. Seems like doing something which has global consensus which isn't that exciting should be welcomed not shunned. There is no world of difference. And invoking slippery slope arguments doesn't help anyone. 


The fact that everyone has unilaterally asked for bigger blocks is just a myth then? 
And there were no relevant events before Mike created XT? And there was no censorship which divided the community even more? 
The truth is that there is no consensus whatsoever on introducing the blocksize limit to limit actual transaction volume. 


Sorry, but there is a conflict of interest. By definition, you should look up it up. 


Mitigating steps have been introduced (like dynamic fees, mempool fixes) and for all we know Bitcoin isn't nearly used as much as it could have been. 
And if there is a 90% chance of something happening, does that mean that someone was wrong when it didn't? You plan for success and you plan for failure. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:25:11
I also explained about this [here]( but my post was quietly deleted by the automod. 
It is good that people are aware that anything can be changed via Softforks. Yes even the 21 million cap. 
Via soft hardforks, where the old nodes will only see empty blocks. Or via proper softfork where old nodes and old wallets will keep functioning (no deterioration).

That is the key part, that merchants absorb the fees. It is more a usability thing, and a gentlemen's agreement of sorts. 
The payment qr-code should not just have a fee, but indicate what fee will be absorbed by the merchants and can therefore be subtracted from the total amount. It is a "SubtractableFee" of sorts. 
Which means you are allowed to pay only 20.299. Which also makes sure your balances looks nicer (good for people with OCD).

Support from miners and global consensus are two entirely different things. Promoting miners to activate a hardfork just because miners are on board is still stupid. 
I hope miners themselves also understand that they have two completely different votes. One for global consensus, and one to activate a hardfork. 
Please don't mix up the two. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:15:42


So you put your fingers in your ear and pretend nothing is happening. You dismiss all arguments by just assuming there is only a small minority of people against introducing a hard limit as a way to limit actual transaction volume. 
Bitcoin is more secure now then ever. Even though we have less miners. How is that possible? 


I agree that asking miners to switch to a hard fork before the economic dependent nodes are ready for it is stupid. And I try to get people who want bigger blocks to understand this simple concept. 
Luckily miners can't afford to be so daft, so that's not going to happen anytime soon.
But a hardfork is going to happen eventually. When the cost of having the block-size limit exceeds the cost of doing a hard-fork. 
We might actually be both comfortable with the moment that happens. 
And remember folks: Blocksize limit != blocksize.

No it doesn't make sense. If it did then everyone would be on board. 
What probably happened is that they burned the "hardfork" bridge and how they have to make weird manoeuvres by creating complex softforks. Burning through a lot of community support probably also didn't help, and also forces them to do softforks instead of hardforks.

Other simpler solutions do not need to be centralised. Although if there is no trust involved, centralised doesn't need to be that bad. If the protocol is open you and even the server side is open source then switching should be easy.

@_date: 2016-01-14 07:53:51
Feels like you agree that the majority of the community is stupid and that developers know what is best. :(
I personally think that that is one of the things people are angry about. People get struck down, berated, belittled, alternative clients and its developers vilified, DDOS'ed and censored. 
But what we never got was an explanation or announcement that the 1Mb was going to get re-introduced as a way to limit actual transaction volume. (Or some official explanation why current volume can be deemed Spam). There should be some kind of calculation which has 1Mb as a result (or anything similar). 
You know what I think? That the level of decentralisation people are comfortable with is very subjective. Things like whether you should or should not buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin is subjective. And even whether a hardfork (activated at 75%) is dangerous is subjective. 
I personally apply Hanlon's razor as much as possible and assume the Core dev's are incompetent in terms of communication and leadership. And I'm still open to them being right. Them not engaging with the community anymore isn't really helping that much. And the ones still here seem to keep evading certain questions. 


There are people on that list who support the roadmap and still want a blocksize limit increase via hardfork.


You can't be in the camp of "Bitcoin is whatever software the majority of people run" and still remain silent when alternative clients get attacked (or even partake in verbal attacks). You can't seek moral high ground just by claiming you are doing nothing, that's as if removing your hands from the steering wheel is not considered an action. Not raising the limit is a clear action on part of the Core dev's which they don't own up to. 
I emphasise with the Core dev's about the shit they get poured over them, I really do. But it is hard to really feel sorry because their hands are not clean.

Well, most people have been led on to believe we need 95% miner support any fork. Let alone a hardfork. 
And a minority seems to want an even smaller blocks than we have now, because they value the barrier to entry in terms of running a full node above anything else. 
In reality the barrier to entry is currently governed mostly by transaction fees. There are probably a lot of people like you who realise this, yet think it is more important to make sure Bitcoin remains hard to change (by giving a minority veto power). 
It's frustrating.

Rarely read something so interesting which doesn't at all explain the original premise, that somehow Bitcoin can't be digital cash at the moment. 
People want Bitcoin to remain a viable payment system because a 1Mb limit is completely arbitrary and because proper off-chain solutions do not yet exist. 
Just tell me which sounds better:
1. Prevent an increase for as long as possible
1. Increased and more erratic fees 
1. Decrease quality of service (higher confirmation times during backlog)
1. Split community
1. Destroyed usecases (for increasingly higher valued transactions)
1. Prevent people investing into Bitcoin
1. Make people move to alt-coins
1. Try to transition these killed-off use-cases to Lightning 
Or: 
1. Increase limit
1. Deploy Lightning network
1. Seamlessly transition existing payment solutions to Lightning
1. Profit
Still waiting for someone to provide proof why 1Mb is the correct size now. Or how higher fees and lower quality of service can be a good thing. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 10:55:24


If everyone outbids you by a factor of 2 or higher than what you are willing to pay, then the SegWit discount isn't going to help you. 
If nobody uses SegWit, they would still be outbidding each other with legacy transactions and increasing overall fees.

@_date: 2016-01-07 19:46:32
Well there is the plausible deniable accidental selfish miner ;). This miner creates bigger and bigger blocks by including all spam transactions. Because he says he has to because of profits. But secretly he becomes more profitable because he has less orphan risks then the small miners.
In reality this is nonsense because a centralised Bitcoin is one which would depreciate in value, which cuts in much hard into the profits of the selfish miner than what he can hope to gain. 
The thing is, if you remove the limit completely you could ask the same question, and get the same answer. ;)

I think it is unlikely that you can trade the old coin. Not with confirmation times over an hour, and not with a effective blocksize capacity of less than 100Kb.

Block propagation isn't the only issue which makes people so vehemently opposed to an increase. It is also node decentralisation, and preventing people from running full clients at home.

@_date: 2016-01-20 11:42:22
Well not all softforks are created equal just like not all hardforks are.  People try to make it into a black and white issue but it isn't.
Most soft-forks are safer than hardforks in the short term, but they always add more cruft to the Bitcoin protocol/code. If you only do softforks Bitcoin will stagnate and die a horrible death. Add complexities and something will go wrong one day. 
For instance (worst case scenario) is that Segregated Witness has a bug. And we need to rollback to a previous version. Then all segregated witness coins are up for grabs. 
A hardfork which splits the Bitcoin economy in half is dangerous. Well not really dangerous, just annoying and bad for its value. So thankfully no one wants to split Bitcoin. Miners won't switch until they know enough miners will switch. It will be coordinated and swift. But even if enough miners stay on the old chain, even then its still as good as dead. It really can't survive. So no one can be duped. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:37:36
If no force was being applied (through censorship, personal attacks, ddos attacks, politics, secret meetings, weird contracts, threats of leaving Bitcoin, threats of splitting the network) to put Core into a position of power. Then you would be correct. But that's not the Bitcoin world we live in. 
And in no way does "bigger blocks now via hardfork" demand centralized governance. That is a stupid slippery slope argument and shows a severe lack of trust in anyone asking for something you disagree with. Going further than what you are comfortable with doesn't mean all your concerns are ignored. It is not that black &amp; white.
It makes no sense to argue that you can pay for $0.13 per transaction, but can't upgrade to a faster internet connection somehow. You want to protect the little guy, but at the same time you achieve the exact opposite. Ironic. 




Of course not. There is a severe case of "not invented here" syndrome going on at Core and the community. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:42:55


Nope, that's not what I said. 


If that is possible, then it's probably because of Peter Todd's handywork. If someone says something is dangerous and then makes sure it is the case, then well, what should I say about it?

In bitcoin world you only need to put a hash of certain data into a block to proof that it exists and belongs to it. So in a way a block can be infinitely large by putting a hash of an infinitely large blob into the blockchain. If the code doesn't depend on it for verification then you don't actually need to download/process/store it. 
You could even put transactions into separate blocks, with [auxiliary blocks]( for instance.

It is urgent because we are slowly boiling a frog here. It is urgent because people are leaving for alt-coins which provide the same services for a lower price. It is urgent because other altcoins are faster at achieving/finding consensus on important issues and Bitcoin is still stuck. 
"I don't think fees are high/low" has no bearing on that. Blocksize limit is arbitrary low, therefor fees are arbitrarily high, therefor transactions move to alt-coins. The only question is how much.

What does profitability of mining have to do with the blocksize limit? At any limit the only miner who makes a profit are the most efficient once.

Yet transaction volume increased slowly following a clear trend. If we didn't hit the limit now, we would have hit it a few weeks later.

I have a wallet which supports both Bitcoin and some other coin, with just one recovery phrase. Conversion between the two is also buttery smooth.
It's also not at all comparable with IPv4 vs IPv6 as that was about hardware, and this is merely a software issue. Users and merchants can upgrade with relative ease.

Ok, good to know. That is reassuring :)
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:54:13
Why? 
1. bitcoin is still getting sold as instant &amp; cheap. This is simply inexcusable, and will turn off a lot of newbies. 
1. bitcoin performs worse overall, and fees need to be higher. Which some people will realise too late. They might choose a fee which used to work, or simply didn't update their wallet software. 
1. even with new wallet with dynamic fees, confirmations can still take hours. There are always going to be a certain % of people running into these problems when the network is congested. And this will happen more and more. 
1. it is very likely that there are people who are concern-trolling. Who use low fees on purpose, or use Bitcoin during congestion on purpose. Hard to tell whether this is a significant %. 
The reality is that the barrier to entry is higher now. The chance of running into problems is higher. And the Bitcoin community is less friendly now. The days where you could get some Bitcoin from a faucet and then play with it are over. 
The chance that someone falls in category 1, 2 or 3 is pretty high. Or at least high enough that you should take them serious. Deleting all complaints from is fine, if you at least point them in the right direction. 
We should not sell Bitcoin as instant &amp; cheap. Undersell and over-deliver is much much better. 
And we should realise that the barrier to entry is not only important for running a full node. It is also important in terms of fees. In absence of secure (bitcoin enhancing) off-chain solutions we should consider this for on-chain transactions in the mean time. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:47:51
Yes, you can expect the 80% / 20% rule to apply. SegWit adoption could go to 1.7 Mb / 1.8Mb very quickly. Which is a bit less depressing as how I originally stated it. ;)

@_date: 2016-06-15 13:18:18


That is disingenuous. SegWit isn't about to be released and it certainly doesn't simply double capacity.  SegWit is still months away from release, will take months before it is activated, and won't double capacity any time soon (not this year at least). 
My guess is that SegWit is released in August and not sooner. Activation in October at the earliest. And an effective increase to 2Mb in 2018. 
In december last year I already said SegWit was going to take a long long time. Yet argued that it was already ready then. Let's just keep changing what "ready" means. That will certainly help us grow Bitcoin.

Well, I'd like to see a lot more information per alt-coin to make it easier to compare.

Pretty sure a simple hardfork could have been deployed and activated a year ago. No problem. SegWit however still hasn't been deployed. 
And SegWit is probably never going to deliver an effective 2Mb increase. People might start to use more complicated signatures, but that doesn't help capacity wise one bit. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:51:59


Unconfirmed transactions are replaceable if we all agree that this should be the case. If that creates a more valuable Bitcoin. But killing off zero-conf is unlikely to create any value whatsoever. 
The whole "it's just policy" is a ridiculously simple notion. 
If a miner has the choice between preventing double spends and not preventing double spends (even for stuff in his mempool) then obviously preventing double spends should be more profitable in the long run. 
The exact same thing applies to double spending 1-conf transactions &amp; selfish mining.

@_date: 2016-06-04 12:06:20
It's about probabilities and cost. The question you need to ask is could we have gone up to 6 tx/s? Did the blocksize already stifle growth? 
Fees are higher and QoS is lower. How would you ever be able to say this is a good thing?
Maybe bitcoins failure isn't spectacular because it simply stops growing before it can hit the limit hard, but that simply means we are boiling a frog here.
The only question is the extent. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:18:27


Lol! You got me there. 
But(!) you might call it a bath now (i don't) but if it gets too hot we have nothing to quickly turn off the heat.


It's not really bad actually. Competition is good. 


It upsets me because there is significant cost in switching to an alt-coin. It is loss of momentum and opportunities. But the biggest issue I have is with Bitcoin seemingly becoming a bubble where its value is completely unrelated to its performance &amp; utility. I don't care about Bitcoin, but if it collapses that would set back all cryptocurrencies. 


Arbitrarily has a clear definition: 


Lacking formal design, it is arbitrary. And it was definitely added by Satoshi at his own discretion. Most probably as an anti DOS feature, and not to limit actual transaction volume. Not really something you can disagree with.
But you can re-instate the blocksize-limit to do something else. And make it not arbitrary from that point forward. Just issue a design and some rationale, and then get consensus. 
The interesting question is: would you ever get consensus to introduce a 1Mb limit now if one was not yet present (or much higher)? Would that need 95% miner consensus? And why are we comfortable with giving a minority (5%) a vote on re-introducing that limit to do something it wasn't designed to do? Why would that make sense? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:38:54
Yes it does, just in a different way. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 07:16:15
Safe and unsafe are not black and white issues. I know you don't agree. But most people make reasonable assumptions about a lot of things. Like trusting a majority of miners for instance. 
It is pretty simple, if the fee is high enough, the transaction isn't replaceable, and no double spends are detected within a certain amount of time then a zero-conf transaction is relatively safe. Not perfectly safe, but when is that ever the case? 
It is the same with bicycle helmets, you would think everyone is safer if they use such a helmet. But in reality it helps to make sure less people actually use a bike, therefor making it less safe for everyone. 
Same goes for this. Make sure Bitcoin becomes less useable, less people use it, which makes everyone less safe (from inflation &amp; monetary control). The most perfectly secure system is the one no-one uses. 
Make no mistake about it, Bitcoin is doomed if it is hijacked by people who cannot compromise and do not care about usability.
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:19:12
And with Core if one person accidentally sends a very high fee transaction everyone is screwed. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:46:35
You missed my point. Introducing the blocksize limit to limit actual transaction volume seems easy enough. And it changes everything. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:26:32
Your own article seems to agree with me, that a &gt;50% can do almost anything at no cost towards itself (and at great cost to the rest of the network). 
And if you have a smaller percentage your cost would go up, but if you scam multiple people at the same time this might be worth it. So your individual risk of getting scammed doesn't give you enough information whether an attack would be worthwhile or not. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:53:12


The value of a Bitcoin isn't related to the amount of work needed to mine one for a long time already. In the very beginning this was the case. The number of miners determined the price, as difficulty went up the cost of obtaining a bitcoin increased. So a halvening then would have increased the price instantly at the halvening.
But at some point the price became mostly speculative, so now the price determines the number of miners (hardware not people). Furthermore there are so many coins already on the market that trading of these coins determines the price, and not the cost of mining. 
So in theory the halvening should not affect price at all at this point. But people being people they would still speculate about it and price will probably go up (my guess)


No, you would need to do twice the work to get the same amount. So it is the opposite.


Yes! 


If you know with 100% certainty that something bad is going to happen before you ever started mining. Can you then still consider it bad? If the 21 million limit is the very thing which causes Bitcoin's value to go up, the net result of the halvening is a huge advantage to miners actually. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:42:47
What did he do? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:24:53
Of course it is more efficient. If you planned to send more transactions anyway this adds no overhead whatsoever. And it should be cheaper than RBF. Considering that most transactions are probably from entities who send multiple transactions, this is a big win overall for efficiency when it becomes available.
Also an answer for Edit: And, probably even more important: One of the dangers of the blocksize limit is that fees would go up, but have almost no reason/force to get it down. Things like this and RBF could really help with that. This might be vital for Bitcoin's survival. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 20:37:55


I;m in favour of any blocksize-limit increase. I consider a faster deployed SegWit a good thing, although not if it creates usability problems for users because wallets do not support it. 


If you have the data to back that up, that would be great. Bitcoin core still has that number between 1.6 and 2.0 Mb, so it is not likely to be 1.6 nor 2.0. 
If people start to user more complicated signatures because of the discounts then you are comparing apple's to oranges in terms of savings. You can't add bytes and then count them as saved bytes. 


Sure, SegWit is good. SegWit as the only blocksize-limit increase is something I have issue with. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:34:05
Yet bitcoins market share is down. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:02:22
15 minutes would be akin to a blocksize limit of 666 Kb. During the backlog in march we went down to a capacity of 888Kb per decaminute. That was pretty brutal in terms of confirmation times. And that took only a few days. 
I hope you are wrong and less miners stop mining around the halving. 
If I'm doing confirmation time analysis during/afterwards I will pass it by you first. ;)
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:48:11
And the people who promote bigger blocks now also create things like Xthin and head first mining. 
Have you never complained about a speed limit which is way too low? I gather you aren't a road builder, yet you are perfectly capable of determining when a limit is sub-optimal. 
And what does the interestingness of a solution have to do with anything. A limit is either arbitrary or it's not. That was my question.

Hashing Power doesn't need to drop by 50% to cause serious problems. Remember what happened in the beginning of march? Hashingpower dropped suddenly, effective capacity went down to just 888Kb per decaminute, and we had a major backlog lasting for days. 
I've seen small blockers say that hashrate could drop by 20%. That is going to be brutal. Yet people on will probably say someone is spamming the network ;)
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:36:24
I was always in favour of both. I don't see much downside to nodes getting ready for bigger blocks, granted that miners do not fork prematurely, but that's a concern whether 10% or 90% of (economic dependent) nodes are ready. 
I think we conflated blocksize-limit with actual blocksizes too much, and getting ready for bigger blocks with splitting the network.
We will see how things pan out :)

If I warn you about some possible outcome, and that doesn't come true, does that mean the warning was somehow not necessary? And who knows what the prices would have been without a the limit being stuck at 1Mb? 
And I have always said the same: I don't want actual transaction volume to hit the limit if that is not yet necessary. This means that if we went to 2Mb or 8Mb or 20Mb or even Unlimited, that there still would be such a thing as soft &amp; orphan limits. 
Just because you think the 1Mb is needed to do something it has never done before doesn't mean when people compromise all the way down to 2Mb that they suddenly share that view. 
Don't do straw-man arguments
@_date: 2016-06-27 12:05:06
Ah, now I see your point! What you propose would be possible in an ideal world where you never miss a transaction. And where miners agree on what minimum fee to accept. 
In theory you could just say: I grabbed transactions before timestamp x. You could even imply that in the header, which also has the hash already. Therefor a header (+coinbase transaction) should be enough.

If the 1Mb limit is kept Bitcoin would not be sustainable exactly for the reasons you mention. It would probably collapse upon itself. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:42:33
So you expect a new player to invest millions to create new ASIC's? Or do you expect the current manufacturer to lower prices for no good reason? 
If you want cheap mining hardware to reach the market the Bitcoin price needs to collapse. And to do that you would need to limit its growth somehow. Like with a blocksize limit..... oh god... it all makes sense now. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:44:32


Ok, how would you feel if you had to pay very high prices for something because the government had introduced a production cap? They introduced this cap years ago, and never bothered to change it. 
And you know that if you pay more others also need to pay more or can't have any. Yet you know this thing is good, important and makes the world a better place. You even want people with a LOT less money than you to use it. 
That's why I stopped using Bitcoin at the end of last year, after using it extensively. 
So even though I know less moral people use Bitcoin for spam transactions, I know that if I don't use it that at least I don't make the problem worse. 
I wouldn't call that "Hand wringing".

I have no doubt that there are people who pay less than the recommended fee. But that will always be the case. If everyone started paying the recommended fee, then the recommended fee would go up. Like a snake eating its own tail. Not going to give more capacity, complaints would be the same.

There is absolutely no need to fork hard and fast. You softfork, and then you have loads of time to hardfork. 
The people who advocate for a fast hardfork might do so to bring Ethereum down. Or because they are reckless in nature.

And fees are not just information, they are fees. It is cutting in line. Paying more for a more shitty service. Maybe most don't want to pay more and increase someone else's confirmation times. Doesn't feel right to me. Not if the limit is still arbitrary at least. Senseless destruction of QoS.

No that's not what would happen. 
You would not see faster confirmations, as blocksize would stay the same. You can't magically fit more transactions into a block with higher fees. 
What would happen is that fees would rise exponentially during backlogs, solving exactly nothing. And creating an unhealthy feedback loop. Because you pay a higher fees, fee estimations look at fees paid, etc. etc. Fees would simply go up until someone gives up on Bitcoin entirely. 
Fees would go up so fast that transactions get stuck anyway. Add in RBF and fees would go up even faster. 
It is a lose-lose game. The only question is how much.

How exactly would you be able to spend it except by colluding with miners? You would need a large % of hashing power to pull this off with 100% success rate. 
So no, definitely not 100% unsafe. 


You don't need a majority. Any hashing % has a chance to orphan a block and add a double spend instead. 
So no, definitely not 100% safe.

Because the market is better at determining the best blocksize? 
You can make technical arguments all you want. But we never had a blocksize limit which limits actual transaction volume. So in my book even increasing it to 2Mb is ludicrous. Because a BIP without a design, and without any consensus is the anti thesis of good software development, or good governance. 
Show me the design and consensus around BIP000 first. Then we are talking. 


Yes, that is the only thing /s
@_date: 2016-06-08 06:01:55
In addition to what WiseAsshole said. [Peter also campaigned]( to never have the 1Mb limit raised. Which started the meme that any increase would immediately lead to nodes needing full datacenters to run. Therefor no compromise should ever be possible even though computers/networks get faster and faster.
Before we hit the limit pretty much any transaction was guaranteed to get added to a block, making zero-conf relatively safe &amp; usable. Now, not so much. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:34:04
They haven't, mempool profile looks perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:50:37


I think we have definitive proof that price and transaction volume are not really linked. I don't consider it likely that there will be some mass on-chain exodus because of on-chain problems, because most speculation simply doesn't happen on-chain. 
I could recant my article. Should I?
So brutal, but probably not disastrous.

That is also something easily changed with a HF. Yet a dangerous meme has been repeated so often far that we might never see any hardfork in Bitcoin's history ever. Just because something benefits you doesn't mean it can't bite you in the ass later.

@_date: 2016-06-26 10:40:50
So you value the barrier to entry in terms of running a full node above anything else?
Notice I haven't said there isn't a cost to increasing the limit. My point is that there is an equilibrium to be found. And it is very unlikely that 1Mb is the perfect size.

Remember the days where you could get coins from a faucet, and the barrier to entry was completely nonexistent. You could play around without any monetary risk. And you always had 1st block confirmations. Regardless of fees. No KYC &amp; AML, and you could still mine coins. 
I don't think there is any small-blocker who would deny that this was awesome, and in a way better than what we have now. 
There is less wow, and more frustration, for [whatever reason](

In theory all mempools should already be the same if everyone used the same parameters. In order to have a predictable network, you want all miners to do exactly the same thing. That would also make it more reliable. 
For instance, it would make sense to have fees determine the average blocksize instead of a hard limit determine fees. 
And things like weak blocks would also help tremendously. You could use that to synchronize mempools and make sure you can deterministically build 98% of blocks (by referencing the last weak block + parameters used for selection). 
@_date: 2016-06-06 09:39:48
If you immediately visualize the Bitcoin transactions coming in then this builds trust for every user that his coins are converted to Bitcoin (with a transaction id so people can actually inspect the transactions).

It has been going on for a lot longer than that. 
You and many like you have stayed very neutral in all this. But there would have been no issue with companies getting ready for bigger blocks and shouting it from the rooftops. That in turn would have made it very easy (and risk free) for miners to activate an HF.

Don't put words in my mouth. I never said miners magically do whatever I want. Double spends incur a non-zero cost upon Bitcoin as a whole. Any double spend should be news, and should hurt miners profits. Although if we all keep saying it is completely unsafe, we might only say "I told you so".

With sharding, fraud proofs and fast block propagation blocks can be a lot bigger. So it probably makes a lot more sense sense if both can be both.

Does the asterix change the fact that SegWit is delayed? Furthermore the text can be read as reassurance that SegWit would not be released (rushed) to reach the specified date. Which is a good thing. But it is still an "I told you so" moment for me, when I said this 5 months ago:

Fees in BTC are also rising, some are fighting to stay on-chain. But it makes sense that some can't or won't raise fees. 
No clue why we would want to push more and more people into alt-coins at this point. But at least it is not boring :P
@_date: 2016-01-11 15:25:43
I guess so. But I'm still a bit unsure what is and isn't a soft-fork. I mean if you disallow certain transactions, is that a soft-hardfork? Or only if you disallow all transactions? 
And what if I force transactions into a side-chain (without two-way peg)? So old old-coins can stay on the old-chain, but you can't receive transactions from the new-chain (forcing you to upgrade). And what if the new chain has a different mining reward? 
Ultimately I think we want Bitcoin to provide the greatest good in the world, less suffering, more global happiness. That should be the goal of everything we do. And that is the only way to really judge whether an action is good or not. Although in most cases we don't have enough data to make a choice, we should always do our best. 
So if Bitcoin isn't sustainable without inflation, we should consider re-adding some. 
Incidentally a higher goal is also something which could reunite the community. Or at least I hope.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:18:51
Does that work? Aren't all ports bi-directional regardless of who connects to who? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:52:05
That SW isn't some new invention as something very similar was already announced. Auxiliary blocks segregate transactions, and thereby would allow any blocksize increase as a Softfork. On top of that it would be weird for someone like Mike who is against doing things via Softfork that he would invent one. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:58:56
Mike seems to confuse people not switching to his solution as some kind of failure of the community. When in reality a lack of consensus is also consensus. Core/Theymos/DDOS attacks probably didn't help. But if increasing the blocksize-limit was really that important no amount of censorship, personal attacks, DDOS attacks would stop it from getting raised. 
The cost of doing a hardfork is currently probably still bigger than the cost of not increasing the hard-limit. Attacks can only postpone the inevitable but not prevent it entirely. Because the cost of not increasing the limit is only going to increase, making the cost of doing a hardfork look continuously seem less and less.




People paying too high fees and people paying too little are not really directly related to blocksize. A lot of transactions can probably pay less, and a lot of transactions probably should pay more. 
The reality is that we do not see massive complaints about fees or confirmation times. Transactions still pay a staggeringly low 0.0009% fees in fees (which has seen no significant rise yet). Pro Hashing paying as little as possible is bound to run into problems (i feel like that is his goal). And wallets paying too much can be caused by a lot of problems, lots of input, wrong fee calculations. 
Between those two cases is a world of difference in terms of fees. This means that it will take a long time before transactions paying normal fees are also going to be affected by the blocksize limit. Although I must admit that this depends entirely on the willingness of transactions to pay more. If transactions which look like spam where just cheapskates perfectly willing to pay a lot more, and not willing to drop off the blockchain. Then we might be in for a ride :O  (but that's hard to state as a fact).


A hugely invested miner doesn't have full control over policy just like a CEO of a big company can't do whatever he likes. He still needs to answer to investors (and/or his own wallet). 
It makes no sense that miners would run their own investment into the ground. Maybe to a certain extend, but not indefinitely. 
I also don't see how blocksize is relevant at all when Chinese miners can simply use stratum. Obviously not ideal, but it would work. 
I'd wager that Bitcoin is more secure now than when we were still vulnerable to botnets and miners were not so heavily invested. 


No one is forcing wallet dev’s to mark all transactions as replaceable. If that were to happen you should take that up with them, not Core.
A wallet making a transaction replaceable but not offering the actual controls to use that functionality is weird anyway. What would happen is you send an transaction (by default or by accident), and then when you discover your mistake, you replace your transaction with a non RBF transaction, then 0-conf should work again.
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:32:06


You should look up what the word "spoof" means. If someone really mined then that's not spoofing, that's real. And they would become economically invested whether they like it or not. 
For a small coin that might not be so significant, but for Bitcoin it is.

Did someone actually run those numbers with current transaction volume/types? I gladly rescind whatever i said if there is new data, until now I only heard 1.6 - 1.8.

Seems like the cost would go up for an attacker, and less so for an honest miner.

@_date: 2016-06-27 11:55:36
You missed:
1. SegWit activation in october/november
1. Running into the limit (with average blocksize) in august/september. 
1. RBF/CPFP usage probably going up 
At a certain point very low-fee transactions go from very slow confirmations to never. It will be very interesting if these use-cases give up, or suddenly wake up and start using higher fees. 
It is going to be an interesting ride the coming months.

FUD and personal attacks originate from both sides, deteriorating relations and preventing us from reaching any type of compromis. And without a majority behind a proposal to change consensus rules - whether this is via Softfork or Hardfork - Bitcoin is at risk of grinding to a halt. 
Core gave a random 5% of miners the ability to veto any change. If that bites them in the ass, do you think they admit that this was a bad idea? Or do you think they will blame everyone except themselves? 
War is expensive, its only a question how much collateral damage we caused. With people getting more entrenched I don't see this ending well, do you?

Firstly, i love your consider.it website. It's awesome!
Secondly, I completely agree with you. But to a certain extend block propagation (and its consequences) is also a mental hangup for a minority. And that minority is in a powerful position, isn't that the main reason we need hurry with block propagation software? Like you said, most want an increase now. 
Take for instance Theymos, saying things like ["What I'm concerned about is the increasing cost of running a full node"](
 and Luke-jr saying things like ["1 MB is too large today"]( 
I'm still waiting for the rationale and the design of BIP000. Without it it's a bit hard to know when we actually "solved" BIP000 and are "allowed" to do an increase. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 11:27:58


It might almost be as insecure for **very low fee** transactions. But that means you are still a little bit disingenuous. 
Ok, lets make it very concrete, so you also know where I'm coming from. 
I'm sending a 20 euro transaction to buy pizza paying a 0.03 euro cent fee. The pizza baker starts baking my pizza immediately, making sure I get my pizza sooner, and creating a flawless Bitcoin super fast payment experience. 
How exactly is that insecure?
With RBF an attack has a cost of zero, and a profit of 20 euro. Now you. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:06:30
Maybe this person meant a full client, and not a full node? And if we can't get equal security through SPV then the ability to run a full client would remain economically important, meaning that that forces blocks to be smaller. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:58:24


They don't need to be perfectly aligned. Selfish mining isn't some subtle private attack. There is no slippery slope


Incentives are never perfectly aligned. So I would not claim they are. 


We already have the best POW and you want to add another. You just want to force miners to download blocks because you inherently don't believe in mining on top of headers.

That if everyone outbids you by a factor of 2 or higher than what you are willing to pay, that you would still get into a block with SegWit?
Or that paying only half the price is the full benefit of SegWit? And that others using SegWit is of no consequence to you individually because it has no bearing on overall fees? 
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:13:08

You still need to trust the majority of miners. And there is a whole lot of trust involved when you use Bitcoin. Still better than the legacy fiat world, but still.

You could use the blockchain for timestamping and making sure votes are immutable and publicly verifiable. You would still need the government to issue unique identities, although maybe in the future this can be done by more independent parties. 
It would still not be completely decentralized, but it can be completely private (nobody knows what individuals voted for) and verifiable (end results + everyone can verify their own vote).
Sadly, nobody trusts computers and have no clue that this is possible.

No 2Mb would need 100% adoption. That will take a long time. Adoption curve goes fast at the beginning/slow at the end. 
Also, to be an effective 2Mb increase means that if transactions become signature heavy because of the discounts they don't actually provide more capacity (using capacity and providing it are two different things).

That's might be a self-fulfilling prophecy, if we made sure everyone got ready for bigger blocks (or if we at least added hardfork detection) years ago, then everything might have looked completely different.

In the fiat world they mostly have this very smart thing of hiding actual transaction cost and fees for normal consumers, go ask businesses/merchants what they pay to transact in fiat. And most people are not even aware that money is being stolen from their wallets, slowly but surely. 
The real revolution isn't consumers using Bitcoin, it is businesses using it and saving a crapload of money. And when businesses are tuned into Bitcoin, then you will see even bigger discounts for consumers who use Bitcoin arrive. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:42:27
Edit: Clearly I was wrong, by repeating what someone else said. I should get downvoted into oblivion. 
They tested 5 blocks bigger than 1Mb. So it should be fine. Because you can't scale up without testing properly. It's not just increasing some limit. We can run into all kinds of real world limits and intricacies.

@_date: 2015-08-28 11:13:38
I think BIP100 voting is super weird. There is no code, and it makes it too easy for the blocksize to actually decrease. 
If the majority vote for a bigger blocksize then the blocksize should increase, and if the majority vote for a smaller blocksize then the blocksize should decrease. That should be a prerequisite for any voting mechanism. And no small % of miners can hijack such a vote by voting extra small or extra big. 
Then the next step in finding a balanced average is easier. And more fair than only being conservative regarding increases and not decreases.

Obviously the nr of full nodes is going to decrease after the invention of SPV clients. I think that is a good thing. What i'm more worried about is SPV mining. That is fucked up. 
I can easily run a full node, i have the hardware, the bandwidth. But I don't do it because I do not see the point. I might start running an XT node though. 


So you would want to introduce a cap? How exactly is that going to work out?

Doesn't mean that the core devs couldn't be earnest in their concerns. Thats not what i say (or mean to say). I get that they might be planning for 5 years in the future, to make bitcoin sustainable even when the block reward becomes negligible. But for the moment I say: "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater". 
Gavin only kicks the can down the road, but sometimes thats necessary.  But that doesn't negate the work the core devs are doing. You need people like Gavin (and Mike?) to be pragmatic in some things. But you also need to have people look further into the future. 
I'm harsh in my remarks because I hope someone wakes up. And its not Gavin/Mike who need to wake up, because they seem to fully understand what their solution is and what it isn't.

I would not be surprised if bitcoin core comes with a solution which is finds a middle ground somewhere. But its comforting to know a bar has been set. That there is plan XT. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:22:59
Well as I see it XT is only an election. Having an actual solution and finding consensus. Actions speak louder than words. 
Do want core to converge towards the solutions in XT? Of course! But I don't see XT as a bad thing. 
Because what Bitcoin is isn't decided by the core developers. It should be an entity by itself. More distributed development. Competition. It can't be that bad. At least better than doing nothing.
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:26:40
I'm pro XT, and anti censorship. But I still believe core developers and even theymos want Bitcoin to flourish. There is just a slight disagreement what that means and how to do that. 
And if there is a conflict of interest with blockstream then that might not even be a conscious thing.

I'm not supporting any altcoin, because XT isn't one. Not by any stretch. If anything Bitcoin Core could become an altcoin, because per the rules of XT it is Core which will be the minority. There is absolutely no way XT can become an altcoin. People who say this are either delusional or lying. 
Yes, the ip filtering seems to make sense yes. And its configurable. I really don't get why people make such a big deal out of it. Seems like people are looking for something to hate. 
And I don't really care about trustworthiness. Bitcoin ought to be a trustless system. Its sad how people try to paint Bitcoin as this helpless creature which needs so much trust (in central development) to survice. 
Actions speak louder than words. And BitcoinXT is definitely moving in the right direction. It would prove that we don't central development. Its awesome.

@_date: 2015-08-16 19:43:14
Why does it seem like you believe that raising the limit also means that that volume is automatically filled? 
If the value of bitcoin is affected by the centralisation of bitcoin, why would any miner create bigger blocks? 
And it also begs the question. If the limit was 8Mb now, would you now at this time make your case for 1Mb? 
And there is no way in hell that you can control Bitcoin with just 6 people. You might be able to DDOS bitcoin for a while, but all the rules would still apply. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:49:11

And what damage will doing nothing do? Do you want bitcoin to never make important changes? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:32:59
If this issue is such a big deal then where are the other proposals? I personally don't mind if this is added. Its not like it only benefits lighthouse. 
If it gets 75% of votes then there is consensus with that patch included. So what is the problem? 
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:51:54
Yeah maybe we should have changed the algorithm every 3 months or so....
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:04:54
Yeah, change 75% to 95%, change the name, change the version nr in the correct places. The downside is that a very small percentage of miners could indefinitely prevent this issue from ever reaching consensus. That is where 75% comes from. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:05:41
Because moores law which still holds true today, keeping the 1mb limit actually lowers the barrier to entry for full nodes. Not raising the limit is the Action, and raising it at least by a factor of two every two years is akin to keeping the limit. 
So the key argument for waiting falls completely flat. 
The consensus is already that the limit should be raised. So the real question is why hasn't this been done already? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:24:37
Hardware is cheaper, transactions increase but the limit stays. Not choosing to change the limit is also a choice. That is a choice to force bitcoin into something it isn't (yet). This is no FUD. A Bitcoin which doesn't change can't be good, ever. Even if Bitcoin XT fails, then we would come out stronger. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 12:33:29
It doesn't matter if it materialises or not. Any lightning network should compete fairly with existing wallet software. So even if it was here, it would still be very unreasonable to keep the 1mb limit. Its not up to the core developers to decide this for everyone. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:33:57
Bitcoin isn't a protocol where you can have multiple versions and still maintain value. There is a huge economic incentive to converge towards one version, at least (but not limited) for rules which can cause hard forks. 
This notion of yourse that you absolutely need central governance for a decentralized system like Bitcoin seem very contra intuitive. 
I would say that you are wrong. But that's also because I personally would not value a Bitcoin where you are right. Centralization of Bitcoin like that seems so very wrong.  
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:29:04
Might be better to keep voting. Thats way more flexible. More experience with voting keeps bitcoin flexible. Who knows what we have to vote for in the future.

Yes and people actually compare this type of vote against BIP101 votes. Comparing apples and oranges. :X
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:32:10
An even more important question: Why are miners voting? Shouldn't the people who actually have bitcoin (and buy bitcoin) decide? I mean if 90% of miners vote for proposal x, but those coins aren't valued then that fork still dies a thousand deaths. 
For me giving so much control to miners doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:21:00
Yes! Amen to that! Currently we practically can't handle any scaling. And there is not even one concrete plan set in motion from the core devs.

So if you don't think the blocks will get full, why is an 8mb limit a problem? I don't understand your reasoning. 
You must not trust the majority of miners then. Somehow they haven't filled up to 1mb (most are still even at 750k) and you still believe that they will go rogue when you go to 8mb hard limit. 
You are contradicting yourself. 
And you are talking about centralisation and decentralisation as if its a black and white issue. Don't you want a future with a little bit more centralisation, or no future (for at least a lot of use cases). 
And speaking of use cases. Is there part of you who wants to completely destroy certain uses cases because thats exactly the space the Lightning network will occupy? Don't you feel there is a conflict of interest there? 
Do you at least recognise why so many people are angry? Do you see the irony that you claim to want decentralisation by completely centralising the debate on only one possible solution. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:51:48
How would that ever lead to splitting up bitcoin? I don't understand.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:00:51
Yes! So what is this debate really about? Its about control. The core devs have it, and they don't want to give it up. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:48:13
You mean software fork, or blockchain fork?
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:16:20
It's the people who want centralized control over Bitcoin to prevent it from becoming more centralized. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 17:00:17
No trolling, at least not on purpose. Seriously curious on where the mods stand on the issues. 2mb sounds awfully low. Haven't seen anyone else say that. Is that the official policy for the mods? Every opinion about block size increase of 2mb or higher needs to be removed?
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:03:10
By what definition is Gavin a rogue developer? He actually took over the work from Satoshi himself. 
Is there even a possibility in your mind that the core developers go rogue? 
I mean the only difference between Bitcoin code and Bitcoin XT is a name. I never voted for the developers of core. Did you? 
How do you choose who is right and who is wrong? Or are the core developers right by default? 
Do you see the dilemma here? You either choose who is right based on merrit, which means you look at both without prejudice. And making one simply better than the other, but label none as rogue. 
Or you admit that the core developers are right by default. 
Which is it?
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:42:47
That doesn't make sense. The only way that is true is if you believe bitcoin must never change in any way and that that lack of change is forced down everyones throat. Non consensus, no discussion.

So you believe he is able to get 75% of miners to switch to XT when in reality everyone is against it? Doesn't that seem a bit unlikely?

There are soo many people actually invested in bitcoin, that a lot of people really care about bitcoin. I haven't seen a lot of people here who don't seem genuine. 
I think that even the pro blockstream folks even want to create the most value for bitcoin. And I'm certain that Bitcoin XT people want the same. 
It actually seems to become more and more religious. 
Personally coinwallet could be on either side of the argument. But either way its really stupid and childish what he's doing. Same goes for people DDOS'ing bitcoin xt nodes. There are extremists on both sides. Lets not be those people. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:50:40

@_date: 2015-08-31 17:14:33


You do realise that you are here right? And all of the core developers etc. 
I haven't seen any core developer downright admit that they don't want to raise the block size at all. If you are able to point me in the right direction that would be awesome.


Yes i have seen it. It feels a bit condescending. Feels a bit like being rounded up ;). But i must admit the frontpage looks more usable now, and more positive. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 06:33:42
I think (or I hope) miners know that and therefor actually represent the economy and can't actually choose themselves. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:24:55
I read it, i should have added the word "realistically". A thousand block lucky streak? Miners who actively want a split without consensus? 
I ran a simulation with 200.000 blocks at 50% chance of mining an XT block and at most I got to 56% for the last 1000 blocks. So it might be theoretically possible, but the same can be said about 1 miner getting a lucky streak up to a thousand blocks. 
Edit: Made a small calculation mistake, changed it from 54% to 56%. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:49:41
Well i personally like to be able to still buy pizza with Bitcoin. It's the fastest and easiest way for me to buy pizza. 
But indeed why people value Bitcoin is at the heart of the block chain-size debate. It's the pizza buyers versus the hoarders. Its utility vs risk aversion. It's about wanting a fast pizza (with zero confirmations) vs securing the value of your coins. 
That's why people are so scared of any hard fork. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:37:00
No, i'm pro XT, but I believe moderates can change their opinion about what constitutes an alt-coin. Thats enough for now. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:57:58
I want to buy pizza also when transaction volume is high, and I want double spend protection so I don't have to wait for confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:39:37
These would be highly visible, and highly destructive for the price of bitcoin. And with highly visible I mean that its highly visible even before the attack takes place. Any type of potential monetary gain would be wiped out because the price of bitcoin drops significantly. 
But centralisation of mining should be addressed. Keeping the blocksize at 1mb is simply not the way to do it. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:10:02
I know what it has been called. How could I miss that? I mean that opinion is NOT censored
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:52:22
Eh, you know what the role of a maintainer is? Bitcoin core also has one. The buck always stops somewhere. It has to. You can't create anything with a commision. 
Just look at say a small project like Linux. Is there one person who decides everything?  How does that work? 
But maybe you just highlighted the thing which is so wrong with Bitcoin Core:  Design by commission. 
And can consensus be whatever a small group of developers say it is? When does it become too slow? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:14:18
By what logic is it an alt-coin? I'm truly curious
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:49:12
That really says something about the lack of competition in that area. 
But there is also this false belief that everyone should be able to run a full node. That is nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:07:08
It was a temporary clutch. Keeping it in is an explicit choice to limit the growth of bitcoin. Keeping it in is forcing Bitcoin to change in a way that might not naturally evolve on its own merit. Thats what's wrong. 
The question you could ask yourself: Would we be able to introduce a 1Mb limit now at this point when the limit was 8Mb? 
An increase in the limit does not mean we would suddenly grow to 8Mb. We simply allow for bitcoin to grow and NOT hit an arbitrary ceiling. Its not rocket science or brain surgery. 
Not raising the limit has the potential to completely destroy the ability to quickly send transactions from person to person using the existing wallets. And the question you need to ask yourself? Who gains from that when that happens?
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:27:07

Ok, so if I fake a million nodes I have a vote?
@_date: 2015-08-22 07:26:18
I don't know. If the most dishonest thing I say on the side of Bitcoin XT is that I question the motivation of developers who are in bed with Blockstream. That they want central control to keep bitcoin as de-centralized as they seem fit (oh the irony).
The core developers do not have the final say in what Bitcoin is or should be. It doesn't matter if they want everyone and their neighbour to be able to run a Node. Or if they don't value cheap transactions (a space which block stream happens to want to enter how convenient).
This is not debatable at all. There is no scientific answer to this question if there are people with different goals in mind. 
This is about control over Bitcoins future. Nothing less.
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:00:49

@_date: 2015-08-17 10:04:35
He knows what's he's doing. It's about control. 
Keeping the 1mb limit gives developers the power over Bitcoin. XT challenges that. 
Maybe money is involved but it's definitely about ego and power. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:59:31
Yes! People keep talking about hard limits, and almost no-one talks about soft limits. No one is forcing miners to create 8Mb blocks immediately. But that seems to be the argument. The argument that without a market of transaction fees that the bitcoin system is unsustainable. But why wouldn't miners create a market by lowering the soft limit? If its in their interest?
Maybe, just maybe miners are also interested in actually growing bitcoin instead of stalling its progress. At current block-reward that is perfectly understandable. 
No lets make sure we stay at very low transaction so we are certain we never get enough transaction fees. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:26:04
Nice analogy were he actually admits that they are changing bitcoin to a big degree without consensus. He admits he is building a brand new car. Doesn't that sound like a fork? Even moreso than XT. Doesn't that sound way more intrusive than raising a cap which was build in a time when one rogue miner could actually do a lot of damage. (Also because he wouldn't automatically be economically invested as much). 
Now we live in a different time, with more hardware and somehow this 1mb limit is being turned into something completely different. Suddenly its a feature. 
This is about control. The 1mb limit gives the core developers control over bitcoins future. To force their vision (and concerns) down everyone's throat. 
I'm not ignorant on their concerns. I simple do not agree and feel like those concerns are hugely exaggerated and unrealistic. And their concerns align way to much with their vision of creating a lightning network, which seems like confirmation bias. 
I don't want a market for fees at this time, might make sense later but not now. Let the market decide. Don't destroy ultra cheap transactions because you want to move in that space yourself. Seemingly with a for-profit solution even!! 
This really smells like corruption. Nothing less. 
We are not shouting because we are ignorant. We shout because we are angry, and rightfully so. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:57:25
what are you talking about? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:03:20


The 8mb doesn't have to magically solve every problem. No one claims it does. But doing nothing is definitely retarded. 


It is a fork. 


At any point the core devs can grab the changes from bitcoin xt and build on top of that. Or they keep putting their heels in the sand for as long as they want. It doesn't matter. 


Hopefully the community gets more nimble after this. More voting would be nice. 


Anyone can change variables. No need to ask permission. If your idea is viable it could become popular enough. 


Bitcoin isn't a democracy, its a Meritocracy.


Ever heard of open source? Of course its not a private project.

@_date: 2015-08-16 13:01:55
Or the value of bitcoin drops significantly, people want to send more transactions, nothing validates and bitcoin is completely dead.
If I send a transaction and it doesn't validate in 10 minutes I would certainly consider bitcoin less valuable. Is that concept so hard to understand? 
Some people simply like the idea that validated transactions itself become scarce. And if the majority wants that, then so be it. But if people are scared to let this play out, and start censoring things then thats just sad. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:39:57
Normally votes pass with 50%. So how weird is this? I also think that once there is momentum the consensus will easily pass 75%.
At 65% you can reach 70%, at 70% you can reach 75%. Of course given an infinite time you will even reach it with just one miner ;).
Miners follow the economic value, if merchants don't want this change then its unlikely we ever get to 75%. Miners don't life in a vacuum. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:50:34

@_date: 2015-08-20 10:52:39
Sadly not for no-reason. Because if even miners use SPV clients then no one actually validates blocks for consistency :(. 
Which is weird because miners could simply start mining a block to get a head start, and still validate the block to make sure they are not mining on top of an invalid one ....

Taking 51% processing power doesn't mean you win anything at all! If the economic value doesn't follow you still have nothing, and the 49% chain has everything. 
51% hashing power could DDOS bitcoin, but what good does that do to anyone? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:07:15

Can you please explain to me how we are going to end up with to viable chains? Because i really don't see that happening. BitcoinXT is asking for consensus. No consensus is no fork. And if there is consensus then there is only one viable fork.

What is wrong with that picture? What's wrong with allowing any negative articles about Bitcoin XT and deleting positive ones? I think it's this negative narrative which is driving Bitcoin in the ground. First by doing nothing and now by vilifying the only real solution. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:07:08
Yes exactly. If XT wins, then that actually proves that anybody can make a change. 
Can't we hire some independent reviewers? We just needs some unbiased research and advice. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:03:58
Well that would be irresponsible, and therefore not viable. Miners are not stupid. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:13:45
"The Bitcoin XT Trojan" why yes, that sounds very neutral. 
Trying to be neutral, and being neutral are two different things. 






Just admit its an opinion piece and not some neutral piece of investigation. 
Is it malice or incompetence? I'm neutral, i'm just asking a question.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:24:18
And what is the problem with that? Doesn't everyone deserve an audience to a certain degree. If its better then i'm willing to listen. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:58:13
Of course i do!

Is that because its easier to artificially limit the supply of bandwidth to maximise profits? ;)
Moore is 2,56 and Nielsen is 2,25 in the article what you mentioned. Both more than the 2x increase i mentioned.  
But maybe you wanted to strengthen my point. That would be a rare thing on Haha
Edit: I see now you are the great statoshi. My apologies sir. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:33:43
is dominated by BitcoinXT. And it seems like its the bitcoin core developers who are not in line with what the majority of the community want. 
Its the bitcoin core developers who created this mess by doing absolutely nothing. So the question is more, what are you going to do? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:14:45
Probably to not shut off being a provider also. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:45:25
Anyone can create a hard fork, anyone can split Bitcoin into two ledgers. But can anyone split Bitcoin into two viable ledgers? Now that is the question. 
I'd say miners aren't going to destroy their source of income like that. No one is going to mine on the minority side of the fork. Too much money is at stake. But also, no miner is going to switch to XT if the risk is too great. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:31:45
Well moores law still holds true today. And to be honest its a bet. There are uncertainties. No one is going to guarantee that Bip101 is perfect for the next 50 years. But I'm certain that if we can introduce Bip101, that we can introduce something better. 
Bip101 represents hope for a bitcoin that can adapt, not one which always stays the same. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:22:21
This is really insane. There is no way both chains will survive. So there will never be a split 
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:37:22


Thanks for making me find that gem! 
And I read most comments. Nice pissing contest, but I don't see huge objections either. But maybe you can create a post of your comment, its nice! 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:11:09
I like it. We could also do this with who own bitcoins. I mean shouldn't they get to vote?
For me you have satoshi, (ex) core developers, experts, miners, popular wallet developers, payment processors, services, webshops, bitcoin investors/owners

"This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most users/merchants don't use it. In normal operation this new code will never run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and home users will still be able to use the network without disruption." - bitcoinxt website
How is this presented as something bad? It seems like a very reasonable anti DDOS implementation. Given that XT nodes are in fact getting attacked seems to proof that this is necessary. (Sadly!)


Its even mentioned on the website. How much lies can you spin? 
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:47:27
I was wondering when this slippery slope argument would arrive

Who says that type of solution isn't given a chance? And don't fall for a nirvana fallacy. This debate has been going on for years. Don't hold everyone hostage to force a solution down everyones throat which doesn't even exist yet. Its madness. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:28:47
I meant that in the sense that it's the only solution which is being brought into practice. Definitely not the only possible solution. Sorry for the confusion. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:16:57
No compromise? Didn't they go from 20mb to 8mb? And why is the soft limit not mentioned? Apparently miners can choose a new fork, but we don't trust them to set reasonable soft limits? For me that doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 08:06:51
So per your definition BitcoinXT isn't an altcoin. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:52:43
The current block sizes are not limited (in practice) by the block size limit. So why would that suddenly change if the limit is set higher. It hasn't been a problem. So why would it suddenly become one?
And how many nodes do we need for bitcoin to still be de-centralized in your book? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:03:46
Bitcoin core can also simply merge the changes of BitcoinXT. No software fork, and if everyone upgrades before January 14th 2016 then there would also not be a chain fork. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:43:44
Every single issue? Things which everyone supports are still going to be added without a hitch. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:25:39
Did not know? Are you listening what you are saying? Its on the website! The fact that you don't know anything is because everything about XT is being censored. Oh wait, no not everything. All negative news is allowed. Wake up!
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:33:13
Well the good guys can become the bad guys, but I also think that sometimes the bad guys can become the good guys again. We must never accept all changes blindly. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:43:47
Nobody wants huge blocks or hostile hardforks. But XT doesn't create huge blocks, and the hardfork looks very reasonable. And thats beside the point. Because it didn't have to come to this. And blocksize increase is better than none and the core developers have had plenty of opportunity to do something. Keep stalling long enough and something breaks. 
And if you remove posts which do not agree with you, then you are being a bad shepherd of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:35:32
Wtf is the point of this? Sending bitcoins from coinbase 2 coinbase isn't sending bitcoins at all. And it also doesn't even use telegram completely. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:59:27
No, because then the price would go up. Bad news = up, good news = down. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:47:38
I actually think we need to have better solutions to fix centralisation issues. But I also think we need to raise the hard limit, so we don't accidentally kill off all potential. And I believe that soft limits can be used to actually try to keep limiting the blockchain size. 
I'm invested with a few coins, but this is still experimental. The worst thing we can do is nothing. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:19:01
The article very quickly concludes that Coinwallet is pro XT. But its definitely not that easy to conclude. 
Because if you want to create a market for fees, what would you do? If you want to prove that the 1mb limit isn't that bad. What would you do?
Think about it!
And really the other patches are not bad at all (i'm a developer btw). I really can't follow the conclusion of the article there at all. The article actually makes a case that the tor-patch is not as bad as i thought (its very selective when it activates, and it really looks like anti-ddos). The article has a wall of texts and is then makes the wrong conclusions, or at leasts conclusions which are not evident at all. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:16:07
I'm pro BitcoinXT but I would say: read all the patches. Its good to know what you are getting into. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:13:23
You are either malicious or incompetent. Because you say so many things which are simply not true, or which suggest things which are not true.

@_date: 2015-08-19 14:03:45
Wait, it dawned on me that if you found the empty block you would'nt have an incentive to share it immediately. But at the risk of creating orphans. No clue if and how that balances out though. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:27:22
Do you call every version which causes a hard fork an alt-coin? Or do you suggest Bitcoin never changes? Or do you believe in a name more than anything. Whoever owns the name "Bitcoin" is allowed to release versions and which you conveniently don't call alt-coin? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:31:24
If he wants to do it, and whether he does are two separate things. Maybe we should simply watch the code. Code doesn't lie.

@_date: 2015-08-24 12:44:56
How does that make you feel?
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:51:36
Wait what? There isn't a lot of changes. And its open source. Anyone can make a version with only the blockchain size limit if they wanted. 


How much more consensus do you need than 75%? We already seem to be hijacked into supporting the lightning network by the minority. 75% seems very reasonable. 


Do you have any clue what you are talking about? Thats like saying you can start adding an airbag after you hit a tree. How fast do you think you can upgrade when the shit hits the fan? You are being delusional.


If 75% use BitcoinXT and all miners keep the 1Mb soft limit then in reality nothing changed. No fork would actually occur. And you would have an airbag which is actually deployable in time.

No i was wrong. Its not true p2p.

XT isn't an alternative implementation! Its just a few more patches than just BIP 101 (which also make sense btw). Everything can be merged back into bitcoin core!

@_date: 2015-08-22 07:16:21
If by some reason developers are way too cautious, what would you do? Any group of people is very good of re-enforcing each others ideas. You can get stuck in a feedback loop so to speak. This happens all the time. Its the reason why the biggest of companies fail.

Who would keep running bitcoin core if there is &gt; 75% consensus? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:39:16
BitcoinXT simply is a version with the 1Mb limit changed to 8Mb (and some smaller changes) which the core developers didn't want to add. 
Its like the debt ceiling crisis in the USA ;)
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:29:28
The reason to keep the 1MB limit because of it being to difficult for normal users is complete bogus. Hardware is becoming cheaper and cheaper. So actually raising it to at least correspond to hardware increases would be akin to keeping it at the same level. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:03:28
If nothing happens and the core devs keep putting their heels in the sand then at one point something breaks. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:45:59
Why is the 8mb considered as something which would fill up immediately? Why is only the worst outcome considered? 
Apparently miners can already lift the limit with a simple patch, and a sensible majority vote. But SOMEHOW we don't trust them to enforce sensible soft limits??
Whats that about? 
And what prevents the core developers to release a bitcoin-core-4mb version? With the same voting mechanism. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:14:31
They censored it, one of the mod restored a lot of posts and now is unmoderated. Its awesome!
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:21:01
This is just rage inducing. Not because the news got it wrong but because the Bitcoin core developers are actually saying that. Bitcoin will not split. Whoever says that is spreading FUD. REDACTED will gain consensus and becomes the new Bitcoin or nothing happens. There is no realistic scenario that both chains survive. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:25:53
You are actually insane, you know that? We are talking about the 1Mb limit because we are FUCKING reaching that limit. How on earth would we be talking about 64Mb if the limit was 8Mb now??? That doesn't make any sense. 
And if a limit is reached, NO amount of fees is going to magically push your transactions through. And how are you even going to add fees after you send a transactions? 
If there is a better solution i would gladly look at it but this shit is retarded. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:59:05
Yes, and how many actually use bitcoin daily of that six million? 
Ok, I use bitcoin around 1 or 2 times a week. And you? From a sample size of two we can extrapolate ;)
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:38:23


Obviously Bitcoin is currently an alternative client. Both Bitcoin core and Bitcoin XT are on the same blockchain. No clue how by any definition XT would be an altcoin. 


I don't blindly trust anyone, I really don't like authority at all. I try to judge most things based on its merit (where applicable and its pragmatic to do so obviously). And I can write/read C++  myself. I'm not just regurgitating other peoples arguments. 
And for instance I really don't like Mike's proposal to show which coins have been marked as stolen. I think thats one of the most stupid ideas ever for Bitcoin. If that's something which says something about his character or motivations I will be extra wary about his proposals.  But honestly I think that was just a bit naive but probably well intentioned. I would personally also like to be able to punish everyone who steals, but not at the cost involved. 


Software is mostly an issue about trust. But Bitcoin is (and any opensource cryptocurrency) really something else. Its certainly bigger than the set of core developers. 
You know what helps? Deterministic builds. That is really cool. Would be nice if app stores supported deterministic builds. So that you could trust even the code of the most unknown developer if its open source. 
So yeah. Some trust is involved. We can't all be software developers obviously. But we can distribute the trust. We can organize independent audits etc. We can make sure we don't need to trust one specific set of developers, with ties to one for profit company for instance. 


So is censoring all positive posts about XT, but I should also censor myself? Why would I do that? I want to see bitcoin flourish. And I truly believe XT (and what it represents) will help in that regard. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:25:20
Thanks, you to. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:28:35
They are not on the same blockchain. Can you spend bitcoins on litecoin? 
Anything which extends bitcoin, like side chains, new bips etc. Those should be on-topic. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:34:31
Somehow you believe that using the 1mb temporary kludge as a way to force a new payment system upon all users is fair? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:24:10
It's a server side clone and therefor a fork. A fork on github just means you get some nice buttons. But it's trivial to merge changes back and forth the way the repository is cloned. So it is NOT a completely new repository, that would have been bad.
And it's a meritocracy because the actors are invested. Any change which devalues the system (doesn't have merit) would not be voted on. Pretty simple. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:18:22
I would say mods need to change, they don't need to be removed entirely. Its just their definition of what constitutes an alt-coin which need to change. (Yes i own bitcoins)
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:14:33
The whole CoinWallet mess can also be explained as someone wanting to prove that bitcoin can create a market for fees. I'm not convinced at all that CoinWallet wants to prove XT's point. 
And the article actually makes the tor-ban-code seem more reasonable than not. 
Edit: The coin wallet guy wants to get wallets to be smarter about fees. Thats what it literally calls for!!! 
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:24:59

@_date: 2015-08-16 11:11:02
Where is the sabotage? BitcoinXT is more like an election. If no one gets behind it then no harm is done. Actually, an active community is better than a silent one. Should we just trust whatever the core-devs decide? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:19:55
I already wasn't able to mine a single block. What good does running a full node do exactly? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:03:37
Block size increase is technically not exiting or hard at all. Its not a question whether its technically possible. Its more a question what miners and nodes are going to do. Miners who fill the blocks, nodes who run out of capacity. 
See we have FUD about a technical problem which is known to cause a lot of problems (when blocks are too small), and on the other side we have FUD about what miners might do (when blocks can be bigger).
I fully trust the majority of miners/nodes to behave themselves. That's always been the fundament of Bitcoin. No need to trust single entities, but overall with technical solutions and with invested actors you can trust everyone in general.

Don't you think its weird that BIP100 is only conservative regarding increases and not decreases? Shouldn't it at last need a majority vote to increase and to decrease? I mean if a majority wants an increase it should increase, and if a majority wants a decrease it should decrease.
We need to consider a view cases. 1) A lot of miners who abstain from voting. 2) A minority who wants small blocks. 3) A minority who wants huge blocks.  
Maybe you could lock yourself in a room with Gavin and create the ultimate blocksize BIP :D

Why do you value centralised authority so much? Because you are part of it? 
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:29:02
Well if its impossible to farm your own food because everything is industrialised, i would understand a little bit of resentment. 
Mining isn't as distributed (and safe) as it is supposed to be. They are even using SPV themselves to mine! How should we respect that? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:04:46
But its hard not to get the idea that blockstream is being promoted by killing off cheap transactions. So is there good faith? 
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:24:36
What side of the argument are you? Because you just made an argument for a block size increase. (To keep spv wallets functioning as they do now). 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:41:27
Maybe the chines understand that there is value in strong leadership. Would be nice if this still gets resolved in bitcoin core. We will see. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:58:30
are you blaming them for actually trying to get consensus? How is that bad? 
BitcoinCore doesn't suddenly cease to function. If there is consensus BitcoinXT is going to disappear and Bitcoin core will probably simply grab the changes from BitcoinXT. 
Only thing which might get hit is some ego's.

I deserved down votes with my tone. Not everyone should be able to read the code, but its frustrating to see people who can read it say that its about ip-banning or that it's a trojan horse. 


That's literally what the article says. When in fact the code does exactly what is mentioned on the bitcoin XT website. Lying gets more eyeballs I guess. Its really sad and infuriating. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:13:38
True you would have confirmations which take 16 hours each. And it would take 2 years for the difficulty to adjust. You would need to create a hardfork again to get it to work, making it again a different coin altogether. 
This utter distrust in miners is the whole reason there is a split in the community. Somehow miners are not in line with your interests? Somehow you think they would choose a path which goes against what all "normal" users want? 
Its not realistic to think that miners would not want whats best for bitcoin. Or that goals are somehow not aligned with normal users. 
You live in a fantasy spinned by blockstream and co. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:13:59
If you ignore XT blocks there would be no confirmations anymore...
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:30:25
Maybe they thought they were the only ones being smart. I hope they learned. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:54:33
Ok and who decides that? And how is that more important than making sure existing wallet software keeps working? 
If transactions become scarce, then the demand for Bitcoin decreases and the value with it. All to force lightning down everyone's throat. It really doesn't make any sense. And it's irresponsible and inexcusable.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:17:00
Nice how he talks about the lightning network as if it already exists. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:55:30
Why couldn't they find some kind of middle ground? Was any hard fork ever on the table? Because it seemed like it was all about the lightning network.
Do you think its correct to use the 1Mb limit as leverage to force the creation and adoption of an entirely different transaction system? 
Because as a Bitcoin user that's how it feels like. It feels like the debt ceiling crisis. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:02:05
The XT version could in theory add an unspendable address which unlockes for the first block which is mined on XT. Then we could simply send money to that address. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 12:51:25
Beware its hard to get a objective picture if one side is being censored. Its easy to confirm your own bias, especially if the only people who are left have the same opinion as you. Users are being banned, moderators kicked out and replaced. 
Tell me this creates a healthy debate. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:55:17
If they change anything which isn't accepted they are simply throwing away blocks. It's not so exciting. 
Bitcoin has a perceived value which gives it a mind of its own. That is what makes it resilient.
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:25:45
If people are truly divided it would be very unwise for miners to push to 75%. Its more likely informal consensus is reached between miners before they push beyond 75%. 
But its even more likely that Core and XT will support another BIP which addresses blocksize. Some kind of compromise so they can both claim a win. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:47:46
Well we might sometimes want to hear what they say? Any feature which is in an alt-coin might be adoptable. It can definitely be interesting. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:34:18
Bitcoin doesn't grow gradually. Who knows whats going to happen in the future which triggers a massive inflow. 


Well thats definitely not a solution. And thats not the consensus. Why do people think that not making a decision is also a big deal. Do people think you don't need consensus for that? 
Personally i think the fear of creating a hard fork is to big. Thats one of the reasons i cheer for BitcoinXT because that actually goes forward. It gives hope for more changes in the future. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:13:29
If you clone Bitcoin it is still Bitcoin. You can send me coins and I would accept them. You are actually making a stronger case that a fork isn't an alt coin.
You could change the rules. But then your software might not get any blocks anymore. 
An altcoin doesn't have to deal with consensus. BIG difference.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:50:41
What trojan horse? Or you mean protection against DDOS which favors normal node connections of TOR connections only in case when there is an actual DDOS going on? That trojan horse? 
And who is preventing anyone from using a version with Bip101 only? 
The reality is that all patches in XT are perfectly reasonable. As it should be. They are all in line with their vision. Not bigger, and not smaller than it needs to be. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:41:01
Because the blockchain not going to get filled immediately. Doesn't mean we should not anticipate spikes. Bitcoin could get an sudden influx of new users/use cases. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:28:30
Then bitcoin itself is an altcoin of itself. This doesn't make any sense. 
In essence you are saying that any change that a select few choose is not an altcoin. If you allow them to stall any kind of development for their own personal agenda isn't that setting a very dangerous president? 
What is bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:30:50
Could you draw a line where things are too centralised? What are good relationships between spv clients vs nodes vs miners? 
Are there also things we can do to increase spv security? Might there be more variants in between spv and full nodes? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:58:27
I really like that this article is so objective and technical. But lets not pretend that this whole debate is just about the blocksize.
Its about governance, distributed development, trust, SPV clients vs Lightning, short term pragmatism vs future proofing. 
I'm pro BitcoinXT and I really like the idea of Lightning. Can I please have both? I want to keep using my SPV client to buy pizza every week. And I want Lightning to compete fair and square with existing payment solutions to get a foot between the door. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:35:08
The trend is more visible in a logarithmic scale. Does that negate the trend or simply illustrate it? 
Most growth isn't linear anyway. Or do you want to claim Bitcoin growth is? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:39:32
No XT would prove that governance isn't centralized! 
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:47:21
You are right. Economics really doesn't need to follow any core principles. But if the core principles of bitcoin give it value, then wouldn't it be hard to undermine those values without undermining the value of bitcoin? 
I think a completely centralised version is completely worthless. Therefor any move towards a more centralised version would therefor hurt the bottom line of miners. 
But that all depends on why people value bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:23:08
Are those the people who feel threatened? Would explain the price drop yes. 
I'm pretty involved. Read the paper, still have/buy Bitcoins. And i'm a software developer from the age of 11, so i'm writing code for 23 years already. Put me in a room for a week and I can give you a rudimentary version of a bitcoin-like system. And I pay for things with bitcoin on average once a week. So yeah, i'm invested. 
I don't really like to make an appeal from authority. But you are asking for it. 
So why don't I think Bitcoin XT is the worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin? 
Although I must say that if everyone is scared of Bitcoin XT that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Bitcoins value is of course very subjective after all.
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:41:22
Well if they can vote for a type of increase, why not let them vote for the details as well?  Letting 21% of mining power vote on the lower limit, thats weird!
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:37:17
That's because a lot of people are screaming how bad a hard fork is. It isn't. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:54:48
6 people might be able to control a lot of hashing power for a short while, but no 6 people control enough nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:47:09
What is the point of a device without a display? A compromised phone would still be able to send all funds to an attacker (at the moment you try to send a normal transaction). 
Give me this with a display, or with at least a few buttons. So you can at least specify how much you are willing to lose in the event of a compromised phone. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:44:33
Its very simple, thermos (and others) branded bitcoinxt as an altcoin. They falsely believe that bitcoin is what the core developers decide it is. They believe in some kind of central authority in that regard (maybe also in their own authority). But that goes directly against the decentralised nature of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is NOT what some small group decides it is. The real Bitcoin is the coin with the most value. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:24:49
Don't miners have an economical incentive to not completely ruin bitcoin with spam? 
And if a lightning network creates more value (for bitcoin) then it might even make sense for them to lower the soft limits, and creating more transaction fees in the process. 
And what you call damaging, I call liberating. And yes, its also ugly and maybe even a bit extreme. But its progress, its movement. 
Ok, let me ask you this question. Would there ever be a moment where you would applaud something like BitcoinXT? How full does the blockchain need to be? How big do transactions fees need to get? There has to be a breaking point for you also where you would say a software fork is needed (if the core developers still don't do anything). 
@_date: 2015-08-30 12:21:25
Does [this]( look like it would take another year or two? 
I mean nothing positive is allowed to happen. No sudden increase in use cases. We MUST fear growth because no solution is in place. This is not just something which is a technical limit. This limit sends a clear message to every investor that Bitcoin has a hard limit.  
Its naive to think we can wait much longer. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:22:54
Obviously you need to consider that. But if you don't have a goal in mind, how would you determine a correct barrier for entry? 
@_date: 2015-07-04 12:00:49
Can't SPV wallets check a little bit more to prevent theses kind of mishaps? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:16:30
Why do you talk about the lightning model as if it already exist? Isn't that disingenuous? 
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:17:44
Not if you use a secure/trusted messaging system (like iMessage) and you can download a parameterised version of an app directly from the app store with the link. 
How would that be easier to intercept than bitcoins from an installed wallet? You simply send a private key, and if you really wanted you could also add a password which you send via another communication line. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:40:28
Without confirmations it won't survive. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:01:21
During the fork? You say that as if both forks will life side by side for any significant time. 
Most likely scenario is that BitcoinCore also implements the same changes before 2016.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:24:24
Exactly. The code makes a node actually usable. And yes it does so by sacrificing tor connectivity. But if the alternative is that a node doesn't work at all, then I would say that that is a good compromise. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:37:40
Well it seemed like the bitcoin core developers were not comfortable to make any important protocol change. So why would they start now? 
If they truly believe that their course of action is the correct one. They could and should completely ignore BitcoinXT from a technical point of view. If they are assholes they will try to undermine BitcoinXT. If they are good people they would still reach out. Its that simple. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:50:07
Shit man, do you know what a slippery slow argument is? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:45:24
Yes let's pretend it doesn't happen so most people can play dumb
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:39:30
That's not true. Mining pools might vote but they represent the people who value Bitcoin. Miners can't do what they do without people buying their coins. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:06:13
Bitcoin has value because it doesn't have a central authority. Well, its trying to shake of its central authority regarding its development. But after that its really decentralised.  
But the big question is, are there enough people who value such a system? Maybe the people who like such a thing are already on board? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:02:13
Of course XT can be redone. How hard is it to create a new version nr. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 11:57:59
Are they going to recover these losses then? Loss of blocks, bitcoin worth less, losing miners. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:22:40


This one is fun. On one hand he is now saying we can wait. And here you see him say you need to plan TWO YEARS ahead. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:55:14
This doesn't make any sense. Do you want bitcoin to remain the same forever? Not making a choice and keeping bitcoin on a 1Mb limit is also a choice. 
By limiting the discussion you are forcing your own opinion onto the bitcoin community. 
So yes, all forks should be discussed. Just delete Spam. And maybe join in the discussion when you don't agree. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:46:02
They need to change, but do not need to be changed completely. I see enough useful discussion that proofs they don't ban everything. 
There might just have been the false belief that BitcoinXT is an alt-coin, and the rules are rules. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:49:30
Yeah the fork should also have a better way to determine the difficulty maybe :p
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:20:11
You know full well that as technology improves latency goes down. Keeping the block size results in lowering latencies and the resources needed to run full nodes. 
What arguments am I misrepresenting?

There i fixed it. We live in the now. And at the moment bitcoin needs to grow. Or at least should be allowed to grow. 
I believe in bitcoinxt and i believe in a second layer service like lightning. I say give it a few years.

There is a split on this issue. It's not the end of the world
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:19:44
Yes of course. Thats one of the things I hate about most humans. I don't work that way, and I don't think that way. I despise hierarchies. 
But most want to look up for leadership. There still is the network effect. Were there is a natural tipping point for new ideas. And i don't think that adheres to a hierarchy. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:53:21
The consensus already was to increase the blockchain. There is no impulse. And calling BitcoinXT impulsive is a gross overstatement. Because it actually seems pretty reasonably implemented. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:38:16
Oh dyslexicStoner240, don't you doubt at all that "the standard" isn't as holy and perfect as you think? Saying that things stay the way they are is never an argument for anything. Even you have to agree that there is a point where others need to take action. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:53:53
Yes AMEN!! We all want all nodes to be equal. Maybe there is simply a distrust in SPV clients. We might need to educate people more about its safety 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:15:06
At what point should we then conclude that that process isn't going to come with a solution? I feel like Bitcoin is being hijacked. Call it a process or whatever, but keeping a kludge in bitcoin and suddenly calling it a feature is NOT good design. It doesn't look professional at all. 
If your point is that we somehow should respect authority, respect the process. But on what grounds? Actions speak louder than words. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:34:32

No there won't be any confirmations. If you are at 75%, which miner would still mine on software which doesn't support bigger blocks after two weeks? I'm saying practically none. So the other chain has no hashing power and no confirmations.

Preaching to the choir
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:59:57
Yeah bitcoin isn't going to follow technical growth. We need to be ready for an influx of users and new use cases. We need a high hard limit, and sensible (low) default soft limits.

@_date: 2015-08-18 09:42:24
Well in this case the people decide what they value. Even if they are complete idiots they will decide the future of bitcoin. Bitcoin is in that sense evolutionary. And the strongest version will survive. And yes that also means that any version which is exploitable might die a horrible death. 
But rest assured that something will take its place. And that thing might even rise from the ashes of the recently deceased bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-20 16:21:52
Change what? Other hard fork changes were just distributed without any consensus mechanism. This is a first. So what changed? 
Do you mean bitcoin core should have just decided on a new limit with no consensus mechanism? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 08:59:28
This is what I also do not understand. Miners can vote on any increase. But we don't trust them with a sensible soft limit? Weird.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:22:57
Wait, wasn't the consensus to increase the block size all along? The problem seemed that they didn't actually listen to the consensus. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 11:50:44
Except you are forgetting the damage to the value of bitcoin. How are you going to recover those losses?
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:21:34

By lighthouse you mean getutxos (request the contents of a ledger entry over the network BIP 64), and by IP blacklist you mean favoring non tor connections in case of a DDOS?
I mean your language is pretty telling about your coloured view on the patches. 
How about Double spend relaying? How about refreshing the DNS seed list? How about other DDOS protections? 
I have no clue why anyone would be against DDOS protections. And you can't be some conspiracy nutcase with this because its open source. There is no hidden trojan horse shit going on. 
For the getutxos. I really don't know how this is bad except when you don't want people to build services on top of bitcoin. There is not really an excuse to hold that opinion except when you want to do it as a personal attack towards Mike's project. Which is just sad. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:35:32


It is. What makes you say it isn't? Or is it a coincidence that the hashes are the same? 


Like i said, bitcoin is a meritocracy.

Miners have that vote by design. But miners are economically invested to choose wisely. So i don't see the problem
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:20:32
You are not replacing 20 developers with 2. BitcoinXT will follow bitcoin core. Maybe to the disliking of the core developers. But that seems to me more an issue with ego, and about wanting to be right.

Gavin is a pragmatist and not someone who will follow certain ideals to the max, and to the detriment of other qualities. Including the ability to do CoinJoins and CT in the first place, as those need more space on the blockchain(!) 
If you have the wrong priorities and are just an idealist, you will eventually end up with some perfect system which nobody will use. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:14:45
No miner would chose a hardfork if that would lead to a less valuable Bitcoin. But supporting a 2Mb HF and actually doing it are two different things. 
A [lot(!)]( of cost is being added to prevent miners from freely choosing what they deem is most profitable. We all suffer from these senseless acts of aggression and force. Some people seem to want to play a lose-lose game no matter the consequences. 
You can bet that Miners would not switch to a HF lightly, and that they still hope Core to come on board. 
You can also not look at [this]( and [this]( and then not feel like something needs to be done. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:56:38
Hijacking bitcoin by doing nothing also comes across as hostile. 
Pretending a kludge is now suddenly an important feature does not come across as reasonable.

How would anyone force anyone else to use this new client? You are not making any sense.
@_date: 2016-02-14 11:14:02
I said &lt;250Kb effective blocks. And if a hardfork happens, it should not have consensus. That's the whole point. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:13:27
Not really. Fear based decision making is be pretty bad actually. Better to stay reasonable. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 07:00:07


Because it can be faked. And paying for security should be a higher priority than paying for bandwidth. 
Miners, merchants, bitcoin businesses and exchanges all should already have enough incentives to run full nodes. If you want more security, then run your own node. If you want to pay random nodes, then you go pay random nodes. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:16:20

If everyone agrees with you guys, then why feel the need to twist, attack and censor so many people? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:46:03
You do understand that Core dev's signed off on 4Mb right? So ultimately it boils down to the method. Which is completely irrelevant if you have consensus. So basically the only reason we don't have consensus is because we don't have consensus. Because if we had consensus this hardfork would be a walk in the park. And it would have been planned months ago. 
Contrived problem is contrived.

I did read it, but I don't agree. Because on what grounds would we split? Because we are divided between team Core and team Gavin/Jeff? 
Imaging a split happening, what redeeming quality would 1Mb chain have? (which in reality would be a &lt;250Kb chain). 
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:23:02
One part of me thinks this is about Pragmatism vs Perfection, now vs the future. And you really need both. But to be honest, I don't see where Gavin can compromise more. I really don't. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:53:51
Haha, really? You take their word for it? Although its possible that thats really what they are after. We should obviously not trust what they say. 
And to be honest if you think 1mb is dangerous, and if you do not want a market for fees you would not condone Coinwallet's behaviour. So at the least that proofs its a lone wolf going against the interests of those who align with BitcoinXT.
Obviously its not easy to conclude anything from such a dark entity. Actually funny that you can interpret it in two ways. One day this could be a movie!

This is a strawman. I haven't seen people claim Bitcoin should be democratic. I did see people say they want Bitcoin to be more democratic. 
What people want is Bitcoin to stay the most valuable and the most popular. I think that Bitcoin is by definition exactly that. And no minority can change that. 
That is an econocracy, not a democracy.
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:47:43
A fee market and a fee market are two entirely different things. 1) We had a "natural" fee market, guided by the cost of adding transactions to a block, 2) now we have an artificial fee market at peak load (reliability goes down, fees go up), 3) and finally we will get to a place where fees will only go up (and a large number of transactions will fall off the blockchain forever). 
I'm clearly talking about the third fee market. The big one. 
I don't know what is worse, you misinterpreting me on purpose, or you really not knowing what I meant.

The title doesn't really capture it. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:40:21
Except not all miners where listed. The ones which do support 2mb but not classic where never reported as supporters for classic.
Even the letter does not go against Classic, it goes against doing a contentious hardfork. Something which classic doesn't necessarily imply.
Classic is a tool which can be abused, but isn't likely to cause problems given that this isn't in anyone's best interest. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:38:55
No, although maybe a nice sentiment, it is not doable. The voting is more market research to make sure that the software created does matches what the Bitcoin community/economy wants. Real consensus would still be whatever software everyone runs.

@_date: 2016-02-13 00:28:09
Your bias is so strong you cant see what is in front of you, the whole 'small block argument is based on FUD, how cant you see that?
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:32:05
1) The idea is that bigger blocks would prevent certain nodes from keeping up with bandwidth/storage. The reason why that is important is because we rely on the number of nodes to make SPV safe. Which is something we hope to fix soon. Also going from 1Mb to 2Mb to 4Mb isn't going to significantly hurt the number of nodes, and should give us enough time to improve SPV so the number of nodes won't matter as much (look up fraud proofs). 
2) In terms of Miner centralisation the idea is that bigger miners would have smaller risks of getting an orphaned block when blocks are bigger. So that small miners are more disadvantaged than bigger miners. Making small miners disappear. This is something IBLT and weak blocks will solve by making it much faster to transmit blocks, decreasing orphan risks to the point that 1Mb blocks would go as 100Kb blocks or even smaller. Just like with node centralisation, going to 2Mb or 4Mb isn't going to significantly change mining centralisation. There are WAY bigger forces at play which already cause mining to centralise, so it is weird to focus so much on this aspect. 
3) In terms of growth it is probably the reverse. A bigger blocksize means that Bitcoin grows more, which would result in more nodes and more miners and therefor more security. It is very likely that this completely offsets any loss in nodes from point 1 &amp; 2. Certainly when it comes to increasing to 2Mb or even 4Mb. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:43:23
He rejects the notion that we can know a split won't happen after a contentious hard-fork. Yet without a shred of evidence he says that a split can happen. 
If views where very far apart this might be plausible. But that is simply not the case. 
The reality is that keeping the blocksize small is simply unsustainable. This means that at the most small-blockers are smaller-blockers, and likewise big-blockers are simply bigger-blockers. 
If all arguments against doing an increase are slippery slope arguments, then planning an increase yourself kinda kills all those arguments. 
If you want an honest technical/economical debate, at least have some calculation which shows 1Mb is fine for the next several months. Or have some argument why doling out 4Mb to attackers immediately, and having a 1.75 Mb upgrade (which still costs 2Mb on the wire) is better than a normal 2Mb increase. Also one costing a lot more development effort for wallets, merchants and other bitcoin services is also kinda important. 
Now you have people saying we can't do a hardfork because a lot of people won't upgrade in time (for whatever reason), yet we are led to believe that these same people do upgrade in time to use these new transaction types. 
We are being sold a blocksize increase which can deploy fast enough, but would then proof we could have just as easily done a hardfork. Or slow enough that we still need a hardfork anyway. 
Core should honestly say whether they do or do not want to introduce a fee market. Being technically conservative and ignoring economic risks is not professional, and it might be downright dishonest.

I'm pro classic and I'm a big fan of things like CT. I have literally never seen anyone complain about CT or CoinJoin for that matter. 
And if this is some conspiracy theory, then I also must disagree. I can explain all actions of everyone sufficiently by understanding that people are passionate about Bitcoin, and maybe sometimes a bit misguided. 
With enough participants CoinJoin can also still attain very good privacy. And I was actually thinking that if we increased the capacity we should do a CoinJoin party, where as much people as possible CoinJoin certain fixed amounts. :D

Please don't state your opinions as fact. Furthermore you are going squarely against what Satoshi wrote in his white paper. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:45:15
Are you sure you want to drive Bitcoin's price into the ground with more attacks over a measly 2Mb increase? You do realise that Segregated Witness as a Soft-forks gives attackers immediate ability to create full 4Mb blocks, and that for normal users it is 1.7Mb (give or take)? 
If we fork, how is the &lt;1Mb chain any better? What quality does it have over the 2Mb chain? There will also not be a single big miner on that chain, so it will be effectively dead in every way imaginable. 
So are we sure? Yes! If core is fine with 4Mb, we are fine with 2Mb.
The only thing you are promoting is a FUDback loop. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 06:17:07
No that was not my question. You also have a weird definition of developer, investor, node &amp; miner support. 
Supporting the Core roadmap and supporting &lt;= 1 Mb blocks isn't that same thing. I would say it is the opposite. Furthermore there are non-developer on your list, and people who already dropped support. 
28,113 BTC is not a majority of investors. That is 1% of Bitcoin, still a lot but definitely not "a majority of investors", as most coins also come from a few people. I'd say it is an interesting but flawed metric. 
Node support is also weird to mention because those can be easily faked. Running a node isn't a vote. 
Counting miner support by block voting when voting hasn't even begun is also weird. 
And you skipped exchanges, wallets and users. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 12:31:25
Overprotective parents are annoying, but Core goes a little bit further.

Because obviously being right is more important than anything.

Well a fork is not necessarily a new currency. That depends on popular opinion, regardless of whether you personally agree or not. 
What if you introduce a 200Kb limit, would that be Bitcoin? No of course not. 
Now what if you introduce a 200Kb limit by explicit inaction when raising the limit was always implied, would that still be Bitcoin? No of course not. 
Yet somehow some people think that this inaction is somehow part of some social contract. It is not.

They are technically not different because they are ideologically not that different. We all value the same things, fungibility, security, decentralisation and bitcoins permission-less nature.

@_date: 2016-02-06 10:10:07
Do people actually disagree about blocksize at this point? With SF-SW going to 4Mb (for attackers) it makes little sense to be against a 2Mb HF in terms of blocksize-limit. 
And if SPV is improved, block propagation issues solved (for the most part) and off-chain solutions are cheap+fast+secure then no-one should care about block-size anymore. 
Maybe we never can satisfy the extremists on both sides, but the middle should be able to come together. At least in terms of blocksize-limit. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:37:46


This back and forth he said she said is not constructive. I'm pretty sure that faking support would be more detrimental to the cause than actually getting people on board. 
The only miners I hear complain (BTCC and F2Pool) are also not on the list, that gives me more trust and not less.
On the other hand, counting chickens before they are hatched is also a bit weird. Saying you are going to run a client which votes for a HF, and actually doing it are still two very different things.

So we are taking millions of dollars to pay miners to execute an attack. As they are at least invested with &gt;25 mil, so lets say they need to pay at least 10 million to miners for this attack. What exactly does that get them in return? 
Miners could switch to alternative consensus rules, but if that doesn't have economic support then they would mine unsellable blocks. Meaning that the investment is a sunk cost. 
Such an attack won't last very long, which would make the Sybil attack futile as well. 
It doesn't seem economically feasible.

Seems like that is proof of having the data, not of validation. Still if validating doesn't cost more than the added risk of mining on top of invalid blocks it should already be OK. 
Problem with this entire approach is that empty blocks (mining on top of headers before validation) prevents orphan risks/cost. Seems like you need to solve that first before you should prevent this crude workaround.

@_date: 2016-02-02 12:50:01
Very good to make these things explicit. At least now we have something to shoot at ;)


This has **broad** economical consequences. As you give any random entity a veto for any changes which need a hardfork. This policy could be the end for Bitcoin as the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency as development stagnates and when off-chain solutions can not quickly replace or extend on-chain solutions. 
Not changing certain things does mean forcing an opinion of a minority upon a majority. Which taken at face value is a lot more ridiculous as a majority forcing changes upon a minority. 
And make no mistake about it, this unchangeable nature is presented as some kind of fundamental property of Bitcoin, that without it Bitcoin would crumble. When in reality this is definitely **not** part of the social contract, and it is a very dangerous idea. Satoshi was very clear about this. 
This is all politics, which was started by small blockers, hurtful propaganda. With Segregated Witness **as a Softfork** as the embodiment of these flawed principles, and a by all means a political move in itself.

@_date: 2016-02-04 11:08:50
Some side notes: 
1. It is likely that the amount of security we now enjoy (25BTC per block) is a lot more than we actually need. 
1. If bitcoin's value increases only by a factor of two every 4 years, then block reward would effectively stay the same (no need for fees to increase)
It is a bit weird to worry about fees now. The best thing to do would be to simply expand Bitcoin any way we can. 
But any off-chain solutions which increases the value of Bitcoin is a very very good thing in terms of security. Even if fees would initially go down but the prices goes up it would even be a good thing. 
The big question is: Is it eventually better or worse to force people into off-chain solutions? What does creating a fee market now do to Bitcoins price?

Yes, do a slippery slope argument with your tinfoil hat on. There is almost no-one who wants to keep the blocksize limit, but somehow we still need a conspiracy theory to explain people wanting to do a simple 2Mb HF. Really? 


Bitcoin should really not be worth anything without decentralisation. Again, there is not a single Bitcoiner who thinks decentralisation isn't important. 
Am I a paid shill? Is that what you are saying? Am I not allowed to have the opinion that an SF-SW as a blocksize limit increase is too little-too late? You can't imaging someone disagreeing, so therefor there must be a conspiracy.

@_date: 2016-02-14 10:37:32
The only reason someone like you (or anyone) could favour a minority having veto powers over a majority is because you happen to agree with this particular non-change. 
The reality is that you can't be into the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency and then try to change it in ways which would make it less popular and valuable. Then you are into the wrong crypto and clearly you want to turn it into an alt-coin. 
The most perfect cryptocurrency is probably the one which no-one uses. If you don't understand how usability is important then you are doomed to push Bitcoin into obscurity. 


We would not be talking about governance if Core had added a blocksize-limit increase. Make no mistake about it, we are having a debate about governance because they continue to refuse to add a reasonable increase (to the roadmap). 


What he describes is cold hard reality. But only if any resolution is perceived as less costly than doing nothing. Which is probably not anytime soon. 
And forcing your principles on someone is a perfect way of showing bad your principles are in the first place. Reasonable people compromis, unreasonable people don't. It is pretty simple actually.

This isn't some tragedy of the commons where we can race to the bottom and suddenly find ourselves with no security. Why would miners ever add transactions which add no value to the network? Why would people suddenly stop caring about security? Why would businesses who rely on Bitcoin not also sponsor it? 


What kind of attack are you thinking about which relates to market cap? You mean the attack stays the same but the effect is bigger? Wouldn't the effect not also be smaller because the market has a bigger chance of absorbing shocks? 
With Lightning people can automatically lock up coins without having to wait for it. You can easily go to 12 confirmations to upgrade the security of your now more valuable coins. 
Lightning would make attacks on Bitcoin a **lot** harder, and a lot less effective.

@_date: 2016-02-12 12:10:47


Yes, and that makes a miners vote for valid blocks more important, not less. You are arguing against yourself here. 
Or maybe you don't understand that partial validation means you have SPV level security. 


Sure if you can validate something yourself easily, then why not. But that is a cost/benefit issue. 


Then you have a black/white view on security. 
I mean you can chain up your car to a post every day. That gives you better security. But the cost (inconvenience/time) does not justify the added security. 


That's not going to work. A hardfork is coming at one point. And at that point you could still be against it. Which would make your position untenable. As the minority chain (or the dead chain) would be considered the alt-coin. 
And your position is weird anyway. You don't like SPV and you want to consent to rule changes, but getting kicked into SPV security by a majority of miners is fine? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:53:15


If not changing something devalues Bitcoin then a change will come eventually. Kinda pointless to try to prevent a change. You will just get railroaded. 
If you can only change things via hardfork which are completely uncontentious, then you basically give a a random(!) minority a veto. Which will at one point devalue Bitcoin.  
So it seems it is you who doesn't have a clue about Bitcoin economics. :)

I was talking about veto power because the alternative to a contentious hardfork is giving a veto to a minority. Maybe you already understand this devil's dilemma.

@_date: 2016-02-09 09:21:50
Blocks are full, blocks are not full is a false dilemma. Because obviously there is an in between stage where blocks are sometimes full, which in turn makes fees erratic. Make no mistake about it, that does have a cost. 


These are very scary remarks. The "I think this is cheap" is the worst argument for setting a price ever. Your personal opinion is exactly 1 data point. If you personally drive 100% of the economy, then your opinion has weight. Else it has the weight of your economic contribution. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 10:53:53


You either do full validation, or you don't. If you don't, you need to trust the majority of miners. And yes, they can say whatever they want. 
If you want to be 100% sure a transaction is valid, you need to check all its inputs, which can go all the way back to the genesis block (depends on the taint). 
SPV will therefor always trust that the longest chain is also a valid chain. For instance UTXO commitments would improve security, but would not completely invalidate the need to vote for validity. Voting matters, and it will continue to matter. 


You are asking me the same question twice in a row. 


What does this mean? That you never trust SPV? That you will never upgrade your software? 
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:14:08


How would proofing you have the data proof that you validated the data? 
Would it not make sense that the validation process returns a hash which needs to be added to the next block? Then you can't turn off validation anymore.

@_date: 2016-02-13 09:43:37
Have a mere 15% of miners publicly abstain from voting, who start to mine at 75%, then you effectively have a 90% activation percentage. Or miners can first vote through a dummy version number before the real vote. 
The need for an 90% is based on FUD. Sure it guarantees that it doesn't activate sooner than what is safe. But in the real world we have incentives. Miners have enough incentives in place to want an clean hardfork. 
If a majority of miners ask for a 90% activation limit that's like saying they don't trust themselves. Very weird. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 10:56:58
And on the other end we have people with a burning desire to introduce a fee market, to put decentralisation slippery slopes above anything else and to force people into all kinds of solutions (some which they didn't even ask for). While they promote a solution which gives attackers 4Mb blocks immediately, but normal users just have to wait months if not years to get to effective 1.75Mb blocks. Still month by month goes by and no hardfork is planned. 
And you think it is weird that people take issue with that?

You need about 20 Kb/s for 4Mb blocks, I hope that that isn't a problem for you. So you are correct, at a certain point block-size would prevent you from running a full client. But upgrading to 2Mb won't have that effect. 
And SPV can and will be improved so the need to trust a node is diminished. Comparable how with the trust model of a Lightning node.

And 90% / 95% is weird. If miners want to do a test run in determining support they can all set a different flag, and then only vote for real when 95% is reached. Another way is for 20% of hashing power to publicly abstain from voting to simulate a 95% vote. 
The problem is that people think that whatever percentage doesn't vote is also the percentage which would be left on the legacy chain. Which is of course utter nonsense.

The kind you can't fake without running validation logic. It should hash all the things which are also validated in such a way that not also doing the validation doesn't make any sense anymore. The risk/cost of building on top of an invalid block should be greater than the gains from only creating the validation hash without actually checking the validity.

That's sounds like a zero tolerance policy. You are entitled to your opinion, but if you want to turn an arbitrary limit into some magical threshold which we can't cross then you come off as disingenuous, and as an extremist. 
And you want the full truth, then you need a fully validating client. Not one which trust miners to provide the truth, as that could be faked. So the Core roadmap isn't going to help you with that. That actually gives you 1.75 Mb for the price of 2 MB, while allowing attackers full 4 Mb blocks immediately. 
And what you want or what any minority wants is besides the point. A minority should not be able to force a change on the majority. Forcing something upon a minority is also bad, but at least it is less bad. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 13:27:21
The problem with an artificial market is that transaction fees switch from being cost based to whatever people are willing to pay to stay on a block. Those are **completely** different price points. And people will stop using Bitcoin altogether and move to other solutions. 
It is a bit like Ticket Scalping.

Miners probably do have the ability to nudge everyone in a direction. But only if the direction is seen as positive or only mildly negative.

While classic can't grab a random set of Bitcoin companies/miners and claim some kind of consensus, that means that this also applies to this random list of supporters.

You repeating your opinion is all nice and dandy. But in the absence of uncompromising offchain solutions (layer 2) your remark does not yet apply. 
And your opinion has as much weight as the value you bring to the economy. If you don't then it is pretty much irrelevant. 
If on the other hand the current payment network does add value, then that is worth protecting. 
A smooth transition from the current payment system to the next would make more sense anyway. Pissing off people in that sector isn't the best way to ask people to adopt any off chain solution. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:23:23
These absurd strawman arguments are really disingenuous and depressing. It simply doesn't contribute anything positive. 
It is complete hyperbole and a slippery slope argument: "if you can change this thing which I disagree with only because you change this parameter a bit faster / more than what I personally planned, then Bitcoin is doomed". 
It almost sounds like we are having a debate on whether on side wants to completely hand over Bitcoin to banks, 21 million cap be damned. 
There is no world of difference between small blockers and big blockers. Which should actually be named "a bit smaller blocks" vs "a bit bigger blocks". 
@_date: 2016-02-12 12:29:28


Because it aligns with your views. If it didn't you would not be saying this. 
If 10% of miners were against a certain change which you wanted, which everyone wants except those 10% of miners. Would you really be talking this way? 
The cold hard truth is that if not upgrading something costs more than upgrading, then the upgrade will happen. No amount of a minority disliking a certain change is going to make a difference. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 09:39:52


And that's somehow different from what the white-paper says? 


It is clear that you need to trust the majority of miners for SPV to work. But that is even true for Bitcoin itself. Nothing changed. 


Sure if you can validate something yourself easily, then why not. But that too is a cost/benefit issue. When we have UTXO commitments hashed into blocks, you really don't need to sync all blocks down to the genesis block. Nice if you can, but not strictly necessary. 
Basically I'd argue that Bitcoin is the longest chain by vote of miners, and that this does include consensus changes. As it already has, and it because it eventually will. It only needs us to trust the majority of miners. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:04:22
The idea that it is simultaneously dangerous and costly to have bigger blocks, but that miners would create them is very counter intuitive. Anyone advocating for a larger limit does **not** advocate for blocks of equal size. That's a strawman. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 09:09:27


Those rules are clearly not meant to be set in stone. They have and will continue to evolve. Whether that is via soft or hard forks is besides the point. 
I'd like to see you make the case for "No voting matters, Bitcoin is not a voting system except for hash power deciding double spending resolution". And how that doesn't go against the whitepaper. 
You might also want to look into this thing called SPV ;)

Amen to that! Promoting that everyone and everything upgrades to Segregated Witness on such short notice is way too fast, or too slow as a block-size increase. Quality should come first, therefor a hardfork would have been much better. 
Just very sad that such a thing hasn't been planned months/years ago. Giving minorities veto powers costs us all.

@_date: 2016-02-14 11:01:33
You are not describing a difference between a &lt;=2Mb vs a &lt;=250Kb chain. You are describing people making good on their threats. Threats to leave Bitcoin's development, and threats to actually make the fork as dangerous as they say it is. 
The only reason a hardfork (as coded in Classic) is costly and dangerous is because people actively want to make that a reality. If only because it gets postponed until it needs to be done quickly. 
Good people (at heart) would say "We don't agree with this hardfork, but if it happens we will make sure it happens we will make sure it happens as smoothly as possible by releasing a compatible Core client". 
On the other hand if you are a bad person you would try to escalate it as much as possible, because then that means you were right. And being right is always the most important. Isn't it? 
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:13:04
Bitcoin's software development is currently centralised. Simply because we cannot switch easily between implementations, and we can't freely extend the platform as we see fit. Maybe some people disagree with that assessment but that is the cold hard truth. 
Core is in control:
 
1. by virtue of currently being the best at developing and maintaining Satoshi's client 
1. by threatening to leave Bitcoin's development if some other client stages a "coup"
1. by threats of DDOS attacks against alternative clients
1. by means of character attacks
1. by means of propaganda and moderation on all major bitcoin fora (which favour Core)
1. by means of threatening to create unnecessary mayhem (by keeping the legacy chain functioning)
1. by means of threatening all kind of monetary attacks
If there is any kind of vendor lock-in then development **is** centralised, regardless of Bitcoin being open source or whether that development is good or bad. A dictator is a dictator however benevolent he is. And whether Core is in full control, or that at some level people are still free too choose is also besides the point. Because some force is most definitely applied. 
It also doesn't matter whether Bitcoin Core is controlled by a company, by one person or by a group of volunteers. That too doesn't make it's development model any less centralised. 
You might see Core as a perfect entity which only has one goal, and that is to make sure all changes to Bitcoin are technically sound and add value. The problem is that that is still highly subjective. One way to "fix" that is to never do anything contentious. But that too can have devastating effects. In-action and indecision certainly do have real world effects and are not always objectively the best thing to do, or not to do. 
That being said, a centralised development model also does have a lot of good qualities. And being conservative and slow seems to suit Bitcoin for the most part. 
I personally think we can do without all the threats and attacks, and that we sometimes should be open to contentious changes and seek some real world consensus. Because consensus from software developers might not always correspond to what the Bitcoin economy prefers. I also think that would not be so scary, because everyone's goals are not that far apart as we might think.  
Edit: I'm not suggesting that Core dev's are active participants in any specific attacks. They are not responsible for all actions of third parties. 
@_date: 2012-12-29 08:37:49

Yes. All indication of the block-size suffering from a tragedy of the commons, or selfish miners stuffing the blocks are FUD until someone actually proofs it is possible and even then any counter measures still need consensus. 


Sure, attack vectors should be limited. But attacks from a majority of miners do not need to be considered. Bitcoin itself would be fundamentally flawed already if we need to take that into account. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:49:44
I'm actually a software developer and been into Bitcoin from 2012, what about you? I've seen all the arguments, and all the evidence so the "I don't buy it" isn't some random remark. But if you think there is something I haven't seen then by all means show it. 
So what are the arguments for "BIP101 is a security issue and opens up new attack vectors."? What are these security issues and these attack vectors exactly? Lets even say BIP101 still upgrades the limit to 20Mb.

I have asked Luke-jr and he only scoffs at it, saying it is too complicated and he seems to want to believe you can't move coins back and forth (from legacy to new and back). But his main argument is that the auxiliary chain would be less secure. As it would grow bigger, can't be validated by everyone and could therefor move non existent coins to the legacy chain which doesn't correspond to an actual transaction in the aux chain. So any single miner could fuck it up entirely. 
But that should be fixable with some kind of time locks, so that you need a majority of miners to execute such an attack. Or where you do need some kind of SPV-like proof when coins move from aux to legacy.

@_date: 2012-12-30 16:57:03
Yes of course. The code is more looked at than written. And the main client is mostly a reference implementation, a test-bed for new features in the protocol. Most processing power lies with the miners, and they use different software. 
Getting any fraudulent transaction in the main chain would be very difficult. Because that means you need to add the fraudulent code more than 50% of all the clients. That would be very hard. You wont get anywhere with the main developers for just the official client.

What you would get is two types of nodes. Pruning nodes, which go well with other pruning nodes. And archiving nodes, which go well with other archiving nodes. The idea that you would want to check years and years of bitcoin history and then throw everything away is absurd. 


Keeping a record of all transactions has nothing to do with Bitcoin's decentralized nature. 
You are confusing the need to trust the longest chain vs running the code and checking everything yourself. 
Which is weird because Bitcoin isn't completely trustless. You don't need to trust a single entity, but it still relies on trusting the entire system as a whole. So trusting that the longest chain is correct isn't a big stretch.

With multisig I meant that YOU are able to choose who needs to sign a transaction. Be it an online service who checks spending limits, who adds 2FA or friend, or a second device. 
So we need some kind of BIP to enable such a thing. Not just the multi-sig ability. But also a standard way to broadcast a multi-sig request.

I had a hard time finding out what this article was really about. But I think the main point was: Keep control over your bitcoins and don't put them in a 'bank'.
Although given the heated arguments about other types of decentralisation (like mining and software development) you would almost assume its about one of those types. 
A friend of mine mined bitcoins, and he holds all his bitcoins in an online web wallet. Told him he was being stupid. One hack and everything is gone. 
Best way to keep bitcoins is with multi-sig wallets. One key online, one key on a device and one on paper. You need two to move funds. 
But if you could set some kind of spending limits for certain keys in the blockchain itself that would be perfect. One set of keys for daily stuff. And offline keys to transfer more. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:41:23

You can't bend reality to such an extend that it fits your agenda. Introducing a limit when there would also create a hardfork if the majority would still mine on the larger size. People on the smaller size would be just as left behind as when a majority decides to create bigger blocks now. There is absolutely no difference. 
A hardfork isn't exciting at all with any majority of miners.

Edit: Well this is awkward. The person above me said something like "Gavin is definitely wrong something something".
That is clearly debatable. The big question is, where does Bitcoins value come from? I would say that it needs to be usable. If you have all this value in bitcoin but it can't move quick enough then its useless. And yes that is an opinion, but also a value assessment. If no one holds that opinion, and everyone shares yours. Then you are indeed correct. 
So you are incorrect simply because not everyone shares your view. 
Lets say 90% think Bitcoin is valuable as a store of value, and doesn't need a lot of transactions. And 10% think Bitcoin is valuable because of super low-fast zero confirmation transactions. Then ultimately you kill off 10% of the value. 
So many people debate the block size from a technical point of view, then form a personal opinion (based on how you value bitcoin, some beliefs) and then we fight. 
But in reality its about people. It doesn't matter what your opinion on Bitcoin is. It matters what the (economic) majority think Bitcoin is.
Maybe we can lose zero confirmation transactions, maybe we can lose low cost transactions, maybe we can do without SPV wallets, maybe we have enough time to wait for LN.   
So really, your opinion doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. All our opinions matter. Because ultimately, bitcoins value lives in our minds. 


The debate is going on for years now. Should gavin ring the bell when its already to late? What is your point? 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:19:54
Can you explain exactly when BIP100 activates? Because when i read it now it seems to activate immediately and thus effectively only changes the blockchain size when 80% of hashing power wants an increase (a decrease would stay compatible with version 3). 
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:12:28
Maybe we should count inputs/outputs and not transactions. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:30:02
Not really. If no one buys coins on their fast chain then it will not survive for long. Exchanges just have to wait till the miners come crawling back. 
Its not that simple. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 09:25:46
A bond doesn't have an identity attached to it, for which you can't prove anyone doesn't have. 
A bond is just a physical key and not a digital one. 
Its not **that** much different. Mostly its simply more efficient, and we can do without notaries/lawyers/banks etc. 
Its not hiding money which was difficult. It was spending it without getting caught. 
So I would say Bitcoin doesn't change that much. But maybe combined with purely digital luxury goods/services it might be a problem, but I don't think we will trade in our real world for a virtual world anytime soon.

You are not doing the same thing. You even announced your intent. 


Behind every transaction is one stupid person. Its like distributed stupidity. Clearly there is a market for that kind of stupidity. No criminal intent do disrupt the network. 
You are centralising a LOT of stupidity in one place. You show criminal intent. And you have made yourself into an easy target. People probably already have your name/address and are simply waiting for you to fuck up.

@_date: 2015-09-06 07:38:09
That doesn't really answer the question. Its pretty vague.
The most probable thing they are going to to is create (closed source?) software and services for hubs, payment processors, exchanges etc. By completely owning the space of cheap transactions. 
The problem with that is that its in their interest to kill off SPV clients (or things like BIP64), zero confirmation transactions etc. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 09:27:25


And I say changing a 1mb limit into a feature is wrong. How can you fault Bitcoin XT by default because they are the ones who split? If core is really unwilling to accept any kind of compromise then what IS the correct way to handle such a situation? 
The lack of empathy and understanding for why there is a split is really appalling. 
This is for me literally a naming game. It can't be that whoever happens to control a name is the defacto leader. That doesn't make sense for and that doesn't make sense for "bitcoin core". 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:51:06


I trust Moore and Nielsen yes, following those trends actually means the decentralisation forces regarding bandwidth/processing/storage stay the same. And I started bitcoin unlimited, so I firmly believe that we can remove the limit altogether. 


Clearly you aren't a developer. And those changes are perfectly aligned with the blockstream vision. So color me unimpressed and a little wary.

Bitcoin is groundbreaking enough by itself, it really doesn't need to replace dollars/euro's/banking completely. If anyone can create banking services, and if no-one can hold the payment network hostage then we all profit. Even the people who don't even know what bitcoin is.

Read the [comments]( its about a difference in philosophy. A philosophy which might very well remove SPV functionality altogether from Nodes (first make it an option, then disable it by default, then remove it).
You understand what is going on? BIP64 is a perfect example of the difference in views. Its perfection vs pragmatism. Wanting to make bitcoin more perfect for a Lighting network vs. building on its current strengths. 
The only way you could say Gavin/Mike are wrong is if you say their vision is wrong. But who decides exactly what Bitcoin is? Even if the community is split 75% to 25% in small blocks/waiters vs big blocks (my current educated guess), would it be fair to force small blocks upon a minority? 
What i'm certain of is that this blind hatred of Mike is uncalled for and very unhealthy. People like you are demonising both him and Gavin, and it leads to all kinds of subsequent attacks. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:22:35
ASICS are so easy to purchase, and production isn't controlled by one entity that its pretty save to assume that not one entity controls mining ATM. Else we would also have bigger problems. 
Question for you. Would we introduce a 1mb limit at this moment when there would have been none? Because somehow the choice to change something is met with more scrutiny than doing nothing. 
I mean the 1mb limit, and the timing is so arbitrary. That anyone who claims it should stay in place is suspect. Who is making the calculation which says 1mb is the correct limit at this very moment? Who?

@_date: 2015-09-17 07:46:01
Introducing a smaller block size hard limit still creates a hardfork. I mean you can have all the consensus you think you need but if &gt;51% of miners still create larger blocks you still end up with a fork. 
I think you are talking about rightfully or wrongfully left behind or something. 
Its just easier to force a smaller size upon everyone than a bigger one. Doesn't make it more right/wrong.

You are the one branding it a conspiracy, when Adrian-X was just mentioning facts. There is censorship going on on and the core core developers are employees of Blockstream. Its not a conspiracy if its true.
But! That doesn't mean the core core developers aren't earnest. By joining blockstream they just publicly show their view for bitcoin. Although they probably had these views already to a certain degree. Investing in those views definitely creates a conflict of interest. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:49:03


75% is a supermajority. If that isn't consensus then I don't know what is. 
Or maybe you think the 20% majority vote in BIP100 is better? ;)
 &gt; Most ≠ all. 
True, but what's your point. 


I won't dignify that with a response. Except bip101 is a bandaid, it really isn't the perfect solution to all of bitcoins scalability issues.

38% of people with commit access are affiliated with Blockstream, and 40% of the top 10 committers of last year. And that still leaves people with no clear affiliation. Maybe luke is the only one who is honest that he's subcontracted by Blockstream. But what about Jonas, Philip and Michael?
And of the people who signed that open letter, of the first 8 people 50% works for blockstream.
Btw, 33% of the top 15 committers (of the last year) is affiliated with Blockstream (of which i can't find affiliation of 5). And of the top 30 committers its 20% (of which i can't find affiliation of 15!).
For the following people I can't find their affiliation. If anyone can help me find more information about these people, then I would gladly update my numbers (if applicable):
Jonas Schnelle,

Pavel Vasin,
Tom Harding
These people have 411 commits and 26000 lines added between them (in the last year).

No negative balance. Nothing is insured. All your transactions are public. Hard to secure. The value changes from day to day. 
I'm pro bitcoin, and I used it every week. But lets not fool ourselves too much. 
We need at least some form of multi sig online wallets with 2 factor authentication. Where no one can easily steal all your coins, not even the wallet provider. 
But another part of me thinks bitcoin is going to be a transport layer for money. And that its not going to be user directly by end users.

Git can contain any data, a blockchain has very specific rules about what content is allowed. Git is build to create as many branches as you need, a blockchain should favour one. (else its value as a ledger disappears). 
So the the answer is a very clear: No. 
But it does raise the question: why can't you add rules to git? Why can't software development be more distributed? Rely less on trust? 
Given a completely sandboxed application, why can't anyone add a feature?

true. just like its hard to know the motives of the people who try to fill the blocks. 
I don't think you attack something which you want to see grow. And it doesn't create sympathy. Seems like its hatred turned into action. Which corresponds to the rhetoric of the people promoting to keep block small. 
There are certainly dark forces at play. Censorship, DDOS attacks and "stress tests".

To me it shows that Bitcoin core is forking away from the what Bitcoin was supposed to be. Turning a block size limit into a feature is a much bigger change than when we would increase it. 
That's what i get out of it...
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:02:34
And why would a majority of miners do that exactly?  There are already so many bigger forces which cause miners to centralize that its really weird to cling to this one as if that can stop centralisation. It gives a false sense of control over Bitcoins future where there is none. You can't fight efficiency of scale by keeping blocks small. Its downright disingenuous to claim that it is in any shape or form a **good** thing to not change the blocksize. 
The real slippery slope, or at least the one i'm scared of. Is that you get to a situation where small nodes are unable to hold any pending transactions as a DDOS protection. That only big nodes with a lot of ram can hold all transactions. That a transactions is only valid when its confirmed. That SPV clients will die. And that the only way to send bitcoins quickly is via an alt-coin or alt-stream. 
The real question you need to ask yourself: Would introducing a 1mb block size limit at this point in time be considered a **good** change? 
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:35:07
Its not nefarious to do this on the real network and not on the testnet? :X

Literally what mods are saying is that even 2mb is already controversial, and luke-jr says that he thinks 1mb is still doable for january 2016. Other things like not including relaying of double spends, BIP100 which let 20% of mining lower the block size, the whole BIP64 debate shows their perfectionism and they have a very negative views on SPV wallets (SPV is like an big version of BIP64). 
Those are the facts. I do not twist them to create some kind of conspiracy. 
Their views on bitcoin have certainly drifted away from mine. And maybe you are comfortable with that. But are you also comfortable with the fact that a lot of people don't like that direction? Do you think Bitcoin will grow without unconfirmed transactions, without SPV wallets, without free/cheap transactions, without innovations like the ones which need BIP64?  
This is not a conspiracy, these are just an existential questions for Bitcoin. 
Maybe they won't follow through in this direction, and then you can say it was just a conspiracy. But they are definitely testing the waters, and they are very clear in their vision for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:43:39
Why do you need 2.13 Mbps to send a 1Mb block every 10 minutes? I mean running a full validating client and running a node are two different things. Or they should be!

There is this thing called the testnet. Although obviously not exactly the same as the real network. But people claim they want to test the technical limits, and not test peoples reaction. But this test seems to be about manipulation of people, not a technical test. 
Think about it. If you have 1.5 mb of transactions every 10 minutes on average then 33% of transactions will never confirm(!). We can't magically fit more transactions into a block by increasing the fee. So this test can only prove if the network can handle an ever increasing backlog of transactions. It forces us to create a garbage bin for transactions which will never confirm. 
So yes, i don't want nodes to crash and burn. But to cheer on the way this is put to a test is ridiculous.

If you are on an attackers blockchain then they can also confirm any transaction they like. They only need to make sure both chains are so much the same that you don't notice you are on a private blockchain. Until its too late. 
But just looking at the difficulty would be enough to check whether you are on a private chain. So if an attacker completely controls all your connections to the bitcoin network AND you don't already have the blockchain (or a checkpoint) then only the difficulty is what would still give it away.

Like I said earlier. If the online provider and your wallet software is supplied by the same people, then I'm not really confident about the security. Even if it uses multi-sig. 
And I don't see anything about the money being insured. It certainly isn't insured in the same sense as with a bank account, is it? 
And a negative balance is a nice feature yes. Its about the ability to borrow money. A BIP to enable a marketplace between those who want to lend money and those who need it. I think that would be cool.

People on both sides of that argument are angry of your planned attacks. No one asked for it. Only fellow retards who believe in the “Whatever doesn't kill you makes your stronger" fallacy might agree with you. 
If you are the only one stupid enough to do this then you are only forcing developers to protect against you. When simply not executing the attack would be so much simpler, and suck up less resources. 
What if there is a zero-day which needs a lot of attention but you made sure attention needs to be direction at you? 
I do think we need a block size increase, and Bitcoin needs DDOS protection against malicious entities like yourself. But nothing good comes from forcing this issue to the foreground at this moment. Don't pretend you are doing some good deed.

If most lite coin mining is done in China on zero-cost  power then the halving could be a small disaster in centralisation for Bitcoin. With mining hardware being turned off, or worse shipped to one central place.

I'm not angry and part of a mob because my opinion is the best, and that I think that the people who scream the loudest should win. I'm angry because it feels like my voice is taken away from me.

@_date: 2015-09-02 12:00:51
Do you think Peter Todd is at the centre of all of this? Is he the one who is such an extreme 1mb blocker that he created this whole mess to begin with? 
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:46:19
Its also possible that Coinwallet.eu is sweeping most coins them selves. Making the private keys available only gives him plausible deniability. And he can make the community look bad because we destroy bitcoin ourselves with our greed. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:22:38
Well maybe you would like that. But I don't. For instance the block reward changing so abruptly every 4 years would be much better when thats a fluid change. Or what about broadcasting double spend attempts? Is that a rule change or not? And what about removing SPV support? Is that a rule change? What about turning a temporary blocksize limit into a whole new feature which creates a market for fees? 
Setting the rules in stone for no good reason is stupid and wasteful of bitcoins full potential. You are free to keep running the same bitcoin client forever. But the economic majority would simply leave you behind, as it should. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:18:37
Maybe just you can at least say something concrete. The vagueness of "the block size needs to be increased someday" is killing. Its more about the things not said, and the things not done... 
To what size do you think the block size should be increased on 1-1-2016?  What is the minimum, and what is your maximum?
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:34:10
There is a reason people like Bitcoin, why they use it, why they invest in it. And that includes the promise/idea that the limit would be increased when it was needed. That it was a non issue. 
So I don't care really care what Satoshi said, not everything he said is holy. But twisting one temporary feature into another under the banner of respecting the principles of bitcoin is very hypocritical. Doing nothing is seen as conservative when it really isn't. There is an insane amount of scrutiny regarding hardfork changes. But this is somehow ok? 
No one would introduce a 1mb limit at this moment if there was none. No one. That really answers every question. 
And the only reason to keep it is negligible decentralisation effects for nodes/miners (in relation to other aspects). And even so its not theirs to decide which trade offs we do or do not want to make. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:02:26
What is better, a crashing node which needs to download everything. Or random evictions. 
So XT has a solution, core has none. And you are somehow still on your high horse. Pragmatism over perfectionism. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:01:06
The BIP is really ambiguous, i read it again. Seems like the code is activated immediately. So it is final when the first block is mined which is bigger than 1mb. So you would need 80% to activate be able to mine the first block which is bigger than 1mb to create a hard fork.
All the other rules at 75% and 95% are a bit weird and hard to interpret. I would expect a percentage which activates BIP100. 
Edit: I got confused between BIP100 and BIP101. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 08:18:12
When a miner creates a block with just 1 transaction. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:01:04


That isn't nearly as big of an issue as people claim it to be. Obviously we would want everyone to run a node, and miners as spread out as much as possible. But preventing a block size increase isn't going to help much in that department. Its the equivalent with "Penny wise pound foolish".
There are so many more factors involved than decentralisation concerns. This is about SPV wallets, BIP64, unconfirmed transactions, subsidising low cost transactions to grow bitcoin, decentralisation of development, alternative clients etc. etc. 
The question is: Do we want to be pragmatic and realistic? Or idealistic and perfectionistic? (where idealistic also only applies to their ideals ;)
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:13:18
It seems we are involved, so that is good. And Jeff is definitely listening!
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:17:03
Wouldn't a node get the correct transactions via a block anyway? This seems to be more about what is more expensive. Resending a transaction or holding double spends in memory. That last one seems to be super easy to abuse to take down the entire network.

Yes of course. Fear, uncertainty and doubt doesn't bring out the best in all people. But I understand most people's reaction. 
Everyone will scream louder if they feel no one is listening. 
We don't want our parents to split up. 
I really like the patches in XT, and I really like the idea of lighting. Based on all the extreme opinions regarding blocksize and other ideas which only seem to promote a lightning network I am fearful other aspects of Bitcoin will suffer. Is that unreasonable FUD? Maybe. 
The Bitcoin Foundation dissolves, core became a more important leader, core developers gravitate towards one type of solution, core developers don't seem willing to compromise, xt splits, xt developers get demonized, xt discussions gets censored. 
If you shun people (and commits) which don't agree with your views than you then at one point you can say: "90% of developers share this view, and always had this view from the beginning". Same goes with censorship on @_date: 2015-09-01 20:52:05

@_date: 2015-09-16 12:32:01
Again with the slippery slope argument. How can you compare changing a blocksize limit with changing the block reward? 
I can also say: If even a simple change causes this much resistance, how can we ever expect Bitcoin to stay agile? 
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:24:01
38% of people with commit access are affiliated with Blockstream, and 40% of the top 10 committers of last year.  And that still leaves people with no clear affiliation. Maybe luke is the only one who is honest that he's subcontracted by Blockstream. But what about Jonas, Philip and Michael?
And of the stupid people who signed that stupid letter, of the first 8 people 50% works for blockstream. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:18:19
But i thought it was cute.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:37:03
As someone who has been banned twice I'm pretty sure its censorship. But protection against spam isn't censorship, I give you that. 
But censoring legitimate people voicing legitimate concerns should not happen. Branding XT as an altcoin is disingenuous. Bitcoin simply isn't what a small group say it is. 
And maybe the sybil attack was a false flag. Who knows? 
But you protect theymos, but do you have any idea who he is? 
And can you see the similarity in protecting the name "bitcoin core" and protecting Why would anyone say who is in control that "Bitcoin is whatever software people run"?
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:05:27
If I build something like bitcoin I would consider O(n2) as a bug. But I would probably also build it in a less complicated way, but that's also because i don't know why you need scripts, operands, multiple inputs/outputs. I would simply create a block with records in the form from-address, to-address,amount,signature.  But that probably misses a few use cases ;).
Personally I believe Bitcoin is still an experiment. Therefor we should not be too conservative. So I share Gavin's point of view. 
Funny because one side wants to use the 1mb size to force progress with lightning it seems. Gavin wants to force progress by removing our training wheels. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:16:32
What small miners? And bitcoin should be able to handle a few transactions. 1mb per 10 minutes, does that really sound like a lot to you? 
@_date: 2015-09-11 19:19:51
Isn't there also cognitive bias towards your own opinion that we can wait that long? Why doesn't that opinion need peer review? 
Attacks like the one we still experience are going to cheaper and cheaper the longer we wait, or the effects will get bigger and bigger for an attack with the same price tag. You probably say that nothing of value is lost (nodes from hobbyist and transactions from unimportant gambling sites). But that's a subjective value assessment. One which you can't force upon everyone else. No hard data is going to change that. 
The good news is that all this might already stop Bitcoin from growing. Who would take Bitcoin serious at this moment? Who would invest? Who would start using Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:12:29
Depends from what perspective. ;)
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:01:50
With how things are going no one would invest in bitcoin, no new users would dare to step into bitcoin and absolutely no growth should be expected. 
If XT fails and I can't use my SPV wallet, or zero confirmation transactions are not supported anymore (on bitpay), or fees are too high.... well then Bitcoin loses someone who actually used bitcoin. 
(yes there was even talk about removing SPV support, yes a patch to relay double spend attends was reverted, and yes fees might get a lot higher under core)
And character attacks are sad. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:39:37
A lot of things can be tested on the testnet. Lets not pretend their motives are good ;)
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:32:12
Every miner would ignore it with a sane soft orphan limit. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:51:25


You are literally comparing it with something far worse to make your point? Thats like saying after you stub your toe: "imagine breaking your leg, thats how it feels". 


Hyperbole to the max. 


Consensus? What consensus? How many votes have there been for specific changes? A few developers stonewalling is consensus? 
Doing nothing is also a choice. Keeping the 1mb limit is a choice. Pretending that only changing the 1mb limit needs consensus is lunacy or opportunism. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:44:01
Thats very unlikely. Only way that can happen if XT lowers the 75% barrier for activation, and I don't see that happening. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:33:58
Its a branch not a patch. So its a patch but its already applied to core. So downloading and compiling the code should be enough. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 14:59:44


The arguments made against BIP64 are just as valid against SPV. And the fact that double spend relay has been reverted. 
And are you saying there doesn't need to be ROI? 
You can't have so many people invested in the idea of a lightning network and then act surprised if people fear that existing solutions might suffer. And this isn't only an issue about blockstream, they just happen to represent this one direction. 
Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Maybe. But so many companies have died because they were chasing a nirvana fallacy. Trying to reinvent themselves. When they really ought to have played on their strengths. 
All the things patched in X T are things which are not needed for a LN. Tell me that is a coincidence and that I have nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:08:42

@_date: 2015-09-04 12:49:19
No actually its possible that a vocal minority unsubscribed and moved away, and with moved away i mean: not actually moved away. Most people just subscribe and don't actually contribute.

@_date: 2015-04-03 22:52:28
If the current bitcoin value mostly comes  from its usefulness in spending it in legitimate places then its going to go down, not up.
And if people can't easily get their money out of bitcoin you will see a sharp drop in price in the exchanges which do still work. People will probably start panicking ... 
If you cannot actually exchange bitcoin for anything else, what value is there? If the value of bitcoin is completely based on official exchanges, what will the perceived value be if governments starts closing them? 
Any one government can't really do much, but if they cooperate and act swiftly. It could devalue the currency significantly. 
And if enough miners quit then the confirmation time could also become super slow, devaluing the currency even underground, causing more miners to quit... 
I personally don't think Bitcoin gets its value from its underground/shady usage. At least not in a significant way. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 08:25:20
That doesn't make sense. You could argue that about anything. Want milk? Get your own cow. Want a car? Build it yourself? Want safety? Protect yourself.
Because Bitcoin isn't perfect we have to make real world assumptions about the likelihood of certain attacks. The likelihood of certain attacks drop because we have criminal justice systems. 
For instance, we have 2 bugs in bitcoin. One is a zero-day which anyone single entity could exploit with one transaction, and the other is this mempool overflow which needs thousands of transactions to exploit.
You see the problem?
 
@_date: 2015-09-21 11:10:22
What exactly do you mean by "client-only mode". You mean not acting as a server? Or not downloading the whole chain? Seems like those are two entirely different things. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:46:10
You didn't respond to what I was saying at all. 
And if an algorithm has O(n^2) complexity that is a huge bug, the block size has nothing to to with that. It doesn't sound professional at all if people start making excuses why such a limit exists afterwards. 
If you go out of your way to find reasons why something needs to be true, you will find them. And it looks really really suspicious when you do. 
Again give me a calculation which states that the block size limit should be 1mb at this moment. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 18:53:43
Exactly! The protocol is what is shared. And without consensus you have nothing. So this isn't something where one can differ at all. But hard to predict how that will turn out. But at least its more decentralised, fits the spirit of bitcoin way better.
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:48:06
I support BIP101 but I don't support what they do. Its irresponsible. and stupid. 
But one thing is clear. With increased block size bitcoin would become more resilient to these attacks. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:02:06
A vote for XT should be one based on merit (of the patches). It should not mean all authority goes to mike and gavin. Maybe some people want to switch from one central authority to the next. But I would certainly hope not. 
Because if we can vote once, we can do it again. Bitcoin would become more than one reference implementation. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:38:58
It seems to me like he wanted something above one reference implementation (in one programming language). Separate the protocol from the implementation etc. That higher level of governance kinda died with the Bitcoin Foundation. Maybe thats why we are in this mess. 
Actually, lately I was thinking that maybe we hire a real Bitcoin CEO. With crowdfunded bitcoin so he is automatically invested. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:50:28
Well, if they are right other people will pick up their slack. But i think its not really about being right. Because bitcoin can be highly successful and useful without exactly following their principles. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:28:33
BIP 64, bitcoinJ seem to be the biggest.  I actually googled him to find some smut, but found [this]( ;)
@_date: 2015-09-16 09:18:57
Not everyone who is pro XT is a sockpuppet. I could say the same thing about people who wrongfully demonize Gavin, Mike and XT as some dangerous fork. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:34:01
No thats not so logical to begin with. If they claim to want to decentralise bitcoin, but do not want to decentralise development. That doesn't make sense. 
XT isn't against core as core is against XT at all! XT patches on top off core. So most changes from core would flow into XT. Just like when a consensus would be reached, core would (be forced to) include patches from core (or at least on the protocol level).  
This isn't a one-implementation-to-rule-us all thing at all! The fact that you think that speaks volumes about how strongly you feel about traditional software development. We can do better than that. No we must! One reference implementation is NOT healthy at all!
This situation is really really bad. Normally we would have this discussion on a protocol level. With a functioning Bitcoin foundation which would debate, reach consensus, includes all kinds of parties. 
The bitcoin core developers should welcome the diversity, they should welcome that they can focus on developing their implementation. That would have made way more sense to me. 
Clearly the core developers do not think and act as just the "developers of the reference implementation" but they see themselves as way more than that. They have literally grouped and invested themselves into one idea: blockstream. Thats why they fight XT tooth and nail. 
That should raise alarm bells in everyone. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 16:58:57
This is so stupid. Those pictures make no sense. And the law doesn't care about technicalities whether something is distributed/decentralised. 
Even the law itself isn't so centralised. So many countries with so many laws. There isn't one central place which oversees or controls everything. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:09:38
Seems like Bitcoin has lost its leadership. Its time that we hire our own CEO. Are you with me?
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:21:38
I know that they said that, clearly I don't automatically believe that they support XT with this action because they say they do. I don't trust what they do, so i don't trust what they say. 
And my dubious agenda is supporting Bitcoin. ;)
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:09:04
We are all in this together. There isn't a lose-win or win-lose scenario. There is only lose-lose or win-win and a LOT of things in between. 
There is FUD on both sides. Literally people afraid of how things are going. 
XT: That core developers are too much invested in one idea: Blockstream and that that clouds their judgement. Transactions will get too expensive and kills Bitcoin growth (a lack of subsidising cheap transactions which kills bitcoins growth). Very slow confirmation times. Existing wallets will get out competed unfairly. Bitcoin development stagnates. Centralisation of Bitcoin because of overly complicated nodes/hubs, or insane RAM requirements. Prevention of any sort of growth/investment because Bitcoin simply doesn't have the room to grow. Removal of SPV support and relaying of double spends. Centralising bitcoin development and using one reference client to guide the Bitcoin protocol.  
Core: Decentralisation because of increased bandwidth/cpu/disk requirements for nodes. Decentralisation because bigger blocks means more profit for miners which are closer together. A hard fork which creates two separate bitcoin currencies. Privacy and censorship concerns regarding Mike and what he might do with control over Bitcoin. Fears about bitcoins further development when XT would take over (stagnation/control). The unnecessary inclusion of spam/dust transaction which do Bitcoin no good whatsoever. Putting to much trust into miners. 
Did I miss anything? 
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:12:54
You are not getting it. $5 is money wasted. You also need to add money as a guarantee. And you are talking about a channel as if its completely singular and centralised. That doesn't strike you as odd? 
A lightning network can only exist on top of the cheapest ledger with the most security.  
@_date: 2015-09-06 15:32:48
I have no problem if one person is some kind of dictator over one implementation of Bitcoin. I have a problem with people who think that Bitcoin IS that one implementation. That somehow dictatorship over one, is dictatorship over everything. Its asinine. 
Do people really think everyone runs plain Bitcoin core? XT isn't some pandoras box which just now has been opened. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:11:41
No I personally think blockstream needs bitcoin to create a market for low cost transactions. Let bitcoin pave the way so to speak. 
Blockstream is more an indication of group-think and an echo chamber. 
And I do think it is in block streams interest to check whether a market for fees can be created. They have a vested interest to let us run into the limit, but probably (hopefully!) not so much that it will actually hurt bitcoins growth. 
Their stance on SPV wallets, zero fee transactions and unconfirmed transactions does scare me. Now we are talking about block size. But this is where their conflict of interest can get ugly next. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:55:43
Exactly! If 50% of mining power can already own any vote, why not simply use something close to that like 40/60. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:13:30
Miners are economically invested, so they can't just vote whatever they feel like. 75% means something. Just like the fact that currently only 1% votes for XT means something (that XT doesn't stand a chance).
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:55:51
How easy it is to uphold a certain law is another issue. And for music/movie piracy there are simply to many people who do it. So what I mean is that it's more about people than its about technology. 
Bitcoin already doesn't have a stellar reputation. Add a few laws and being associated with Bitcoin can become completely toxic. 
So a lack of a central place to shutdown bitcoin is definitely handy. It doesn't make it invulnerable. It needs people, a lot of normal people to use bitcoin to become essentially invulnerable to laws and regulations. Only then its comparable with Bittorrent. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 08:03:12


I strongly disagree with that assessment. And I haven't heard any argument which supports that conclusion. Its also simply unenforceable. If the economic majority wants a certain change then its going to get implemented. You can hold onto your bitcoin core 0.xx coins but they won't be worth anything.  
For instance when there is a exploit found in the bitcoin protocol we don't even have a choice but to upgrade. 


So its about the name then? Do you think Bitcoin will become such a generic term that its even possible to centrally control what constitutes Bitcoin? Bitcoin is simply bigger than that. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:15:12
No I think voicing your fears, uncertainties and doubts is very understandable. But to state fears as facts is just wrong. And I don't like downvote brigades on both sides which downvote anything which doesn't correspond to their view. 
Opinions should stand on its own. So in that regard it should not really matter if someone is a sockpuppet. And I really don't believe in conspiracy theories. I don't believe that anyone wants to destroy bitcoin in any way. 


True, to a certain extend. With enough planning and testing a hardfork isn't very dangerous at all, at least technically. 


I think that's a case of choosing a lesser evil. Doing nothing is also not an option. And I don't see how providing the only technical solution to a problem is a political move. The only way that is true if you say that only the core developers are allowed to vote. And you really need a severe distrust of miners (and their intention) to not accept a majority vote from miners. That is at the core of the split. 


If you are truthful I wouldn't really consider it demonization. But that's really the point. Opinions stated as fact, character attacks, exaggerations. Those are even uncalled for when someone is really evil. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:40:31


If anyone mentions core developers they don't mean people who don't have commit access. And within the context of what i was saying it was clear i meant the people who were part of the consensus in the first place. Or are you saying consensus is always weighted among 300 people? 


You are free to create a BIP101.a, but personally i would rather see a more reasonable version of BIP100, and an implementation. Hell, I would almost start coding C++ again myself. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:30:45
Yes! So he admits that keeping the block size limit is the bigger change. That means in spirit Bitcoin Core is the contentious fork.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:25:18
He could not foresee the future. Not how the mining landscape would look like, and not what the average block size would be. That means he could not yet plan a reversal of the limit. Does that answer your million dollar question? 


You could argue that a lot of things changed already, that the metaphorical concrete has already dried. Mostly in the form of heavily invested miners, and an insanely high hash rate. 
Larger block limit would make it harder to attack bitcoin, not easier. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:23:33


BIP101 waits for consensus and it waits months to activate.


And most of the other core developers are all associated with blockstream.

Obviously usability is important so that people don't unnecessarily freak out. But that still doesn't add more transactions in the same block. 
I simply want to be able to keep [ordering my pizza]( buy stuff from [shady unknown entities from the internet]( or pay my dinner at [a restaurant]( with Bitcoin. Those are my real life use case. Maybe that makes me biased. 
I also firmly believe we should keep subsidising cheap zero conf transactions to grow bitcoin. That's how you grow a business. Certainly not by capping it. 
The second you start cutting of transactions you stop some growth. Maybe not a use case you value. But who knows what it could have become. 
And i also believe in a Lightning network. But maybe we are going to kill the use cases it is destined to replace before they are even born.

Your analogy with the cd's make it seem like the worst thing you could do is store it, when in reality that's the easiest thing to do. And the least costly. Because that also means that the attack almost has zero effect. So why keep up the attack at all? 
So yes, lets subsidize cheap/free transactions to grow Bitcoin.

Do you think a pragmatic solution like that is going to end up in core also? Because although its sad that something like that is needed, it seems to be a good example of an imperfect solution to problem but which is better than doing nothing.

Thanks! Although you might want to donate to the developers, and not send coins to one person who is quick enough to grab the keys. Core and XT devs preferably.

The bigger the block the slower. It would not make ANY sense for a miner to pad a block.

Of course, but my intention is not to bamboozle. The discussion is still interesting for when those assumptions become true, or for people who already think they are true. 
I simply think this aspect (how to create a fee market in the best way) hasn't really been discussed.

My payments are instant and cheap. It literally can't be cheaper and it can't be faster.

I think at the worst Mike isn't an anarchist, and he seems pragmatic and realistic. Maybe a bit naive. 
I sometimes say that the split is about pragmatism vs perfectionism. But maybe its more between pragmatism vs anarchism. What is clear that this split runs deep. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 09:38:34
Ilogy is being a prick. Although if enough trolling is allowed against one person on maybe we should call it something else entirely. A sad echo chamber. But ultimately even a parrot is a prick if he attacks a person with lies. 
No one has been promoting handing over control of Bitcoin. This is truly absurd. 
And I can't understand how people can fear Mike's employment and not have the same reservations about Blockstream. Just like R3CV they are funded by financial services. Also weird to fault someone from seeking employment. Although I do see it as a defeat that developers can't be employed by Bitcoin itself more directly. 
If we want a currency for the people by the people then we should put our money where our mouths are. Maybe that would have prevented the community from being torn apart. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 18:41:49
You don't say!
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:22:20
Doesn't RBF give the opportunity to lowball transaction fees and increase the fees later? Wouldn't that potentially bring fees down not up? 
Voting by including replaced transaction is like speeding on the highway as a way to increase the maximum speed. Even if its a soft rule and something miners could always do already, it would still be safer if its activated in some structured way (time/version nr). 
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:42:40
That's some fine circular logic. 
You do realise that the tx fee which is currently used to cut of certain transactions is completely arbitrary and based on the number of transactions which fit in the blocks? So if you keep the block size limit the same, more and more transactions need to be marked as spam. 
Lets build a house, but lets not use to much concrete, just keep removing concrete from the foundation. That will work!
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:45:03
The questions for all:
1) Do you want SPV wallets?
2) Do you want zero confirmation transactions?
3) Do you want free transactions?
4) Do you want cheap transactions?
5) Do you want pragmatic solutions to real problems?
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:02:15
No one is going to say no to that. But it might be fun to try to create a set of questions which really capture how people feel about important things without being biased... (my questions are also biased obviously). 
@_date: 2015-09-04 07:45:06
Well to be honest who ever gave Wladimir the franchise? 
By design the miners have the franchise. Whether you like it or not. But because they are invested they can't just choose whatever they like. They have to consider what the market wants. And thus they need to find a bigger consensus. 
Obviously its nice for them to have a core group of people who you can trust to find that consensus. But what if they fail?  What if they just keep appealing to authority and spread FUD just to keep stalling? What then?
The really hard part is that Bitcoin can become something the core developers do not want it to become. They can't dictate their vision for Bitcoin upon the rest of us. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 13:10:30
He is just parroting the same "OMG decentralisation" rhetoric and claiming that settlements with huge transaction fees would still be considered payments. If you can't reasonably pay someone using Bitcoin then its not a payment system. 
And if there way more important and bigger forces which cause centralisation, that's why arguing against an increase for such a reason is complete bogus. The data simply doesn't show a correlation. Actually it's the reverse: A more popular bitcoin causes more people to want to run full nodes. 
That is why he gets downvoted. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:07:14
I have payed for things with zero fees and still enjoyed zero confirmation time. And I still pay for things instantly with bitcoin (with zero confirmations).

Of course it moves the goalposts! That's exactly the idea!
Who says that an increase would magically solve ALL problems? It would at least handle a sudden (and temporary) boost in popularity. 
Why do we need to fear Bitcoin's succes at this completely random moment in time? 
What calculation returns 1mb as an answer at this moment? Tell me.

That's what I've been saying, but I get a lot of negative feedback (and down votes) on that opinion. 
Somehow people trust a untrustworthy entity on their word when they say they support XT. It's weird. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:24:49
The block size limit was always a lot more than the actual transaction volume. What reason is there to want the actual transaction volume to be so close the the limit? I don't really see the rationale for that. 
Lets pretend for a minute that the limit Satoshi chose was 10mb and not 1mb. What reason would there be to lower the limit now to 1mb? 
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:44:06
I've only seen him advocate/develop to achieve the opposite. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:34:29
Filter bubble much? ;)
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:05:56
But a network without censorship isn't able to know what is and isn't spam. It can classify certain transactions as spam. But spam isn't spam just because you mark it as spam. Its about intend. 
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. That's all i'm saying.
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:54:42
Isn't what's considered valid indirectly determined by the blocksize limit and the actual number of transactions? We had no problems with zero-fee transactions for years. 
So if you raise the blocksize limit you can lower the minimum fee. Don't do anything and the minimum fee goes up if Bitcoin is successful (higher value / more transactions). 
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:45:38
Because people are just going to sense whether a transaction can be replaced or not?
Why does it feel like this is a deliberate attempt to make zero-conf less attractive and by extension Lightning more attractive? 
@_date: 2015-11-25 11:14:49
If adoption doesn't merit the current security we enjoy, then maybe we have WAY too much security at the moment. Its also possible that a reduction in mining fees (without a corresponding increase in bitcoins value) would lead to more decentralisation. Big mining farms closing up shop, a lot of hardware ending up on the market and getting distributed around the globe. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:24:24


You do realise that the "forked chain" also contains all original blocks. Its not like miners are going to restart from scratch. 


A difficulty adjustment can only happen when you mine enough blocks to even get there, and even then its not going to adjust to the correct amount immediately. 
  


So you would have three forks. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:08:34
We never needed the limit for this new purpose you claim it's needed for. And you are entitled to your opinion (which really seems more like baseless FUD and wild extrapolations).
But I simply don't want low/zero fee transaction to be killed off. I personally see that as the main driver of bitcoins adoption. And without any consensus the 1mb limit is turned into something else and its killing of more and more transactions every day. This is not about 6 months from now, or about 1 year from now. This is happening now.
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:45:48


Without RBF and without a block size increase you mean. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:21:50
I don't understand the point you are trying to make. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 14:17:43
That's stretching it, because if BIP101 is enabled then its likely core would have also added BIP101 support making his remark true. 
Maybe he should have added a disclaimer. But considering people choose XT mainly because of BIP101 support I don't really think its realistic that anyone is confused by what he's saying. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:34:43
It would be weird if someone would buy so many Bitcoins and not know the basics. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:55:17


So again. If there are enough mining pools which continue to mine smaller blocks then it would still seem blocks are not full? 
For instance (in the last 12 days) 13% of Slush mined block were not full when the previous and next blocks were full. Compare that to DiscusFish which only had 1% of its blocks mined in a similar situation. So the size of blocks is not only correlated to transactions volume but also the willingness to mine bigger blocks.  
Its like saying there are no traffic jams because there are places where you can still drive. 
And I think fees are high and confirmation times are slow/unpredictable. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:18:33
Because transaction volume has historically always been a sliver of the maximum size. Conservative is doing what you have been doing and repeating that. Getting close to the limit would be the dangerous thing to do. 
The limit was added to limit the damage of DDOS attacks. The closer we are to the limit the cheaper an attack is. That's why BIP103 is still dangerous (and stupid). 
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:40:11
Raising the block size would likely increase decentralisation not reduce it. A less useful Bitcoin would cause less people to want to run nodes not more. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 20:22:03
Good that he summarises all his responses then. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:22:50
BIP100, I fucked up. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:45:20
If the block size limit is removed then yes. 
I also suggested (theoretically) to add a mintxinclusionfee as a hard limit. So everything above the limit is always allowed to be added. And maybe everything below it is only added if you are still below the hard limit. (i'm just making this up at the spot). 
So if block size &gt; hardlimit then no transactions are allowed below mintxinclusionfee. And mintxinclusionfee is recalculated every X blocks like the difficulty to get to a certain average block size. 
I personally don't like the whole fee market at all. But if you do it at least do it right. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 13:58:31
Haha, i knew you were going to say that. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 06:12:14
Its weird that any kind of blind negativity and trolling isn't allowed if its against core dev's. But somehow if its against Mike/Gavin then the gloves can come off. You should be ashamed of yourself.  
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:25:01
I'm against a fee market now. I should have made myself clear. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:34:15
If child-pays-for-parent is relevant, then blocksize is. If we stop rejecting certain transactions you would not get these kind of problems.

If you want Bitcoin to rise, just use it already. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:15:55
Then we might be saying the same thing? 
@_date: 2015-11-30 09:53:47
Child-pays-for-parent generates more transactions, but it allows both the sender and receiver to add fees. Making it far more usable for receivers/merchants. Why would the sender care about adding too little fees?

@_date: 2015-11-04 21:06:28
Growing and subsidising the network. Paving the way for near zero fee transactions in side-chains/lightning. Zero fee was a promise Bitcoin "made" when I first read about it years ago (the wiki still mentions this). 
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:56:11
I want this answered too. It baffles me why we need to open such a big hole for exploits. Its really hard not to still see RBF as an attack on zero-conf. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:37:50
No its not. If you can't see that fine. But you can't deny that other people see that Bitcoin is WAY more than that. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 10:21:49
Of course there is. Or will a node randomly add one of the conflicting transactions? That seems really counter intuitive. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:28:16
I think that keeping a 1mb limit which was added for entirely different reasons is the most extreme thing to do. Should I quote satoshi on how simple he regarded upping the limit? Obviously things change but It would be very coincidental that the moment we run into the 1mb limit would be EXACTLY the moment we need it. For me that's really the most extreme (or deceitful) pov to have.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:20:15
That's true. I just think we are not there yet. We just happen to run into the 1mb limit now. We never made an informed decision (with consensus) to have this limit now. 
I'm perfectly fine with running into this limit 2 years from now when sidechains/lightning have arrived. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 12:44:04
No im just saying it can take a long long time for the difficulty to adjust. I just think the original chain would probably be dead long before the difficulty can adjust. Given the lack of security and the slow confirmation times. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 20:45:41
Honestly i think core values security over everything else. Its seems like a hoarders mentality and a lack of appreciation for Bitcoin as a payment system. Not a desire to destroy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:42:44


Enough core developers regard any increase as controversial. It's not unreasonable to believe this will effectively prevent the inclusion of any increase. 
And "waiting" also advocates for a 1mb limit for at least the next 6 months (give or take).
I don't see how voicing my concerns about the dangers of a 1mb can be seen as dishonest. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:06:06
True, you can so some social engineering type security exploit. But I don't think the people who don't know how ChangeTip works and could be fooled would overlap with people who would trust ChangeTip enough to accept it as money. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:37:24
If core actually cares about merchants they would implement Child-pays-for-Parent. Or relay double spend attempts, which is also long overdue. 
You would almost think that some core developers are cooking up some new payment system.

Mike is entitled to his opinions. There is no redlisting in XT, and even if there was we decide ourselves what defines Bitcoin. That;s also one of the points XT is trying to make: that bitcoin doesn't have centralised control.

@_date: 2015-11-29 22:29:13
I see other developers adding things to XT. Its definitely not just Mike/Gavin. XT didn't have to be a huge development effort because it isn't wildly different that XT (yet). The patches are not shocking. But it is very typical to see what things are added to Core and which things aren't.  
BIP64, SPV, Zero-conf, block-size, MinTxRelayFee, double spend relaying, now RBF. Tell me there isn't a pattern here? 
And you can see a little bit what BU is cooking for example: 
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:12:22
Its circular because its like saying "the bible is the word of god, because the bible says so".  "this is spam, because these lines of code says so". The only correct answer is: What is and isn't marked as "spam" is defined by the block size limit.  Which is weird because the definition what is and isn't a useful transactions cannot be determined by a rule AND a market for fees. That cannot possibly be true. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 11:07:02
Nodes should be fine. Miners are in danger of creating incompatible blocks which will always get orphaned. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:35:20
You can already do micro transactions with bitcoin. No problem. It doesn't scale, but nothing keeps you from doing it now. 
I believe we should first see the usage and THEN solve any problems which arise. 
And I don't really understand the malleability problem. Why on earth would you allow multiple signature types/formats? And if you support them why aren't they specified in the transaction first? And shouldn't the transaction be identified by the hash of the signature+transaction-hash in the first place? Or am i missing something?
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:47:10

Ok well if you say so. I'm not seeing valid or new counter arguments. You are repeating yourself. 


It was Satoshi himself who added this change. Lets not alter history here. 
Just tell me this: If satoshi chose 10 mb instead of 1 mb as a limit. Would the actual block size be significantly larger now? And would we have a discussion about lowering the limit to 1mb at this moment?
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:02:57

@_date: 2015-11-06 10:34:34
There already exists a mechanism to keep block sizes reasonable. A block size limit should simply get out of the way (or get removed entirely). This watch [this video]( you will understand.

I see what you are saying but I don't know enough to know for certain where that is coming from. Is he ostracised or did he do that to himself? 
If you look at the things people say to him, if you look at how his main project has been killed off because of the 1mb limit... I can understand a little how he feels. 
To me it seems he doesn't play a political game. If he were he wouldn't be so honest and open about his opinions. It would be much smarter if he refrains from saying certain things (things like redlisting for example). 
You have to realise where he's coming from, the amount of energy he has put into making Bitcoin a real payment system. What would you do if so much of your life's work is being thrown in the garbage? Without any due process, and without any consensus. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 11:32:48
I have it all wrong yet you respond to one thing I say without giving any sources. I still see literally no difference between Blockstream and R3CV.  
Never mind, I searched around for "R3CV private blockchain" and found you are indeed correct. So there should be no fear surrounding Mike's new employment. But instead you can see it as a resounding success in ostracizing him from the community. 
What you definitely can't do is say that this brings "clarity to what the Bitcoin civil war has fundamentally really been about" and imply some form of guilt or something. If you push someone into a corned you should not be surprised by the outcome. 
I have been banned for insinuating bad motivations behind Peter Todd and Blockstream, when in reality I was voicing my sincere fears. But somehow every negative remark is allowed on regarding Mike/Gavin and XT.

I think it is better to be a bit naive and become a victim than to make victims yourself. Naivety can be a conscious choice. But this is something needed to be considered a good person, and indeed should not influence Bitcoin itself. You might even say that all code should be reviewed as if it came from an anonymous developer. 
Mike seems to be a genuinely good guy to me, albeit a bit naive regarding red-listing. And I have seen a lot of hate being posted about him but I have seen no evidence whatsoever of bad intentions. Sure he's no libertarian, but why fault anyone for that? Why the insane amounts of hate? 
So the question is: Is mike's code and remarks still taken at face value?  
@_date: 2015-11-28 10:07:24
There was a 10(!) hour backlog. Who is weakening bitcoin exactly? Blocks don't all have to be full for Bitcoin to be negatively impacted. 


I have never waited 10 minutes. Zero conf has worked perfectly thus far for Payments. The fee market makes zero conf harder. RBF makes zero conf a lot more dangerous. There is a pattern of wilful destruction of Bitcoin as a payment system. Which happens to pave the way for Lightning. Its scary.   


There is no data to support that. A Bitcoin which is more usefull actually creates more decentralisation, not less. Promoting the idea of a fragile Bitcoin which needs centralised control and censorship to survive is weakening Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:35:45
I actually don't think increasing the block size is the best solution. But sometimes waiting for the best solution is worse than implementing an intermediate solution. 
And isn't part of the unpredictability already because of bigger blocks already cause higher latencies? 
If miners efficiently synchronise how the next block is going to look like this whole discussion might be over in a heartbeat. Because i suspect people care a lot less about storage/bandwidth than they do about latency. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:59:36
Isn't the sender also the receiver of change most of the times? And that still adds two transactions. But it would at least also be possible for the receiver to use this method. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:55:46
Like was the case for years. You see the contrived problem now? 
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:11:28
P2pool is currently at 0.19%, it clearly is already way to inefficient. No block size limit is going to fix that. 
If you want decentralisation just set up more mining pools. Seems like a way better solution. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:16:31
Ok thanks! That should give wallet developers more than enough time to add an indicator. Preferably they should replace any mention of how many nodes have seen a transactions with this indicator. 
Would be nice if double spend relaying could be added this swiftly. Still seems totally unfair how these things get handled. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:10:14

Judging by the down votes more people think you agree with the censorship. Maybe an edit is in order (i already upvoted because I thought you said something interesting). 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:08:05
Yes and no. If the exact same bitcoins make 20 hops in one block then its pretty safe to assume they are controlled by one entity and do not actually represent natural transaction volume. 
But ultimately organic and artificial bitcoin volume can't be measured. 
So to an extend with its not weird to assume that large bitcoin holders try to fake bitcoins succes. Fake it till you make it ;)

Since when did zero-conf stop working? Why would we give up something that works because it doesn't provide perfect security? Not improving zero-conf because its not perfect is a self fulfilling prophecy. In reality you can work on the pragmatic short term solutions AND work on the perfect solution for the future at the same time. 
Talking about security, wouldn't it be more secure to bet on two horses instead of one? Or at least let other people bet on the other horse in the mean time. 
So whack that malleability mole a few times, kick the block size limit down the road a bit, add getutxo (as a configuration option?) and double spend relaying. That work pales in comparison to the work needed for Lightning.  
What developer wouldn't want a little bit of breathing room? What developer doesn't have bad experiences with focussing to much on the perfect solution and disregarding the old too quickly? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:50:38
Well, there is two types of FUD being spread: 1) mining/node centralisation 2) losing valuable transactions 
The problem is that we can't look into the future, and its hard to really know what drives Bitcoins value. 
I know for me personally the appeal of Bitcoin goes away to a big extend when I need to pay 10 cents per transaction to get it confirmed quickly. That has the simple consequence that I'm not giving away any small amount of bitcoin to demonstrate how it works. 
Maybe i'm not representative of most users. But if people are allowed to spread FUD about mining/node centralisation ad nauseam, then I keep feeling the need to voice my concerns. 
So if you have anything which really soothes my mind then please say so. But just saying that it is Ok isn't going to help.

I assumed you were talking about node centralisation, because that is at least a little bit realistic. Haven't we debunked this already a million times? 
1. If a miner has &gt;50% mining power then he can already selfish mine all he wants and orphan all other blocks. 
1. If he doesn't then other miners can orphan his stupidly large blocks (or delayed blocks), a single miner can't do jack shit
1. Miners are not completely stupid to run their own cash cow into the ground
1. Miners start mining new blocks **before** validating, significantly reducing cost associated with network latency
1. When new blocks are synchronised/validated before they are mined most block size related latency is gone, and that would pave the way for even beter zero-conf transactions 
1. There are way bigger forces which guide mining centralisation
Your arguments only work if we conveniently forget certain aspects of reality. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:51:32


What makes that disingenuous is if block size growth doesn't actually outpace moore and nielsen then nothing actually changes. You are spreading misinformation and FUD.
You also imply that there is no other limiting factor to block size than the block size limit. Which is of course also false. 


Really? How/why this worst case scenario actually unfolds you never mention, but somehow this will certainly happen. 
The weird thing is, people say we don't need to rush because block size isn't so big yet, and on the other hand they say that if the limit is raised that suddenly the block size would explode. You can't have your cake and eat it too. 


Ever considered that doing nothing like we are doing now is even worse than the worst block size increase BIP? Because you (and your friends) are advocating a super fragile Bitcoin which needs censorship to survive. You are promoting this idea that a hard fork is insanely dangerous and difficult. 
Do you ever think about the actual damage you are doing? 
Because sometimes changing something is more conservative than changing nothing.

@_date: 2015-11-14 08:18:01
I'm just saying that the people who claim anything above 1mb causes centralization are dishonest. Because however you cut it hardware will get faster. 
Not saying bip101 is perfect, but we can be reasonably sure that we won't exclude a significant amount of nodes. But you won't be able to keep running Bitcoin on your potato. And mining pools can't keep their dial up connection. 
I think it's irrational to limit bitcoins growth because of a random limit set years ago for a completely different reason. That is certainly not solid design. 
And mining is a multi million dollar business. A good network connection gives you an edge at 1mb but also at 8mb. It would be weird if Bitcoin needs to stop growing to cater to someone's slow internet connection.
And choosing bip101 (or bip100 or Unlimited) doesn't mean you are against lightning. 
All these discussions are moot anyways. Because miners already build on top of four blocks before validation. So network latency becomes irrelevant. And therefor block size becomes less important. At least not important for latencies.
The reasons not to upgrade are getting smaller. And the pressure to upgrade is getting bigger and bigger. 
Fees are ever growing and becoming more erratic. The promise of Bitcoin as a payment system is slowly dying.

@_date: 2015-11-04 13:04:20


I did. But it isn't implemented yet, not in bitcoin core and certainly not in wallets. 
Sometimes you need to apply the easy fix first, thats all. If you can introduce a whole new way of storing side chains, then you can also do one hard fork. It really not as scary as people make it out to be. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 13:58:06
Moore, nielsen, more pressing centralisation forces and orphan risks all make the "&gt; 1mb == OMG centralisation" argument completely moot already. But if you can talk about lightning, then I can surely talk about techniques to transmit found blocks faster. If anything completely obliterates any argument to keep the 1mb limit its that. 


I never understood people who say "just increase the fee" as a way to make small blocks ok. As if more fees would magically help to fit more transactions in the same blocks. 
So yes, if block size limit is completely removed and actual block size becomes so big that just one miner could handle them then you have the situation you describe. Just ignore that every other miner would orphan those blocks. Or that it wouldn't make any economical sense to completely destroy bitcoins value by centralising bitcoin that way. 


That makes me think of this quote by Douglas Adams:


This moment that the 1mb limit fits us perfectly will not last. Watch [this]( video and you will understand. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 09:44:45

BIP101 follows moore's law. So no datacenter needed at all. Maybe you can link to something they said?

Apologies, this was already posted with the shortened url: 
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:25:04
One word: permissionless 
Anyone can build wallet's, payment terminals, new features, no transactions needs anyone's permission. 
There is just one snafu: You need to ask permission to add something to the blockchain in the form of fees. And the 1mb limit artificially restricts growth. And we need to petition core developers to ask for permission to add more transactions. This goes beyond sheer economics.  It shows not the limit of Bitcoin, but the limits of human group behaviour. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:12:31
I actually really like for miners to be invested in Bitcoin for a much longer time then they are now. Now mined blocks are already available after 200 blocks.

Cheap is not to be cheap. Cheap is to subsidise bitcoins growth. Maybe even pave the way for a Lightning network. Who knows. But i'm pretty sure that hitting the pause button helps no-one. 
1) I simply reject some of your premise that blocks will get filled towards the maximum block size. We have never seen this behaviour. Its not reasonable to believe this will suddenly happen when the block size is increased. 
2) We don't need to cater to miners/nodes who simply do not want to upgrade their hardware/network speed. Life goes on, everything gets cheaper. We should at least follow moores law / nielsen law. Anything below that should actually increase decentralisation (making your key argument about decentralisation and security void).
3) We need to allow for transaction flooding attacks. That's why we can't just keep the maximum block size limit just above the transaction volume (like BIP103).
4) Miners are not scary. They are rational invested actors. Contrary what you want us to believe. They can and should vote on issues.

I think its a huge insult to the community to define consensus in terms of just a few core people. 
Its not difficult at all to determine if consensus has been reached if you let miners vote on issues. If anyone represents Bitcoin (and by extension the community) its the miners. The economic reality is that that is already the case. 
Small blockers have effectively hijacked the entire debate. Spreading a lot of FUD. In reality its the community which is bamboozled into thinking that waiting is more conservative than upgrading. BIP101 has effectively been outlawed. It has been decided by a minority that voting via miners is not an option. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:56:30
When the next block is just a suggestion then that would be harder to attack right? 
We could even synchronise suggestions from multiple miners (from the last x blocks) to make suggestions. 
Just sign a stream of simple commands which puts transactions in a certain order with the private key of where the block reward went. Commands like: Add/move transaction x to index y.

If double spends are propagated you can at least know that a double spend is being attempted. No clue how you would fake that without colluding with a miner. (excluding mempool eviction for non spam transactions because of small blocks).
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:56:31
I do not count empty blocks. And because some miners still mine 750Kb blocks doesn't mean that blocks aren't full. Every time the mempool grows significantly blocks are full. Because some miners never mine full blocks, does that mean you would never consider blocks to be full? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:15:48
You are absolutely 100% correct. Its always easier to disregard the old and focus on the new. 
If you can do a Lightning network on top of Blockchain without adding another blockchain then we can also improve the upcoming block with more security features. We can look at Bitcoin-NG for inspiration.

UPVOTE for visibility.
It seems like you don't actually know what you are talking about and just repeating opinions. Looking for some kind of authority to tell you want to think? 
Have you ever heard of moore's and nielsens law? 
If BIP101 follows expected CPU/Network increase. That means that BIP101 doesn't create any centralisation. It actually keeps things (more or less) the same. 
The **only** reason anyone needs to move to a datacenter is if they live in such a shithole that that would be the only way to get decent network speeds.  The other reason datacenter's are even mentioned is because Satoshi believed in SPV clients and that nodes could move to datacenters. 
So Mike/Gavin might say Bitcoin could move to datacenters, that's certainly not what BIP101 does. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 12:49:17
And all non upgraded miners? Aren't they going to mine invalid blocks if they do nothing? Would create a nice orphan rate :O

My idea would be to re-adjust the mintxrelayfee (or something similar) just like difficulty adjustment. This way for the next X blocks the fee needed for inclusion is entirely predictable. 
Downside is that no one would pay more than the minimum (maybe the guarantee should be the second block and not the first). And the average can still be higher than the set limit.
Upside is that there is no weird grey area of transactions which might be included.

So many years go the limit was: 1) created for a completely different reason 2) was many times bigger than actual transaction volume 3) was relatively bigger than what nodes/miners could handle with available hardware. 
Keeping the 1mb limit in place is lunacy. BIP101 is actually the conservative option. 
You know what would be prudent? If we show that Bitcoin can evolve. This idea that bitcoin is fragile is completely bogus, baseless and contrived.

Haha. I hereby declare that i'm a real person with just one account on reddit ;)
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:14:50
Bear with me. Maybe I made a wrong exit somewhere. 
1) An SPV attack is based on spoofing blocks and pretending a certain transaction is made. 2) SPV can query irrefutable proof that a transaction is present in a certain block (via the relevant part of the merkle tree). 3) SPV client can query and check the POW of every block. 4) Therefor a SPV client can detect a drop in hashing power on the faked chain
So if a attacker wants to spoof 6 confirmations it needs a huge amount of hashing power todo so (more than 50% at least).

If most people are pro-redlisting then that will be added/accepted. But if most people are against it then it will never become a thing. I personally think redlisting is the most naive and stupid idea ever for bitcoin. I don't like theft/extortion just like anyone, but it still fills my heart with joy that bitcoins are anonymous enough that those things are even possible.  But naive and stupid doesn't mean that Mike has bad intentions, i think those ideas come from a good place. 
And considering lighting and the block size limit, its actually pretty simple. Lighting doesn't exist. Every person who mentions a non existent solutions should get a slap in the face. And what also should merit a slap in the face is saying that 100% of users could transact if the block size isn't increased. But I assume that is what you are saying, because your comment isn't that clear to me. What are you saying exactly?

At least by being able to absorb peak loads. And people might be unpredictable, but as a whole they are not. 
The question should be: If we want to use a fee market to reduce (average) block size. How would you do that?  Would you add a hard limit like we have now? Or would you let miners recalculate a smart fee which "guarantees" inclusion in blocks every x blocks just like the difficulty adjustment to get to a certain average block size? 
In reality the solution is simple: raise the block size limit.

It seems miners are pretty conservative in adopting BIP101. Doesn't that tell us that they are in fact conservative and actually listening to, and waiting for, consensus? They are after all invested in Bitcoin. So its hard to believe miners would do anything contentious.

@_date: 2015-11-05 13:19:40


And here I was thinking I was reasoning with you and not the other way around. ;)


Because miners aren't stupid? 


On chain and off chain transactions are not comparable yet. Certain use cases simply die if they don't find room on the blockchain. 


Current off chain solutions are different use cases. Who says that everything needs to move on-chain? 


No one fixates on one parameter as if that would be the holy grail. And not you or anybody can define what success means for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:37:57
Bitcoin was created/designed years ago when computers where not so fast. And as a safety measure a limit was introduced to make sure no one would transmit a block so big no one could handle it. Because nodes will always accept new blocks from anyone and start validating whether its correct immediately. A big block would effectively shut down any node. 
So this limit was NOT put in place not to limit Bitcoins growth but only as a DDOS protection, with the added idea that when needed this limit could be raised very easily (with just 2 lines of code).
Now computers are much faster and can handle much bigger blocks. And currently we are running into the limit (people have been saying for years that we could run into problems around this time). This means that certain transactions simply don't fit. And all transactions with low transaction fees are being cut off. And the more transactions we get, the more transactions need to wait multiple blocks before they are added. So confirmation times go up or transactions fees need to be added.
TL;DR: Bitcoin has a safety net which gets in the way of actual growth. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:18:32
Haha, yes. Weird right? As annoying as I am. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 23:02:40
I didn't say it makes 0-conf impossible. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:22:42
I heard this remark about whining about fees before. Except the amount keeps rising. 
And I don't care about how much I need to pay. It's about potential, predictable fees, predictable confirmation times, Internet of things, use cases, micro transactions, subsidizing growth and barrier to entry etc
@_date: 2016-05-17 10:13:49


That would be cool. As more transactions == more fees == more capacity. But can fees be enough to make/break mining profitability? 
Might even make sense to automate the process so that a miner automatically turns on when it becomes profitable. That way it could also respond to price swings. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:56:05
Seems like you are making my point there.

Isn't the testnet sometimes reset to a copy of the real chain? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:22:03
Well, its one way of making the block size limit seem less urgent. That way the average block size also looks small.
I personally think miners should not build on top of such blocks to make it very costly to mine such nonsensical blocks. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:44:54
The block size limit had been WAY bigger than actual transaction volume for years. The block size limit was designed as DDOS protection, BIP101 just makes sure that it stays that way. We are not supposed to actually run into the limit. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:27:32
Ok, i'll be more concrete (and repeat myself). Why would problems suddenly arise now when we hit the limit? When this limit could have been set much higher. Or do you think we would have lowered by now? 
@_date: 2015-09-06 18:49:22
We should crowd fund something like that. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:35:05
Different ways to handle the block size problem? Any block size increase is controversial. People aren't up in arms because of HOW the block size should be changed, but that it has to be changed at all.
There are "forces" which want to keep the 1mb limit or even lower it, they probably want to remove SPV client support and they don't want support for unconfirmed transactions. 
Saying that its just about how to change the block size completely misses the point. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:31:24


The wallet on my phone does this. So how hard can it be? 


The cost of validating/storing a transaction should approach the actual cost, certainly not some arbitrary limit. The cost associated with bandwidth/storage pales in comparison with the cost of mining. So yes, i think the cost are currently insanely high. Spam which pays a fair price is by definition not spam. You certainly can't define spam as everything which can't make it into a block. That's just wrong. 


Mike has been run into the ground by vicious character attacks. XT has been run into the ground by DDOS attacks. And both are smeared by lies and censorship. If that is a "win" in your book then you should feel ashamed. 
And most developers want to build the next new thing. Almost no developer likes to do the easy pragmatic fix on the old imperfect system. Its one of the biggest Achilles heel of software developers. It makes this whole situation very understandable, but not in any way more right. 
And there are more forks already. We are not going to roll over and die. The cost of the 1mb is going to keep rising, and either core caves or a fork takes over. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:27:40

Bitcoin (and crypto currencies like it) might be the only software project where governance and the workings of the system are intertwined. Bitcoin is by definition what the majority of people run. I'm not a headless chicken for mixing them up. I'd go as far as say you need a whole lot of cognitive dissonance to separate them. 
If core doesn't add a blockchain increase then an alternative client (not to be mistaken for an altcoin) will take over and add an increase for them. Im not promoting client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus, i'm just stating an [economic inevitability]( (when bitcoin grows enough before other solutions arise).

Bitcoin already has instantaneous transactions. XT actually has improvements to make those safer. Having to evict transactions (because of small blocks) is something which makes zero conf more dangerous. 
And XT doesn't prevent anyone from implementing payment channels. They would just have to compete fair and square.

Maybe you are trying to be funny or something. But you really aren't. We have had a blocksize limit of 1mb for ages which was thousands of times larger than the actual blocksize. You are saying that when the limit is raised that suddenly that space is going to be occupied? What exactly prevented someone from carrying out that attack before? Do you believe there are actually people waiting in the dark for the limit to be raised to execute such an attack? 
Any miner which tries to create huge blocks runs the increased risk of getting his blocks orphaned. You are more scared for an unlikely theoretical attack than for the one which is actually happening because we are reaching the limit. And every day those attacks get cheaper and cheaper and/or the impact gets larger and larger. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:32:22
Because any change would cause a hard fork. That's why BIP101 is better, it at least checks to see if enough miners are on board.
BIP101 is actually very conservative. Contrary what people want you to believe. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:51:21
That's simply not true:  
77.000 unconfirmed transactions with between US$ 0.05 and US$ 0.08 cent fees per transaction. And they are not expected to confirm the first block, and for most not even in the second. 
And transactions are only getting more expensive or are going to take more and more time to confirm.

Bitcoin can mimic this with soft rules to make the miner who successfully mined a block be responsible for the ordering of transactions. Just for efficiencies sake and to add a little bit of extra reliability for zero conf's.

Why are you able to decide that certain transactions are spam/dust? 
You either give us the exact data which states that 1mb is the correct limit at this moment, or you change it. Its wrong to turn the 1mb limit into something completely different without consensus. And i mean wrong in the sense that it makes you look like a bad guy.

So if we have more transactions the mempool isn't going to fill up because blocks can't grow? Either transactions fill up the mempool if blocks are too small or you throw away more and more transactions. What do you think happens when bitcoin continues to grow? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:45:05


That's not what i said. They are filling all blocks in case of a backlog. And I want the block size limit removed entirely. 


I basically said the same thing. So I agree. But the pressure to add more blocks temporarily doesn't need to increase the average size. Its possible that a 500Kb block on average is ideal but that much larger blocks are still accepted at times.

You are talking as if the max block size dictates the actual block size. When in reality that has never been the case, and there is no data to support that it would suddenly be the case now. We have had a limit way in exces of the actual transaction volume for years. 
It makes no sense at all that the moment we actually run into a limit which was designed for one reason that we suddenly need for something completely different. 
BIP101 is already a huge compromise because it already changes the block size limit into something else. Its is by far the most conservative option out there. But the actual most conservative thing would be to change the limit into a value comparable to when it was introduced (or gasp... remove it completely). 


You are extrapolating your previous point into the absurd. Seriously don't pretend miners would suddenly create the biggest blocks possible. 


Yes, and who gets to decide how we trade of more transactions vs better security? (Even if we disregard that in reality decentralisation already happens more significantly because of other factors). Why on would we want the number of transactions be determined by a hard limit set years and years ago? 
You are repeating really stupid baseless arguments. 


It seems like most people want an increase. But with the FUD you help spread combined with the censorship on all major fora we are forced into compliance. We are force fed one opinion. 


You simply can't compare non existent solutions with exiting solutions. Even I would say that increasing the block size limit isn't the ultimate solution. But it certainly is the solution we need now. 


Off chain solutions do not have the same properties as on chain solutions. That would be the same as saying we don't need bitcoin at all because we have banks. Why would we believe in a certain type of system/solution and not want to let it grow? That might actually even pave the way for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:55:30
The only non compromise would be to remove the limit altogether. 


Well it is. But not changing a hard limit is easier than changing it. But that doesn't make one better than the other. 
Satoshi said it should be very easy to change the limit. But look at us now.

If the HF was factored in years ago it would be a total non-issue. Average block size would probably be the same, but fees and confirmation times would be a lot more competitive. People who advocate for smaller blocks would not have a disproportionate control over the entire eco-system, and they would advocate for lower soft-limits and higher minimal fees. 
It would not be technically exciting, except maybe for the whole signature validation performance thingy. But we would/should probably have never allowed transactions to occupy the entire blocks in the first place.

Well, I guess a service should exist which only handles double spend protection. Where the seller would put coins in a multi-sig wallet with this service. And this service signs all transactions if they are not double spends and if fees are high enough for fast confirmation. That way zero-conf would be enough and your transaction would be instantaneous. 
You would need to trust this service, might be handy if these services are run by miners, or with some kind of insurance contract which locks coins which can be redeemed with a specific fraud proof (double spend).
Or, if that doesn't exist yet. You could use an alt which confirms faster. If waiting is too awkward ;)
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:33:57


I thought we were complaining about Miners **not** being invested for long periods. Such an investment does add cost, but I see no problem if that has been factored in. We should have increased the time a miner had to wait before he can spend his coins way sooner. 


Didn't we need to wait at least one year to safely schedule a HF? It is like a grace periode of sorts.

Never heard about people actually losing anything during that HF. Wasn't that fixed in a few hours? Where people still running the old software for longer periods of time? Interesting.

That is so wrong. Of course bigger blocks are desired to empty the mempool. 
You are only correct if you do not value zero-confirmation transactions and low fee transactions. But that is just an opinion, one which you can't force upon everyone else.  
So we have a decentralised currency which is supposedly censorship free. But by centralising the development into one pov we have effectively censored certain types of use cases. No consensus, no discussion, no nothing.

The XT (and Classic) route are not intended to split anything. If the goal was to split, the activation % would be lower and the grace-period shorter. And it would add a requirement that a  block is  &gt;2Mb to guarantee a split.

Obviously governments decide what is and isn't legal. Obviously it would have been nice if we don't need to ask permission for everything. The reality is that for a thing like Bitcoin we do. Its not necessarily a bad thing if people ask themselves if something is dangerous. 
And in practice permission-less innovation still remains true on any small scale activity.

It doesn't matter if price goes up when it comes to network capacity. If 20% of miners stop then we effectively have a blocksize-limit of 800Kb. Which would also be a bloodbath in terms of confirmation backlog &amp; fees.

So why would you agree with the censorship exactly? You trust/value the community more than you do the miners?

@_date: 2015-11-13 13:18:19
Well i screamed doom about creating a fee market. The result is not a block size increase but wallets ([reluctantly]( increasing transaction fees (and miners increasing mintxrelayfee). We still hit the wall, it just doesn't hurt as much. The pain is more subtle. 
And we are not at 1/3 capacity, but more like 50%. And you don't plan for average load, but for peak load. If at least if you value Bitcoin as a payment system.
But thats the crux. I do, you don't(?). Mike does, blockstream and friends don't. 
So Bitcoin as a whole is certainly not doomed. Bitcoin as a payment system is. At least if you keep the 1mb limit. But I don't expect any explosion or snowball effect anymore. It will be a slow and undeserving death. The death of more and more transactions which simply can't exist when fees are too high.
Maybe try to emphasise with wallet creators. 
I must admit I value micro transactions, that is the place where I think Bitcoin can really grow. If you don't share that believe then I get your pov.\


If? What do you mean if. We have "touched" the cap multiple times already, and we do that as we speak. 
You do understand that the bigger blocks get the more empty blocks are created? Your focus on average block size is a bit weird.

@_date: 2016-05-13 07:38:05
If an open source projects kicks out everyone or is downright hostile towards everyone who disagrees on one fundamental issue, then you get people who complain. 
For Bitcoin the rift started with developers vs. developers. This isn't just about freeloaders acting entitled. We are talking about developers who invested a lot of time and effort into bitcoin. Users who poured in money and energy to promote Bitcoin. And businesses who took the chance in building on top of Bitcoin. 
So yes, there might be people who only complain and haven't put in any time/money into Bitcoin. But that is definitely not the entire story. 
We are not even complaining about the code Core writes. We complain about their leadership. Which is way too authoritarian.  Too much appeals to authority, and no respect for reaching community consensus. 
I don't see how respect for development effort should flow to  respect for leadership/authority.  Likewise, disrespect and complaints about leadership have **NOTHING** to do with respect for development effort. 
Conflating development/leadership is exactly the problem.

I wrote an article regarding [the worst case scenario]( But I could have written a similar article with positive feedback loops, I leave that up to folks. 
In the meantime we know SegWit is not going to deliver an increase around the halving. We probably saw a very large batch of new chips being tested (?) last week, which means we can expect hash-rate to increase soon which increase capacity (but who knows). All in all I consider it very likely that Bitcoin as a payment system will get a large beating around the halving.  But price-wise, I have no clue. There are enough people who think higher fees and lower quality of service is a good thing. 


No that is highly unlikely, fees are just 2% of total mining revenue. It wil not grow with a factor of 25x to compensate for the halvening. 
Price only needs to increase by a factor of 2 every four years to for bitcoin to be sustainable security-wise. There is absolutely no reason why fees would need to increase at this moment. Maybe in 8 (2 halvings) or even 16 years (4 halvings) from now. But definitely not now. That would make absolutely no sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:09:44
The number of coins added through mining is a small % of coins which are continuously traded. Therefor the halving should not influence the price much. 
But in reality the price is greatly influenced by what people believe. Regardless of facts. So if we all belief price goes up, then price will go up. And if price goes up, price might go up a lot simply because there are more eyes on the price during the halving. (Same goes for the reverse). 
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:40:42

And I don't remember exactly where this was stated. But the idea was that zero fee transactions would be added to blocks as a courtesy, subsidised by paying transactions. For instance a customer can buy things without adding transaction fees, but merchants/payment processors would. 




I said near. But yes. I wouldn't say that if I didn't believe that. If all transactions confirm within reasonable time, then that makes Bitcoin simply better. And better means more adoption. 
Guess what happens when we reach the 1mb limit (we are already at 750)? Are you going to explain to all new users why transactions do not confirm?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:01:16

Doesn't that summarize everything? Lightning is technologically scalable but not financially. Sounds great! ;) (or am i missing something?)


If you can transact with twice as many people then transactions also increase for the existing 1% of people. So you would see from two to four times as many transactions. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:46:27

@_date: 2015-11-04 07:40:48


Depositing &amp; withdrawing (bitcoin/fiat) leaves a definitive trail, but internal trades do not. If all internal transactions are in a database, then deleting one record could be enough to delete all proof that that trade ever happened. 
This is also one of the big reasons a blockchain is better than a simple database. 
All exchanges should actually supply proof that internal transactions are also in a private blockchain/sidechain.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:51:31
If you have a time machine, it doesn't really matter how long it takes to mine a block ;). So it doesn't matter how far back you go. 
And the further back you go the more influence your actions will have on the still fragile Bitcoin. Better mine a few coins over a long stretch of time, and not to far back (so after 2013 for instance). 
@_date: 2015-10-08 20:28:53
Why doesn't it create a web of trust? Based on the 6 degrees of separation thing. You trust some people, they trust some people and indirectly you should be able to trust most people. Via a graph you should be able to determine who can/cannot be regarded as a real person. 
The only problem is that the marketplace would look different for everyone depending on the people they implicitly trust. But maybe thats not a bad thing. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:43:24


Did the author completely miss the concept of mining for transaction fees? 
No one needs to invest in mining hardware themselves to ensure bitcoins are still being mined after the block reward becomes negligible. Nothing prevents interested parties to add transactions fees to subsidise mining. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:34:09


Except that it could mean an influx of new users and a lot more transactions.

@_date: 2015-11-25 11:04:11
I think he voices his fear that Lightning will only make sure you can do off chain transactions with entities like CoinBase. That the upfront cost of locking coins will simply be too big to switch, which essentially locks you into a one hub. Efficiency of scale might also cause the nr of hubs to be very small and therefor centralised. 
Although admittedly its a bit weird to say anything definitive about something which doesn't exist yet. But the fact that Lignthing doesn't exist should be the strongest reason to prefer Bitcoin as a payment system at this moment.   
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:38:39
At least double spends attempts are also relayed through the network, so any double spend which are broadcasted quick enough to get picked up in different orders by different miners should also be visible as a double spend attack very quickly. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:07:23
Tell me what consensus means then. Why is a minority allowed to even define what that means? How does that work? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 10:41:19


Exactly! There is already pressure enough for miners **NOT** to include your transaction. No mention of block size limit anywhere. Because you don't actually need it. 
We had a 10(!) hour backlog, that could have been reduced completely without incurring any extra bandwidth or storage. Except maybe by making Bitcoin more popular. But that should also generate more fees, not less. And it would also promote more nodes not less. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:04:08
Could it pay for its own 4g connection with bitcoin? :O
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:43:18
Oh so those will get relayed but normal double spend attempts won't. Go figure. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 10:51:26
Normal mining pools are also not as centralised as people think. Miners can subscribe and unsubscribe at any time creating enough decentralisation to secure the network. 
It's pretty simple: If mining is centralised, then bitcoin's value goes down, forcing miners to switch pools. 
This even applies to creating huge mining farms, which could become too big by themselves. The gains in efficiency by creating a huge mining farm doesn't outweigh the destruction of the value of Bitcoin. 
This whole decentralisation which is supposedly caused by increased block size is grossly overstated anyway. This has never been the case and there is no data to suggest it will be (without cherry picking). 
@_date: 2015-11-28 11:40:28
The cost of switch to an alternative client could simply be way higher than the cost of losing zero-conf. I also havent seen a vote on these issues from miners. But maybe that already says enough about how little they care.

If Bitcoin ever becomes completely anonymous and untraceable, that would be the most likely moment it gets shut down.

I was always very much against such stress tests. 
But as Bitcoin's value gets bigger it becomes impossible to keep marking certain transactions as spam. 
And i'm not saying bitcoin should absorb all spam indefinitely. I'm just saying that would be the best course of action now. 
The reality is we are getting a market for fees without anyone asking for it. Without any consensus. "Just increase the minrelaytxfee" isn't a better solution just because it isn't a hard fork.

The intention of BIP101 isn't to create a hard fork. The block with more than 1mb worth of transactions causes the hard fork. BIP101 only enables miners to do that safely with the assurance that the majority of miners will accept their block. 
Actually when no miner orphans such a block, is there really a hard fork? 
Worst case scenario is that the 1mb chain's confirmation time becomes 4 times slower. But more likely is that it will never confirm again ever. 
So with one chain being alive, and the other dead. Is that really a hard fork? 
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:51:54
If a transaction has been relayed to enough nodes its reasonably save to accept zero confirmation transactions. If its someone I know or if its below 0.5 bitcoin then i'm not going to wait for confirmation. So basically I never wait. 
For what kind of things do you actually wait for confirmations? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:03:19


Zero conf works because of miners. Because we can make reasonable assumptions on the transactions they will accept into a block next. 


So you think people complain about turning the block size limit into something else is because there is another solution to scale Bitcoin? So people would gladly accept no solution and pick up a fight because there are two? That's hilarious!


Merchants and payment processors will disagree with you. Real world usage paints a different picture. 


Never heard people say that Bitcoin in its current form is not very decentralised. 


No one needs to be formally in charge to hijack Bitcoin and force it into one direction. Core does deem certain things controversial and others uncontroversial. There is still no formal system for any consensus whatsoever. And even if the majority of users/miners are subscribed to their ideas without being swayed by misinformation/censorship/character attacks then its still wrong to destroy Bitcoin as a payment system for the rest of us. 


So I have been dreaming all along. 


Never said fees should be removed entirely and always, there is still transaction priority regardless of fees. 


What is removing block times? Who suggest that?


You can change certain aspects of Bitcoin. If we have a better system to synchronise how the next block is going to look like the block size wouldn't be as important anymore. And that could also improve zero-conf greatly. 
And no one bury's their head in the sand. Block size increases are heavily tested. There is absolutely no problem in going to 8Mb for instance. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 10:10:12
Tell me how to do scalable side chains with two-way pegs. Miners/nodes need to watch all side chains to actually check if all transactions are valid. How will that scale? 


So you learned about Bitcoin recently then? Because only recently people started to spread FUD that we should not welcome Bitcoin's growth but we need to fear it. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:05:52
Can it really destroy anything? It can lock coins indefinitely, which a Softfork can obviously also do. But then you could always unlock them with a new fork, so they weren't actually destroyed.
You might be able to misappropriate them, but that seems like the least likely fork to ever happen and then it still can't be considered destruction. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:13:37
Don't small blockers want everyone to be able to run a full client? Because that would be the most secure wallet. Which is an extreme position to hold except if you need to send huge amounts of Bitcoin. If you have so many Bitcoins to send, maybe its only logical that you become a little bit paranoid. 
So instead of trying to send found blocks more efficiently, maybe we should also focus on making SVP more secure. 
Edit: Not that I think bitcoin needs to be industrialized any time soon. With BIP101 people can essentially use a full client forever. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 11:49:58
Or we could raise the blocksize limit making Bitcoin more usable (before we have better solutions). :X
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:08:56
Why wouldn't everyone buy more hardware like they do now? Cost of mining always approaches the value of the transaction and mining fees. I don't see why that would change

But it doesn't look like that.

@_date: 2015-11-27 14:29:43
Blocks are full for 3 hours already so not everything is going through until transaction volume decreases. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 12:39:34
Actually we might want to run hard into soft-limits before we run into the hard-limit. Because it is not like we know with 100% certainty what is going to happen when we do. Because that would mainly depend on the willingness of current users to stay on the blockchain, not for instance on the current fees being paid. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:46:23
Seems unlikely that 100% of that 6% would in be favour of blocking anything. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:52:56
I just think that's the next victim on the list to be scrapped for the "reference" client. Although that forces no one to actually run that version, but it seems like the reference client is currently seen as way more than just that. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:45:55
You are promoting micro transactions without using side chains, therefor you are indirectly promoting an alternative client. And that isn't allowed on @_date: 2016-05-05 21:26:12

@_date: 2015-03-24 22:01:39
Bitcoin is still an experiment.  Hell, the official bitcoin core implementation is still at 0.10.0. And what's the worst that could happen? Value goes down? More alt coins? Actual creation of side chains? 
You can't increase the blockchain size indefinitely. That would certainly lead to more centralisation. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 12:42:08
I assume these are large miners switching to 14Nm chips. Seems like big swings in hashrate exactly what you expect when a more efficient chips are being released on the market. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:53:40
It would be similar to having an 800Kb limit. The limit per block would be the same, but because you have less blocks the limit would reduce the number of transactions per second which the network can handle. 
Similar to what happened around march with the big backlog. Then miners stopped (for unknown reasons) and the effective byterate went down to [888Kb per 10 minutes](

@_date: 2016-05-08 19:52:59
It is far too easy to switch from one repository to the next. So there isn't really a central point of fail-lure. But what might become a problem is the lack of truly anonymous access. But its also easy to cross that bridge when we have to.

Could be a security issue. The more secrets you give away, the easier it is to hack/crack a private key. Maybe the first keys he used were not random enough? 
He could move the coins, but that might upset the economy. Which given how close we are to the blocksize-limit might not be the smartest move.
Not that I'm completely convinced yet. Although it would be career suicide if Gavin is lying or stupid enough to get fooled. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 11:33:18

@_date: 2016-05-13 14:29:06


That is entirely your conclusion &amp; extrapolation. Saying something bad happens which needs to be prevented does not mean someone is willing/promoting to do something even worse to fix it. 


I agree with him here. Fees should be used to limit average blocksize. Blocksize should not determine fees. Because that is the way you can make confirmations reliable while maintaining a sensible average blocksize.
This doesn't allude to "bigblocks to the max" at all. 


It might make easier for you to assume Hearn thinks like this. But it proofs nothing. 


Thanks for your effort. But your comments said more about you and your bias than about Hearn. 
So again, do you know anyone who seriously says something like this: 


I mean I could be wrong obviously. I don't read everything everyone says. There is bound to be someone who thinks like this. But it is definitely not the narrative of "bigblockers". 
And I actually ran survey's on and and a question like "Should everyone be able to run a Full node?" even had a higher affirmative response on than I could also say that "small blockers" want zero byte blocks, or that they want infinitely high fees. That would make just as much sense in implying "big blockers" want infinite blocks. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:21:40
Yes censorship, lying, ddos attacks, character attacks are really funny. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:57:55


If you do not add fees your transaction might never be mined. Or it could take days/weeks. 
And funny that its being called a controversie when the wiki itself even states that almost everyone wants an increase.  
And wtf is up with the distinction between raising the limit and introducing a hard fork? You can't introduce a block size increase without a hard fork.

@_date: 2015-11-04 17:33:41
Can you read? Hard fork needs way more planning ahead. Soft changes don't. 
And you really can't have it both ways. The 1mb campers can't yell that we have lots of time before transaction volume merits an increase. And at the same time complain that all soft code should already be finished. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:40:51
Its opt-in. If you want to do zero conf you can. Different use-cases, different options. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 12:10:53
So is it also probable that they themselves order the DDOS attacks? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:47:51


Wait what? Where did that come from? Transaction volumes have always been WAY lower than the actual limit. The limit has always functioned as a DDOS protection. 
And you do realise that the resources to run a node become cheaper and cheaper while the limit stays the same. Effectively keeping the limit in place is exactly what BIP101 does. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:20:03
With enough focus and effort zero-conf transactions can be made a lot more secure. Better double spend detection. Double spend relaying. And you could even go as far as penalising miners who double spend (inspired by Bitcoin NG).
The danger is that if we destroy Bitcoin as a payment system and Lightning doesn't materialised quickly enough that Bitcoin will get overtaken by something else.  
So yes people can check that flag. But not if they are not given enough time to actually change their code. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 07:00:49

There are a lot of people who don't write (a lot of) code and are still regarded as an important voice.

So Satoshi was definitely a big-blocker. ;)
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:42:04
As far as I know the transaction which is send indicates whether or not a transaction is allowed to be replaced. So the sender has control. That's what the opt-in is about.

I agree that we still need RBF and CPFP. Those are good things to have. Although I personally think we should absorb all transactions, even zero fee transactions. Not forever but just at this time to subsidise bitcoins growth (fake it till you make it, so to speak).

How on earth do you know when/if these transactions become non-economical? You can guess, but it is also possible that these transactions are willing to outbid a lot of transactions which you would deem important/economical/non-spam. 
Furthermore the (future) economical impact of certain usecases is very hard to gauge. Killing off anything at this stage is lunacy. It might make more sense of proper off-chain solutions like Lightning exist, but not now. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:42:09

What's the point in showing how you could theoretically determine consensus but not how you actually do it? So in theory you implement certain rules without bias, but in reality its still "whatever some small group of people say"?




If you answer a "who" question with the exact conditions when consensus is needed, does that mean that you yourself decide that a hard fork always needs consensus? And do you realize that that's not actually what happened in reality? 
Your policy is also a dangerous one, because that means a minority could create controversy forever and completely stagnate all bitcoin development. What really is the lesser evil then? 


That really summarizes the whole situation. A small group of people decided that raising the limit is controversial, when in reality keeping the 1mb is controversial. A huge majority wants an increase. Your policy should actually favour XT not Core. 
And the how - the limit is increased - isn't nearly as important as people make it out to be. That's completely contrived because this issue is deemed controversial in the first place. 
Raising the limit NOW to just 2Mb would process all the bogus transactions three times faster! It would show good faith. And it would show that Bitcoin is actually agile and not stagnant. In the beginning the 1Mb limit was a thousands of times higher than the actual blocksize. It wasn't a problem then, and it isn't a problem now. Bandwidth and processing power has also increased at least tenfold in that time. 


If you say XT falls under that rule when in reality it tries to find real (pragmatic) consensus then you are definitely enforcing an opinion. You are saying that some theoretical method of finding consensus is better than an actual one. And you should be honest in the fact that a minority of people (who control bitcoin in name) do not trust the majority of miners and users to do the correct thing. Which actually goes against the concept of consensus completely. 
You sit on your theoretical high horse to defend a contrived controversy. And it all sounds pretty believable if you censor and ban the people who actually speak up. That might even have most people hoodwinked into believing that we are all just waiting for a solution. But seeing that the people who started this mess (or keep us in it) clearly state that anything above 1mb is controversial. Think about that. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:50:54
It would be possible that Satoshi never kept the key for the genesis block. As it was build by hand. Maybe there was never a key to begin with. 
The first block isn't spendable. So how likely is it that the key was saved in the first place? 
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:24:55
Ok, interesting. 
As a developer I always cringe when I see people still using fax/email/manual signatures/centralized (corruptible) databases for really important things. And its weird that those things still have legal weight.

@_date: 2015-10-24 17:29:29
Its not an either-or thing. No business can start without care for regulations, not in any type of business and especially not when you deal with money. And bitcoin is so new, and so different that we simply can't keep regulators in the dark. We can't afford to be that naive.

The intended purpose is indeed to release "stuck" transactions, but also to kill off zero-conf transactions. Or at least push it a bit faster towards its demise, as it is deemed unsafe.
What RBF will also do is lower average fees paid, as transactions can (and will) have a lower initial fee. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:45:42
Or it would have been a sign that Bitcoin is wildly popular. Who knows. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:33:54
Yes and no. The definition of spam vs legitimate transactions is now a direct consequence of the 1mb limit. Something which it explicitly wasn't designed to do. 
Keeping the 1mb limit and turning it into something completely different seems to be something which doesn't need consensus. Its like standing still in the middle of the highway and not moving out of the way because then we might get run over. 
The 1mb limit is being imposed. I'm really not suggesting to impose anything without consensus. 
What spam/dust transactions we absorb and which we throw away should be carefully considered. At the moment it isn't. 
I personally would absorb all transactions at this moment. Because in principle I think no one is able to determine what is and what isn't spam/dust. But again, I would not want to impose anything. 
And I also think that transactions which make the UXTO smaller should need less fees than transactions which grow the UXTO. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:37:16
We have the raw numbers regarding a blocks becoming bigger for years. Even from the time BIP101 was implemented blocks have grown significantly. How has bitcoin destabilised in the mean time? 
We have had a block size limit which was a LOT smaller than actual transaction volume for years. It wasn't a problem then, why would it suddenly be a problem now? And before you answer think of this: The block size limit was arbitrarily chosen years ago as DDOS protection, nothing else. Therefor the fact that we run into the limit now is completely arbitrary. 
The conservative thing to do is to increase the limit. That's a fact. Re-introducing the limit to do something completely different is the progressive thing to do. Creating a market of fees is really the more dangerous course of action. Although maybe that's the best thing. Lets not pretend that being passive is the conservative thing to do. Because its not. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 10:27:33


Would you shoot yourself in the foot just for the very small chance of someone else also shooting himself in the foot? It's a lose-lose game however way you cut it.  I'm still waiting for someone to explain how it would make any sense without assuming miners want to shit where they eat. Bitcoin's value could be completely decoupled from the actions of miners, but then we have bigger problems than empty blocks ;)

How can anyone take someone serious who says: "So what happens when that limit is reached? Transaction fees go up. Literally, that’s all that happens."

The pain of not having certain transactions will FAR outweigh any contrived issues regarding centralisation.
@_date: 2016-05-23 10:54:29
Some additional points: 
* Bitcoin's development seems to be picking up pace with more funding and because of the blocksize-limit
* Bitcoin halving is coming in 48 days (which could affect capacity)
* New 14Nm mining chips seem to be hitting the market making hashrate go up and down violently (affecting capacity)
* Segregated Witness seems to be delayed (which might mean no effective capacity increase at the halving). 
* Transaction volume is already almost at capacity
* Off-chain solutions like Thunder &amp; Lightning (payment channels) are not ready 
* Bitcoin's % of the cryptocurrency market seems to keep going down 
* We had a big backlog in march (capacity low, tx-volume high), and right after a certain alt-coin went up in value (coincidence?)
* A certain alt-coin has created a DAO funded with $150 million dollar worth of cryptocurrency
* Several alt-coins seems to be a lot better regarding finding consensus than Bitcoin (might be because they have less at stake)
* The Bitcoin community is divided regarding supporting Core or Clasic's scalability plan (clasic seems to be a minority)
* Miners side with Core but seems to demand a Hardfork before they mine to activate SegWit (delaying all blocksize increases)
* Fees &amp; confirmation times seem to become higher and more erratic
* Businesses which supported Bitcoin exclusively now accept a certain other alt-coin
Seems like Bitcoin will have its defining moment within a few months.

So fees were lower and soft limits higher, yet somehow blocks weren't filled then but it makes sense they would get completely filled now?

Thanks for taking the time to dive into this. There seems to be something to learn here (for you/me).
I'm actually also in favour of removing the limit entirely. But that still doesn't mean I believe Bitcoin should be able to handle everything you throw at it regardless of the consequences. Because it would be completely irrational to add more transactions if the cost isn't covered. And cost can be anything, orphan risk/cost, centralisation, bandwidth/storage, cost vs security of validating transactions for users etc. 
There is one reason why you could be against such a thing (actually there are two, but lets not get into nefarious reasons). That is, you believe in some kind of tragedy of the commons where you need to protect the majority against themselves. I hope you don't take that serious. 
The blocksize limit is akin to mandating bike helmets to improve bicycle safety. Technically it's safer, but with a broader perspective you notice that it actually accomplishes the complete opposite. Similar to being penny wise but pound foolish, technologically smart but socio-economically foolish. 
So I consider it very very unlikely that Hearn wanted bitcoin to handle any and all load that's thrown at it regardless of cost. I don't see why I need to prove a negative there. And maybe we should leave Hearn out of it as he rage-quit a long time ago. 
Regarding the spam attack in march, and my comment. You can clearly see that this is still conjecture from my part. It is not unlikely that a HD wallet which represents users funds in some kind of exchange would result in the same type of transactions. Not that it matters. Because either running into the limit makes such attacks cheaper and more effective, or we ran into the limit with actual transactions doesn't really matter as you need to plan for both anyway. 
I believe a transaction is innocent until proven guilty and we even more important is that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Which **still** doesn't mean I think we should add all transactions at any cost. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 10:10:16
Bitcoin addresses should be more easy to verify by a human. Something like: "reddit.com.1HPpnc43wJndLQaRU9V6Y4TWkyh" which also means that the address 1HPpnc43wJndLQaRU9V6Y4TWkyh is checked (cryptographically/queried) to be valid. 
Obviously if blockstore/blockname is populair and trusted enough we could use that. 
What is the point of bitcoin addresses if humans can't actually check them? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 23:05:05
If you can pay less, would you? With RBF you can. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:16:47
If you have more efficient hardware available and the fees are reduced then with an equal amount of hash power the security would still go down. 
Because the question is: how expensive would an attack be. The hash rate by itself says absolutely nothing about the security. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:08:20
Your point? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 14:13:58
A private blockchain can have value just to make spamming the network expensive. Making sure that resources are paid for fair-and-square by all players. 
If Bitcoin can be valuable within the entire universe, then a private coin can be valuable in a subset of the universe ;). 
Bitcoin is also more distributed most other systems. Many still have a central command &amp; control of some sort. Bitcoin doesn't. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 15:29:36
The number of coins traded daily completely dwarfs new coins which are mined. If miners believed the price would go up they wouldn't yes hold the arbitrary amount the mine, but they would **buy** more BTC. 
A miner buying their own coins (internal accounting) would be the best way to make sure the market is **not** moved. Not dumping coins on the market should have some effect but not to the degree we are seeing right now. 
Someone is buying, and it could be miners, but it could be anyone. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:51:43

No, why would you say that? The current delays are artificially induced and unnecessary. Doesn't mean bitcoin wouldn't also hit physical limits at some time. Just not at this time, and certainly not in the same way. 
A hard limit is the worst way to deal with peak transaction volume. If you really wanted to introduce a fee market to make bitcoin sustainable, would you introduce a hard limit? Or would you create something which only pushes the average blocksize down? Something which would have create guaranteed confirmation times for certain fees, instead of the unpredictable fees we have now. 
This moment when we let Bitcoin keep bumping its head against the limit is **not** designed.

Dude, really? At the moment you would need to wait 28 times **longer** to have the same level of security with Litecoin as with Bitcoin. So it is slower, not faster. 
And once coins are locked and securely confirmed there would be no speed difference whatsoever when using Lightning. 
I hope you were just trolling...
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:01:49
And diversify maybe? 
@_date: 2016-05-01 09:54:00
It is likely that SegWit still isn't activated by then, transaction volume would be at an all-time high already, and some 10%-20% of miners could shutdown (variable cost getting too high for some) which would cause the biggest fee-event we have ever seen. 
Just think about the last fee-event around the beginning of march. Tx byterate was 1Mb on the first of march, because of miners shutting down capacity byterate was just 888Kb. Average confirmation skyrocketed and usability was severely impacted, price went down, number of transactions fell and some alt-coin shot up. People were moving away from Bitcoin to alt-coins, no doubt about it. 
And if you insist that it was "just a spam attack", then such an attack should likely also occur during the halving as that would be the point where an attack is the cheapest and causes the most harm.
Ergo, the price would most likely go down just like around the beginning of march. Where it went down from $436 to $401. 
The only thing which could change this if we have a major fee-event before the halving, which is likely if price &amp; usage continues to rise.
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:50:45
I don't follow you. The same fee market still exists below the mintxinclusionfee. And the mintxinclusionfee would itself go up and down based on the number/size of transactions. I don't see how that isn't a market. 
And i'm not saying a miner is forced to add all transactions (how can he be?). He is just allowed to add certain transactions. And a hard limit should also exist. 
I put "guarantees" between "" because its not really a guarantee. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 10:44:02
CLTV / BIP 65 sounds like a hard fork. Can someone explain?

@_date: 2015-11-30 10:33:13
RBF has been specifically altered to force increased fees to prevent DOS attacks. Else you could flood the network with as much double spends as you want. 
Even if that wasn't the case. Why would a miner voluntarily replace a higher paying transaction with a lower paying one? 
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:39:44
Would you objectively say that mining full 1MB blocks is better or worse for the entire network?

@_date: 2016-07-04 09:11:27
Yet this hasn't been the case ever. If miners do not act in the best interest of Bitcoin as a whole, we have bigger issues. 
And miners are or are not in control. If then aren't (and can't activate a HF like classic for instance) then a high blocksize-limit would not matter much as you should be able to lower this at any moment. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:59:30
If everyone thinks nothing bad will happen and no significant number of miners will shut down at the halving, then maybe miners become more careless and switch off at the same time. 
Although miners could switch their rigs back on if there are serious issues in terms of tx-capacity. That might make sense if you are still invested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:16:01
I'm not significantly invested. I agree with a fork, but I agree more with letting the market decide. Whatever that choice may be. 
The reason there was a bug falls onto Ethereum as a whole. It reflects on Ethereum as a whole, as the decrease in price also showed. And Ethereum can obviously take ownership of that problem. There is nothing wrong with that, except that it hurts the perception of immutability, that is a real cost for Ethereum as a whole. We will be compare the price of ETH &amp; ETHC and see which one is more valuable. That should give a definitive answer. 
What is your alternative? Not letting the market decide? 
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:57:40
Because you value things based on its content? 
And I genuinely think Bitcoin is going in the wrong direction. If I wanted Bitcoin to fail I would stay quite and promote this course of in-action. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 05:57:04
A contentious HF was supposedly very dangerous. Yet Ethereum is all set to pull it off anyway. You can't really sell the fear of a contentious HF when one has been implemented successfully. So yes, it is important for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 05:11:43


If fees only go up, that's not a healthy fee market. 
Furthermore, if everyone used dynamic fees you would see fees rising and dropping faster. 
Dynamic fees are not the answer to everything. If we hit the limit permanently, it is simply game over for a lot of transactions/use-cases. 
The next few months are going to be very interesting. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:21:31
That's not the original code for determining the block reward as Satoshi wrote it. It was designed to inflate indefinitely forever. /s
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:57:17
I said probably, because we still don't see definitive proof that growth is stunted by higher fees yet. So the reverse probably also not apply yet, in theory at least. 
If the marginal cost is so low, then why isn't every block full now? Why were blocks not full last year? 
Imagining 2Mb blocks isn't that hard actually. Just go back in time ;)
@_date: 2015-10-24 14:58:19
With the cluster fuck that is the Bitcoin foundation it really can't hurt to get a little bit of legitimacy back. Like it or not but we do not live in the wild west. No company can operate outside of the law. 
We can be scared that bitcoin might change for the worse. But the way I see it: Bitcoin is already a dream for law enforcement. Its a freaking treasure-trove of information. 
And in the real world stolen money is still money. I believe its also in the interest of law enforcement to not create a bitcoin blacklist. Because that is really our big fear. A blacklist would kill bitcoin and give rise to completely anonymous crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 09:15:42


Why exactly would you want to give 5% of miners a veto? 
Do you understand that **not** doing things can have huge consequences? I mean, does that need explaining? 


Basically what you are saying is that you don't want blocks to get bigger, and/or you think there are no forces in place to make sure blocks are sizes appropriately given current incentives. 
You have a certain goal, and that is what you want to reach. The goal isn't a democratic system, or reaching the most economic solution. Your goal is something else. 
Maybe you should state your goal first... ;)
@_date: 2016-07-20 10:49:41
For me the main goal of cryptocurrencies should be enabling widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. And specifically creating currencies which are backed by cryptography and not violence (as seems to be the case with fiat). 
Decentralisation is a means to an end, because power always corrupts and therefor you cannot have centralised governance or control.
What I said pertains directly to that: 


The only other alternative is centralised control. And it doesn't mean the only goal is the highest price. A lower price coin can become more popular while a higher priced coin completely implodes. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:17:39
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:42:24
A free market is a contradiction in itself, because there it can always spawn entities so large that they are indeed government like. At least, that is how I see it. It takes an effort to keep it free. It's like keeping Bitcoin decentralised and free from control. Prevent vendor lock-in. Prevent any status quo from forming. No appeals to authority, no character attacks. No censorship. You get the point. 


I did, and I do. But not in some black and white way. Bitcoin is still largely free. Everyone is free to do whatever he/she wants. 
You might have mistook me saying we don't have a free market to mean that it isn't free at all.


People voicing genuine concerns isn't FUD. Tell me why tx-volume goes down every time we hit the limit and had a big backlog? This data is readily available. Draw your own conclusions. 


I agree. 


And I agree to an extend, but it's more a long term strategy. And getting longer and longer. 


If you wait long enough, then at one point a Softfork limit increase will indeed be faster than via a Hardfork. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:07:31
If I give my interpretation/opinion then that's not lying. I cropped out nothing, I gave **all** the data. And in my interpretation I even removed all transactions which paid less than 0.00005 BTC/Kb. We don't have to agree whether that is cheap or expensive, or whether confirmation times became too high when running into the limit.
Running in circles. Let's do this again sometime. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:47:43
Yes, when you ask people about the good things in life, things they desperately need, decentralisation is always something they mention ;). 
No, the good things we strive for are security, privacy, freedom, health etc.  those are things which are good by themselves. Those are the goals we (should) strive for. 
Although I would not be surprised if decentralisation goes into the history books as something which helped us reach those goals globally. So yes, important. But not a goal by itself. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 09:16:00
I was talking about limits, not risks. Although an orphan limit would increase the orphan risk. Although it is probably a stick which will never be used. 
Believing it exists should be enough.

If bitcoin's security isn't linked to the block reward then you actually do not have any security. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:13:10
Its really weird that rewards a cut in halve from one block to the next. A small decrease per block would have been a lot nicer. I like my bitcoins to be stable. 
On the other hand, maybe nothing significant will change. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:58:11
Can Bitcoin grow when the barrier to entry has been raised? Can people see its future potential when things like Lightning have not materialised yet, but on-chain transaction growth has already been stopped? 
 You can expect the price to rise when SegWit and Lightning is released, because the utility of the network **is** important. ;)
@_date: 2016-07-22 11:47:39
That's hard to say. Financial incentives would still be the same. His development effort was probably significant, so stonewalling might have been easy enough. But him not stonewalling can't be seen as a bad thing.

If you do not deliver counter evidence, then simply claiming someone is lying **is** basically a shouting contest. I mean you are still free to provide counter evidence. But I don't see why Blocktrail would provide me with wrong data. I'm also perfectly fine if you simply believe it is wrong, just don't state it as a fact without backing it up. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:14:04
Oh Peter you create a problem, and then you discover the problem you yourself created. It's amazeballs. 


You could remove the blocksize-limit, and make sure that anyone can get into a block who pays enough fees. Mempool isn't supposed to grow bigger and bigger. That wasn't the original design/plan. 
Pay enough fees == get into a block. That's how it should work. With optimisations like head first mining/weak blocks/thin blocks blocks the network can be very capable of processing the occasional huge block. 
This is what many people fail to understand about bigger blocks. You can allow bigger blocks, yet still keep average blocks at reasonable levels. Which is exactly what would happen if you increase the blocksize limit now. Average blocksize wouldn't suddenly go up, because minimum fees would stay the same (if they don't go down now, why would they go down when blocks are bigger?). Average blocksize is what mostly determines the cost to run a full node, not peak blocksize. 
If I ask for bigger blocks, I ask for a more reliable Bitcoin. Which happens to be exactly what Lightning needs. Go figure.

@_date: 2016-07-11 14:18:39
I like to emphasise the "widespread" part of what a cypherpunk is (from wikipedia):


The most perfectly secure solution is one which isn't used. 
We are not starting a revolution here to try and monetize something as much as possible and introduce as much friction as we can. No, we want social and political change. That why people make things like  because you are not after money. Cheap or free isn't the goal, it is a means to an end. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:01:08

@_date: 2016-07-05 11:11:36


That depends on how wet you are willing to become. 


Blocks will indeed never be 100% full. It is very likely we hit the limit hard before SegWit is activated (before december). But we will see. Potato potato. 


Why would we be able to force the development of off-chain solutions, but not make on-chain scaling safe? 
And if paypal2 is still decentralised (not in the hands of one entity), and is still cryptographically auditable. We would still have gained a lot. Combine that with nodes trying to find fraud proofs to make sure blocks/transactions are valid. Still seems like big step up from fiat. 
But maybe Roger does have a more centralised view in mind. IDK. I'm not a Roger groupie.

I would wholeheartedly support governments doing this. If it is pseudo anonymous like Bitcoin, that would be a huge step forward. More transparency, faster transactions, easier to proof reserves, provable inflation.  Which would all make it easier to get out of fiat. Think atomic swaps between fiat and crypto-currencies. Having more control over your fiat currency. 
No clue why all the other commenters are so negative. Because just like says, this is going to be a huge boon for Bitcoin. 
Maybe hodlers want Bitcoin to succeed so badly that they shit on everything else, which is ironic because that accomplishes the exact opposite. Certainly in this case.

The ultimate goal is improved wellbeing and happiness for as many people as possible. The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris comes to mind. 
If we can agree on that, then it is just a matter of how to get there. And specifically how cryptocurrencies can play a role in that. But I'm pretty sure I agree with Roger Ver on that one regarding fiat &amp; inflation being used to pay for wars, and that cryptocurrencies can help in that regard. 
And back on topic. ;)

Why not let the market decide?

Do you think any backlog &amp; any fee level is fine? 
For instance, if it costs me $5 per month to run a full node (hardware depreciation / internet cost). You would at least think that $5 fees per transaction is too high right? 
So what fee level would merit an emergency hardfork? 
It is a devil's dilemma, you increase the barrier to entry, or you increase the barrier to entry. But there should be an ideal average blocksize which makes sure the total average cost is as low as possible for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:30:24

I advocate for bigger blocks via HF. But I still admit that the blocksize-limit is a double edged sword. It hurts wherever you put the limit. But we can at least make sure Bitcoin continues to slowly grow like it has for years, because it happens to align with Moore &amp; Nielsen (when we assume those continue to hold true). 
But nevertheless, if an entire 3rd world nation jumps onto Bitcoin it won't be sustainable anyway. But it would still be beter (morally) to say honestly that we can't scale any further instead of saying we don't want to. 
Bitcoin can't scale indefinitely, but it sure can scale to more than 1Mb.

If the actual value of the mining reward ((block reward + transactions fees) * bitcoin value) goes down then we would lose mining power. If the reward goes up then more miners will join. 
Therefor the security is directly related to the mining reward. That means when you only rely on block reward and it is divided by two, the value of bitcoin needs to be twice as high for bitcoin to enjoy the same level of security. 
Bitcoin might very well grow a lot still, but it can't multiply twofold every four years (19% growth per year). Thats not sustainable.  
In 400 years that would be 5.444.517.870.735.015.415.413.993.718.908.291.383.296
And you were talking about adding decimal places ;)
If you still don't understand just imaging the mining reward to be only worth 10 US dollar, how many miners would Bitcoin attract? And how much security would Bitcoin have? The answer is: 10 dollar. Bitcoin would only attract 10 dollars worth of mining power, so it would only take another 10 dollar worth of equipment to have 50% mining power and be able to launch an attack.

I got that idea from talking to Luke-jr directly (him mostly that is)  
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:04:43
But decentralisation is a means to an end. It's not just about who mines, but also about the architecture itself. 
I mean, if you would have one hugely invested miner with &gt;50% hashing power, the code would not change. Nor would this one miner be able to change the code forcefully. Bitcoin's architecture would remain decentralised. One misstep, and this miner would be gone. Because however big you are, you are in service of the network, not the other way around. And any professional miner has to answer to his wallet. 
In a way, PoW at a large scale is PoS. It probably is the best PoS implementation we have.

Head first mining. Transactions never amounting to exactly 1Mb. Miners creating smaller blocks for whatever reason. If you care about those few extra Kb, why not hardfork to get 100Kb extra? :)


If you need it to grow much faster then it currently does, then yes. But maybe more importantly, if you want to force people into more private solutions. Sometimes I expect that this is the real reason to keep blocks small. Bigger blocks means you can more easily track transactions. 
Maybe it all starts to make sense now :O

It could be that companies would only jump in when an x-amount of capacity is readily available. Whether that is safely possible is another matter. So maybe 99% of those companies cannot fit, even if we hardfork to a reasonable new size (like 2Mb). 


Sure. And we need to discuss discounts on when transactions reduce the UTXO. 


Genuine needs cannot be inferred from transaction fees paid. Except if you belief high value transactions are more important somehow. But that sounds like the 1% talking. 


I bring you the entire history of Bitcoin as proof that this has always been the case, and still is. There are enough low-fee transactions which are ignored and never get added to blocks. 
No feigning needed. 


You mean like a hardfork? Or double spends? Or transaction censorship? 
Bitcoin works because socio-economic reasons. That's what it is build upon. 
Random people working together for the greater good. Trusting a majority of miners to do what is best for Bitcoin as a whole. 
I understand that the community is split by people who don't actually still belief this, and people who do. Also hinges on Bitcoin's price being influenced by its performance as a currency. 


A transaction which Bitcoin chokes on also cannot be relayed properly. A DOS doesn't automatically become a DDOS. And if a client uses too much resources, in whatever way, it should be killed or throttled. 
Ethereum has the upper hand here btw.

First I was called a troll for saying SegWit would take a very long time. That it would not be released in 6 months, which i said more than 6 months ago. I was clearly an idiot because the code was already ready in december, and because the code was much simpler than a hardfork blocksize limit increase. 
And I was a troll for saying you should not conflate two unrelated issues (SegWit and a limit increase), because you would have a conflated planning. As the perfect timing for an increase is unlikely exactly the same as when SegWit is deemed safe (code wise). 
And now I'm a troll for saying SegWit is taking too long. Which I honestly think is the case. 
If anything isn't trolling, it is voicing genuine concerns. If you don't agree, doesn't automatically make it trolling.

Do you realise that we could not even do a rollback of the MtGox hack even if we wanted to? Those hacks are not comparable at all. Would you like me to explain? 
Furthermore you are telling an entire market to do what is less profitable. How is that ever going to work? Wasn't the whole point of cryptocurrencies that they work because of incentives? 
As an outsider (who probably wants Ethereum to fail) you are saying - after Ethereum shot itself in the leg - to not tend to the wound. You probably did not value Ethereum, so you have no effect on the price. If you did, you are entirely free to sell ETH for ETHC.

Exactly. And you also see fees in BTC rise at the same time as Bitcoin's dollar price rose. Not 100% sure if these correlate but an increased price could result in more on-chain transactions, which increases competition for fast confirmations (and staying on-chain). 
Furthermore, you see people from the Core-camp continue to ask for median's, but you see this rise scary fast IMHO. 
It is interesting :)

@_date: 2016-07-06 12:49:04


And that's not what I said. Core dev's are perfectly capable of releasing a full-client. I'm talking architecture. 


This is exactly the mindset I was talking about. Thanks for the example
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:04:55


Except miners can't go higher at the moment ;). But you are right, blocksize is governed by market forces. 


I just said fees would go up/down very fast. Fees would go up to the maximum the last transaction which fits in a block is willing to pay to stay on. 
Fixed fees means less competition. Which in turn makes sure fees do not rise very fast. 
Just saying: be careful what you wish for. If everyone used dynamic fees, that would mean everyone wants to stay on-chain. 


Seems like Bitcoin has certain characteristics, and that is why people want to use it. This is more a "do you push your baby birds out of your nest to make them fly, or do you need to teach them to fly first". 
I actually don't have a clear answer to that. To force or not to force. Do we innovate to prevent problems, or do we need to feel the pain first? 
And why would it be ok to run into economic problems to prevent technical ones. And not ok to run into technical problems to prevent economical ones? 
If we can run into economic problems to speed up development of off-chain solutions, why wouldn't running into technical problems (which are also economic problems in the end) speed up development of better on-chain solutions? Like sharding, fraud-proofs, pruning.

Where are those zero-tx blocks again? Because I don't see them anymore, you? ;)
And head first solves block propagation issues completely. I would say it is a net-gain for Bitcoin. I really don't see the issue. 


No it isn't. Because there is a real cost associated with creating blocks which are too big. 
Ok, answer me this. Why are zero-fee transactions virtually impossible and do all miners run with a minimum relay fee, yet we aren't filling every block? I mean, there are enough low-fee transactions waiting to be added. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:00:29
If I do it correctly and look at fee/bytes I'm also going to do a weighted median. But I expect it would not result in a huge difference because most transactions are close to the average size.
 
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:37:47
Coins mined is not really a significant number of coins compared to what is traded every day. So the answer could be: never.

Actually you can. A sidechain can inflate more, it just means not everyone can go back on-chain with all coins.  ;)
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:34:16
1. Yes, until we hash the UTXO into ever block. But anyhow, we were talking disk storage. 
1. Well, a 2Mb block would make spam attacks less effective (or much more costly), so you would expect less, not more. As for low-fee txn, they don't fill blocks now, so why would they fill blocks at 2Mb? 
And I still like to see Bitcoin succeed, what is wrong with that?

@_date: 2016-07-04 14:45:11


That's unlikely. As blocksize limit != blocksize ;). On the other hand, Bitcoin being used ten times more should attract a lot of attention. Including all kinds of smart optimisations. We would finally put hash UTXO in blocks. And 1 terabyte seems like nothing, that's only 8 bluray movies.

You can put a hash of any data into the Bitcoin blockchain with just one transaction. And you can even hash multiple sets of data (from multiple businesses) into one hash, and share the cost amongst each other. 
But that is only needed for time-stamping and immutability. If you need to proof a consistent tamperproof record of events, then a blockchain could help. Put a hash in the most secure blockchain, and it becomes publicly verifiable.

@_date: 2016-07-04 19:04:44

@_date: 2016-07-01 14:41:27
Ok, i'll bite. 
1. Security is determined by whether you can validate transactions. Not whether you can act as a server. You have absolutely no need to store all transactions. The UTXO set should be enough in terms of storage. 
1. 2Mb blocks does not mean blocks will become 2Mb immediately. Average growth is likely to stay the same. The whole argument that if blocks can be bigger that they will be makes no sense, as blocks are still not completely full at the moment. We still have 1 or 2 months before we hit the limit permanently (with current mining policy). 
What would happen if you increased the blocksize-limit is improved confirmation times, and lower fees. Average blocksize would probably remain the same. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:58:13
I think means there is no volatility risk for the issuer.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:36:27
Of all the things which are not going to happen, that is near the top of the list. Conceptually it would be nice if it is possible. But markets are rational. Miners are. Everyone who has money at stake needs to be. But the mere possibility that a minority chain can become take over should have some pre-fork influence on miners. 
Also important, that this does not apply to Bitcoin. Because difficulty isn't adjusted so fast it a similar minority chain would not be viable. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:53:19


So we agree after all! 
But don't you think low fees also make transactions possible? How many transactions can you make at $0.20 until you pay more than running a full node? 


Yes, but only to the extent we already limited growth. And to the extent businesses have witness heavy software upgrades in the pipeline.  
If SegWit was released in April/June I would not have expected a huge increase in average blocksize. But if it is released in a few months, I would expect a fast rise in blocksize, which then quickly tapers off. 
Hard to say really. Someone might begin spamming Witness heavy transactions. Which would probably (and ironically) be interpreted by Core supporters as legitimate transactions. 
Also make no mistake about it. If blocks become 200 Kb larger, doesn't mean we gained 200Kb in capacity. Because it will be hard to know what size these transactions would have taken up before, as it is expected that transactions become more signature heavy.

Because I don't. If you favour a free market approach you promote consensus finding, voting, you make sure the cost of hardforking is as low as possible, you make sure you try hardforking with a non-contentious change, you do not bundle unrelated forks into one, you do not give random 5% of miners a veto on changes. All that goodness. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 11:00:14


Currently that would be the external cost of running a node, node decentralisation. There should be some kind of consensus what the max cost should be, and miners should take this into account lest the price of Bitcoin were to drop. 
That's how it should work if Bitcoin is valued for its utility, and not valued for its value ;).

But pushing people into off-chain solutions now isn't terribly smart when these solutions are not build on top of Bitcoin yet. It is a very risky gamble.

If fixed fees transactions do not occupy entire blocks a fee market should still work perfectly fine.

I don't think you understand the issue. Lots of channels collapsing at once amounts to big losses overall. Furthermore with fees being high on-chain, you would expect more LN to be used for more than microtransactions.

If I wanted to destroy Bitcoin, keeping the blocksize-limit would be the way to go. Divide and conquer. 
You stifle growth and you divide the entire community. Two birds with one stone. 
But better would be to get everyone to run a highly anticipated SoftFork which is exploitable, like with a buffer overflow which allows remote code execution. Then you might be able to destroy Bitcoin entirely. 
1. marry a highly anticipated feature with a big code change (blocksize limit + SegWit)
1. make sure it gets postponed and delayed until on-chain issues arrive
1. make sure no other (simpler) solution gains traction 
1. develop and test a virus which not only exploits SegWit, but also allows command &amp; control of miners/wallets
1. release SegWit fast as a fix for scalability issues, and say it is safe because it is just a Softfork
1. gather as many private keys as possible 
1. slowly sell more and more coins for alt's (never re-use an address, use different fees etc. ) 
1. slowly make more and more on-chain transactions with higher fees (make it look like Bitcoin is doing very well)
1. if the exploit is discovered and a patch is being made, steal all coins and afterwards brick as many exchanges/nodes/miners as possible
This makes the attacker untraceable because he never hits fiat exchanges. And this makes a roll-back impossible, because a lot of honest people bought BTC from the attacker already. Legitimate transactions are indistinguishable from the ones the attacker made. 
The success of this attack depends on people running full-nodes with funds attached. This means it might make sense to wait for Lightning to arrive.

@_date: 2016-07-10 17:23:43
Miners get Bitcoin, other people want Bitcoin, and buy them from Miners (which is already a transaction from one person to the other). And then it goes on from there. 
In the beginning Bitcoin had value because it was hard to make. It took you resources (computer time/energy/hardware) to create, that gave it a certain value. So price went up as more people started to mine. The price followed the cost of mining. 
Then Bitcoin became speculative and its value rose faster and the relationship was reversed. The more the price went up, the more people started mining.  The cost of mining followed the price of Bitcoin. 
Interesting, isn't it? ;)

No, I meant it is not healthy if there are forces which drive prices up. But not (enough) to drive them back down. 


Dynamic fee estimation is done by looking at transactions, and transactions determine fees by looking at dynamic fee estimations. It's like turning up the volume when you have a microphone connected. 
But if enough transactions use dynamic fees to get slower service (not 1st block confirmation) then it might not be so bad. 
And I think that is what you are saying. People/services should use dynamic fees to get low-end fees. 


No. ;)
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:21:26


Yes, but only with my economic weight. I'm in favour of letting the market decide. Saying I want Classic, doesn't mean I want it at any cost. Although technically Classic would be fine. It's more a political problem than anything else. 


I'm still in the green. But that is not hard when you buy so low, and it also helped that I converted everything to DAO tokens (which was also very low). Although I expect more resolution by now :P.

In pretty sure the 5% Classic has doesn't consist 100% of people who would also like to block SegWit. 
I asked the same question [here]( btw.
And I'm a supporter of Classic, but I also support SegWit. I'd say it's very stupid to block a blocksize-limit increase (in whatever form) if that is what you wanted all along. And if you block it, and something goes wrong, you would also make sure people can blame you. 
I will do my best to make sure SegWit gets activated ASAP.

@_date: 2016-07-06 20:11:58
Aren't we conflating full nodes and full clients. I use the term full node to indicate someone who is able to verify all transactions, and thereby enjoying full-on security. 
Furthermore, while the system is still in "subsidy-mode", it would make less sense to make Bitcoin already rely on fees alone. It makes even less sense if an off-chain system is around the corner which would alleviate congestion problems (and reduce fees). But we have been over this a 100 times already. 
What we haven't talked about a lot is actual economics, which I'm probably not even that good at. But it needs to be addressed more.

Oh sorry, I thought we were in another thread which was about the hash rate not going down. I confused myself. Never mind. Going back on topic:
I believe the market has decided to stick with Core, sure. Whether I call it a free market is another thing. I believe (and I might be wrong in terms of definitions) that a free market is free from any centralised entities using undue pressure on the market to sway it left/right. 
Although without FUD, censorship, attacks, threats, we might end up at the same place we are now. But hard to know that for certain. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 12:06:27
Upvote for visibility, but I wholeheartedly disagree with you. 


If you try to sell something and make as much money as possible then this is exactly the question you would be asking yourself. The fact that you ask this questions says a lot about you. 
How much do you think a certificate is worth to enable secure client/server communication for your webserver? Well, a lot of companies have an answer to this question. Just google and you find that it costs upwards to $100 per year. And in many cases even more. Because people pay whatever it is worth for them. That's why enterprises pay more for basically the same service time and time again. 
We are not starting a revolution here to try and monetize something as much as possible and introduce as much friction as we can. No we want social and political change. Therefor, you make something like  because you are not after money. 
Cheap or free isn't the goal, it is a means to an end. And if you don't get that I'll upvote you anyway, because this is an important topic, and it seems there are a lot more of you, then there are of us. Let's see if this can be freely discussed in or whether I'm moderated and silently deleted (or even banned) again. 
So to answer your question what it is worth to me? Priceless!!! Bitcoin as a whole is priceless, and therefor a transaction should also be (nearly) priceless.


The problem with this line of thinking is that you are literally saying that people should leave. You completely dismiss metcalfe's law. And frankly, you completely miss the point. 
There is tremendous value if everyone uses Bitcoin in the same way. Pushing people into centralised solutions which diminish Bitcoins value is lunacy. And you have to think up is down and down is up to believe such a thing. You are trying to turn a bug into a feature. Well, if you keep saying something it doesn't suddenly become true. 
If you want Bitcoin to grow, (you want to spread a more secure currency) then network effect is very important. You would make sure you do not create unnecessary roadblocks, and you make sure people can transition seamlessly into level 2 solutions (if necessary). 


Amen to that. But that also clearly means: no arbitrary limitations. 


Tell me how Bitcoin can do things any other currency cannot do? 


Like I said, i'm hungry for social and political change. I'm hungry for more secure money, which makes everything and everyone more secure. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 09:49:11
Bitcoin was never perfectly secure. If you can see how you gain more and more security as you gain confirmations, you will also understand that this works backwards in time. 
You don't have to validate all transactions all the way back to the genesis block, just like you don't have to wait years worth of confirmations to accept a transaction. 
If you lock your bike, you know two locks is better than one, and three locks is even better. Yet you still use only one lock. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:45:10
Yes I'm aware of that sentence in the agreement. How exactly does signalling a few Classic blocks go against running Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems. Does Core software not accept these blocks? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 09:44:54
I get your point. Fixed fees means transactions mindlessly getting in line to get confirmed. My point was that these transactions would also mindlessly drop off the chain. Which would result in less competition. 
I'm concluding (maybe wrongfully) that transactions with dynamic fees are more eager to stay on board. Just Fingerspitzengefühl.


That captures my fears about Bitcoin pretty well. Power play and politics, instead of honestly trying to find real consensus. More dirty tactics equals more power play. 
And is it ever good to do wrong things for the right reason? Can you fight a war to make peace? 
For Bitcoin the road to peace is a Hardfork. 


The reason not to upgrade to 2Mb are not technical. They are all about economics and perception (psychology). Who needs to be able to run a full node, can nodes upgrade in time etc. There are no open questions whether Bitcoin can handle 2Mb blocks, because it most definitely can. And it doesn't need SegWit to do so. Although scaling is improved with SegWit.
Thanks to SegWit we still don't have a limit-increase, and won't have one for months.  


What is possible and what is economical are two different things. Currently these things are conflated. A limit might be necessary to prevent DOS attacks. Other that that the market should reach consensus on the best sizes/fees etc. 


I think you misunderstood Roger. He's just in favour of making Bitcoin as valuable as possible. If that includes turning it into Paypay2, that would be a wonderful problem to have. It is a champagne problem. And you can bet that people won't give up without a fight to continue to be able to validate all transactions. (arguable paypal isn't even so big that this would be a problem). Fraud proofs for the win :). 
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:52:11
In E's case would you go from multiple implementations to 1? From something with a specification, to something without? I'm also very certain the reason why E wasn't integrated into Bitcoin in the first place still holds true today. 
Pretty sure people keep saying Bitcoin can copy any feature from alt-coins, yet this seems to never actually materialise in a significant way. Any alt-coin can say the same thing, and it would also be technically true, yet still not realistic. 


Not a chance. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:07:54
That's fine. We are still friends right? 
Didn't we almost make a bet? Isn't it possible that you would have won? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:12:12
You don't say! More value indeed gives Bitcoin more utility. But that should not be a runaway process which removes Bitcoin from the hands of those who need it the most. 
You can't argue that we need to keep blocksizes small to keep it accessible for everyone, yet blow it up value-wise with huge fees so that it doesn't remain accessible to everyone. 
For me, that doesn't make sense. There has to be a blocksize-limit which is more ideally suited for this moment in time. And this size is probably higher. Else you would see people take up arms to have miners lower their soft-limits, yet what you see is people left and right arguing for miners to fully utilize the limit. 
If there was ever proof we have consensus on a bigger-blocksize limit it is that. 
Add 100Kb to the limit and fees and confirmation times would be significantly lower, yet average blocksize would probably remain the same. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:45:07
So, are you going to make a new picture? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:36:15
We wanted higher limits, not higher sizes. Stop conflating blocksize with a blocksize-limit. 20Mb, 8Mb, 4Mb it would have all been perfectly fine. 
To this day we see proof that blocksize-limit != blocksize. As blocks are still not completely full. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 10:50:49
Just a heads up. If you buy ETC with Bitcoin you are still giving money to the Ethereum ecosystem. Because mostly people who hold Ethereum hold an equal amount of Ethereum Classic. And most of these people support the HF. Meaning they will buy more Ethereum with the Bitcoin you gave them. 
After this blows over, Ethereum will gain in value and Ethereum Classic will go to near zero again. This "attack" isn't going to last. And all you are doing is making Ethereum richer in the process.  
@_date: 2016-07-04 10:51:24
You make sure you don't set limits too high, that's the whole point of a limit. But I don't think orphan risks are the main reason to set an orphan limit. That would probably be the cost of running a full-node. 
Furthermore I believe you should use fees to keep blocks a reasonable size. Not the other way around. To make the network more reliable, prevent  BlockPriority etc.

Why does everything need to be in memory? It's very easy to cache only the information in memory which need. No need to store spend transactions with more than say 1000 confirmations. That would eliminate 90% of all data right there (probably even more). 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:00:55
But what is exactly the problem? Transactions are already sent instantaneous to all nodes, and no need to wait for confirmations for small transactions. And for big transactions the advice of waiting for 1 hour of confirmation/processing time would still stand. 
Its the same reason Litecoin is not necessary. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to be a catchall for all use cases.

That's not a good analogy because Bitcoin is a protocol. Nothing prevents someone to compete within the space of that protocol. 
Most social networks are currently centralised, they DON'T share a common protocol. So within the social network there is no competition. 
In the social-network space its in our best interest if an underlying protocol became most popular. Like we now have with bitcoin.

Its a system so that businesses (bitcoin exchanges mostly) can follow the laws already in place for Anti money laundry and Know your customer policies in the US. 
So its (probably) not for (small) businesses who sell stuff for bitcoin. Its not for miners. And its not for consumers. 
It will make sure its very easy for law enforcement to get to the person behind certain bitcoin transactions, because all exchanges would work with the same structures/systems.
So the laws currently in place make it almost impossible to buy bitcoins in the US. This could change that. Which means more money will flow into bitcoin (legitimately), which is good for the entire bitcoin ecosystem. 
So if you want to complain, then complain about the law. Not coinvalidation. And nothing really changes, because these laws are already being implemented. Just in a different way.
As far as I can tell this is NOT about shops only acceptiong white-listed coins/adresses. But this coinvalidation thing can be a slippery slope in that direction.
Currently it seams like you can still launder your money within the bitcoin system. And white/black coins would still be worth the same. 
TL;DR: Coinvalidation wants to be the standard implementation of US money laundering laws regarding bitcoin. But its a slippery which can cause white coins to become more valuable than black coins.

Of course the fast-one-swipe should only be done in a relatively safe environment. And for amounts which are trivial. An attack should be economically unattractive. Also because a user can decide to do a one-swipe or two-swipe transaction. An attacker doesn't even know if a transaction gets authorized automatically (in one swipe) or two. So he could be discovered without making any profit. 
But maybe a one swipe system is never a good thing. But convenience/speed is worth something i guess, and worth some risk...

Well if the Chinese jumping on Bitcoin made the price go from 130$ to 1100$ then its possible we now see the price go back to 130$. 
Most likely the price drops to somewhere above 200$. Because not all bitcoin newbies (from the last 2 months) will dump their bitcoins, some of them will stay for the long run.

And all miners would agree that the total health of bitcoin is more important than a few mined blocks. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:12:15
Do we see more (sophisticated) miners because of the value increase of Bitcoins? Or does the value of bitcoins increase because there are so many miners?
Isn't the value completely determined by supply and demand? And the supply of bitcoins is not tied to the nr of miners. So the value of bitcoins would not be affected. 
The reason bitcoins went up was after the supply ran out, which was some time after the first halving of the block reward. 
Another reason why the price would go up is when demand goes up. New bitcoin services are the best way to create more demand.

Why don't you use a one-way function which takes all the bets (addresses + amount + timestamp) as input, and use THAT to determine the winner(s). That way its verifiable (and crazy).

If you need to buy bitcoins just before you want to use them you are doing it wrong, the basic idea is that you have bitcoins already and then decide what and when to do something with it. 
Best thing would be if you can earn bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:16:35
Exactly, you could interpret the patterns which you see. So if ALL transactions seem to end up at one address you could tally all incoming transactions and say that that's the total bitcoin sales. But you might be totally wrong. It could be less, it could be more. You could be looking at multiple businesses, you could be looking at just at regional transactions which are pooled. Anything is possible.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:01:33
Bitcoin does not need to completely replace any currency to become succesful. Bitcoins succes does not depend on demise of any other currency. And such a big value is completely unnecessary. If you want to transfer value then you only need to go in and out of bitcoin very fast. You don't need to store ALL your money in bitcoins. Actually if you can transfer money faster with bitcoins you actually need less.

You need a thorough lack of knowledge to actually claim any altcoin is faster OR more secure. All altcoins combined don't come close to the same processing power. That's what makes it secure.

There seems to be this entitlement from miners that they should earn a certain amount of value for their services. Based solely on the current payout per block (and value). But does anyone consider that the current hash rate is WAY higher than necessary?

What a retarded article. Somehow bitcoins should exhibit the EXACT qualities, functions and popularity of a normal (dollar) bill (and right NOW). And for the convienience of his point of view validating a transaction is SUPER hard, but tracking someones transaction history is SUPER easy. Really? You can't have it both ways. 
This is like comparing a car to a horse and complaining that you need to start the car first to use it. It's a completely different thing. 
He should compare the bitcoin network with the entire banking system. 
Comparing the usability of a bank-note with bitcoin is like comparing the linux kernel with an iPhone. 
And bitcoin is still in its infancy. It doesn't have to perfectly apeal to Karl Denninger. But let him try to send money from one remote place in the world (where international banking/paypal isn't availble) to another place in the world.

1) Do we need to do everything just because its possible? Does that say anything about LTC? 
2) Scrypt was build to prevent GPU miners(!). But actually it's just a generation behind BTC, just because its less popular. How is that a good thing?
3) LTC is not so popular, but a lot of things are not popular. Does not mean it will grow. Gow is that an argument for anything?
4) You trade LTC with Bitcoin because LTC is less popular. 
5) Well I agree that most people are a bit limited in their perception of numbers. But I think the complexity of bitcoins (including decimals) will be hidden in future services and systems on top of bitcoin.  
6) LTC is Bitcoin + Scrypt + Changed parameters. Its just as much build on top of the original Bitcoin source as Bitcoin itself (in its current form).
7) 1 hour confirmation time is the same regardless of the number of blocks within the hour. LTC is not magically faster just because the confirmation time is smaller (which is just a parameter in the bitcoin code). 
TL;DR: LTC is less popular than Bitcoin, and that's somehow a good thing.

Here in the Netherlands i pay 1 euro transaction fees to pay for pizza (on 20 euro thats 5%!), and then I have to use my mobile (then its 5 clicks) or the computer (then its 7 clicks + digipass challenge response).
Bitcoin is no transaction fees + one qr code (then 2 clicks).
So Bitcoin wins easily. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:17:04
His best point is the price fluctuations. But considering I can now buy 20 euro in bitcoin, buy a pizza with 20 euro and even the seller of said pizza gets 20 euro. I'd say that problem is already solved (by the services surrounding bitcoin). 
That doesn't mean holding bitcoin is a problem. That's like investing. Many bitcoin services are build with the money that's being put into the bitcoin economy. So actually that works out perfectly.

In normal operation you will at most get 2 orphan blocks, 6 would be highly suspicious. And it would be highly obvious which transaction is left out. Ánd which transaction is the fraudulent one. 
 
The best solution (as i see it) would be to reject blocks which omit any transaction which already had 6 confirmations or more. Or maybe just sound an alarm, and make sure you can add a suspicious transaction to a blocklist or something. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:57:49
Just because Dollars retain their value party by force, doesn't mean its needed for a currency to have/retain its value. Comparing bitcoin with Gold is therefore much better. Gold has so much value mostly because people believe it has value. Same goes with bitcoin.

Well you would have to trust the developer not to put in a back door with any connected device. Even while scanning qrcodes back and forth it's possible to activate a back door. 
Ultimately everyone uses precompiled binaries, so open source isn't magically more secure. It just the impression of being more secure. 
With an iPhone you only need to trust the app developer, and that your iPhone can't be silently owned by someone. But I would think that would be big news, so you have enough time to stop feeding your offline wallet to your iPhone. And there are probably bigger fish which would get hacked first. 
I would create an iPhone app which 1) can scan a transaction (which you want to perform, and which you already signed once), 2) scan your offline key, 3) sign the transaction, 4) erase the key from memory and 5) send the transaction to the network (or return a qrcode?).

I could not find any info on a range for which you could do a man in the middle attack. Just reading it would not be enough to steal bitcoins. 
Still the NFC protocol should assume a man in the middle attack is possible. And a user should be able to check the amount/address before he authorizes the transaction.

That makes it seem like controlling the most computing power gives you the ability to do anything you want. But in reality you still can't spend someone else's coins. 
And if you have most computing power, you automatically have a stake in bitcoin. So doing a double spend would hurt you more than you can profit from being honest.

Yeah, but it might favour centralisation (as i understand from the bitcointalk discussion) which in turn decreases the security. 
And I really don't understand how adding orphan blocks (redundant blocks) to the blockchain is going to help in reducing bandwidth and increase the speed. Seems like he is simply increasing the confirmation time (fastcoin style) and suggesting a 'solution' for the multitude of extra orphans which are created.
But I might not fully understand his solution.

Smaller also means more chance of collisions and thus forks. Its build to create a good consensus about what is the longest chain. And it needs to account for slow connections. Bitcoin wants to reach the smallest outreaches of the earth. It should even work when an entire country is connected through a dialup line with the rest of the world. That's the goal.
Other services on top of bitcoin can provide faster confirmation times (like with green adresses).

Yeah but how does the thin client know the real current network difficulty? 
Any fake network could have its own blockchain with all transactions in it except with a different difficulty. The thin client itself can't decide if thats wrong. 
It could show you the difficulty, then you can decide if its save....
EDIT: What the thin client needs is some sort of list of nodes which you were previously connected to, and you should be able to verify that they are still the same nodes when you connect to them via an untrusted network.  I dont know if thats already in the protocol. 
But if you recently connected to a trusted network, the software actually knows the current difficulty. So i guess the threat is minimal.

And mining does not have to be profitable. There are enough bitcoin stakeholders who would secure the network for free (or even at a loss). 
The only relevant question is: Is the Bitcoin network secure or not? If its not, and Scrypt would help then that could be incorporated into the protocol. You could even make a hybrid model. Where both hashing algorithms have their own difficulty (based on 20 minutes between blocks per algorithm).
Currently Scrypt makes GPU miners happy. But crypto currencies don't exist only to make miners with certain hardware happy. It should add value for end-users. So where is the benefit for average Joe?

Well, i guess you need to perform two bitcoin transactions from the same address from an android device. But who does that? 
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:10:24
If you are rational as a miner you won't fuck up the system like that. If people find out its bad news for the value of bitcoin.

Even if the code fails to check for certain invalid transactions they would still be visible in the blockchain. And those transactions can be invalidated in a new version of the bitcoin software. 
The worst that could happen is a hard fork. Old software which accepts the invalid transactions, and new software which does not. You would need for the new software to out-mine the old software. So given a quick response, nothing really bad would happen.

A web application can do everything a native wallet needs to do (secure wallet storage, qr-code reading, client side signing). 
You just can't create direct sockets. And you need a trustworthy web-host. But that's workable. 
And although there is a chance Apple rejects Bitcoin applications based to serve its own payment agenda, I firmly believe that there are enough other valid reasons to block Bitcoin apps for now. 
I'm a big bitcoin enthusiast, and a big fan of apple. But its already easy to send bitcoins from my iPhone, so why would I ever complain to apple?
@_date: 2013-08-31 08:00:54
No they could not add just any fraudulent transaction to the blocks. No one would accept them.
They could only remove certain transactions, but that would hurt them more than any profit they could make with such a double spend.

So in the USA you don't have an instantaneous and easy electronic payment system without charge-backs? Would be nice if you could buy bitcoins with bitcoins :P 
@_date: 2013-03-14 14:16:32
Even if the blockchain is only avaible on two computers it would still be decentralized. So yes, bitcoin is and always will be decentralized. And that will always make it easier to scale than any centralized system (like visa/paypal). 
It's not necessary anymore for every client to hold the entire blockchain, just like it's not necessary anymore that every client mines. Given enough miners, there is less need for every client to have the entire blockchain. 
Hope that answers your question. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:34:09
Just like they did with its older brother Bittorrent!
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:40:54
yes there are alerts: 
And the chance that an actual fork will happen is pretty small. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:22:00
The funny thing is, that the harder it is to buy bitcoins, the more value bitcoin has over other payments systems in your country. 
Here in the netherlands i can already do instantaneous transactions without chargebacks. And that actually makes buying bitcoins very easy and fast.

I've build qt apps, you don't actually need to use any native api's to build a qt-app. Like java it abstracts away the entire native OS. 
A qt app runs natively on a processor, not natively on the OS.

No I don't really think so. It has its learning curve, but its not technical. Many banking systems are actually harder.

A proof of stake algorithm can secure the network with far less resources. But what would new coins be worth when its easy to create them?
@_date: 2013-07-12 09:44:36
That;s why it's nice that/if the bubble pops: lots of cheap mining hardware on the market.
And one party never needs/wants a lot of mining power, because that would not do him/her any good. The need for more mining power comes from the distribution of mining power. Because no one is going to compete only with himself.
Competition is what will make Bitcoin succeed.

Less miners for an altcoin is less security. And there is no centralization going on in bitcoin. Even if there are only two miners its still distributed. 
Its funny, because even though bitcoin doesn't use proof of stake. Big miners still automatically heavily invested in bitcoin that partaking in a 49% attack would hurt them more than they could ever profit from it. THAT is the briljant security model of bitcoin. 
And even if they are to big that would be a risk for their own profits. That too creates a nice equilibrium.

Exactly, the blockchain isn't ever going to check something like that. But a third party, which is completely automated could do it using the Bitcoin network.

Multiple people all put exactly 1 bitcoin in a shared pool. And when someone wants to spend their bitcoin they grab a completely different coin from the pool. But that transaction is only valid when you provide anonymous proof that you also put 1 bitcoin in the pool, and did not already take 1 out already.
This of course also works with other denominations (like 10 BTC, 100 BTC or 0.1 BTC etc.)
@_date: 2013-01-07 20:11:45

"No altcoin can succeed". Thát is the point of the article. They are neglible and anoying but they can't overtake bitcoin. 
Bitcoin might be slow to adopt changes, but if any altcoin truly becomes popular because of a certain feature then they will adopt it.

Since when is litecoin faster? You do understand that even if the hashrate would be the same that one hour of processing power (6 confirmations) is the same as one hour on litecoin (24 confirmations)? 
And since when is a more memory intensive hashing algorithm an improvement? GPU mining on litecoin is already faster than CPU mining. 
Litecoin is always a step behind Bitcoin, and Litecoin enthusiast are trying to sell thát as something positive. It is not. 
 
@_date: 2013-01-06 12:16:39
So you think there will ever be mandatory (or practically mandatory) transaction fee? And that they will be huge? So, in essence, you are saying the miners could hold the entire bitcoin market ransom? Wouldn't that actually be very detrimental to the value of bitcoins? So, woulnd't that kill your own mining business?
 
And from the paper: 


incentive to keep the knowledge of any transaction that offers a fee to itself, as any
other node that becomes aware of the transaction will compete to authorize ﬁrst and
claim the associated fee" 
The funny thing is, this paper acts like this is a technical problem. Buts its actually more a social dilemma. Bitcoin (I think rightfully so) assumes that the majority (of computational power) is good.  And thus that majority wants to act in the best interests of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. 
I actually think transaction fees will approach zero, and that they only need to be high enough to prevent an attack to be more profitable than playing nice. Miners are even encouraged to include transactions with no fees because it's in their best interests that the bitcoin network thrives. Especially making sure new people join the economy, because THAT makes bitcoins even more sparse (and thus more valuable).
And have you ever considered that the current Hash rate might be WAY higher than necessary?
@_date: 2013-05-13 12:06:33
I like this part:


Who ever claimed that bitcoin is more than that? How bad is volatility if no one forces you to hold bitcoins, or forces you to set prices in bitcoins, or forces you to deal with bitcoins in contracts etc.

It's not the ignorance on the subject of Bitcoin which scares me. Its the ignorance of the fact that 'normal' ways of transferring cost money for the seller. And maybe that's even worse than all the people who think the current levels of inflation are normal.

You are the hero bitcoin needs, but not the one it deserves.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:01:03
You need some kind of automated escrow service. The agent (as you call it) should NEVER have access to the bitcoins. It only has access to a shared key. You just send it your part of the transaction, and the agent adds his signature also. And the agent's only task is to prevent double spends on the money. 
But going further, i would even make sure you have 5 completely separate agents, and for a transaction to succeed you only need your own key plus 3 of the agents (for added security + fallback). 
And just create it as a service. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 14:17:13

The most significant halving of the block reward has already happend, and i didn't see the Hash-rate drop in half. And the block reward is never suddenly going to disappear. 
Lets call it what it is: a concern. Something to keep our eyes on. But I would bet that this won't ever be a problem. Certainly none which needs any major change in the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:14:13
But $12 dollar is not 0$. That's still not worthless. And Bitcoin would technically continue to work at 12$ as well as it did when it was 1200$. Even if 99% people left the Bitcoin economy. 
The interesting question is: what % of people invested in Bitcoin did so purely speculatively? How many would jump ship given a big enough drop in price?
My point is, that % is never 100%. 
@_date: 2013-02-03 15:37:30
Wouldn't it be better to have paper wallets with an expiry date on them? Because else your bitcoins would go up into nothingness if the paper wallet is destroyed.

The article doesn't say anything about why the exchange rate doesn't matter. It explicitly even says that it doesn't say anything about that. So why is it in the title?
