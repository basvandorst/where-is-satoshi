Well said. While bitcoin has become *sort of* the gold-equivalent of the internet, dogecoin might just become the "community coin".
Respect those before you, but strive to do more!

It kind of had a head start of about 5 years.
All jokes aside, why do bitcoin people always have to bash on other cryptos? We over at respect bitcoin for what it did, which is laying the groundwork for cryptos after all.

From someone that doesn't suffer from it, but has a lot of experience with depression and the people affected by it, this was beautiful.
Thank you!

Or, as some over at are predicting, bitcoin already is somewhat of the Crypto-gold equivalent, while Doge might just become the internets' everyday-currency.

So was paper money. How dare we copycats in the western world steal that invention and slap silly pictures of buildings, or in the case of the USA, silly pictures of our historical celebrities, on it.
We should all pay our respect to the chinese for improving face-to-face financial interaction!
