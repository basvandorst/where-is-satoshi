I must be doing something wrong. I’ve had mine running for about two months now. I’m only at 1GB uploaded.

But fuck them.

Locked up for what?

Ledgened has it.

Had the same issue with Coinbase and my bank. Bank thought it was fraudulent. I was able to do the transaction while on the phone with them.

Where and what

I had mine running for a little while, took FOREVERRRRR to download for some reason. I have decent internet, 25/5. I haven't ran core in about a month and could not believe how long it is taking to sync, been running for four days now with only 97% sync'd. 
I'm downloading the torrent now to help speed things up. I only had one peer connection through core for some reason.

Mine took forever with 25Mb. I downloaded the Blockchain torrent and then downloaded the daily update. It got me to about 95%. Took 3 days after that to sync. Not sure why it takes so long to download.

Mine was too before my first payment was due. Can't wait until they sell it; hate giving big banks money.

US bank did that when I had an account with them back in 2006-2010. I was not very good at money management so I got hit with many over drafts. Most of them were for purchases under $10. 
I'm not sure on the legality of it but it's very shady business.

That was my problem since Coinbase is overseas. Kept flagging it. Spoke with fraud department twice. They opened a window for 72 hours but even then it took about two days for it to go through.
