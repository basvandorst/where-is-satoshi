a simple—although incorrect—explanation that I like to use is to say that SegWit “compresses” transactions.
EDIT: As I said, I know this is incorrect and it is not an explanation in terms of the technical aspect of SegWit.

sorry lol, I tried

Thank you! But I disagree on some stuff. i’m anti-BCash all the way but people are making it sound like Satoshi wouldn’t support big blocks. This just isn’t true. While Satoshi created Bitcoin, he wasn’t perfect.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:45:24
not a place to make a joke man.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:40:29
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:15:20
so if every block was hypothetically at full capacity to store the entire blockchain it would take over half a terabyte right now. this is why a blocksize increase is not the best solution.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:47:46
I really hope that before proposing to someone you’ve at least discussed it. asking someone to spend the rest of their lives with you is no small event.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:59:48
exactly my point. bitcoin isn’t supposed to be an “investment” so much as a legitimate currency.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:49:44
I'll might try it. I was thinking $5?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:44:54

thanks for the offer but i ended up figuring it out. it's the same price on origin and gamestop, so i bought a gamestop gift card from egifter with BTC and then purchased the game there

80% of those can be put under “scaling”

How...? Just put your public address and say "send 0.0067 BTC here". You can monitor how much an address has received for free pretty easy to verify whether or not you've been paid with a lot of websites, shouldn't be that hard to write a script to monitor such a thing.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:19:57
EDIT: Why am I the one getting downvoted here? To be honest, his claim is ridiculous. I am a lurker on this sub 99% of the time, how does he understand my knowledge of bitcoin?

dude you’re just proving my point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:22:28
my guess is a correction to around ~$5200 and then a spike to $10,000 at the end of the year.

how do we go about sending $162,000 to Kraken. I doubt you can do this just by making a normal account
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:27:21
I would, but when searching i’m having trouble finding any due to reddit’s terrible search function. I posted one that recently made fp on the sub, but I don’t think it’s the best example given there’s no real evidence it was unfair. if I find any more i’ll show.

actually no. the average person has no use for gas outside of cars, except the occasional exception. GPUs have a lot of use outside of mining.

@_date: 2017-09-01 13:10:52
Exactly this. So what the fee is $0.02? It's still ~6% of the transaction
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:02:22
I really like the app but a couple of suggestions. I’d rlly like a light mode and the icon could probably be a lot better. Also I think the price is a bit steep just to set price alerts. Also the chat section is constantly saying that I have unread messages and it’s kind of annoying me.

i once saw a quote that goes something like:
“Look around you and realize how many people are idiots. Now realize that half of them are even bigger idiots than you think.”
I probably butchered it, but you get the idea. A true democracy is nearly never a good idea, and luckily, it’s not how BIPs work, as many people have explained below.

I’m sorry, this is a super far stretch. This doesn’t really make sense. The government honestly doesn’t care about bitcoin. It’d be more believable (although still unlikely) to say that they just wanted any kind of money.

Basically Mr. Lawsky had the audacity to impose a bunch of regulations on companies related to bitcoin that required them to get a special bitcoin license in NY called the “bitlicense”. At the time NY was probably the biggest place of innovation and growth for bitcoin in the world. Lawsky’s new “bitlicense” literally destroyed that and required so called “bitcoin companies” to get this license to be able to do business in NY. Then he quit governnent and started a consulting business just to help people obtain this bitlicense. he’s over all a really crappy and shady dude who just used his power to make some money. Of course he doesn’t get in trouble for this. Anyways, now-a-days most exchanges don’t accept users from New York because of Lawsky and the crap he pulled. There’s an extremely good documentary about this on Netflix about Bitcoin (although half of it is about this exact topic). It is *extremely* interesting, but it leaves off during late 2016. it’s very well done and I highly reccomend that people watch it. The name of the documentary is “Banking on Bitcoin”.
