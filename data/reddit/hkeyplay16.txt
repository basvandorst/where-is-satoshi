I was making an analogy between owning bitcoin and owning stock in a company which makes a lot of money just processing payments.  Everyone who takes part in the new bitcoin economy shares in the added value that this peer network provides.  Miners generate coin rewards, but also process transactions.  Anyone holding bitcoin as an investment is reducing supply, which helps to keep the price high. Anyone buying or selling with bitcoin is saving money on transaction fees.  Bitcoin is a valuable technology.  To say it is not is like saying the internet is worthless just because you can't hold it in your hand.
Did that clarify my comment or just raise more questions?

I would like to see a system by which the coin blockchain is used to give access to an encrypted file.  If you track the 'spend' of the coin you track the use of the file.  I haven't fully considered the architecture of this type of use, but i'm imagining a system in which the wallet is modified to be a viewer of some media or file.  that file doesn't necessarily have to be stored in the blockchain, but maybe it can only be accessed if the user has acquired a coin from a specific address...and the network has verified that the coin has been received.  This might require a whole new, yet to be imagined infrastructure in addition to the blockchain/mesh network of users.  
Does anyone else have any thoughts on how this might be implemented?

I don't see how taxation would "doom" bitcoin.  Suppose bitcoin is trading at $1000 for simplicity, and the government does decide to tax it as any other possession (which is speculation..we do not know how this will work at this time).  It does not make one bit of difference (with respect to taxes) whether you mine one bitcoin and cash out, or earn $1000 at your job if tax is being taken from your earnings.  This point takes NOTHING away from the benefit of cheaper transactions vs fiat currency.  If BTC is not taxed then it obviously has a huge advantage.  If it is taxed as everyone expects it will be, then this element becomes a wash between fiat and bitcoin and advantage still goes to bitcoin for cheap transactions.  Obviously there are other pros and cons for both, but taxation should have nothing to do with this argument.

Lets say that Bitcoin displaces services like VISA and Mastercard.  At time of writing, VISA has a market cap of about  $143,000,000,000.  Mastercard has a market cap of about $92,000,000,000. These companies get most of their earnings from processing fees they charge businesses.  Those fees are passed onto the consumer.  Now imagine that you have a business and have a choice of accepting either Bitcoin or VISA.  Bitcoin essentially has a small, flat transaction fee.  VISA has a 2-4% fee.  Which one is better for your bottom line?
With Bitcoin, every participant is a shareholder and reaps rewards from its use.  The barrier to entry is low.  Why not own a piece of the new VISA or Mastercard?
