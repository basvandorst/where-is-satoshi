Nearly every single state in the U.S. has laws that mandate companies to notify customers in case of a security breach.  Bitfinex is in direct violation of the law, and their hair cut + junk debt token is likely illegal as well.  They are putting all of their customers at risk to identity theft by not notifying them of this.  Extremely negligent, borderline criminal company.
I would report them to your state's attorney general and get a proper audit and investigation going.

All of those things remain true and bitcoin has still failed to achieve any sort of adoption.  So despite gloating, you've yet to be proven right.

The best comment in this thread is literally saying "I can't wait for a global financial collapse".
LOL but  bitcoin is NOT a doomsday cult.  Mass adoption any day now!

Don't worry, all networks have a breaking point.  For instance, Visa's breaking point is 63,000 per second.

The fact that you think Paypal had bitcoin in mind when making this video only goes to show how delusional you are.

Scams are prevalent in bitcoin because you guys readily fall for them, not because you are ultra intelligent individuals.

And Mark Karpeles is sitting in prison right now because no theft took place, right?
