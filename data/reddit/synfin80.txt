Drops to $775 two weeks later... And moons to $1290 by March. Buy the dip.

Yeah, fuck coinbase for giving all of their customers access to the BCH they rightfully own.

That makes sense. I couldn't figure out why the low fees were clearing while the overall fee amount was going up.

What I'm talking about is the URL to the website that is put in the public comment of the transaction. If the URL had a unique tracking ID per each address they send a transaction to, they would be able to track which computers accessed which address blocks. It wouldn't be perfect since this is a public ledger, but the first person to go to the posted URL in the comment is most likely the owner of the address the transaction was sent to.

Please keep in mind his company would like to be the FDIC of bitcoin.

Not sure I understand. With a credit card, merchants get an authorization response in less than a second confirming they will receive payment. They usually then settle the funds over night.

This same method could definitely be used to identify individual address holders based on device fingerprinting/geolocation if a unique code was used on the URL on each address. This one is spam though.

what merger?

How do the declarations requirements work for something like this. Have any governments made a statement?

If it would result in a 3D view of the blockchain and bitcoin mining, I might be ok with that ;/

With mtgox going down at the same time as the release of this statement,  was this a coordinated effort with mtgox?

You are correct, 2013, can't believe it was that long ago. Wish I could go back and buy more coin.

Auction, as has been done with other large sales.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:14:17
More of a closed auction that will not have as large an impact on the overall price. Similar to FBI auction of silk road. Putting a large volume of coins up in a market order does not give the market time to compensate for the unexpected increased supply.
