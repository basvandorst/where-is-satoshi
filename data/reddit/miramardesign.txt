i was deported to south america, but i still have to pay taxes to the hellhole, and it would COST me several thousand DOLLARS to renounce  my citizenship and i would lose my social security and never  be able to visit my family. (ok thats a + but  i digress)
so lets see, people from across the sea can come and get benefits but if  i leave i have to pay.  just like marriage/ divorce  in the usa, you can get in cheap but getting out  if you have any skills or capital is an issue. 
umm like i said its not  just employment its housing thats getting fucked by the combination of the  boomers sitting on it  plus inflation.  
i am employable made over  100k last year, many us graduates are not and I feel for them.. if the  american dream is over then whats left of it should be enjoyed by those who have little options to go elsewhere. At least until  things improve.    The diversity cult has seemed to make interviewing with a woman a waste of time. I had them call me for a screening w/ a literal attitude that they had to waste their time talking with a white man.   Of course with this bullshit imma start voting againsts leftism.  "Diversity" was taken to its extreme.  "Lets shit on the people who make our way of life possible"  yah that wont backfire. 
Tech companies have become so politicized w/ the women in tech. however they mostly are more than 50% minorities which are imported, so they complain theres not enough women, yet they are actively encouraging majority indian males to immigrate and fill roles. 
soon we will be the refugees. and guess what other countries are not going to be so welcoming.  
uh yah my ex wife took the test it was literally govt history 101, she studied for an hour. and she was dyslexic not too bright.  i got an A in university level government, so yah id bet a bitcoin i could pass it. its basically a drivers test which no one fails, except those who cant speak english. (its given in english except for older immigrants) so nice try.  Its a participation trophy for  studying an hour. 
i didn't  vote  i went to south america to fuck whores lol, i am letting the american opinion aka democracy drive policy decisions, they said: "their borders, their choice" and i support them. much like i would support my family if they decided they would accept no more guests into their home.   but the globalists seem to think democracy is optional if  they can label it  an "ist" or "ic" well its optional if  you want armed insurrection. else i would let the  family decide how to manage its door.

Communism by definition needs a strong centralized government to enforce it. Since most people are self motivated when others are not looking in order to put money into the collective pot, an enforcer of the money pot has to be chosen. As more and more people neglect to put money into the pot, more and more enforcers are put to the task.  In the end you have a layer of men with guns and a man who directs the men with guns guarding the pot.

Typical leftist response to attack the speaker and not the subject.
If my argument is so bad should be easy. 
Face it multiculturalism leads to ruin.  Leads to distrust. I guess it leads to a bigger state and more men with guns to protect genetically dissimilar people from each other which plays into big government globalist hands. If we have powerful enough institutions to keep people scared enough to get along. Well after the iron curtain fell we saw the racial cleansing in the balkans that happens after the babysitting government can’t control people long enough.  Or we can go to the non aggression principle and free association. The American people chose tougher borders. Ignore that choice at your peril. The next option is violence. Unlike the cucked Germans and Swedes we are armed.  Enjoy the end of the Pax Americana it’s  a brand new world

I live in Argentina lol. I realize the truth that multiculturalism is untenable long term.
Historic immigration was genocide was it not? Did it work out for the Indians? You might think this is because white people are assholes but the truth is all people are assholes. Is that racist to realize that no one can get along? 
Historically immigration was about conquering a hunter gatherer low density land with the greater density allowed by agriculture and thus we gave away and stole the vast land that was available. There is no easy cheap land left I had lived most my life and not been able to afford a piece of land that the baby boomers all gobbled up to get away from an inflationary currency and whose values skyrocketed on further untenable immigration . 
Don’t lie immigrantion was very strict so much so that Americans barely tolerated Irish and Catholics. Still there were race riots.   Here in Argentina it was primarily Italian and Spanish so much so that even today those counties are given free passage more than I a yankee whose hometown Miami is full of Argentines now

You can call me racist all you want I even own it in so much as I believe race matters. I see history and it shows that people in small numbers get along fine when things are good and inventives are aligned. Once large numbers of people displace other people whether it be from land or jobs or pussy(excuse me mating rights)one asshole will start killing and then endless reprisals happen. Now the government will be able to control small numbers. Rather than fighting its more humane to live separate when one population has explicitly stated in a democratic election that they want more separation .
So yes I’m racist, but not so racist as to want to kill poc rather than let them live peaceably on the other side of the mountain if we are starting to not get along .

Ideally we shouldn't have to deport them . That costs money. Best case they don't come , second best they self deport.

in such case i must remind you that since horses are mammals, without tits, their offspring would starve.   far be it from me to explain to a leftist that tits and reproduction are a necessary part of life but I digress.  
in any event he should or should not be in jail, irrespective of that either his point or valid or it is not.   The fact remains that facists were FOR state control of everything, "everything in the state and nothing else"  and so to call those who are for the non-aggression principle and less government intrusion into the lives of citizens is comically opposed to what fascism is.   You are referring to nazism, which obviously like communism needed massive state power centralization to enact, and against individual liberty.

It’s racism to try to replace a population and a folly likely lead to violence. Once men can no longer get laid or have jobs shit will hit the fan. White people are nice until we’re not. We clearly voted for less immigration since we voted for someone who ran on a clear platform of less immigrantion.  You can call that racist or whatever you want but the clear truth is no population will permit their lifestyle to go down while importing other people who are given opportunities from the government.  Shit will eventually hit the fan

It’s not a meme it’s an argument. And typical leftists diatribe non argument “aw shut up”. You can at least tell me why I’m wrong but I’m not or you’re not smart enough to field an argument  . It IS morally wrong to take people’s property with guns as socialism dictates. It is necessary to centralize power in order to take property and out of that centralization of power dictators arise who are never as altruistic as their claims . Turns out humans are fallible even those who claim to want to help others.

In these cash strapped societies where change is often not on hand, your corner store often will spot you change since they know you. In such a place a two day clearing time will not be a death knell to transactions since there is some face to face trust involved.

Well whoever Satoshi is he is in tech, fintech. He spread it to other techies until it got out to other investors that were less techie but still tech oriented.  It's safe to say most of the earliest hodlers were coders. Some have taken profits by now or bought an island...  In the last year it has undoubtedly migrated to the least tech of investors yet, people who were previously online gamblers. And next year it will hit mainstream insistuituon after cme opens and more funds buy in.

Well the more selection they have the greater power they have.  Since cock's are not fungible they are free to pay more for one they like more. But since hypergamy applies women tend to always date up in some way or another.  Since they already have a fair amount of money being the richest bitches in the history of the world they have started to look for other qualities to define hypergamy. It seems they have gone skemwhat from money to height.  You can notice this in the fact that first world women are super ashamed to admit that they're dating a man because of success, but will freely and boldly put "must be six feet " on their dating profile.  
In South America I am amazed at how women date shorter men, even like 6 inches shorter. Of course I'm five seven so maybe I'm bitter

Well the point was based on the fact that white men pay vastly more in taxes than they take in in services, not to be exclusive of the men of color who do the same.

Feminism is cancer that rips society apart. If a society stops breeding it stops existing. You are a parasite you do not want to have kids or raise them. You have a warped view of the world fed by bitter teachers who fed you this socialist feminist crap, I don’t blame you I was taught and believed the same thing I was a leftist like you but then I saw truth by living in the ghetto experiencing life and I came to the conclusion that we are in an adaptive phase in our history . 
A mere fifty years ago a pill was introduced that changed our fertility and family structures and the contract between men and women . This started a gender war, where once a woman would have over 6 kids average and have a big family around her now she has little over 1. This led to a great unhappiness as a single man often cannot make a woman happy and of course have women more power. A power struggle ensued and in my childhood the divorce rate shots up. I didn’t meet my father until I was nearly a man. I was taught my father was a monster. I believed it so. But I was “just like my father” wasn’t I?  
So now the marriage rate is falling and so with it the divorce rate. The war rages on the family is broken, if marriage is so bad why do only mostly rich women marry? 
Things to ponder. 
I’ll be in South America eating pastries

The inanimate objects are one thing and that's fine. My point is that you have been brainwashed by the feminist power to not call person X a he lest you get pushback. I am against not calling person X a he if position x is statistically a he.  Thus I would fight those who push for political correctness with statistical correctness. I.e. if the average Fisher is a man we should refer as a he since fishermen die to put protein on your plate and instead of yelling patriarchy we should honor their sacrifice.

My post divorce advice: you should maintain leverage in a relationship.

True dat its a raw deal, I actually agree with feminists that marriage is bad. It's the state coming into your relationships power dynamic.  It was different when it was the church and women had a lot of kids and it was tough for her to pickup and leave. Now 60 % of marriages are initiated by women.  You know who initates the other forty? Men like me who want some respect and sex after the wife has checked out but won't pull the trigger.  Boycott marriage until the law is changed

We should have never sold our manufacturing capacity to a centrally controlled communist Ethnostate. The neoliberal cucks justified that it would turn them to the world community and open up freedoms. But instead they used their power to remove all freedoms subsidize everything and used that unprecedented state power to engage in an economic war as a prelude to their racist conquest

The trade war and talks breaking down had something to do with the latest run IMHO.  I thought the Chinese were mostly out of Bitcoin but it seems they are in capital flight

Merkjle really did the fourth reich which was the 3rd in reverse. Instead of going to other countries killing people and taking their resources, she invited others to come to Germany kill Germans and take their resources.

I live in South America argentina. Most mortgages have an inflation interest built-in.  My rent does not. it has gone down dramatically since I have dollars. However it's a 2yr deal and will catch up to inflation next year for sure.   Food is usually more than rent but I should prolly eat out less

I apologise that I voted for Obama twice, bought his book and t-shirt and for Trump never. I will do better in 2020.

I wouldve but I wouldn't disrespect my adopted country that gave me so much and the best job of my life.   I don't hate immigrants I hate disrespectful ungrateful immigrants.  And unfunny comments like Trevor Noah. 
Source I'm and immigrant and I would never disrespect my adopted country. They have the hottest girls

Yah but your influence is limited or you would have more coins than Satoshi.  And wouldn't any action you take has the risk of being cancelled by non collaborative groups noise and other major market moves?

Known stats. African American unemployment has never been lower as is female unemployment.  
The Chinese are timing their revenge to pre election to see if they can shake off weak hands. Xi is under no such constraints.  Our position is compromised because we don't have a dictator like China and we have a free market.  We should have never given our manufacturing capacity away to a centralized communist expansionist Ethnostate but the idiots in the uniparty liked the cheap stuff.
