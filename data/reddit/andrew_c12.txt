At the moment it's recommended not to run lightning on the mainnet due to the possibility of losing money.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:50:57
[Here]( is one.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:31:50
At the moment ... probably virtually nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:40:12
I'm sorry if I misunderstood.
I wasn't talking about an attack just legacy unmaintained nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:12:48
There will never be a Classic/BU HF that doesn't have a majority.
So I will respond to your post as if are chooseing to run a minority client.
Are you willing to isolate yourself from the majority?
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:12:34
TIL I'm not interested in consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:54:05
We really don't.
We should but we don't have to.
Consensus is something we choose to do not what we have to do.
I don't even choose to do it.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:45:47
I don't agree
I believe every bitcoin node gets to make its own decision in what it believes.
Those two wolves will consider the sheep eaten.
But the sheep will consider the wolves as not having even tried.
I don't think the wolves and the the sheep think they have tried yet. 
But it will be interesting to see what they think in the future.

So if everyone decides 25% are acting badly they can decide to fork with only 75%?
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:37:02
Thanks for spending the time talking to me.
I hope you get to see your dream someday in spite of me.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:53:10
Also I didn't say the wolves ignore the sheep. I said the sheep ignores the wolves.
Is this how it works or how you want it to work?
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:42:15
Sorry I've misscomunicated.
When we started talking about sheep I switched from talking about people to talking about individual nodes.
I support segwit, hell I had an argument that the one year activation period could hurt segwit activation.
I've already said I'm not interested in consensus (consensus among a majority i do support)
And the sheep I was referring to was a node with rules that the majority doesn't have.
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:59:41
What's your definition of consensus for a BTC HF?
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:18:26
I think the wolves having to listen to the sheep
Is the same thing as the sheep having to listen to the wolves
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:25:19
Thank you.
That's a pretty high threshold.
Would you consider reducing it if a non-negligible amount of nodes running ancient 5+ year old software made up 5%?
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:02:30
why can they not ignore the wolves? if the sheep does not accept that it can be eaten then it will ignore the wolves telling it it's been eaten.
@_date: 2017-01-17 04:49:48
There really are no predefined rules.
There are the current rules we apply.
"we" as in all of the nodes.
"current rules" as in the various different rules people are following right now.

While it is an example of progression, it only shows the progression of bitcoin clients not bitcoin blocks.
For that there is 
@_date: 2017-01-17 03:57:54
Users choose how they react to information that comes in.
They can ignore it, but they can't choose for someone else not to send it.


it does


it does


we have no rights. we only have what other people let us have.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:29:59
Aww yeah!
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:19:20
Since it's based on the number of blocks not time, it would take ten weeks.
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:40:27
Maybe something like "Ignore transactions paying less than %minrelaytxfee%"
And somewhere else the txfee/byte they have to beat to evict a transaction in the mempool
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:49:33
Honestly I don't know and I can only make useless random suggestions.  Sorry.
@_date: 2016-12-13 10:10:06
Also maybe what percentage of blocks it would have been ineffective for.
@_date: 2016-12-13 10:03:22
In that case does it need to be shown?  The minrelaytxfee is never violated.
Anyway you could inform the user that the minrelaytxfee they are setting would be currently ineffective for rejecting transactions due to the mempool size limit.
Otherwise you might be able to inform the user the percentage of transactions that would have been rejected from the last 1, 6, 144, 2016? blocks with the selected minrelaytxfee?

@_date: 2018-02-02 00:54:17
I think we're in agreement here.
I'm just saying if you're trying to help test LN sending a transaction to SLEEPYARK when you are connected to SLEEPYARK uses none of that goodness.
As for "Why does this matter to you?"
I have previously guided people to connect to SLEEPYARK.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:27:07
So the transaction actually has to get relayed across the network instead of just paying the node you have the channel open with.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:00:07
You can also temporarily increase the database cache (dbcache) during the initial sync 
Maybe try 1000
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:23:49
This should be useful 
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:40:11
Firstly read multiple sources before doing anything.
1. Backup your wallet just in case.
2. Download the latest version. 
3. Install the new version. 
4. Run the new version.

I think I ought to be caged if I refuse to give out the password to my wallet, to pay for your room and board.
