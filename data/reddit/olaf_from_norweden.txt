Isn't the penalty 20-40%?
Don't do it because you "believe in Bitcoin". That's irrelevant. Don't do it because you think you'll make a good return because you probably won't.
If you do it at all, do it because you'll enjoy the process and it will excite you. And dumping that kind of money into an investment like Bitcoin *will* be exciting.
But don't delude yourself and make sure you're not doing this just because you got a taste of the koolaid being passed around here.

 with cold addresses.
downside is that your bitcoin is getting tumbled with whoever else is tumbling, and moneypot seems to be gambler-centric. so i would still send to my wallet before sending to coinbase.com, for instance.
also, i've used  for ultra-small amounts.
edit: oh yeah,  is the ultimate mixer. it's just very manual, obviously. also, it becomes riskier with larger amounts if you plan on carrying that kind of cash all at once.

Some don't seem to have any revenue model.
I know  (which calls itself a "gambling wallet") makes money from its casino API.
The free decentralized wallets (like what I have on my phone) seem more like labors of love.

Love this wallet, really. Great for beginners, too.
If someone has iOS and they're into bitcoin, it's usually a good idea to get them setup with breadwallet.

Pretty sure "achievement unlocked" and making some pennies are really just an insult to the kind of technical chops you need to be able to make these sort of contributions to bitcoin.

"The hard part is done. Now we just need users." Newsflash: getting users is the hard part and the only part that matters. It's not a "temporary problem", it's *the* problem.

Yeah, the DAO event is a parallel to the early Bitcoin fork events. The difference being that almost no eyes were on Bitcoin back then and there were far fewer early-adopters.
It is unfortunate that this happened to Ethereum, and there was no response that vbuterin could've made that didn't have significant drawbacks, but it's hardly doomsday.
Most of the responses to the DAO event are pretty toxic, imo. Every masterful skeptic trying to impress us with their own brand of told-ya-so. "Psh, that's what they get for trying."
Another thing Bitcoin had in its youth was a little bit of fucking camaraderie that we'll never see again.

that's not very interesting. imo the innovation is that bitcoin has been impressively resilient. satoshi was a clever cookie. it wasn't just a naive implementation from a hobbyist. even the sha+ripemd combo for addresses indicates that satoshi was able to foresee the future in small ways.

I remember being a freshman in university (2007) eating up Peter Schiff's doom and gloom bullshit. It's been 10 years, mate.
Maybe everything will go to hell in 20 years, 50 years, but that's not what he's been saying. He's been saying "better buy up because we're going nuclear any moment now" while conveniently owning a company that sells what he's telling you to buy.
Guy is a joke. Every time you speak his name, it makes it seem like he's an authority on anything.

Yeah, unfortunately the list of good BTC&lt;-&gt;fiat services is always shrinking and we're kind of stuck with, as the guy above said, dog shit. The service might not be complete dog shit, but there always seems to be an element of dog shit in these services that's hard for me to ignore.

The thing to remember is that your coins all exist in the "blockchain" that's passed around publicly and your key is used to demonstrate that you own the coins.
Some people talk about "keeping their coins in a safety deposit box on an old Android phone" or whatever, and you'll see that it doesnt really make sense.
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:21:08
All you need is the private key. People move around their wallet.dat file simply because it happens to contain their keys.
That's why you can print out your private key and keep it in your wallet.

It's Javascript, so you can save the page and open it without internet access if you actually want to use the feature.
Of course, you'd want to be sure it doesn't just serve you pre-generated seeds which you can verify by reading the source.

The government doesn't need to regulate bitcoin to discourage its use. And they don't need to make it so 100% of everyone stops using it. They just need to make it inconvenient enough.
It's the part where you mess up and have to explain to the IRS where a bolt of USD came from that flagged you for increasingly rigid anti-laundering laws. Or, when the government subpoenaed that supposedly anonymous exchange and found your routing number when they declared it illegal. Or when they find out that you're a company that's not reporting your bitcoin earnings yet through some taint analysis and wire-tapping laws, they were able to prove ownership enough to satisfy increasingly prosecutable laws.
It's sort of like the typical affront against a Silk Road-type market where people say that Silk Road must be shut down because it enables the trade of sex slaves and child laborers or whatever.
But the reality is that the government doesn't need to control Silk Road-like markets because the chink in the system is the part where you have to actually physically haul your menagerie of sex slaves and child laborers in meatspace where the government and law enforcement already have well-defined systems of control where these things are already illegal and carry strict penalties.
Sure, people can do what they want. But people also want to live their lives. There's a critical mass of inconvenience that a government can force upon people so that most of them just give up and the only remaining users are the ideological martyrs, so to speak.

It already is on the "cloud".
You simply "log in" with a private key to access them.
People don't seem to understand that you aren't stashing away your bitcoin in a wallet. The wallet is just a file that contains your keys.
It's probably confusing because the reference bitcoin implementation (bitcoind/qt) overload the term "wallet" because they use wallet.dat to cache all sorts of shit instead of making it a simple file with your keys.

Transfer your coins to a new address away from Coinbase.
Remember that your coins exist on the blockchain. It's your private key (which generates your address) that proves that you own the coins.
If you wanted to lock away funds, what you're really doing is locking away your private key. A private key can be printed on paper.
Hope that helps.

Socrates believed so much in oration skills (he taught and argued for them) because he said that people irrationally trust those who can woo them with presentation. It allows one to case an illusion of reason that trumps all other measures of intelligence.

Not only did I buy at the all-time high, but I decided to buy TEN at once.
It was 3am and I had just received my first bitcoin after a 5-day wait, so I guess what followed logically was to buy ten more at the peak.
