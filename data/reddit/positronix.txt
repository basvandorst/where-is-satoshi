No it's a floor relative to the new price of $630, the price stabilizes at $630 because of a sell wall at $628

Hence why the bet is in bitcoins - zero risk for the better and something only an idiot would participate in.  I'm sure buffet's seen this one before but most of the morons on this subreddit have not.
Edit: Yes, zero risk you fucking loons.  It's like if I owned half the apples in the country and then bet 1000 apples that apples will be twice as valuable next year.  This guy voorhees has got hundreds of thousands of bitcoins.  The bet isn't that bitcoin will outperform warren buffet, the bet is that this bet will convince idiots to buy more bitcoins and inflate the price.

My friend claims to make money through illegal bitcoins.  Shrug.  I think he mines fake bitcoins and sells them onto the normal market for a few hundred cheaper than normal.

I think he mentioned that he lost roughly 4200 bitcoins from mtgox, and then someone complained that his gigantic letter to gox was ill-written because he still had 125k coins left.  His complaint made it sound like he was in the same boat as all the other victims, when wealth-wise he's more in line with the gox owners.

This is actually good news.
Speculation drives the moonraker, which in turn powers the crankshaft connected to the bitcoin valuation machine that extends() the price floating point value to new astronomical heights.  By hanging onto your bitcoins^TM , the mass transfer relays spike the code blocks and turn over enough bits per day to create new forms of wealth like space shuttles and turing machines.
Also, if you heed the advice of not using your bitcoins it helps them become more scarce, which makes his bitcoins more valuable.  Actually spending your bitcoins turns it into a *currency* instead of an investment - the absolute worst outcome for any hoarder.

You see, the thing that makes bitcoin different from classical fiat is that bitcoin is run by a shadowy organization that answers to nobody in particular and could, because of 'reasons', decide to tank the entire bitcoin economy for short term personal gain.
Also, you'll have to read a manual on the specifics of storing, buying, and trading your coins if you want to actually use bitcoin to buy stuff and not get ripped off or hacked.
Also, you will need to learn compsci terms like hashing, mining, block chain, etc. or you'll be berated online when you ask questions about bitcoin.
Also, the entire thing is a pyramid scheme.
The future is coming!  To the moon!

Bitcoin dissed by someone important?  This is actually good news.

You're new to this whole 'pyramid scheme' thing aren't you?
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:15:35
Because your obsolete so-called "dollars" aren't going to the moon!

don't disrupt the circlejerk.  It's really amusing listening to the responses to this argument.

LOL "never sell"
Yes, please do.  If everyone else never sells, my own btc will rise in value as supply of btc decreases :D
