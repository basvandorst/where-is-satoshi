Does bitcoin solve a systemic problem? Or do we just use it because we profit from it?

1,5 MB gif. That would be some minutes of loading for a dialup connection. Put it on a website and annoy some people!

Bitcoin.de partnering with Fidor is mainly to speed up buying and selling bitcoins in exchange for other currencies. Currently it takes up to three days in germany to get euros for your bitcoins using bitcoin.de

That is definately a feature. But having my money lie around with other people is only a potential problem. It's all fine until they take it away, which does not happen very often and - as i see it - for reasons not related to how I store the money. E.g. the cyprus crisis seems to was caused by bad overall economic management not by the central banking system. I guess using the decentralised system of bitcoin would not have changed the ultimate cause of this crisis.
