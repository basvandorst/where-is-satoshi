As far I know (can verify on google), one bitcoin can be **divided up to 100,000,000 Satoshi.**
The premise of your assertion is there are **net 10,000 genuine long term believer/builders still valuing bitcoin**, if that holds true, bitcoin will still has its value.
I can see there are a few ways for this scenario to break down
1. Those 10,000 individuals' demand for btc (converting fiat to btc) is tapering off the same rate as the amount of new coins being mined.
2. Assuming there is no net increase of believers/builders, and the buying and selling actions of btc **plus** new coin generated are at an equilibrium, meaning if there are just about \~5,000 individuals buying btc with fiat and the other half selling their btc for fiat.
If there two conditions were to occur, btc price will not increase, but we have to factor in inflation rate of government backed currency (GBC), if GBC inflation rate is much higher, then the fiat value of BTC will be higher on a nominal basis.
The really bad case for BTC is if some new technology comes out in the next 8 years making BTC obsolete, people started abandoning the project, then not only would the value not go up, it will become null.
So the most important question is how can we make BTC more useful to people, improving its usability and adoption.

Good question, if one control 51% of the hashing power they can in theory perform a "double spend" or better yet "selfish mining" , thereby potentially denying all the other miners but themselves any future block rewards.

I am quite clueless, I don't know what new technology will come out in the future that would make bitcoin obsolete, perhaps you know something that we don't.
Would love to hear your views on bitcoin, and its future.

Do you mean because there are so much energy committed to mining, there will always be incentive to keep the currency going?
I would love to hear more discussion on the 51% attack since mining inherently rewards miners with economies of scale, so I think bitcoin will just become even more centralized in the future, any solutions?
If an attack were to happen and known by the community, that would unfortunately be the end of btc... &gt;\_&lt;

Interesting points, would like to dive in further on each segment.
**Questions for you**
Why would new technology have to replace the internet?
It seems you believe BTC has utilized the internet to its fullest potential?
**BTC penetration:**
I would argue BTC has market penetration only relative to other cryptocurrencies, it looks like it will remain that way for a while given the tract record and the "soundness" of BTC.
If you are talking about BTC as a global currency it is still small.
^(According to this article:) [^(
*As of December 2018 -* 32 Million wallets has been set up, it is possible one individual entity holds multiple wallet, so we can be looking at an even smaller number of real users. 
*Market Cap as of 24 Feb 2019 -* USD 72.87 Billion, it is **0.3%** of the US Economy, 0.15% of the World's TOP 5 Economies (US, China, Japan, Germany, UK)
Biggest problem I have with BTC is its limited use case right now, which really limits the adoption for it to be a true global currency, I am sure many are aware of.
In order to mine BTC with ASICs, and still remain *cash flow positive*, you would need power cost that is 6.5 US cents or lower at the current price/difficulty. That's excluding other operating expenses, such as utilities, labor and depreciation. Meaning, very few people but the ones that have access to 1.) Lower power cost &amp; 2.) Scale 3.) Access to capital can remain a profitable miner. These conditions makes mining or BTC much more centralized then it once was.
I also read that mining pools makes the mining hash power more centralized within a few entities, *can someone clarify this?*
**Hash Power:**
Indeed BTC has the greatest hash power behind it right now that is because it is still the most profitable and least risky currency.
Hash power will shift if something better comes long.
Could BTC one day adopt Proof of Stake? Making hash power a non-issue? (this would require a separate thread of discussion)
*These are just some of my own opinions, feel free to point out any flaws or erroneous information.*

I am interested in vertical farm and you seem to be very knowledgeable about this, can you point to the right direction to get more info on best practices for vertical farming as there are a lot of information out there.
Thanks,

Not sure how big their team is, but maintaining a blog requires resources which they may not or will not be able to dedicate at this point.
Nonetheless, I am enjoying this thread.

thank you for your response, very insightful, I will test it out in my balcony first haha

Thanks for the reply, so site visit is the best.
I am currently residing in Jakarta Indonesia, not sure if there is a vertical farm within driving distance.
What would be the next best thing?
When you first started out, what did you find most beneficial to research this topic?
Thanks again for your time
