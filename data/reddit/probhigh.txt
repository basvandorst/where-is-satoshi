One of the interesting propositions of Bitcoin is micropayments. 
Content providers are looking to migrate from the failed subscription based model to collecting micro payments on each article...
You are not far off

I am a 20 something year old who has worked in the Finance world. I have been reading about Bitcoin for a few weeks. I have made some seed round tech investments 
Whilst my parents consider a Techie  and "good with computers" I know nothing near enough to secure my own Bitcoin. 
I decided around a week ago that I was going to buy a few coins 10-20 with an E-wallet. 
The price drops over the past few days have gotten me nervous and I am sitting it out. Although I think there is huge potential here and the value could rise 5x I'm still not at ease with the price volatility

Thats part of what Uber did for the Taxi market.  As a passanger I no longer have to call a dispatch base. And Drivers,Instead of having to paint their cab yellow and get any permits or joint a cartel that gave them jobs they can hust whip out their smart phone and connect with end users...
Some say they decentralized but I think they came the new center...
