You are correct in your assertion that you cannot prove delegates to be independent.  This is why Bitshares is susceptible to Sybil attack.  They have already experienced this!
NXT though doesn't use delegates.  It only uses stakeholders.  Stakeholders' stake distinguishes themselves.
In NXT, a users holding x% of the stake secures x% of the network.  In Bitshares, a user holding any percentage of the stake secures 0.99% (100% / 101 Delegates) of the network if he can convince other stakeholders to vote him into a delegate position.  This make the Bitshare's network insecure and leads to Sybil attacks.

If it's based off NXT's PoS algo, they would have to retain control of over 90% of the currency to centralize it.  I find it more likely that they will use Ripple or Bitcoin which is imo more susceptible to centralized control.

You can't have equal security in a PoS clone because the security of the network is directly proportional to the amount of users.  Regardless of the float of the currency staying the same, more users with individual private keys means higher network security.

How can you?
Each new person who buys into a PoS system makes it more decentralized.

Imo, the centralization of Bitcoin mining is an economic problem.  Individual miners simply cannot compete with large corporate miners because they don't have the economies of scale.

Satoshi didn't get paid to develop Bitcoin?  How many bitcoins does he hold again?
All the people who I have seen developing PoS systems are diametrically opposed to the central bankers.  The reason PoS coins like NXT were created was to continue the legacy of decentralization that Bitcoin abandoned due to its nature to centralize.
