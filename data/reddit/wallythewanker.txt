I see your edited your post after my explanation because you realized how dumb you looked. You actually changed it in a way that people think i'm answering your question. For those who care it was another one of those "i'm extremely important and you changed your words because you know i am right". How fucking sad. I can totally see from your behaviour how you are banned. 
This kind of behaviour is digusting and very childish. I bet you're a sneaky lying bitch in real life as well. Seriously, i can't believe that you pull this shit. Are you 15 or what?
I have no idea what the original drama is about but i'm quite sure they are right and you are wrong. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:23:39
Yes we know! It's been posted several times already. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:52:30
Enough! Please!
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:51:55
What makes you think you are the first to post this week old news?
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:50:16
You are new to this internet thing, aren't you?
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:36:04
It's already been posted several times! Stop the goddamn reposts! This shit is crazy!
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:42:57
Yes we know. It's been posted several times already. 
Thanks for being the 50th person today to repost something. 
Make sure to never search before you post. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:46:16
Your username history shows that you are quite active here. Which means you must notice the tons of reposts every day. 
Then how exactly is it possible you didn't do a search before posting and now are one of those annoying pricks that reposts yourself?
Why, if you look at this subreddit, does avoiding reposts seems like the hardest thing to do. Ever. You might be able to explain it to me. I really want to understand it. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:46:19
Please please pleaaaase stop these ATM posts. Just.....stop....please!
I seriously think we've had more than 200 ATM posts in the last 6 months. Already 10 or so in the last few days! It's been enough. It really is. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:03:29
Yes we know. It's already been posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:07:18
Weird, i read your message twice and can't find the part where they are considering using Bitcoin.
Can you point it our for me?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:59:40
Ah capslock. Then you know it's serious. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:17:34
I hear nothing but horror stories about that company. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:56:06
Yes we know. It's already been posted. Why do you people refuse to look at the page before posting? Why?
About 40% on the new page are reposts! This shit has to stop!
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:48:02
I stopped reading after a few lines. I only picked up the word butthurt after i submitted my post. I figured you must be butthurt so i edited my post. 
Once again you are not that important. You need to get that idea out of your system. 
Crying on one forum how you are banned on the other. 100% typical i'm extremely butthurt action. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:18:49
Don't be so fucking gullible! First of all if you did a search you would've seen that just today you are the 8th person or so to ask this question. Which makes you an annoying prick. And second nobody knows what Bitcoin will do. Nobody!
If you are older than 15 then i can't believe you would ask such a thing. Do you think anybody here can look into the future?
And that guy saying 300k is obviously pulling numbers out if his ass. Guess what, he is some dumbass who owns a few coins who wants to get rich. So what else he is gonna say than 300k? It's called the Bitcoin fantasy land syndrome. A lot of people here suffer from it. And i can tell you sure look like a good candidate for it!
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:34:03
What makes you think anybody here would know the answer to that?
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:59:33
Yes we know. Because it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:35:53
Being new to Bitcoin isn't an excuse for not using the search function. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:48:08
Don't be an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:20:00
I fully agree. This has to stop. And there is only 1 way to stop it. You know what that is right?
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:10:39
The one on the left?
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:28:09
Please, for the love of God, stop the ATM posts. Repeating the same story 10 times a day is just ridiculous. This has to stop. 
I think since the first mention of a Bitcoin ATM there have been more than 200 posts about it. The last week at least 5 to 10 a day. All of them repeating the same shit. 
It's insane. It's completely insane. 
1 or 2 posts once it's placed would be nice. It would be normal. But 200 posts before it's even live is insane. 
And i'm afraid of what's coming. Once it's live we'll have 10 posts a day how it's live. Every day. For the next 3 weeks. All repeating the same story. 
Then we'll hear about a new ATM which will be placed somewhere else and we'll repeat the whole process again.
You want Bitcoin to look serious and mature. In the meantime you people act like kids. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:25:29
Keep clicking that button kiddos! Like the frustrated fucking idiots you are. Yup, that's really your life. Virtually downvoting people on the internet. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:39:00
Why do you people refuse to use the search and instead ask the same thing over and over and over again? Why?
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:15:43
Jesus man! Do a fucking search. There are at least 100 posts about this topic. 
This is asked and answered every single day. Often multiple times per day. 
What is it with you people! Why do you REFUSE to do a search?
When will this stop!
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:18:48
It's been posted several times already.
You must see the insane amounts of reposts here every day.
So why don't you do a search before posting? What makes you think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:17:43
So you never read anything about not selling or buying Bitcoin through Paypal. Not 1 post anywhere. This was completely new to you?
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:25:38
I realize the date says 26 oct but i'm pretty damn sure this has been posted a long time ago already. It must be some kind of copy of the other story. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:19:44
Yes we know. It's been posted many times already.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:34:48
This is getting stupid. 
Apparently the only way to solve a problem with these people is if you bring it to Reddit. 
I learned one thing from all these threads. To stay as far away as possible from them. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:27:15
Because it's the most retarded and annoying sentence ever maybe?
@_date: 2013-10-31 11:42:33
Total signatures: 2
This shit is funny!
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:33:06
Thanks, we didn't know how Bitcoin works. We do now. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:44:03
This has been asked and answered 100 times before. Just do a search man.
@_date: 2013-10-27 20:37:47
How can you possibly think this wasn't posted several times already? Don't you see this place is completely filled with reposts? All day long. You didn't think of maybe doing a search before posting?
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:48:43
It's 60 dollars. Not 6000. You're gonna wait to see if you can save 2 dollars or something like that?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:12:47
These posts are getting so annoying. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 10:00:04
Yes we know. It's already been posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:23:03
I'm not sure if you are trolling or just plain stupid. Either way you are annoying as hell. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:17:44
Why do you people keep asking these questions? First of all do a search next time. There are 100 similar topics. 
And then what kind of answer do you expect? What makes you think anyone here can answer this? Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do next week or next year. 
Think before you post. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:27:49
You can start by stop asking the same questions that have been asked and answered 154 times already.
This shit has to stop...
Actually, maybe you can answer my question. Because so far it remains a mystery. 
Why do you people REFUSE to use the search? I just can't seem to get an answer.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:26:11
Stop fucking asking the same shit every fucking day you annoying idiots! One: use the search because there are 100 similar topics. Two: nobody knows what Bitcoin will do so impossible to answer. Couldn't you figure that out yourself? Do you think anyone here can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:55:16
And another mining post which has been asked and answered about 100 times. 
Can't the search button be moved to a better spot? Maybe then all these idiots finally will start using it. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:58:09
Really? This has been posted so many times man. Can you idiots please just stop it with endless amounts of reposts?
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:22:44
Yes, of course it been posted already. If you weren't sure why didn't simply do a search?
The amount of reposts here are already insane. Why not do something about it. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:14:03
Yes. Reality can be harsh. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:04:27
So besides a bottom feeding loser kid you are also a liar. What a surprise. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:22:10
How many happy posts have i seen here that Paypal refunded BFL money. Money that people who paid with Bitcoin never saw back. 
People even suggested here not to pay with Bitcoin. 
And how safe is it? Insane amounts of bitcoins got stolen over the years. 
These awesome features of Bitcoin aren't that awesome really. 
I rather buy a product with my card or paypal and gladly pay a few % extra. I'll have buyer protection. No way i'll buy an expensive product with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:37:44
Stop being a butthurt little bitch. You're not that important. Believe me. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:43:43
You mean it's already been posted?
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:16:11
Yes we know. Because it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:59:33
Just stop the fucking reposts you fucking retarded idiot! It's all you fucking do all day long. What the fuck is wrong with you man? All fucking day long you post "news" that's been posted already. Do you have brain damage or what?
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:17:06
My god! Stop the goddam ATM posts!!! This is completely insane! I never seen anything like it!
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:40:57
Yes, we know. It's already been posted. Just like every other message that has been posted today is a repost. If not more. 
Why? Why can't you people just stop with the reposts. How incredibly difficult can it be exactly?
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:15:31
Look, i made a new account. So all that downvoting did absolutely nothing. 
Fuck, that must be even more frustrating to you morons. I bet you're foaming from the mouth about now. And nothing you can do to stop this. 
You know what? Try some more downvoting. See if it helps!
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:36:34
How can you possibly think this wasn't posted several times already?
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:30:57
How fucking desperate must you be to spam Reddit hoping to make pennies. 
I always wonder why kids like you waste your time on this shit instead of finding a job. 
Fucking bottom feeder. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:43:05
Can we just stop reposting the same shit over and over again? It's nothing but pure arrogance. It's always someone who thinks he is the first to post it so he doesn't have to do a search. 
It's so easy to avoid. 
But as long as you keep upvoting reposters this shit will never stop. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:57:00
Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:51:46
Really? Please tell me more about it. I haven't heard about this before. It's the first time someone mentions this. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:24:59
Yes, it's the ATM obviously. What else could it be!
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:16:07
Just stop fucking answering these people. It has been answered 80 times already. Let them use the search!
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:51:55
Why do people always have to post in public to get shit done with you guys?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:46:11
Go get a job. You freak! How the hell can people waste their time on this shit. A week for 1 coin? Seriously?
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:49:21
Yes. We know. 
It's been posted about 10 times already. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:03:31
But you knew this already. Yet you did it anyway because you got greedy. 
You're an idiot and deserved what you got. Nobody is going feel sorry for you. 
I also wondef why you are blaming Paypal. You do something against their TOS and then cry like a little bitch when they take action against you. I'm no Paypal fan but i can't blame them here. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:27:19
Fucking stop it already! This is insane!
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:05:49
Stop crying. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:51:08
Because you make up your own sensasionalist titles. A search on the real title would have showed you. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:16:51
Why don't you use the fucking search the next time? You know what it is right? And what it does? If you would've done that you would've seen that 10 people a day ask the same question and that it's annoying as fuck!
Oh and please, go find a fucking job. I get sick from these i'm so poor how do i get free money posts.
@_date: 2013-10-27 20:25:41
You are here a lot. How is it possible that you don't know how to avoid reposts yet? What is it with you people?
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:05:34
How can we stop the insane amounts of reposts on this subreddit?
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:41:42
Yes we know. It's already been posted. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 09:17:02
Yes we know. Because it's been posted about TEN times a day. Every day for the last week. 
You can stop it now. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:00:07
If you have been here longer than one day then you must have noticed the insane amounts of reposts every day. 
If that's the case then why don't you look at the page before posting? Do you think you somehow magically won't repost?
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:59:43
Well, that's kinda odd then. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:30:45
There are 50 threads like this. We get it. Just stop using them. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:04:36
Fucking stop this shit. Stop fucking asking the same thing every hour! 
Not only is it asked 100 times before, it's also impossible to answer. Do you think someone here can look into the future or what?
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:32:55
Yes we know. It's been posted several times already. If you check this Reddit you must've noticed the insane amounts of reposts. So why the hell don't you do a search before posting?
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:02:41
Great story. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:46:30
No, you are the idiot if you think that anyone here, or on this planet, can tell you what Bitcoin will do. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:15:54
If you check this subreddit you must have notice the crazy amounts of reposts. Every day, all day long. Sometimes half the posts are reposts. The main reason for that is because people are arrogant. They think they as soon as they find a link they are the first to post it.
Now a very easy way to avoid this is to think "this place has 1000's of people browsing Bitcoin stuff all day. The chances of my link already being posted are quite big so let me do a search before posting".
So what is your excuse for not doing this? Arrogance? or something else?
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:08:39
Use the goddamn search!
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:24:53
Can i pay you to stop posting here?
Fucking retard. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:38:08
Yes we know. Because it's already been posted. 
How can you possibly think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:53:46
And there are millions of people who would have multitude of problems using Bitcoin to send money to friends and could instantly do it with Paypal. Denying this because you happen to be a Bitcoin supporter is completely retarded!
Yes, i support Bitcoin, yes, i rather see Paypal go than stay but i don't live in fucking Bitcoin fantasy land like you idiots who downvote me because you can't stand reality.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:00:26
Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do. You could've figured that out yourself or found it out by doing a search and find this same question asked about 10 times a day. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:09:29
Oh right. Because it's a copy and paste on a different domain it's no problem to repost. 
You're an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:08:10
It was a correction. We went up too quick. It didn't crash.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:49:14
Stop the fucking reposts!
