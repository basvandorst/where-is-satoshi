So 15 Bitwage users will win a ticket to TNABC? 
Not bad for just signing up for Bitwage's free bitcoin payroll service.
The General Admission ticket is currently retailing for $215 while the Saturday tickets are $150.
Now if Bitwage could also throw in airfare and hotel...

Welcome to the free market of crypto coins. Bitcoin has become too big to change fast, so alt-coins are filling the niches. I do think anonymity-built-in will be crucial for any coin's long-term success.

Currently Bitwage works only with USA-based payroll providers.

"Acted alone and in desperation" - Bingo.
Does Bitcoin have any enemies in this world? 
Maybe some powerful and ruthless people, with unlimited and unlisted budgets?
Maybe they realize they can't stop Bitcoin adoption, but would really like to slow it down?
Like a few trillion dollars at stake in merely slowing the adoption?
Just maybe? 
My theory is MtGox was told to Mega-Gox itself with maximum pain for its customers, then leak that damming document, or else someone would die in an accident.
Kind of like Breitbart died of heart attack, then the coroner who did his autopsy died suddenly as well.
Karpeles has a nice family, I hear.
The previous four mini-goxings would provide great cover.
I'm not into this black-ops conspiracy stuff, but from what I heard and read from people close to MtGox, nothing else makes sense, neither incompetence, nor greed, nor both.

Just received my first BTC payroll from Sidecar via Bitwage
I drive for sidecar (side.cr)
I did not have to explain Bitcoin to Sidecar.
All i did was update my Sidecar payout settings with the bank account &amp; routing number that Bitwage gave me.

To have a network effect, we need more international Bitcoin Payroll &amp; Payment companies, ideally partnering with local exchanges for liquidity.

I've heard AirBitz mobile wallet encrypts the traffic to their servers.

Bitwage is on the right track by reducing the role of banks and how much they know about our spending, but it's too early to talk about cutting out the banks entirely.
Right now most employers are still sending payroll in Dollars, so Bitwage needs to buy bitcoin from exchanges via bank transfers. If and when many employers start paying their employees and suppliers in bitcoin, that would completely "close the loop" and cut out the banks.

So the big banks are considering a proprietary blockchain, merely inspired by Bitcoin?
I would not want Bitcoin itself to be the backbone of the 700+ Trillion derivative market. 700 Trillion is 10x more than the world's GDP, and hence can have a "tail wagging the dog" destabilizing effect on Bitcoin and the rest of the real economy.
