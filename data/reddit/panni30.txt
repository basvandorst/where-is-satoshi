Amazon has costly over heads, imagine all the rates they pay for them warehouses, office space and staff. What we have here is effectively the public being able to sell using their own homes as their offices and storage and being their OWN boss. Surely a point will come where amazon will not be able to compete with this no matter how good their relations with postal services and wholesalers.

End of the day, there is more chance that gold will be unlimited than Bitcoin. Technology may one day be able to reproduce gold. Whereas, the amount of Bitcoin in circulation surpassing 21 million will be down to a democratic vote and people will not vote that their money is worth less.

Thanks for help guys. I'm on windows and on the latest 0.9.1 client. This has only happened when I downloaded the new client previously on 0.9.0. When I boot the core client program instead this message doesn't show up an the bitcoin loads as usual.

Ive been buying Bitcoin in the UK since January and I always have to buy Bitcoin knowing that it's cheaper on other exchanges throughout the world. And the exchange Im using works buy matching buyer ans seller directly. Using my online banking I send them cash directly and vice versa. This is risky but of all 58 buy trades I have done I have received Bitcoin in good faith. I have just had to be extra vigilant with the price and the timing I buy is very important, I mostly buy on dips.

Although the Amazon brand isn't accepting Bitcoin, Twitch owned by Amazon, they are accepting Bitcoin. Kind of stretching it but in a way Amazon does accept it through Twitch. 
Another way of looking at this is, the image below the text showing that Amazon accepts Bitcoin was produced by Intuit! I don't know, maybe they know something we don't.
'Intuit Inc. is an American software company that develops financial and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, accountants and individuals. It is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Mountain View, California.'
Do they work for Amazon?

The value of Bitcoin has no limit because the technology it's based on is revolutionary. Just as with anything in capitalism if you get there first you make a profit.. The funny thing about Bitcoin is, it becomes more intrinsically valuable as it becomes more valuable because then hopefully volatility should calm down more thus making it more useful.

'As a digital delivery system, perhaps bitcoin can be saved. But a currency built by hackers and anonymous code-writing anarchists offers a pretty weak alternative to cash, credit cards or PayPal.'
That has to be the most ignorant paragraph. Does he understand that on weekends and public holidays bank transfers cease. It can also take up to 5 days to transfer money to the other side of the world. Or 3 days to pay your credit card bill from your bank account even when they are both controled by the same bank. How does this make Bitcoin a week alternative to cash or credit cards?

Ether buyers made the developers millions (18 million) for producing open source software from a controversial premine. Does anyone know what will happen to this money if ethereum doesn't succeed? Counterparty used a proof of burn concept, the developers did not profit and relayed on the true spirit of open source. 
One of the reasons why Bitoin is the most popular crypto is because it has the most secure network (that will probably never change). ethereum is not proven to be safe and will likely encounter safety issues. Counterparty took the wise move to build on top of the Bitcoin network and port the free open source code of ethereum.
P.S does anyone know how many ethers there is out there? One thing that gives a currency value is it limited supply. I have never read anywhere how many ethers will be in circulation. There will only ever be 2,647,039 XCP.

Good points.. Online wallets can disappear over night, we have had a fair share of these. Neo, Mt.Gox which was primarily an exchange and im sure more.

Cheapest and fastest way for me to buy bitcoin in the UK is using  though in the past some of my friends struggled to have their cards verified as they are US based.

Andreas saying that Bitcoin is not a safe investment? Now must be the time to buy.
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:23:10
Perhaps, just a language barrier and also merchants based further away from me (more postage costs). 
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:36:51
I see, thanks for informing me... Looks like I don't have a clue about Bitcoin. I know that it is monetary Jesus though! Thanks for your help.

Would you give your child the freedom to learn how to cross the road in their own way or would you regulate their actions? Complete freedom is as bad as complete control. I take a minarchist view thus some regultion is good.

I think the CEO came on this sub reddit once for visa europe stating that they were indeed using the bitcoin block-chain, reasons he gave was that it was safer than off-chain transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:28:45
I really don't care if they are or not. I'm telling you what I read because you asked if this is really happening. Nice show of appreciation for someone trying to bring this information to you.

Nice to see Tehcrunch transition from Anti-bitcoin &gt; Bitcoin Skeptic &gt; Pro-Bitcoin

Very true, but if they were going to buy a significant amount, they wouldn't do it when the market is making downwards movements. They would wait it out so they can buy in at a good price.

Isnt Circle.com or bitstamp covering you guys yet, with card payments?
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:19:32
You have ethereum on the Bitcoin blockchain its called counterparty

Just make sure you do due diligence before sending any cash or bitcoin to any company. You don't want to fall into the arms of a scam.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:27:16
Thanks very informative!!
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:03:00
Not when it works, its more like unresponsive if a have to press it a second time or third time etc. Perhaps it is a faulty button.

Thanks for answering that important question for me. I got the Trezor because I also fear having bitcoin in a custodial account. Better to keep the bitcoin under the mattress.

I thought Factom used it's own block-chain?
@_date: 2016-02-28 14:11:25
derived from bitcoin could also mean an alt..

So its not just me, Im in the UK.

The bitcoin block-chain is secured by a physical element. The power of all the mining computers on the network. We have Bitcoin, we have Ethereum and we even have Ethereum on the Bitcoin block-chain (Counterparty). There is nothing more we will ever need. What we have is good enough. The network effect is in full drive with bitcoin and it also has the maturest price and exchange market. It's more than good enough.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:18:35
Great news for Factom -&gt; Counterparty -&gt; Bitcoin
edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:09:41
Counterparty coin, accounts for quite a few Bitcoins transactions. Quite a few projects running on it.
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:27:27
I use Circle all the time to buy my Bitcoin. It is extremely useful. I tend to buy my bitcoin from them when the price is crashing because usually on an exchange you need 3 days to transfer funds. Yes it's limited on the amount you can buy, but for convince it's brilliant. I then store them with Coinbase.com
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:14:01
Ah ok I didn't realize, anyone still interested can private message me then.
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:45:02
Question about Bitreserve, if I buy a card say XAU (gold) do I actually own the gold? Or is it just used as protection against volatility and you guys actually own the gold?
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:41:11
Mt. GoX doesn't compare to a legitimate multi venture backed company with solid security like coinbase. I trust these guys more with their free insurance than making paper wallets that are subjected to hardware, entropic errors, theft or fire. Personally I think storing coins on coinbase should be encouraged rather than discouraged.
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:29:32
Nice work!
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:47:20
Sure there will be more to innovate. But when you have the ability for turning complete on a token, to this extent the innovation remains within bitcoin. As this ability has been bought to the bitcoin blockchain through counterparty.

I suppose if there is another financial crisis Overstock would be a good company to own shares in as they have investments in safe heaven currencies such as gold, silver and bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:37:25
I'll probably get down voted but coinbse has its advantages. Free insurance on funds and a legitimate company.
@_date: 2015-11-21 17:05:01
I recommend Coinbase to store and buy and sell. They have a vault and free insurance. Plus they are a legitimate company (whatever that means).
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:48:51
Anyone know if Counterparty will be involved with any of this? 'and it's protocol**s**' is plural.

This is a subjective question. Do you mean in absolute terms or in terms of prioritizing their money on essential items before they can afford to buy it?

The Freemasons are an organization like any other. Any organization will have its good and bad actors. Look at banks, schools, politicians, the church, every fucking walk of life has bad actors. People are just extra suspicious of Freemasons because they are secretive, they are an exclusive club.

This is a great charity!  and they accept Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-02-06 10:26:41
Of course, but I believe this is highly relevant to Bitcoin. You can't money print with Bitcoin. This highlight Bitcoin's advantages during economic crisis.
