They will have to buy significant coins to pay fees.  They will be supporting the miners as well, which becomes more and more important as the block reward drops.  Also using the blockchain for such important things will make it a much more valuable asset, and give it much more credibility as a form of money (think regression theorem type logic).  If the blockchain is securing billions and trillions of dollars of financial assets, you better believe people are going to be buying Bitcoin and investing huge money not only as an investment but to help secure the network and promote mining.
