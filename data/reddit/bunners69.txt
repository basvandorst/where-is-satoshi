I’ve tried researching wallets and this looked like the best one for me at the time of research. Could you point me in the direction of a wallet that is better for my position?

The truest statement I’ve ever seen

I have a question and idk where else to ask it. Will lightning network help wallets like exodus lower the fees? Right now I’d have to pay like 45 dollar fee to move my btc from there. I’m guessing so because lightning network is supposed to help all transactions on the chain and transferring from one Wallet to another is a transaction so...I’m still trying to figure this stuff out

You have to understand that it is going to dip and it is going to dip hard. It could crash 10k in a day, that’s very possible. If you like learning from history then know that after every attack, bitcoin has come out on top and has grown. Every single time. No one knows what the future holds but just know that bitcoin isn’t going to disappear any time soon. Keep hodling my friend.

I mean I haven’t seen anything besides people saying it’s electronic cash (which it is like you said). The only thing I’m seeing now is that it’s going to be insanely volatile until the mining stops in the year 2140something when all the Bitcoin has been mined. At that point it’ll stabilize for good with some ups and downs here and there and people can start spending regularly. Not to say there won’t be a point of stability before then but that’ll be the most stable imo. Unless I’m completely wrong here, I only got in in November so ��

You know what you’re absolutely right. Idk why I didn’t think of it that way. I myself have fallen guilty of this a little

Now they have millions from their company Bitomato Cash. They’re doing much better than you.

This was covered a few weeks ago when it first happened, that’s what his joke was referring to
