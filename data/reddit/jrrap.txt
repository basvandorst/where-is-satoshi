This. If some rando is trying to give me an ultimatum then I say good riddance.

Sure Bitcoin is fallible, but consider that it's still fallible with all the geniuses and decades of programming experience that exist behind it. What does it say about any other coin that has nowhere near that kind of talent?

This dude has been predicting a bull run every other month. Pretty sure he has some heavy bags.

There's a few already out there. Waves, BitShares, Bisq, etc

Around what time does Satoshi make his last commit?

Fair enough, but what if the amount of the transaction outweigh's the rewards/incentives the watch tower's receive? A 2 btc lightning network transaction would probably outweigh the incentives a watchtower would receive for years.

Or until the price gets back up to 20k so that hodler's can unload their .25 btc

Funny you used "greedy banks". I'm pretty sure 95&amp; of the posters in this sub are just as greedy if not more so than the bankers.

Volume seemed to jump 300 million in 10 minutes, and there was 250 million tether that was recently printed...hmm

What these cars with these license plates actually say are "HODL BTC until it hits 15K-20K, then sell"

You don't want Bitcoin in your retirement account

This topic shouldn't be downvoted into oblivion.  This is a very serious issue that the community has to recognize.

Too many people got burned with the previous run up in December and January, plus there's a lot of uncertainty regarding regulation. It's the same price it was 5 months ago. I don't think it's ever falling under 1k again, but it's pretty hard for an asset to appreciate that much and maintain that price without a MASSIVE necessity for it.

Nothing but margin washing. Either an exchange or some whale that likes to see margin traders get rekt.
