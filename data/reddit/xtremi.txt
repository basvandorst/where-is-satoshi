Why is $7600 lower than $7400?

I understand. I was suspecting people might be skeptical of a free non-open source executable. I will consider setting it up on GitHub, other than that, I can only give my word, which probably isn't worth much!

There's already a donation window within the program. Working on fixing the project before setting up github.

Looking into GitHub.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:42:47
The source code is not available on GitHub. I might consider making it open source, but not yet.
Anyway, it doesn't require any keys (public or private) to be used.
The application only reads the trade history files that you import and lets you manage your trades.

I'm working on a little windows application that allows you to import trade histories from anywhere. I could use some feedback if anyone is interested to try it (free &amp; no ads).
I made a post here:

I only have experience with c++. But with the QT libraries it's not that complicated to create some UI for Windows.

Yes it's the same idea. Difference is, cointracker has a fixed set exchanges it connects with.
What I wanted to achieve, is a more generic way of importing trades. So whoever uses it can set it up to read trade output from whichever source wanted.
This also does everything offline (except of price history queries).

Thanks. Yes there is a link to the thread in my comment.

Thanks. Hehe, I wouldn't want to work in the financial sector. I'm working as a mechanical engineer, but involved in creating some applications for file processing/conversions and such. 
It is all written in C++.
I will probably put this in GitHub soon!

Yes, a spreadsheet could do a lot of this. But some of it will get quite complicated, require a lot of VBA, and might be slow.
I worked on some spreadsheet before making this. But f.ex. importing large sets of price histories slowed down the process.
Also, quickly parsing trade histories from exchanges was a pain.
