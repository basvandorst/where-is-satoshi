Samsung is the best in the business for solid state drives. Although not the exact same tech. I have high hopes for this.

9800  is our support right now since we passed the 10k support. Next would be 9500. Resistance is 10200 ish if we can pass 10k again.

Been day trading in stocks during all of 2017 *did well for myself thank god*. Cashed out scott free before the major correction. Now I'm here in bitcoin with you all. Got in at 8k. Glad to be here and to help bring her back up a bit. Cheers! I'm sure I'm not the only new fella aswell.
