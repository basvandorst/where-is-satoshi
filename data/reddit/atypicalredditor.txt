Thank you for a well thought response.
You've explained quite nicely some things that are wrong with our current monetary policy.  And I agree with you for a lot of them.  But I have some questions about Bitcoin as an alternative.
In future-bitcoin-world, nobody would be able to borrow Bitcoin because nobody would loan Bitcoin.  Why loan out something (risky) that will already, at no risk, increase in value?  It seems like the lack of borrowed money would be terrible for economic growth.
Also, more to the point, why would anyone spend Bitcoin in any forseable future?  The more frequently people adopt Bitcoin, the more its value goes up, and the more it makes sense to save it, not spend it.

It is technically impossible, but practically quite easy to dissuade businesses from accepting bitcoin.  Pick any one:
 * Make accepting bitcoin prohibitively expensive through regulation
 * Make accepting bitcoin illegal through consumer protection laws
 * Make Bitcoin perceived as (or actually) more risky, volatile, or illiquid than existing currencies
That said, I do agree with the rest of what you said.  It would be fantastic if it lead to improvements in the protocol.

You need to perfectly define some mathematical definition (or whatever the fuck you're talking about) in order to have a regulator go into a store, see a sign saying "Bitcoin accepted here" and throw down the banhammer.
Also, you're right that it would be trivial to re-invent Bitcoin as something else, and have everybody switch over to it... over and over again after each subsequent ban or regulation.  That would be really easy and everybody would be on board, and nobody would devalue the currencies due to concerns of risk or inconvenience.

You are assuming a world where the only possible currency for buying a house is Bitcoin.  Today, and for the foreseeable future, people would prefer to buy a house with dollars, because they can get a loan, and because houses are sold for dollars.
Nobody would prefer to spend their Bitcoin, nor loan their Bitcoin, because it would be a guaranteed losing bet vs. hoarding.  Therefore I do not foresee houses being exclusively paid for in Bitcion anytime soon.


That is nonsense.  To believe that 100 year light bulbs are not commonplace because dollars are inflationary is absurd.  Regardless of inflation, rational consumers will always prefer to spend less.  If somebody sold a light bulb that lasted for 100 years, consumers would buy it as long as it were cheaper (and they could spare the capital).  This is irrelevant of the currency.

Your points are, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that it is impossible to define a law to ban bitcoin because:
 * 1. A precise definition would not work because Bitcoin could be changed
 * 2. A general definition would not be possible, because it would be too general.
 * 3. It's not technically possible, Bitcoin is decentralized
Here are my refutations:
 * 1. A precise definition *would* work.  Merchants** would cease accepting Bitcoin (version 1) or else get their business shut down.  Creating Bitcoin (version 2) would mean that it would have to be re-adopted by everyone -- I find that quite daunting and even more unlikely given the risk of the new version being banned.
 * 2. A general definition isn't needed.
 * 3. It doesn't matter if it is technically not possible.  All the gov't needs to do is shut down or fine any merchant** that accepts bitcoin.
Where do we differ?
** By merchants I mean brick and mortar and US based companies.  It is simple:  See a "bitcoin accepted here" sign, and throw down the ban hammer.  Yes, I know, Bitcoin is anonymous and could still function in anonymous markets.  If Bitcoin gets limited to simply be an anonymous currency only used to buy contraband, it's value would diminish tremendously.  (We can argue that, too, if you'd like).
@_date: 2013-10-19 20:49:32
Companies' market cap are based of a variety of factors (revenue, debt, market conditions, etc) -- and since BTC does not operate like a company it's an apples to oranges comparison.
The comparison against a global value store makes much more sense than against companies.  I'm invested in BTC not because I think it will become a currency (quite certain it will fail at that), but because it's a value store that hedges against a few problems with gold (it's heavy, costly to own, transport, etc).
My personal target has always been .1% of Gold's worth, ~$700/coin.  At that point, I'm out.

My whole post is about what happens when a currency goes up in value over time.  So, yes, I do make that assumption.
You're right, it is priced in.  If one expects the bitcoin economy to grow then they should also expect an increase in their value, as there is a finite supply.  The decaying rate of new coins being infused is interesting, though, as it could turn out it provides more of an inflationary force than a deflationary one.

Why do you need to spend each paper wallet all at once?
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:41:30
A few of my guesses:
- The hype is subsiding, very few new buyers
- It turns out that Bitcoin being accepted in new places does not increase its demand.  Its inflated price accounted for wider adoption which is not happening.
- Even if there is wider adoption, places that accept Bitcoin most likely immediately sell them for USD, since they have bills to pay, and do not want the risk of holding BTC.  _In other words, if you're spending BTC, you're likely selling it._
- BTC "investors" are not in it for the long run, can no longer stomach their losses (or receding gains), and are selling.
- The market at MtGox is so incredibly thin that price fluctuation is bound to happen.
Of course, the only way to know for sure is to be MtGox and know who is buying and who is selling.
**People are concerned with BTC to USD precisely because Bitcoin is not a suitable replacement yet.**  Not saying that's what it aims to be... but if you're looking at BTC/USD that's how you're choosing to see it.

It's my job?  Really?  I buy 10 BTC/day because I hope for the best.  But I also like to plan for the worst.
I love Bitcoin and I think it's beautiful system.  However, nobody has been able to adequately convince me why Bitcoin is immune to government regulations which could cripple it's value.  No, I don't mean BTC-to-dollar value, or the fact that it can still exist even when outlawed, I mean its value as a currency that is widely adopted.  Any government could simply not allow businesses from accepting Bitcoin.
I cannot go to the corner store and buy bread with BTC.  In order for that to happen, Bitcoin will need to be formally accepted as a means of payment -- yes, formally -- because developed nations have strong protections in place for consumer confidence.  You cannot even roll out a vending machine without a permit/license... much less a Bitcoin ATM.
I am also not interested in supposing a world where bitcoin is already accepted everything -- at that point my concern is moot.  The problem is getting there.
Of more concern to me is how delusional and sometimes downright retarded this subreddit is.  The most upvoted comments are the ones that share the sentiment of "Bitcoin is unstoppable! It's perfect, and if you believe otherwise you are simply mistaken  :)".  If you post anything that at all discomforts people, they respond by downvotes, Reddit's way of sweeping concerns under the rug.  I don't take it personally, but it annoys me how I'm in a boat full of dodos, particularly ones with confidence since $/BTC has gone up.
I openly welcome responses that have sound reasoning, and I promise I will not lash out on any morons that insist banning bitcoin would be like prohibition.  I will simply ignore them, because I've discovered there are too many, and they never relent.  If it was my job to convince you bitcoin will sink, I'd have quit by now.  There's no amount of money that can change the minds of people with this amount of cognitive bias.
I also welcome all of the downvotes, because just like you (well, the majority of you), the more you disagree with me, the more I believe I'm right.

I've thought about your remark about ATMs for a bit and decided to write a separate reply to address that.
The problem seems to be that once there is a physical way to convert hard currency, such as dollars, to bitcoin you are subjected to real life governmental regulation.  That is to say, it would be quite trivial for the government to make cash-to-bitcoin ATMs illegal.
Aside from that, there are only two ways for the ATM owner to do this in a risk-free or low-risk manner.
* Accept the dollars at a premium to some index where he/she could convert them back to dollars.  That is, act as a proxy to MtGox and exchange give you slightly less bitcoin than could be purchased instantly.  At this point, MtGox exchange (or whatever exchange has the most liquidity, reputation, etc) becomes the centralization.
* Be able to convert the BTC to tangible goods.  This is becoming more and more common, but will always remain hampered by the fact that the people offering these goods will only do so if they can hedge the risk against currency that already exists... in which case it's the same problem as above.
In short, sellers of goods or bitcoin, will for the foreseeable future not be incentivized to price in bitcoin if not able to price against a currency already in use, such as the dollar.  It's a catch 22, and it's not helped that currencies like the dollar have a 99.9999999999999% market share.

My point is that alcohol and bitcoin is not an apples to apples comparison.  I find it remarkably unlikely that there would be a worldwide revolt causing anarchy if a currency used by 1% of people were outlawed.  There's not really a problem with dollars.
Imagine if I told you that American Express credit cards, which are much more popular than bitcoins, are no longer allowed -- do you think there would be a worldwide revolt?

I've been buying daily since it was $25.  Sold half of what I bought when it jumped up to ~$40 just now.  Going to wait for it to go below 30 then start buying aggressively -- then I'm in it for long haul (unless there's another bubble).
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:37:49
I think at this point it is meta-speculation -- that is, people speculating that there will be more speculators entering the market.  If you look at it that way, it's a reasonable buy.  There are a lot of buyers queued up and it keeps getting more and more press.
That's not going to last forever, though.  The more people hold bitcoin, the more susceptible it is to having the bottom fall out when people decide there aren't any more suckers buying and that really they are holding bitcoin purely for it's value relative to the dollar (and not to use BTC to buy things).
I've decided I'm not going to buy or sell anymore... I've put in as much as I'm willing to risk, have sold my initial stake so that I'm only left with profit, and I'll see how this goes.  I imagine I'm not the only one who is going to have the mentality of "well, I made enough -- time to sell!"
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:01:33
This highlights the reasons I am bearish on BTC-as-a-currency, though I still own them and believe in their long-term growth in value.
For the average person, obtaining bitcoins is a pain in the ass and managing them (wallets) is confusing. There's also not much reason to obtain them beside the fact that their price might go up, as anything you can buy with BTC you can buy with dollars.
Unfortunately, as you solve the first two problems (ease of obtaining them, and better understanding of them), the third problem (price rising) gets worse.
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:47:27
This is true if there's very little economic growth, and if everyone is already using bitcoin.
But fixed money supply doesn't work as well if you want economic growth.  Fixed currency supply doesn't halt growth or crash an economy, but it provides a lot of friction for growth, since money won't be spent as freely.
Economic growth means more currency needs to exist.  You either create more, or each unit becomes worth more.  If each unit becomes worth more, then simply holding money is more appealing than spending it (not in all cases, but certainly in _more_ cases).  Yes, the growth rate will reach an equilibirum, but the result is a growth in economy that is slower than if you had a growing supply of currency.

So I've thought about this a bit more.  I'm willing to buy a depreciating computer because I can extract more value from it than the amount it depreciates.

What's the advantage of that?  Is it to incentivize mining?  Miners already would already be incentivized by the fact that more and more coin will be minted.  Not sure I see the value in re-rewarding miners.

Your scenario hinges on there being a flourishing, stable Bitcoin economy with which I can spend Bitcoins on anything I need.  This is response  that I insisted one should not respond with.  There is no reason to believe that there will exist a flourishing, table Bitcoin economy which which I can spend Bitcoins on anything if there is this problem of deflation causing nobody to spend (and thus nobody to sell) in Bitcoin.
I agree, Bitcoin would be fantastic if everyone used it and the price were stabilized.  But how does it get to that point?
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:31:32
Finally, somebody that gets my point.  All it takes to make Bitcoin much less valuable is for merchants to not want to accept it.  All it takes for that to happen is:
 * Accepting bitcoin being prohibitively expensive
 * Accepting bitcoin being illegal
 * Bitcoin being more risky, volatile, or illiquid than existing currencies
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:46:07
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:28:04


Prices don't depreciate, assets do.  Depreciation is simply "the decrease in value of assets over time", which I think we can agree is the case with computers.


Everything you can pay for is subject to inflation and deflation.  So?
My original question still stands.  So what if people purchase things that depreciate in value?  This says absolutely nothing about how a deflationary currency would or would not work.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:21:05
I can see your point, and I do agree smarter spending is a good idea. BTC will certainly "tweak" incentives, but it's not by a small amount -- it's by _at least_ the current rate of inflation (that's assuming BTC remains constant), and likely much more (roughly correlated with how widely it adopted it is) which is quite substantial.
Maybe this is good because it's a natural cap on how fast bitcoin can grow, kind of like a "growth limit" because anytime it starts to increase in value so much, people spend it less until it reaches equilibrium.  I think it's very possible that this "growth limit" is far too low to sustain any substantially sized modern day economy.  Maybe it will trigger debt-free economies that reach equilibrium, which would be very cool.

Documented proof of what?  Regardless of what you say, there are probably cases which would both support and refute it.  That is to say that other situations will certainly have been affected by countless variables other than simply "deflationary spiral".
Debt-based currency or not, as a consumer I am faced with the decision of whether or not I should buy something.  I consider the utility I get from the product, and what it will be worth over time (even if that value goes directly to 0, like with bread).
As an example, take a house.  Today I could buy one for $X, and sell it for $X * (inflation) * (growth or decline in home values) after, say 10 years.  In Bitcoin land it's the same, I can sell it for $X * (inflation) * (growth or decline in home values).  (In Bitcoin land, deflation is &lt;1, while today it is &gt;1).
When comparing today vs Bitcoin land, it doesn't matter if home values go up or down -- in both scenarios it has the same effect.  So my examples will ignore this -- just assume home values remain constant relative to all other things.
Currently, I can buy a house for $100k, sell it in 10 years for $120k (let's say there was 20% inflation) -- I'm even, as I now have $120k to spend, which is equivalent to $100k 10 years ago.  I could buy a similar house as I did 10 years ago.
In Bitcoin land I can buy a house for 1000BTC, then sell it for less BTC, because each BTC is worth more, let's say 800BTC.  I'm now out 200BTC vs. if I didn't buy the house.  I could have just held onto my 1000BTC and it'd now be worth 20% more, I could buy a nicer house.  So, before I buy the house, I ask myself:  "Is it worth 200BTC to own this house for 10 years?"
It doesn't matter that my example uses a house, it could apply to anything -- things that increase in value, and things that decrease in value.  The problem is that there is a cost to spend money, vs a cost to holding it.
On a macro scale, this applies to _all_ things _all_ market participants would purchase, lease, rent, etc.  It's not necessarily a deflationary spiral, but it just means less spending and less growth.  That's all.  It will still work, but growth will be limited by this, and that's typically not a good thing.

IMO the biggest threat to bitcoin is government.  Despite the groupthink that government can't touch bitcoin, they can certainly make owning and using it extremely risky, which will in turn drastically limit the demand for it.

In my mind Bitcoin mimics gold.  It's a good place to put money if you want to shield yourself from market volatility, world turmoil, etc.  However, if you're in it to hedge risk... then Bitcoin sure does seem a bit risky!
Things get better with time, though.  The more Bitcoin grows, the more legitimate it becomes as a value store.  But as a currency I cannot see it succeeding... unless someone intelligent can explain.

I've been discussing this with people here for the past week.  Most people have the opinion that "if I'm going to buy something, I'm going to buy something, regardless of the currency", which is just flat out not how populations of people make purchasing decisions.
To answer your question concretely, you'd part with your BTC if:
- If you want to purchase something anonymously
- If the goods or services you wish to purchase are only sold for BTC
- If there's a steep enough discount to account for opportunity cost
- You believe BTC will lose value over time
- If you're irrational (eg: were given BTC for free, are filthy rich, etc)
In terms of spending a deflationary currency, it makes the most sense to think of it as a built-in depreciation of all assets.  That is, using your example, whatever you buy now in BTC will be worth 10% of what it would normally be worth in 10 years (in BTC).  Some things are still worth buying, most things aren't.
A concrete example:  You buy something whose value is always constant relative to all others.  Of course, nothing has this guaranteed property, but let's say something did.  How about a coupon for 100 free McDonalds hamburgers.  You spend 1BTC on it, and in 10 years you can sell it for .1BTC (since all BTCs are more valuable).  Well, shit, you're out .9BTC.  With a dollars, you could buy the coupon for $200, then sell it for $300 in 10 years (assuming dollars inflate by 50%) -- you're net even with respect to dollars.  You can still buy $300 of things, which as long as all things are priced the same relative to McDonalds hamburgers (this was the assumption), you're even.
It is the elephant in the room that people are trying to sweep under the rug.  What it really means, to me, is that BTC's greatest use is as an alternative to gold, not as a currency.

It's going to rebound to about $40-45 in the next 24hrs, then plummet again to lower 20's over the course of about a week.  Finally, it will level off in mid/upper 20's in about 14 days -- that's about where the previous peak is the new norm which is a comfortable spot.
Without a substantial adoption by brick and mortar or large online retailers, or at least a very easy and liquid way to trade to/from real life useful currency, there's no reason it should be above a $1b market cap -- which is about $50 per piece [I'm including unmined coins].
Have fun, everybody.

I'm not sure I follow completely.  I think I lack a full understanding of how transactions work.  Could you explain what, exactly, happens when I transfer n BTC + y Fee from one address to another?
I assume my client contacts all connected nodes, each one will update their own ledger and propogate outward, until the entire network agrees.  If that's true, how does the "y" fee get split up among everyone?  Does it just get sent directly to the address that originated the block?  If so, what's the incentive for everyone other than the originator of the block?  What happens if that miner becomes inactive?  I'm just shooting the shit here and have no real idea of what technically happens.  I'm sure it's all been answered, and I'd be grateful if you could explain or point me in the direction (except for a link to the entire white paper on bitcoin).

Further, they tend to employ this fallacy in an antagonistic tone as if it's somehow obvious, and anyone believe otherwise is a retard.  It's all quite defensive and pitiful.

The prohibition was before my time, so sadly I don't remember it :).  However, I can point to bans on lots and lots of things that were quite effective, despite those things being quite popular, profitable, and/or useful.
Everything you have said might be true if BTC reaches critical mass and becomes accepted everywhere.
However, it needs to survive that long, despite there being vast incentives by government and status quo to kill it.  What makes you so certain that BTC will survive that long and not be squashed by the powers that be?  It may be *technically* impossible to do so, but it is easy to make it *practically* impossible to use -- in which case it never gets to the point of ubiquity.

Explain that people who want to transfer usable currency ($) to another person far away.

Assuming they both have internet, don't get hacked, and have a way to convert BTC back to $ because, you know, they probably intend on spending it.  Hopefully the value of BTC doesn't drop, oh, say 20% in the meantime.

I think the difference is that I can purchase an older computer for cheaper in the future.
From the decision standpoint of purchase a computer today or not, I can decide not to, but not actually lose any utility, since I can buy the same computer later for cheaper, or buy a better computer for the same price.

It is my belief that regulation is both inevitable and incentivized by the powers that be (governement, big banks, cc companies, etc), that regulation would also be trivial to implement, and that regulation would be detrimental to the value of bitcoin.

Las Vegas makes sense in a lot of ways.  People are paying for a product:  gambling, excitement, entertainment.  A good or service does not need to be necessary in order for it to be appealing to people.  Casinos are subject to the same market pressures as any other business -- competition, marketing costs, etc.
My definition of rational is that you wouldn't pay off a low-interest debt before a high-interest debt.  In the same sense, you wouldn't spend something which will increase in value before you spend something that will decrease in value.

If I were you, I'd sell off 50 and keep the rest as profit.
Say it goes to $500.  You would have turned your $10k into ~$80k.
Now, say it goes to $25.  You would lose $5k.
Which would you regret less?  For me, making $80k instead of $100k (an 800% profit vs a 1000% profit) isn't as bad as losing $5000 (a 50% loss).  In my mind, both scenarios are equally likely.

I'm not sure that the price would spike rather than drop.
Suppose the government did not allow vendors to accept BTC.  They made it outright illegal, and they monitored it.  If any business was caught accepting BTC for goods or services, it would be shut down.
What kind of economy could possibly be built off of bitcoin?  No already-legal business would want to accept it, for fear of being shut down.
Those holding BTC are left with no way to spend it on reputable, non-anonymous businesses.  BTC would only be valuable for those seeking illegal goods -- all others would liquidate their BTC for something they could buy bread with.  Dollars, for example.  That would cause a price drop, not a spike.
Finally, another thing to consider:  If banning BTC would cause a price spike, then why does the opposite (BTC becoming more widely adopted) also cause a price spike?

Not rude at all, very informative rather.
It is not difficult to send money using the traditional banking system.  Everyone accepts credit cards, which are essentially instant.  Sure, there's a fee involved, but at least I can instantly obtain any goods, from essentially anywhere, instantly, with a line of credit.  Why can't I buy bitcoin with a credit card?
A month ago I was very much on the bandwagon with bitcoin, but the deeper I dig, the more friction I encounter.  I've about had it and am ready to dismiss it as "currency for nerds" -- I, myself, being a nerd.  It is theoretically brilliant and I love the concept and the design to pieces, but pragmatically it is an absurdity to own/buy/transfer bitcoin.
I've spent two weeks researching this, am reasonably intelligent, am a software engineer, have a stack of cash, and I *still* only own 15 bitcoin.  How can this ever catch on?

I agree there needs to be a first mover advantage.  There already is one built into the system - miners compete with one another to discover blocks.  So if there are less miners, it is easier to get rewarded.  Also, if there are less miners joining on a daily basis, then you compete with fewer miners for longer amounts of time.
Would you agree that this is already a substantial first mover advantage?  If rewards were fixed, even, you still stand to obtain bitcoin hyperbolicly faster than those that join after you. 
Furthermore, would you would agree that first mover advantage is not black or white?  The protocol could be to cut rewards by n% every z years.  A higher n or z favors early adopters.   Besides decaying reward time, there are an infinite number of ways to draw a curve (reward size vs. time) that ends up at zero and has an integral of 21,000,000.
So why, specifically, is it to decrease reward size 50% every 4 years?

Currently businesses do not accept bitcoin, and they are not crumbling.  Businesses only accept bitcoin as much as it can be backed by the dollar.  For example, any site selling real goods will alter their BTC price to ensure they can sell the BTC to make a dollar profit.
Look, I entirely understand the ideals and possibilities of the world on bitcoin.  If I had a choice, we'd all use bitcoin.  But, right now, that's not how the world works.  You are ignoring how costly the transition of dollar/whatever to bitcoin is -- in your mind the world already is hooked on bitcoin.  It's hard to see somebody so delusional.

That is not how statistics works.  There is no "average" -- unless you meant "I was 50% likely to have found a block in 208 days".  You'd be wrong there, too.  But let's see why...
What are the odds that you find a block within 208 days?  Well, it is the odds that you *don't* find a block, subtracted from 100%.
So let's get the odds of not finding a block for 208 consecutive days.  Each day you have a .48% (.12/25) chance of finding a block.  Put another way, that's a 99.52% chance of *not* finding a block.  Now how likely is that to happen 208 times in a row?  It is .9952^208 .. which is 36.8%.  36.8% chance of *not* finding a block after 208 days... which means  63.2% likely to have found a block in 208 days.
The correct way to approach the question is take a certainly, let's say 50%, and solve from there.  In other words, "how many days would I need to mine in order to be 50% certain to find a block?".
To solve that, you do log(.5)/log(.9952)... which is 144 days.

With a deflationary currency, the problem is that before you purchase something you need to assess whether or not you'll extract enough utility from it for it to be worthwhile.  This is extremely difficult to gauge as you won't know what the rate of deflation is, and so purchasing things actually becomes risky, which I would assume leads to less spending.  Not necessarily good or bad, as it could mean more responsible spending.  But it could also mean very slow economic growth.
We have the same issue now with inflation, but in reverse:  You need to ask yourself what you can buy that will increase in value over the rate of inflation (or will provide enough utility to compensate for the difference).
Our argument is about whether or not buying computers (with USD) provides any supporting evidence that consumers would be just as willing to spend a deflationary currency, and I'm not convinced it does (I was briefly, though!).

That is not true.  It would be devastating enough if the US said "accepting BTC is illegal."  It would take a long, long time for bitcoin to usurp all other currencies to the point of weakening the US dollar, and during that time there is a ridiculous amount of incentive (for example, the loss of billions of dollars of profit) for everyone else in the world to follow lead and also ban BTC.

@_date: 2013-02-23 02:44:29
Yes, you're right.  Bitcoins are incredible and are amazing.  As a merchant, I should sell everything in bitcoin because although the rest of the world uses dollars, euros, credit cards, etc, bitcoins are cool or something.  I can sell in bitcoin, then convert back into useful currency.  That sounds like a huge value add.
As a merchant, I much prefer to hold onto bitcoin, because I can order pizza and drugs with it.  I can either buy overpriced things in bitcoin, or I can convert it back to dollars and get more with my money than with bitcoin.  Clearly I'd prefer to hold onto the bitcoin, because a few times I've ordered beer with it successfully. What am I supposed to do with outdated paper money that can buy me real tangible goods at every store everwhere?  Convert it to bitcoin, that's what.
You are right about bitcoin being better, and this explains why everything priced in BTC is always more expensive than if I first converted BTC to dollars and purchased with that.  This is because everybody prefers bitcoins, not dollars.  Nobody needs bread or to pay rent.  Besides, in the future, my landlord will accept rent in bitcoin because he too prefers to pay a premium on anything he purchases in bitcoin.
Also, you are absolutely correct that I'll always be guaranteed to convert my bitcoins back into cash, because everybody will always want to use bitcoins, even if they are banned or prohibited, because I can support my family with web hosting, cupcakes, pizza, drugs, and other things available online.  As a bonus, if there are any regulations on bitcoin (what this entire thread is supposed to be about), I prefer to do business with anonymous entities and BTC helps me do that.  I like buying bread from strangers.  I can also just buy and sell black market goods -- this will work because I like the risk of being thrown in jail, and I know for a fact I can go to my local Whole Foods and trade them heroin for fresh produce.  There is no need for the dollar anymore.
Also, you will always be able to buy web hosting with bitcoins, even if web hosts cannot convert them back into dollars.  This is for the same reason.  The people running these web hosts prefer only to be able to buy bread for their children through anonymous online retailers, not their corner store that accepts stupid paper currency.  The fact that any goods or services bough with bitcoin are actually priced directly as a function of bitcoin-to-dollar is evidence of this.
Finally, you are so correct about how easy it is to get bitcoin.  Nobody cares about the dollar to bitcoin exchange rate -- if I see BTC are trading at $25, then I'll be fine paying $30 each for them because it is so easy to do at several brand new bitcoin sites that I'm sure I can trust.  All I have to do is use weird payment methods -- credit cards and such are so stupid and inconvenient so I'm glad they don't accept those payment methods.
This is true with ecommerce, too.  Merchants clearly prefer bitcoin because although the volume is orders of magnitude less and they will sell much less, the transaction fee is $.000001 instead of $.30.  It is totally worth narrowing your market by 100,000 fold so that you can save $.29 on each transaction.  That's just good business -- I'm not about to throw away hard earned $.28 that could be put into bitcoin to buy cupcakes.  As icing on the cake, as a consumer I'm positive I can trust whoever I send my BTC too, because they've been in business for weeks, have no reputation, might be anonymous, and could rip me off without me able to do anything.  This vastly increases consumer confidence, and thus sales for any merchant accepting bitcoin.
I'm sorry that I'm not as visionary as you -- I will convert my dollars into BTC and buy cupcakes, then I will trade those cupcakes for bread and rent.

In the near-term, the discount cannot be too steep, otherwise vendors will lose money, at least on a dollar basis, which matters since they require dollars to pay the bills (currently).  Long term, in an all-btc economy, it could be possible.
The only way to offer deep discounts near-term is if businesses can afford to eat into their margin or utilize capital and/or line of credit to cover the costs.  Businesses also need to assume the risk that the value of bitcoins may not increase as much as the consumers are demanding (by way of requiring discounts) it does.

This advice will sound very boring and cliche, but it's truth.
It depends on what your investment strategy is and how it fits in with the rest of your holdings.
BTC is highly speculative and as such is *extremely* risky.  When it comes to extremely high risk ventures, only invest what you are willing to lose.  I mean it.
Despite what this subreddit and the past 60 days of bitcoin will lead you to believe, there is a very real chance bitcoins can lose their value tremendously quickly.  We might be in a bubble, we might not.  Perhaps MtGox will get hacked, or perhaps a weakness will be found, or perhaps legislation will look unfavorably on bitcoin.  Hell, maybe everyone will just "get over" Bitcoin since it currently has very little actual utility.  You cannot know what will happen.
My personal belief of BTC's insane growth is that it is entirely irrational and entirely speculative.  I do not believe many people are using bitcoins, but rather that they are buying into the idea of a decentralized digital currency, as well as something that is potentially "the next big thing".  It's really an entirely new type of asset, and people are jumping in on the bandwagon because the price keeps shooting up.  I'm not convinced that the market is valuing BTC based on its utility -- which is fine -- but this won't last forever.
Now imagine if your $50,000 became, say, $5,000.  If you could live with that, then read on.  Otherwise, don't bother or consider investing an amount you could live with losing.
Also consider what your other assets and liabilities are.  Are you diversified enough such that you could withstand a loss in BTC value, as well as a loss in stocks, for example?  Do you need cash to pay off debt?  Are you OK with going broke?  Do you have a guaranteed source of income?  These are all things to consider.
I don't know how much $50,000 is to you, so I cannot answer that question.  I personally would say putting 10% of your savings into Bitcoin is the extreme high-end for any sensible person.  Also realize that if you're after risk, there are alternatives such as options, trading on margin, angel investing (if you're qualified), etc.
Finally, please consider that you are asking thousands of people who have invested a lot of their money into Bitcoin.  The responses will be incredibly biased.  Now, that doesn't mean they are incorrect, it just means you need to be skeptical.  For some straight, less biased advice, ask an investment subreddit.
Whatever your decision is, you're going to have to live with it.  So take your time and don't act on emotion.  Could you live with losing all $50,000?  Could you live with only investing $10,000 and seeing it go to $100,000, knowing that could have been $500,000 if you'd taken more risk?

Cities do not have strict limits, they typically expand to accommodate new growth.  They are not scarce.  Nor is land infinitely divisible -- you can divide it but at some point it becomes too small to be useful.
A typical city starts at the center, and developers build around the center since their buildings can provide more value than the land is being sold for.  If the land is being sold for too much, developers look to other cities to develop, or they move further from the center where prices are cheaper.  Anyway, over time, the city limits are stretched and the overall value of the city increases.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is _truly_ scarce.  It can only grow so much.  And so, everybody buys their plot of land and sits on it knowing that its price will only go up.  Except, no can build there because the prices are so high they couldn't possibly turn a profit, and there's no growth because all land owners are squatting.
What ends up happening is extraordinarily slow growth.

This is not complicated, and you're getting hung up on semantics when it really doesn't matter.
In order for a currency to have value, it needs to be well known.  If it's called Bitcoin, that's what the ban would be on.  If something new comes up and reaches the point of being well known, that's what would be banned.  It's not complicated.
You're saying that if in the US we banned Euros, that the ban could be subverted by calling the Euros something else.  That would not work, because the currency says "Euro" on it, and can be used as such.  You're also suggesting that Euros could simply be printed on different paper and renamed -- fine -- but nobody will want to accept them unless they were popular (aka: had value to other people).  If they became popular then once again, it's easy to ban.
Really, just imagine a ban on bitcoin.  It is not difficult to monitor.  If somebody says they accept Bitcoin, throw down the ban hammer on them.  If they call it "cryptocashy coins" then who the hell is their target market?  If "cryptowashy" coins *are* bitcoins, then it's still banned.  Not complicated.
If you are suggesting it's trivial for the world to transition from using Bitcoin to using Bitcoin Version 2, then there might be more difficulty in banning. But, if that's the case, what's the value in Bitcoin (or any replacement currency) if they are a dime a dozen?

It's not a matter of your opinion, it absolutely does not refute that claim.  It doesn't support it either.  It's entirely unrelated except for the fact that both involve situations where prices decrease.

The difference is that in a "depreciating currency" (I think you mean _appreciating_ currency, since its buying value goes _up_, but so long as we're on the same page it doesn't matter), when you purchase something, no matter what it is, you need to extract utility from it at whatever the pace of appreciation of the currency is, otherwise you lose.
With computers, it could work.  With something like real estate (assume the value is constant), you'd need the value of the real estate to go up at the same rate as appreciation, otherwise you're losing net buying power.
edit:  In other words, I can buy real estate today, sell it in 10 years, and have the same buying power as I did 10 years ago.  With a deflationary currency, if I did the same I'd end up having much less buying power vs. holding onto the money for 10 years, and thus I might not make the purchase.

This is more incentive for the US government, and others, to squash bitcoin as quickly as they can.

I'm wondering why you posted in the first place.
It is pretty easy to isolate yourself -- just stop interacting with others.  If you find this to be impossible, or the pressures of the world and idiot strangers to be too much, you can also terminate your existence rather easily.  You have a lot of options.
Seeking opportunities to be an asshole to others serves very little of your goal of isolation.  All you really need is the ability to make money without interacting with people.  Focus on that instead.  If your intent is to do that with bitcoin, then it would be in your best interest to evangelize its use rather that dissuade it.
Of course, I don't believe you truly want isolation.  I think you want to find company that you feel comfortable around.  Isolation is one way to achieve this, but as you are finding out it is not very practical.  You, again, have more options.

If bitcoin is only used in black markets, then it's only valuable to those either buying or selling black market goods.  That would severely *devalue* it.
I'm not sure why you are so hung up on the Streisand effect.  If bitcoin were banned, the only people who would really wish to acquire it are those buying or selling blackmarket goods.  These people would likely already be using bitcoin, so there's no real gain there.  For everyone else, it's an interesting story, but they would have no use for bitcoin.

Surely you agree that when people purchase things, they do so based partly on assumptions of depreciation.  You can hopefully agree that some things depreciate faster than others.  For example, food depreciates rather quickly, while a house may not.
With a deflationary currency, essentially _all_ things will depreciate at whatever their natural rate is (food will still depreciate faster than houses), _plus_ whatever the rate that the currency increases in value.
Now since we (hopefully) agreed that people consider depreciation when purchases, then this new currency will change how people spend, and they will spend less.

I await your response if provides useful information (such as what stock_blocker has been offering) it is other than: "Thanks for the advice freud but you are an idiot." or a similar attempt to quell your insecurities with harsh ridicule.

I think accepting cash might pose an issue.
There is a reason that all vending machines are regulated -- good luck having a Bitcoin ATM pass the exam.  I'm sure the examiners will understand a p2p decentralized virtual currency dispenser just fine.
Aside from that, those offering the service can have fun with all the disputes that "the machine ate my money".  Once enough of these complaints get escalated to government officials, then you're in for a good time.

It is not hard to understand.  I am unafraid of investing in other things, such as shares of businesses, other currencies, bonds, etc, because there is very little incentize to ban those things.  The risk of that happening is incredibly low, and it would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
There is, however, ample incentive to ban bitcoin, as it provides an easy way for harboring taxable dollars, trading illegal goods, etc.  From the government's perspective, it is a good idea to ban a currency which allows this sort of anonymity.

Consider the ramifications if Bitcoin were no longer allowed to be accepted by business in the US and other actual economic drivers.  It would be worth exactly the same as karma points.

Great response, I like your style.
I'll try to give some expansion...
People sell gold to get fiat because the world works with fiat.  Everyone accepts it, gets paid in it, trusts it (some more than others), etc.  (If you don't trust it, you buy gold, and transfer to fiat when you need to spend it.)
However, this does not make gold fine as a currency.  While it might be true that there is incentive for me to put *savings* in gold, there's no real incentive for me to *spend* my gold, especially if I can instead spend my dollars which are *guaranteed* to lose their value (due to inflation).  Likewise, there's no reason for me to pay people in gold -- I'd much rather offload these soon-to-be-worth-less dollars on them.
In other words, any rational person, given the choice, would rather spend a depreciating (fiat) asset than an appreciating (gold, btc) one.
I do agree that BTC is (possibly) superior to gold... but I disagree that gold, or BTC, are suitable currencies.

Regarding your loan -- I cannot capitalize your 1 BTC quickly enough to pay you back .1BTC a week.  You are charging me an exorbitant amount of interest!
With regards to running the miner, this is another form of interest.  Can't I just pay you x BTC to run the miner yourself?
There's literally no point in you loaning out your BTC, because there is always a risk of default.  Unless, of course, BTC is the only currency we can agree on... which is not the case.

Three weeks ago I raised concerns of the possibility of government regulation and was met with a torrent of downvotes and ridicule.  I got a whole thread dedicated to calling me an arbiter of FUD.
This subreddit is delusional.  I don't mean that in a derogatory sense, but rather as a matter of fact.  This subreddit is an echo chamber composed of those invested in Bitcoin, myself included, and it's very dangerous to let it cloud your judgement.  On top of that, the idealism behind Bitcoin is beautiful, fair, and just -- but this alone does not guarantee success.  The takeaway: **consider upvotes to indicate hope, not fact.**
The problem with Bitcoin is that you cannot go to the corner store to buy bread with it -- and the government has the power to stop this from ever being possible.  It really is that simple.

Not sure why you're being defensive about this.  Besides, the central banks don't have much to do with overall transfer -- the _vast_ majority of transactions are off their books. (eg:  I buy something from Walmart -- central bank doesn't have access to that transaction)


I want to know what amount of BTC are _spent_.  That is, what amount are exchanged for good and services, not counting:
- Currency (MtGox, etc)
- Bets

@_date: 2013-02-21 02:10:00
I am going to be frank here. This is the dumbest reply yet, and six idiots have agreed with you.
It is dumb for these reasons:
* You've selected one example from history of something being banned, or not banned, and equated it to bitcoin existing in modern day conditions.  Bitcoins are not cars, and it's not the year 1850.
* Cars were not primarily used to perform illegal activity, such as robbing banks.
* Cars did not marginalize the government's ability to collect taxes.
* Cars offered a massive technological and economic gain to society.
* Cars did not make it easier to harbor money from being taxed.
* Cars did not primarily facilitate the buying and selling of illegal goods.
* Cars are not a currency.
* [Cars actually *were* regulated at first.](
* New laws were formed around the use of cars.  For instance, before cars existed it was not illegal to run people over with cars.  Now you are no longer allowed to run people over with cars.  You cannot drive through red lights, either.  There is a whole body of laws and regulations surrounding the use of cars.
What you said sounds like it could make sense.  But really, it's babble.

It really comes down to when you start buying in.  If you started both strategies at the same time, the 7x one wins since you buy in 7x on day 1.  If you start the daily strategy first, it wins since you buy 6x at slightly cheaper.
But after that, both strategies are equivalent.  There's some slight initial difference which counts for less and less as you continue.  In other words, having paid slightly more or less on the first week won't matter much after you do the strategy for several weeks.
If you would just sit down and fucking think about it, this thread wouldn't need to be 8 levels deep.

I would bet their ASICs have worked perfectly well since October and they've been slowly ramping up their own mining.
Put yourself in the shoes of someone sitting on 10TH/s  (~1500BTC/day at today's difficulty).  Would you rather receive $40k in BTC today, or ship away your hardware to people whose money you already hold?  Only when future sales of their product are *really* at stake will they start shipping.  That's going to happen soon -- other ASICs will enter the market and push up difficultly, lowering their daily take of BTC, and then they'll figure it's time to liquidate and instead become a hardware company.
Right now it would make no sense to ship away ASICs.  Nobody is that benevolent.
tldr:  ASIC suppliers are mining. Expect shipping delays until difficulty rises.

Thank you for your informative post.
I think you are vastly underestimating how easy it would be to prevent bitcoin from being an acceptable payment option in brick and mortar stores, by credit card companies, etc, *right now*.  Perhaps in the future if there's massive adoption (eg, 1/2 of all stores accept it, or CC companies let you pay your bills in BTC, etc) it would spark an outrage, but *until then* it seems that it is at risk of serious regulation.  Especially since, as you've noted, it's not in government or corporations best interest to allow it to flourish to the point of massive adoption.
Yes, technically it is *impossible* to stop bitcoin from being transacted.  Practically, it is not at all a challenge to disincentivize business from accepting bitcoin.  The government could quite easily reprimand any business based in the US for accepting bitcoin -- just as they can reprimand a business for partaking in any of thousands of illegal business practices.
Logistics aside, I agree that this type of ban would not work because it might spark an outrage.  This is only true if the Bitcoin user base is large enough to have an effective outrage.  Bitcoin does not currently have that type of adoption.  And before it gets that massive adoption, it needs to dodge regulation.  I entirely understand how a ban or regulation becomes much less feasible in a world where bitcoin is massively adopted, my concern is *getting to that point in the first place*.
It would not surprise me if US gov't decided to ban the acceptance of bitcoin for any US based businesses, under the guise that BTC is used primarily for black market goods and that businesses should not help build an economy that allows for easy anonymous drug trade.  Would it surprise you?
Until Bitcoin is backed by a really large player (like a credit card processor, or another government) it will remain a risky currency that can only reliably be used for risky business.  If you're OK only using your BTC to buy contraband, because you value contraband, then fine, you don't need to be worried.  If you instead want to spend your BTC on tangible goods from reputable sources (eg: corner store, whole foods, amazon.com), then the decentralized, zero-trust, etc, architecture of Bitcoin will not suffice -- it needs to be a sanctioned means of payment.
In the words of the EFF:  "Bitcoin raises untested legal concerns related to securities law, the Stamp Payments Act, tax evasion, consumer protection and money laundering, among others."  -- This is the modern day risk that Bitcoin holds.  It will not go away until it is officially sanctioned or widely enough adopted to avoid governmental intervention.

Bitcoin has very little intrinsic value at this point.  It's only value is perceived scarcity, a currency for anonymously participating in black markets, and the tiny potential to replace modern currencies -- the probability of which people here are far too optimistic and confident of.
When it's big news that you can now buy Papa John's with BTC, and yet it is also claimed that a ban on it would only increase it's value, you know something is off with market perception.
People also seem so hung up on the ideals behind bitcoin rather than the actual logistics and pragmatism of it.  Just because something is more beautiful, more fair, or more perfect, does not mean it will win out in the long run, particularly when it faces an *massive* uphill battle against the status quo, who are incentivized for causing it to fail.
Yet, people here insist it is just *that much* better than currency, despite the fact you cannot really use BTC anywhere.  There is simply no incentive for businesses to sell things in bitcoin in a manner not directly tied to their true currency of choice.  Why is it that everywhere BTC is taken, it is linked directly to dollar prices?  This is because you can buy useful things with dollars, and not bitcoins.
Still, I think it's a very interesting concept and am putting in a small amount of money in the off chance it grows into something more than proof-tokens of a delusional mob.  This is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-02-20 07:02:47
Excellent points, and thank you for contributing and encouraging everyone to explore this topic.
A governmental ban does not need to be synchronized in order to be effective at crushing the bitcoin economy.
Consider, as a thought experiment, the US banning Bitcoin as an accepted currency.  Sure, it's technically not possible to do this, but practically it is quite easy.  If a business accepts bitcoin, it gets shut down by the government.  US citizens holding BTC would sell (price drop), unless they were going to spend those BTC on illegal things anyway.
Now, consider the state of BTC then.  For US citizens, it's worthless (and risky) to hold.  And for everyone else, they are at the whim of their government following the US's lead.  Which, by the way, they are quite incentivized to do both from a governmental aspect (ability to collect taxes) *as well as* from corporations (banks) lobbying to keep their cash cows in place.  So it's rather risky to hold BTC, and to accept BTC, and you're probably better off ignoring it completely unless you want to do sketchy things.
I don't think a ban is that far-fetched -- it's not difficult to make the argument that an anonymized currency poses a great threat:  it's hard to collect taxes, it's easy to launder money, it's easy to buy/sell illicit materials.  Hell, maybe BTC really is too powerful for it's own good.
But you're right, there may always be a market for BTC in whatever economies can thrive off of anonymity -- but if that's the only realm BTC is used for, well, it's kind of pointless.  It's basically tradeable karma -- a currency for a small community of people.  You can't actually buy bread with it, so why bother?
And that's basically what it comes down to:  If you can't spend it, what's the value?  Combine that with:  the government can shut down businesses that accept it.
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:43:32
You can buy and sell bitcoin regardless of what the reward size is -- this fact is irrelevant.
I am asking why it was decided to have reward size initially large and for it to decrease over time.  It overly reward first movers who already have the advantage of less competition and mining while there is slower growth (means they get to mine with less competition for longer amount of time).

@_date: 2013-02-21 01:52:40
It would be very easy to prohibit brick and mortar business from accepting bitcoin.  It would also be quite trivial to ban any non-anonymous website, eg: Amazon, from accepting bitcoin.
That would be an extremely effective ban.
Could bitcoin still be used to buy/sell black legal or illegal goods, insofar as the buyers and sellers could remain anonymous, but the risks of doing that would prevent anyone from using bitcoin to purchase *legal* goods. Thus, bitcoin would be left as a currency for black market goods.
In my opinion, that's a failure.  I have no desire to hold a currency that can only purchase illegal goods.

I think the flaw in your reasoning is that depreciation is somehow equivalent to deflation since in both cases the price of something drops.
Certain products' prices drop because more compelling products are produced later, either due to advances in technology or competitors coming along.  This is distinct from deflation, which increases overall buying power per unit currency, and causes prices to drop across the board (not just for electronics).
The fact that consumers purchase deflationary goods says nothing (positive or negative) about sustainability of a deflationary currency, as consumers are purchasing these goods based on their value relative to other available products.

Bitcoin is, currently, quite useless.  Aside from speculation, the only reason to buy Bitcoin is to spend it on things that fiat cannot buy -- virtual goods with anonymity, for example.
The climb in prices earlier this year was due to its first mainstream appearance -- and since then the novelty and fascination of it is wearing off.  Where are all the Bitcoin ATMs?
