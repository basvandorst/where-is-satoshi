Most coins are pegged to bitcoin in value, look at their value to bitcoin... it holds pretty stable. If bitcoins goes up alt coins goes up.

What indicates bitcoin will be worth less in the future? Spoiler: Everything points to crypto will increase its marketcap in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:33:28
No you pay a specific fee on the amount of data being sent. All segwit does is decreasing the amount of data being sent. For example with segwit my transaction is 168 bytes. Without segwit its 240 bytes and the fee is 400 sat/kb for example. So the fee IS lower but only because the amount of data is lower.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:09:55
when 120k?
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:41:23
When you study the charts i say the odds are massivly in your favour that bitcoin will exceed 19k before 2020 so just hold.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:06:21
LN are not gonna be adopted unless people are forced to it because the majority of humans are lazy and stupid and won't figure it out unless they have to. Just look at segwit adoption... noone adopted it before fees skyrocketed then everyone wanted segwit.
If we scale block size first and then add lightning later it won't be adopted. We need to force people to adopt lightning then we can increase blocks if we have to.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:07:55
what? You mean btc on legacy is stuck on legacy? That sounds inaccurate.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:35:41
Im not gonna bother giving you proof. I know what the fee was and if you don't believe me i could not care less. If you want to go all in on ETH its your loss so again... why would i care?

@_date: 2018-01-20 17:33:42
Segwit is good, no downssides whatsoever for users but people won't use it. Noone gave a shit about coinbase having or not having segwit before fees skyrocketed. Lightning will stay at 5% adoption if we have big blocks and when those blocks are full we are in the same situation again: people will demand 16 mb blocks and not adopt lightning because its too complicated.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:00:41
I won't let the greasy tribesmen who manipulate the price get my bitcoins... i just don't give a fuck anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:03:41
Why would bitcoin not be able to support more users than its current users? Im a bitcoin user as long as i hold bitcoin and i never move them and a big part of the bitcoin network are horders meaning they don't actually use the network but they are part of it.

Eth is not cheap at all, i have payed 5 dollars for transaction for a coin worth 1/20th of a bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-20 22:26:35
Thats true we will not have as quick adoption if we don't increase block size now but i don't see a rush to reach maximum speed of adoption if that means sacrificing sound technical design.
And we still have almost too fast adoption as it is which is why we have such high volatility on the price.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:59:40
So is this the same guys buying up to hit their next long futures contract again? So the next future contract after that is probably gonna be a short so they can dump all that BTC AGAIN!

for the tribe maybe
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:33:18
I think if a wallet would communicate how much premium they are paying and for how much time they would save with that premium they would never pay that high fee.
Most people i have talked to barely seem to understand how the fee/blockspace works even. Most people are too dumb to use bitcoin in current state.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:19:39
oooh yeah its the "flippening" again? zzzz
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:30:37
Aren't fees unrelevant in this case? All segwit does is decrease the size of data the transaction has thus making it cheaper but the fee per kb is still the same.

But roger ver never used sockpuppets in his life.

Very good, we should always think from the viewpoint of "will my grandma understand this?". Using bitcoin has to be as easy as playing online games today. You simply press the Play button and the game service will automatch you automatically.
Late 90's you had to manually insert server ip adresses to connect to game servers. Or compare Windows to DOS. In DOS you had to you yourself know the correct commands to pack and unpack files, delete folders or free up more memory in system.bat or autoexec.bat. Numbers of computer users skyrocketed with Windows 95.

If you don't understand what you are talking about then don't give any advice, clearly those who understand Bitcoin will understand it is a given that $2600 was not even CLOSE to the top.
And yeah 11k is not even CLOSE to the top either.

Hey there are history experts that will "debunk" it just as there are economic professors that will "debunk" bitcoin. End of the day you need to do your own research.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:17:51
So you are saying it is gonna go down soon and advice not investing? Its your fault if they miss out on eventual profits then. 
People want advice and if we are bullish on bitcoin guess what, we are gonna say its not too late because we believe it will go higher. If anyone is dumb enough to think anyone can know with 100% certainty whats gonna happen then they are too dumb to have any business investing in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:09:22
The value of Bitcoin is you don't need to trust any third party. Banks can create their blockchains all they want but you still need to trust the bank to run the blockchain which makes it worthless except maybe faster payments than the traditional system.

Because if everyone is euphoric and thinks asset X is a safe bet because it always goes up then nobody will ever question it... and when the day comes when the asset comes under pressure people have no benchmark to point at which the asset could be worth so a freefall selloff can be enormous.
Smart money don't want to invest in such risky bubbles.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:38:14
So if bitoin is the be end be all that everyone wanted U think futures would never enter? It is a step on the way, deal with it! Either bitcoin is strong enough or it isn't to go through as the victor.

What all you sceptics don't seem to understand is EVERY investments involves risks. It's a risk your investment won't generate any money, its a risk your investment will go to zero. Why would you cash out from a investment.. ANY INVESTMENT that gives you 50% return in 2 months? You are really investing like you are playing some roulette game if you think in those terms. (Hey better cash out now, what are the odds number 34 will come twice bro!)
It is not about KNOWING the future, it is being able to make reasonable predictions based on information. And I predict here and now Bitcoin will be more worth 2018 than it is now.

When the market show signs of pullback he shits his pants and cashes out instantly because he didn't know why he really wanted to own a bitcoin in the firstplace.

Easy to say "take some profits" for people who sit at 100 BTC or more. But for those who managed to scrape together 1 BTC i don't think its a good advice to take profits. Noone knows what the future holds and it is not unlikely that getting hold of an full Bitcoin is just gonna be harder and harder in the future.
Getting $10k in profits ain't gonna change anything for most people, you can't even buy a house with 10k... and if bitcoin eventually hit 1 million dollars you wasted 500k on basicly nothing since what can you do with 10k? Buy a car that will lose value every year i guess.
Don't know what you mean by your investing vs gamling point. All investing is gambling if you want to see holding as gambling, no investment is 100% sure of giving returns on investment. Just because you don't have the balls to go deep doesn't mean you aren't "gambling" yourself.
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:02:51

The term white people today are only used to put blame on people of european decent and feel shame and selfhate. No other race and certainly not jews are ever shoved selfhate and shame through the entertainment industry and education. Talk down to white people is progressive, if you ever would change the term "white people" with "black people" in the context the term is used today you would be called a racist and scumbag.

it's a weakness for some purposes and a strenght for others. The strenght of fiat is you can print more money and have liquidity to boost the economy and have the capital for new companies etc. 
The weakness of fiat is the average worker is getting robbed of their wage values and small savings. Also the inflated economy sometimes implodes can wreck havoc because much growth is based on fake money.
Is it better with a inflated economy that boosts growth but sometimes implodes and also robs the working man? Or a slower growing economy that is more stable and better for the working man?

I agree... im tech savvy enough to handle bitcoin but im still nervous as fuck EVERYTIME i send bitcoin... thinking im making some mistake with the amount im sending or some error in the recieving address... one mistake is all it takes and you could possibly send away all your bitcoins with no chance of ever getting it back.

whats that? Btw i can't download anything on my TailsOS offline computer.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:44:53
Well it seems i have internet in tails if i just use the browser to surf but electrum doesn't connect, even if i try manually connect to a server. Electrum however works fine on my other computer.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:52:21
Okay but how do i get the wallet as a file to save for example in TailsOS? Or am i missunderstanding how this works?
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:52:27
when you are shamed for not believing a narrative and called a denier its usually a scam... 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:43:08


Yes but when i click Sign it tries to connect to the server and fails which is ofcourse because the computer is offline. So the question is how do i sign on the offline computer if it tries to connect to a server when i click the button?
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:22:50
They have documentation how to do it, but it just doesn't work. As i said it tries to call up the server when i follow the instructions how to sign the transaction which is impossible since im offline.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:24:41
okay I have now booted Tails using two usb sticks
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:59:26
what is a "safe wallet"? Is electrum a safe wallet? You also said remove coins from online wallets.... im getting so confused by the terminology here... is electrum a online wallet or not? Is it safe to store my coins there?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:21:59
I laugh at all these weak people the instant there are problems with bitcoin they jump ship "grass is greener on the other side". Ofcourse other coins works better since they are so small. But whatever problems bitcoin faces due to growth other coins will aswell. If we can't solve this problem with bitcoin there is nothing that points to other coins will. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:00:19
Thats because you haven't understood most wars are banker wars.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:11:51


bitcoin core is over 100gb and growing, is that really necessary to have for being able to use electrum offline?
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:48:13
You think so? Im sure 80% of all "btc holders" cashed out during the bear market. Everyone i know who claims to be btc holders have no bitcoin at all but a portfolio full of shitcoins.

@_date: 2017-05-25 20:54:27
Is it more secure to use two way authenticator or just a default wallet? Also when i tried to do this in Tails it doesn't connect to the server so i couldn't see my balance. I install electrum on a computer connected to the internet to see the balance but isnt that a security risk? I had to type in my entire seed, couldn't a keylogger pick that up?
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:12:11

@_date: 2017-06-12 07:38:07
It was simply luck that bitcoin took off this much, going all in when it was worth next to nothing is reckless and stupid. There is no way anyone could "analyze" and predict the future accurately because too many unknown-at-that-time-factors could influence its success or failure.
But i understand this guy is a liberal and i have zero trust for anyone letting their emotions dominate facts.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:44:36
No i have made great profits on bitcoin myself already. I just don't like someone being lucky and then makes it out to be about his superior intelligence and then uses that established intelligence as a argument for the direction of bitcoin  and trashes devs.
