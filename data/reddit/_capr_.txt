* Demand for silver should go up as our society becomes more and more dependent on electronics.  Sure I think palladium, platinum or even copper could act as alternatives but they are not as efficient for conducting electricity as silver is at the top of all metals(including gold) in that category.  Your smartphone would have less processing speed and battery life if it used alternatives to silver.  
* Most silver is supposedly being mined at below the cost of production which should lead to shortages of supply as mining companies scale back their operations or shut down. At the top of these operations being scaled back is silver deposit exploration which is a bad omen for the long term.  Also, mines take a lot of money and time to go back into production after being shut down.  I admit lot of silver is mined as by-product with other metals. 
* US mint has been scaling back on Silver Eagle coin production in recent years and has also delayed delivery or sold out of them. This can be an indication of more demand as well as a shortage of supply. 
There are decent fundamentals for the gold/silver ratio to shrink more than ever has in history.  Although it's traditionally not the banker's metal, it should have more appeal in this new day of age for being considered as a monetary metal. 
As a side note, I would also argue that cryptocurrencies will force fiat banks to be competitive once again.  This may likely mean they will have to return to some kind of metal standard again.

They would be more likely to just spend their money on frivolous things instead of saving/investing in new businesses.  Estate taxes are just another form of cannibalism because they squander any potential for their savings to create more tax revenue in the future.  Instead, the money is just spent on government pet projects(don't produce tax revenue) which can only be politically motivated and not economically motivated.

I agree Bitcoin and gold are not direct investments.  However they are indirect investments because buying these assets bids up the price of business holdings in the industry and helps them finance their operations.

* Peercoin has a .01 tx fee and a 300 mb blockchain.  Hence, Peercoin is meant to specialize as a backbone currency. High volume transaction activity will be done by trading Peercoin tokens on Open Transaction. Peercoin isn't capital intensive to operate so it doesn't rely heavily on tx fee revenue.  Therefor, Peercoin won't mind if OT takes all the tx revenue.   
* A 51% attack against Peercoin or any other PoS coin means you have to buy 51% of all Peercoins.  
* Minting/servicing the network is cheap and practical for all users and not like PoW where the well connected can service the network because they have specialized hardware.  Minting only requires a PC.  There are no mining pools in PoS coins
* SK and sigmike are working on v0.5 which will allow all users to opt out of enforcement of broadcast checkpoints.

Well let's apply that logic to every other industry out there. Would there be more or less goods and services(the real wealth which money isn't) to go around? There would be less to go around and would translate into higher prices(inflation) because of less supply vs demand. This is because higher wage prices make labor(supply) less affordable to employers(demand). The least skilled workers get priced out of the market and left with a wage of 0 instead. Taxi drivers would have a harder time making a living because the cost of living would be higher.

OT's federated multisig model is what's suppose to prevent double spending of Bitcoin tokens in its distributed orderbook.  I'm not an expert but I presume double spending may happen occasionally but the trade off will be cheap, high volume, off-chain transactions.

You don't understand what PPC is.  It's not meant for buying things.  It's meant to function as a secure backbone currency(like gold reserves) and not a transactional currency.  In the future, Peercoin will be traded on decentralized exchanges like Open Transactions.  Peercoin isn't capital intensive to operate and therefore isn't heavily reliant on transaction revenue.  OT will take most of the transaction revenue for doing its job specializing as a transaction medium while Peercoin specializes as a store of value medium.  If you piece Peercoin and OT together, you will get the best of both worlds in one package.

Here we go again on rationalizing inflation... When will you Keynesians ever get it through you thick heads?  You're just telling yourselves what you want to hear.  If inflation is a good thing than i guess taxation must be a good thing?  Inflation is a stealth tax.  The less of it there is, the better so people can have more savings.  Bitcoin has inflation so it can pay miners to build and eventually finish building a secure payment network.  That's it.  Nothing more and nothing less.  We want deflation so people will have more savings AND WILL BE INCENTIVIEZED TO SAVE.  Being incentivized to save means having the delayed gratification/discipline to spend more wisely.  Inflation disincentivizes people not to save by leading them into frivolous spending/malinvesment.  Inflation makes people want to use the value out of their money before its value diminishes further as prices rise. Scarcity is a good thing when it comes to money.  In fact, scarcity is requirement which shouldn't be corrupted if something is to meet the definition of money.  Sure gold has small inflation but if you have an opportunity to create a form of money without inflation, **WHY NOT GET RID OF THE INFLATION?!**  If money isn't scarce, what good is it as a store of value? 
Does Dogecoin not have a coin cap because they want people to keep mining it?  Is the appeal of mining Dogecoin what drives people to Dogecoin?  If so, Dogecoin is not the best money alternative because it doesn't meet the definition of money.  I don't know what the Dogecoin inflation rate is, but if it plans to keep continuing it indefinitely to preserve their mining party, I'm staying away from it.  Peercoin will have a future annual inflation rate of 1% just to pay for servicing the network and it destroys its transactions fees to add deflation so it works as a store of value.  This sounds very reasonable to me.  If Dogecoin plans to keep a small rate of inflation going to make sure the miners service the network instead of themselves, than I'll give it SOME credence.  
BTW, call me a prude but I could care less about memes which don't contribute anything to serious intellectual discussion. If you wanna clown around and laugh at yourself, is for you.  If you're interested in learning and possibly making substantive contributions towards getting actual work done, just about any other crypto community is for you.

Not true.  With Peercoin, the more coins you have, the same stake you have.  If a wealthy coin holder mints and competes against other minters, richer or poorer, he maintains his stake just as much as every other minter.  In the meantime, what good is your savings if its never spent?  People have to spend their coins sometime.  When people spend their Peercoins, the transactions fees are destroyed which deflates the currency for all holders, rich or poor.

No, the NSA does not have back doors built into our hardware.  It's one thing to say they have back doors built into Windows or other software but it's quite another to say they have back doors built into processors and hard drives.  Do you have any idea how large scale of an operation it would be to do what with hardware?  Somebody would be bound to spill their guts so that theory doesn't seem plausible.  It's much more practical and scalable to insert back doors into software.   I can't speak to the potential protocol issues but i would assume that since it's open source and distributed for 5 years, someone out in the world would have broken it by now if it were flawed. 
It's good to be vigilant but with all the effort you went through to present your conspiracy theories, its as if you want to believe they are real.  What would the government have to gain from something like this?  They invent cryptocurrency(let cat out of the bag), give us hope, then tear it down so they can demoralize us?  That would still hurt them more than us because someone else would invent a newer and more secure cryptocurrency BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGY THE GOVERNMENT EXPOSED to the public.  Frankly, I'm more worried about the size of the blockchain and centralization of mining rather than some theoretical government plot.

True.  However, PMs are commodities which can never fall to a price of zero because of their industrial demand.

"That's why Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have pledged 99% of their wealth to charity when they die."  I'm not against charity but voluntary charity and taxes(legalized theft/violence) are not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination.  This doesn't mean that charity is always a good thing because you can't have charity without capitalism producing the wealth.  Which has fed more people in the world?  Capitalism or charity?  Obviously capitalism.  In the late 1800s of the US, why did so many immigrants vote with their feet for capitalism and weren't given a hand out in return?  Because capitalism creates prosperity.  How else are the BRIC nations growing so much?  Because people like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are investing in those countries.   In capitalism, private money is invested into working capital which produces goods and services.  Any form of taxes leave less private money to be invested.

LOL, not true.  Your seem to be twisting facts to suit your purposes.  Cryptocurrency uses extend from time stamping to colored coins.  There's a lot you can do with blockchain consensus technology.  Even with that aside, the definition of a commodity according to [Wikipedia]( is: 
*a commodity is a marketable item produced to SATISTY WANTS OR NEEDS.  Economic commodities comprise goods and SERVICES.* 
Cryptocurency SERVES an easily tradeable commodity to SATISFY WANTS OR NEEDS.  It is what it is.  Just like any other currency, crytpocurrency is a commodity of use, advantage, or value.


Hypothetically speaking, if we had domestic choices to choose from in private fractional reserve currencies, would people vote with their wallet/feet/labor for which ever currency they thought had more value? I believe so.  If they think a currency is going to be a good store of value, then it must have value from an currency investor standpoint.  The two types of value go together in a free market.  I don't know what you mean by your last sentence.   


Most economists are in cohoots with people on government payrolls of one sort or another.  Their payrolls rely on the FED creating inflation so they are going to seek ways to rationalize inflation.  BTW consensus does not necessarily translate to truth as nature acts independently of whatever human consensus ends up being right or wrong.  
Deflation doesn't promote under investment. Better way of putting it is deflation discourages malinvestment.  Deflation communicates the right signals to people by discouraging them going into debt on poor investments.  Severity of debt is a good thing because we don't want to encourage debt in the first place.   How does the Dogecoin protocol explicitly encourage spending without doing so excessively?  Isn't that subjective?  What's your definition of excessive.  More importantly, by saying Dogecoin encourages spending(Keynsian language) you are admitting it is not intended to be store of value.  We don't want a currency which encourages spending for the same reasons we don't want a currency like the USD.  The Fed always talks about consumption rather than savings.  We likely wouldn't have Bitcoin today if it weren't for the economic philosophy behind the Federal Reserve and how it controls the USD.  








I think it depends more on what quality of productivity we're talking about here.  If Dogecoin is just used to tip people for posting pro Dogecoin comments, that is like a company spending most of its budget on advertising rather than production, payroll, or R&amp;D.  That's not an efficient balance.  


Well i don't know what else to tell you in regards to the threats of inflation eating measure of our labor and the benefits of deflation preserving the measure of our labor other than what i have typed above.  Calling savings as hoarding reveals where your priorities are.  If you don't value savings, than why are you into cryptocurrencies in the first place?  Again, the failings of the low interest rate policies behind the USD are what inspired Bitcoin into creation in the first place.  The fact it differentiates itself as being deflationary compared to the USD is why it as grown in value so much in the last year.  If you think savings is hoarding than why aren't you touting fiat currencies instead of Dogecoin or cryptocurrencies?  Your not being logically consistent.
Obviously, your shill for Dogecoin who likely has a vested interest in it.  In other words, I don't think there's anything I can say or argue to convince you otherwise. This is becoming inefficient.  Take care.

Are you contemplating the economics of what you're saying?  If small banks are protected because they don't have to worry about other banks expanding, then they don't have to worry about expanding.  This type of regulation inhibits incentives for any business to produce better value so customers will choose them and make the business grow.


No the Federal Reserve just inflates bubbles which gives the politicians and bureaucrats a platform for legislating more regulation into existence.
EDIT: Also, if the Federal Reserve is digitizing profuse amounts of money into existence like it is now, the people who are closest to the monetary spigot(FED) are going to benefit the most.  This leads to a consolidation of wealth, pure and simple.

 Isn't money just an easily tradeable commodity?  Isn't the world *commodity* a subset of the word *asset*?  Yes i'm treating cryptocurrencies as assets because they are an asset class.  


I shouldn't treat a currency as an investment?  Should i not have choice to vote with my wallet for what currency I believe has value? This is how currencies compete.  If I invest in a currency, I am betting it will have future spending value.  By spending value I also mean it will have utility value.  If your just sending/donating Dogecoin back and forth, then it has poor utility value because there's little to no productivity associated with those transactions.  If Dogecoin has artificial inflation, people will spend Dogecoin unproductively because they won't benefit from saving.  Dogecoin is functioning more as a fad than a useful medium of exchange.

I think Sunny King addressed the tragedy of the commons problem on this [thread](  This is what he posted.
"This is an old topic. I can summarize the major points known about this argument:
Q) Will minters stop processing transactions and cause a degradation of service on transaction processing.
  * Transaction processing is cheap at reasonable volume. There is very little incentive to do this.
  * I don't view block chain system as the most suitable medium for high volume transaction processing, so transaction fees in PPC serve an important mechanism to control volume on the block chain. This is why transaction fees are currently fixed at 0.01 per KB.
  * There were proposals that distribute partial transaction fees to minters but I am not in favor of them at the moment.
  * If this truly becomes a problem, the default minting algorithm could possibly be revised to include an adversarial strategy to deter such behavior, for example delaying building on top of a 'cheating' block.
  * Demanding fees from users wouldn't be very different from bitcoin, as it's construed as a legitimate action from minters. Only difference is in PPC you would need to ask users to add additional outputs in order to collect the fees yourself, causing bloating. I doubt such strategy would work well for minters though, again PPC is meant to be highly decentralized and not sacrificing decentralization for high volume transaction processing."

LMAO, by rewarding hoarders do you mean users being incentivized to save?  How does Peercoin encourage wealth concentration?  Yes, most Peercoins are owned by a small group but the same was true for Bitcoin in its earlier days.  As the price rises, the first people in the market will start selling off and distribute coins to more people who are likely poorer.

It doesn't cost much money to store precious metals in a hidden safe other then buying the actual safe.

Not exactly.  You're making it seem like the participants are being paid when they are actually just preserving their purchasing power as far as Peercoin is concerned.  Again, they are maintaining their stake.  When they mint Peercoins and collect 1% interest, it's as if the participants are keeping the Gold ounces in their bullion stack the same.  Although Gold is very scarce, it's not perfectly scarce such a Peercoin stake but it was the closest example i could think of.


I received more Peercoins simply because i bought a lot more than you did.  Also, i might have taken the larger risk of investing in Peercoin early like a venture capitalist.  How do you know I "surely need them less than" you do?  Should i not be rewarded with at least the right to maintain my stake of Peercoins?  Do you believe in a "progressive" tax system where certain people are given preferential legal treatment and others not?  I don't.  I would certainly prefer a flat tax system over a system which disproportionately taxes certain targeted people more than others.
If it's an issue, what then should be done then?  Should those who save less/smaller Peercoin stake be rewarded with higher interest???  That's just backwards.  If Sunny King changed the Peercoin protocol to function this way, it would steer away from what Peercoin is trying to focus on.  People would endeavor to save less money because they know they'll be penalized for saving up to a larger stake.  People would frivolously spend money as if they were receiving negative interest on their fiat savings/checking accounts.  That's a bad thing.  Peercoin's focus is not to be a transactional currency but a savings or backbone currency like gold reserves.

Give me a break.  Trying to tug at people's heart strings by giving those examples means nothing.  I too can argue Bitcoin donates to [charities]( but ultimately it's not what matters.  Capitalism must exist first if charity is to exist, i.e. value must be produced before it is consumed.  Focusing on how charitable Dogecoin is doesn't necessarily show if Dogecoin has any underlying value.  Are you saying the Bitcoin community should channel most of its resources into charity instead of building infrastructure and researching solutions to solve problems?  Clearly the latter is more important than charity.

It's been working like a currency for over a year now and with a 12 second block time to boot. 2 key differences PoS and Pow. One, the price moves up if you buy more coins, making it cost prohibitive to buy more. 2. Having more coins means you have a vested interest in the network to safe guard your investment. 
&lt;EDIT&gt;Yes it was premined and but this was the only way the project could get seed funding.&lt;/EDIT&gt; 
TheDAO was bad but they recovered and learned their lesson not to rush projects.  PoS is similar to PoW because you have to buy coins to service the network and earn rewards, &lt;EDIT&gt;just like how you have to pay more for higher power mining equipment in PoW.


In comparison to what? What is Bitcoin's primary utility? See Ethereum can as both a universal medium of exchange and as gas. &lt;/EDIT&gt; 


While it's generally maintained a $10 price for 6 months and has more Dapp development than any other coin.

That's absurd. The market cap will be divided up, just like a stock split. If you owned Bitcoin before the fork, you would doulbe your number of BTC but the total value would still be the same.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:39:54
The market will choose which ever fork has the best fundamentals as the demand for Bitcoin has to go somewhere. The number of BTC you have on one fork will be the same as the other, but with temporary price volatility until it blows over and everything heals.
Just let the chips fall where they may. This widespread paranoid aversion to forks is overblown.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:32:04
So you're saying price discovery will reflect a hard fork in a negative way. That seems speculative because I could argue the reverse by saying a hard fork separates obstructionist partys from the network. 
There's also the dynamic of Bitcoin's "reserve currency status" in the cryptocurrency markets. Just like the USD, Bitcoin's fundamentals(higher fees, less nodes, centralized mining) aren't immediately reflected in the market because everyone instinctively opts for the most established currency. 
I also think it's speculative to say the ETH hard fork cost them because every market retraces to some sort of equilibrium point. Bitcoin behaves the same way after it's reached an ATH.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:09:22
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:14:06


Never.  But I believe the price volatility from a hard fork will be short lived as the kinks from the hard fork get ironed out.


I'd say the DAO hack had negative fundamental impact on the price but I think it was separate issue from the hard forks in it's influence. The DAO hack was an indication that Ethereum's devs weren't doing their due diligence or that the code has too large of an attack surface.

Why are you arguing from authority and channeling Satoshi? It doesn't matter what Satoshi supported or not. He's not a God so stop deifing him.




So scaling a multi-billion dollar network through a hardfork is a safer way to achieve consensus?  I think not.


Democracy is tyranny of the majority over the minority and ia not very comparable to Bitcoin.  In cryptocurrency, proposals must be agreed to with a unanimous majority or their will be a hard fork and the dissenting party is goes its separate way **without being coerced**.  It's rather beautiful when you think about it.

I'm not a developer but a common opinion I hear among devs is that raizing the blocksize limit will take a large number of nodes off the network because they won't have the hardware to handle a larger mempool(or something like that). It seems to me if the block size is increased, it will be the beginning of incremental corruption towards a more centralized payment system which might not look much different than the legacy banking system or R3. I don't know a lot about Dash but I think they recognized this block size problem in this way and increased their block size anyway because they subsidize full nodes so they have the hardware to handle it.
TL;DR: I think we shouldn't deviate from **first principals** for the sake of expediancy. We should try to preserve Bitcoin as a genuine peer to peer currency.

@_date: 2015-04-29 19:46:45


I'm referring to Bitcoin's growing growing centralization problems.  It's eventually going to require server farms to maintain to host a full node on the network, which isn't very P2P.  More capital requirements could also lead to higher transaction costs. I regard this as a *corrosive* aspect to Bitcoin's value. Also, if half of the network is controlled by one entity, they can make as much Bitcoin as they want. 


I agree Bitcoins are easier to validate but it's not as difficult to validate gold as you say it is.  You can run magnets over it, scratch the surface, weigh it, ping test for coins.  These methods are very practical, in which case you don't necessarily need an x-ray machine.


I'm comparing the store of value characteristics of Bitcoin and gold, not their medium of exchange characteristics.


As I state before, I believe these costs will inevitably rise.  Again, Bitcoin doesn't have a reputation comparable to gold. Gold as been used as money for several millennia and Bitcoin has been used for only 6 years.  It's speculative to think Bitcoin will stay the same where as gold has and will always stay the same.


I agree but I think the fact that it's a physical natural element contributes to it's merits as a store of value.  I refer to what I stated above.

Peter Schiff is testing the waters too by accepting Bitcoin for payment for his precious metals.  He's still adamantly against Bitcoin in his podcasts though.

Which is likely to occur regardless what happens because Core and BU ideologies are not compatible.

That's a statement and not an argument. I don't understand this aversion to forks. To me forks represent choice. If Bitcoin forks  there might be short-term volatility but the price will recover as people will adopt the chain they believe has the most merit. Last time I checked Ethereum is still here and going strong.

How hard would it be for all exchanges to actually use multisig?
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:12:23
We shouldn't have to rely on wishing people to donate money to a service which will use it to run full nodes.  It has to be a profitable endeavor and not rely on egalitarianism.

You don't seem to know what your talking about because you're mischaracterizing libertarianism.  I'm a Libertarian and I don't believe it is morally objectionable for BTC-E to freeze funds on suspicion of theft. Why would it be?  The exchange is a private entity and they're be operating independently of government coercion for all we know.  They can make whatever decisions they want with their own property.

I don't believe exchange trading engines actualing buy and sell Bitcoin on the blockchain.  They just trade them as tokens on their own separate database.  Only deposits and withdrawals use the blockchain.  However, I'm guessing exchanges would have to set up numerous individual wallets in order to accommodate users who want multisig.  That might be the reason a lot of them haven't set it up yet.
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:39:46


@_date: 2015-02-16 01:37:23
Multisig distributes control of the coins. The user has the second key and not the exchange. That's the point behind the multisig.

Frankly, 90% isn't very sensible and is borderline religious I might add.  Anyone's  top priority should be self preservation.  In investing, you achieve this through diversification and risking only as much as your willing to lose(money management).  BTW, have you ever heard of [chaos theory]( Bitcoin has only been around for 6 years and has a history of volatility. No one can say with absolute certainty where the price will go. My money is betting(one of several different bets) it will appreciate in value to at least $1000 again but I'm human and could be wrong.

@_date: 2015-02-22 19:15:59
I don't think Bitcoin is geared toward smart contracts where as Ethereum is.  In a vibrant economy, there has to be entities which specialize in their own specific service.  Bitcoin specializing in payments,  Ethereum specialized in contracts, BitShares specializes in property rights/DACs, etc.

Stop arguing from authority. The facts are it's been on testnet for over a year, it fixes maleability to allow for LN, and fixes quadratic hashing. It does all of this while doubling the block weight. Has Litecoin, Vertcoin, or any of the other altcoins which implemented SegWit suffered in anyway? No.

He refers to Bitcoin as "fake money". In comparison to what? How fake is fiat credit which is simultaneously someone else's liability? The neutrality of Bitcoin is what gives it power.

Sure, it's less capital intensive to maintain the network.  If someone wants to perform a 51% attack, they have to buy 51% of the coins but if they do that the price will skyrocket.  This will ultimately hurt the attacker and help the PoS coin.
