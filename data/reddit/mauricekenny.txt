Lol yeah that’s true ��. Depending on the blockchain system we easily do not need the banks from a payment system or processing perspective. I talked more about that and other things in blockchain on my YouTube channel for anyone to check out �� -&gt;

Awesome story. Always happy to see more people in the community ��.

Would be so funny if the Halloween party you went to had someone dressed as a banker ����

For BTC theirs always the bitcoin lighting network that’s being worked on to make things better ��
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:11:53
Exactly. That is the exact reason why I go around either giving presentations about purely blockchain as the technology or posting Blockchain educational videos on my YouTube MKennyTV- 
The technology is the golden ticket!

Are you asking about how has fractional reserve banking worked so far? If so it has slowly been failing lol. 
Or are you asking how has bitcoin worked so far? If that’s the question really good since there is so many developers, interested users, and people seeing the value enough to jump on the train and use this. Just need improvement in stability and scalability so it can handle many more people using it as long as the UI is improved as well.

Thank you!! The more that agree the better!

The good news is that in those scenarios their is interest on bitcoin that already exist within the 21 million dollar bitcoin supply. In typical federal reserve banking if the bank is involved in anyway where someone asks for x amount of money for a loan they type in the amount on the computer and just create brand new money. So your example everything is still playing around with the 21 million total bitcoins. With normal currencies their is no limit on the supply / amount of how many bitcoins in circulation. So overinflation can happen as a result, depreciation of currency value, and increase of products/services.

Oh that one. Yeah that patent is MasterCard trying to fight back against this because bitcoin is closing the gap. Bitcoin is doing the 8 billion in transaction volume while master card does 11 billion.

100% agree with you! 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:54:34
How do you believe they can?
In the video I explained my point of view of how they can not. Had a few points but 1 was that as of now they create and pump any amount of money they want into existence since their is no max on how much currency their can be. So with bitcoin as a ex their is a cap of only 21 million so more money can not be created to cause over inflation.

Which bank are you talking about and what are hey doing? Also if they are still trying to centralize bitcoin specifically and not a different crypto currency that won’t work since it will be to easy to attacks. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:40:28
It would be difficult for them put the way they do Banking now “fractional reserve banking” on top of bitcoin since they can’t pump more money into bitcoin to increase the supply, but I wouldn’t be surprised if more banks try to create there own coins where they could do that. 
Like you said though if you don’t own your keys you don’t own your money so if they did that and centralized things they will get hacked very easily. Cold storage wallets / hardware wallets  is what every individual needs. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:33:34
100% the truth. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:45:15
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:20:40
Lol yeah I know right. Them centralizing the blockchain is going to make them open to so many attacks. They will learn sooner or later lol
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:42:05
Happy to see the comment, but would like to know how am I a idiot :)? I want to keep improving in front of the camera as I already travel around to give presentations of blockchain in general. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:41:02
Exactly. Oddly enough not enough people that know about the crypto exchanges know about the cold storage though.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:03:06
Lol, in all seriousness though do not over invest anything that you can not afford to. I am all for bitcoin being the National currency, but keep your priorities straight so you will not end up on the streets because you can’t afford your next month payments/rent/mortgage.
