I'm still missing BTC from a deposit made when their login screen wasn't working. I sent multiple messages through their "Mailbox" but never received any kind of correspondence back. I'm not the only one either.

I'm sitting at my husband's computer... I don't know what to do with this. I'll have him do it when he gets home! But Thanks! :) That was really sweet.

I like beer.

I deposited cash to their BofA account and it was there, credited and ready to trade within the 10 minutes it took me to get home.

There's a few locals to me but their asking price is ridiculous.

Haven't noticed a drop in the price yet.

I always say to my super conservative best friend, "I like paying taxes. I buy civilization with them".

You can buy from other places without verification. Cash deposited to BofA for Bitfloor has you about to buy bitcoins in about 15 minutes.

Where do you see that? I'm relatively new to btc, so I don't know where to 'check charts'

Which crystal ball store did you buy yours at?

266---&gt; 155 is way more than 20%

And it's back up

Thanks! I accepted it. I'll have him move it when he gets home. My first bittip!

I don't know much about rich people taxes, but I've heard the term capitol gains before. It always sounds like that applies to money made from stocks, etc. Buying something and selling it for more. Not for actual labor put in. like a job. Would BTC income fall under that?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:02:35
They were way more than 5% above.

lol - I understand bitcoins, but not how to work the tip thing. I'm not sure if he has that app or not. I studied biology in school so I don't understand much about computer stuff. I pay him to know.

Better how?
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:07:31
About $3000 invested.
