Don't get too worked up about this. US patent office don't understand anything about blockchain/bitcoin, they typically allow any patent to be registered because they get money from it. Later down the road when it gets to court it is easy to prove that others already linked credit cards to blockchain tech before the patent was issued and thus it won't hold there...

Governments are made of people. Regulators are people. People invest in bitcoin. When an investor is in a position if power / regulator, things tend to change in favor of their investments.

Now assume you can never know your computer was free of malware... And that malware records and sends later when u are online.... So even better, use a live cd with bare metal s/w on it and then just shutdown the system after you generated. That would be better

# Generate a public key from a private key (Elliptic Curve math)
The public key is then simply pubkey = G \* PrivKey.  The catch is that \* is EC multiplication in the appropriate modular elliptic curve field and G is the base point of that curve.
G is a constant point on an EC graph - it has an x coord and a y coord.
The multiplication here is a constant number (privkey) multiplied by a dot (x,y)/
Multiplication in EC is one way meaning that you can’t divide pubkey by G to get privkey.
An EC graph is of the general form:
y^(2) = X^(3) \+ ax + b
(a and b and constants that you set to produce a specific EC graph, they also have to abide with this rule to have no singularity points:
4a^(3) \+ 27b^(2) ≠ 0 )
EC graphs with good crypto properties are modulo a large prime number
y^(2) = (x^(3) \+ ax + b) mod p
Bitcoin uses a specific EC graph with specific constants for ‘a’ and ‘b’ and ‘p’ which is called : “*secp256k1”*
Here, a=0 and b=7, and
*p* = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F = 2^(256) \- 2^(32) \- 2^(9) \- 2^(8) \- 2^(7) \- 2^(6) \- 2^(4) \- 1
So the actual bitcoin EC graph is:
Y^(2) =(x^(3)\+7) mod *p* (p is the constant above)
‘G’ in this graph is

This is uncompressed form to say that (04 header byte means we have an uncompressed coord):
Gx = 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798
Gy = 483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8
(because G is a point on a graph you can represent it by only showing the ‘x’ coord of the point  and later calculating the ‘y’ point using the formula and code - this is called “compressed representation” - here we use the first header byte to tell you which ‘y’ to use - the header byte for compressed form would be 02 or 03 if the omitted ‘y’ was positive or negative \[there are 2 ‘y’ points for each ‘x’\] - so the compressed form of G is 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798)
