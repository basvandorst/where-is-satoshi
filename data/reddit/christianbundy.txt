The entire history of cryptography is the story about how every cryptographic system we've ever used has been fragile, brittle, and often broken by default. Cryptography is incredibly valuable, but it's important to remember that any time you increase your convenience you're likely decreasing your security.
Public key cryptography (and its ease-of-use) have increased exponentially, but running an SSH server adds a non-negligible amount of attack surface area.

Exactly! The socialist position is that we should _all_ have democratic control of the land, therefore no single individual can use it to exploit any of us. Personally, I think it's equally important that we use a participatory democracy as well, that way we only have people voting on the things that affect them.


There are _tons_ of options, all of which make different compromises. If you and a few hundred friends were all moving into an abandoned mansion, how would you choose who gets which rooms?
- Capitalism means that the toughest and best-armed people sell rooms to everyone else. In exchange, the security force will patrol the hallways and make sure that your monopoly rights is protected. The rich will purchase many rooms, rent them out, make a profit, and repeat until everyone is renting from them.
- Socialism means that you come up with a democratic process on how to divvy up the rooms. For example, you might all agree to charge rent based on square footage, leaving each floor come up with their own democratic process to deal with maintaining the kitchen/bathrooms/etc.


Just to be clear, these things don't end up being free, we just remove people who only exist to extract profit and let the people own and control the means of production.


Again, just ask yourself what you'd do in your personal life. If your bedroom wasn't large enough, you'd likely hit up your roommates and ask if there was a larger room you could switch into. If there are no more rooms you'd ask and see if anyone/everyone would pitch in on a remodel to add a room. Socialism is just economic democracy.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:59:24


Yes, the same way that every feudal lord exploited peasants. The state protects private property (e.g. factories) from being used by the workers to produce the things they need, _except_ when the workers give the capitalists a huge cut. This isn't a voluntary system, it's a form of private tyranny. If you've ever played Monopoly you know how this ends.


Cool. Please send me half of your paycheck from now on, since it "isn't necessarily a bad thing".


Ignoring the "in China" bit, let's think this through: the fact that people are willing to have low wages means that they have unmet needs, right? If that's true, why are they building phones for countries across the world instead of producing food/water/shelter/comfort for their own local familiar? This is because parts of their community (private property) were sold to corporations, and any use of that property that doesn't create a profit for the corporation is met with police violence.
We're a bit indoctrinated into the "land can be bought and sold" thing, so let's switch to water instead. Let's say that you depend on a stream for food/water, similarly to how most people depend on land for food/shelter. The local authorities (feudalist/capitalist/etc) decided to sell off the monopoly rights to that land, and it's now owned by WaterBottleCorp. The local police restrict access to the stream, which makes food/water difficult to come by. When WaterBottleCorp starts hiring, their wages don't matter. You _have_ to take the job to survive, because the state has given a monopoly on that private property to someone else. WaterBottleCorp is an oligarchy with little to no accountability, meaning that they can treat you however they'd like.
Capitalism, feudalism, and slavery are all the same _type_ of system. One class has ownership (whether that's over property, property with humans, or just humans), and the other class has to work their ass off to survive. They're all exploitative, there's no way around it.

You're confusing trade with capitalism. Trade is good! Anti-capitalists aren't against trading goods and services (e.g. phone manufacturing for water), we're against a rich person being handed a monopoly over community resources (i.e. private property) so that they can exploit the local population via wage slavery.
For example: landlords. While _some_ landlords provide services, they're negligible compared to the amount of rent that most of us pay. So _really_, what are we paying them for? We're paying them because the police coerce us into it, the same way that peasants were coerced by feudal militaries to give a large share of their produce to their lord (who _also_ contributed negligible value).
There's no structural difference between a landlord demanding rent and a feudal lord demanding a fifth of your produce. They contribute no value, but they have the police/military on their side so we all play along.

As I'm sure you've heard, if you don't have the private key (i.e. the password to the wallet) you don't own the keys. When you save your coins in Coinbase, they don't give you the keys, but they'll send you your coins whenever you want if you'd like to store them locally. If you have them send you the coins now, that transaction will occur on both of the blockchains (since the fork won't happen until August 1st), so if you want to access your coins on the forked chain you can use a wallet that supports the fork and your private key will continue to work.
On the other hand, if you leave your coins in Coinbase and decide you want to access your coins in the future, the transaction where Coinbase sends you the coins will only happen in the blockchain that Coinbase supports. In the eyes of the forked chain, your coins will still be sitting in Coinbase's wallet, which you don't have access to.
In other words, if you have any intention of using your coins on the new fork, you need to send them to a wallet you control _before_ the fork happens, and then you'll have your coins on both chains.


Currently there aren't any exchanges that support the fork -- we don't even know if anyone will use the forked blockchain at all. It _may_ matter in the future, but for the time being it's a pie in the sky "wouldn't it be cool if" type scenario.

Exactly. There are people who want to make backward-incompatible changes to Bitcoin, which is basically like making a new coin (as the two blockchains will become completely independent). Coinbase isn't making those changes, and so you won't be able to buy/sell on the new fork.
If you'd like, you can withdraw your coins to a wallet you control (as you'll control that wallet in both the current Bitcoin and the future fork), but I'm not very convinced that the fork is going anywhere.

That isn't the "extent of [my] insight into politics", that's my gross simplification for someone who voted for Trump not because of his policies, but because he trolls the media. Nice try though.
Yes, he represents "the electoral college who voted for him", but that doesn't mean he's representative of what we want. Hillary wouldn't have been either. Two-party politics, which I'll remind you that the founders wanted to avoid at all costs, are terrible for democracy. The question goes from "who do you want to be president?" to "do you want A or B?". That's barely democratic.
Let's pretend we're voting on ice cream. Without political parties, you'd have people voting for strawberry and chocolate and vanilla and rocky road and all sorts of things. In our current political climate, the options are peanut buttery chocolate, and chocolatey peanut butter. Of course the one we vote for is _more_ representative than the alternative, but that doesn't mean that's what people actually want.
In case this is easier to digest in video form, check this out: 
Please remember that criticisms of your "god emperor" aren't endorsements of Hillary Clinton, they're literally just criticisms.

It's "glorious" for the owning class, but real wages have been tanking since about 1973 (while productivity has been steadily increasing). The US is making money, but it isn't going to the people doing the work; the profits are going straight to the owning class who make money by having money.

I can't put into words how fucking stupid this is. Regardless of the "you don't get to have an opinion unless you quit your job and run for office" rhetoric, we're part of a two-party system. Third-party candidates aren't a viable alternative.


I'll give you $1 if you can point out where I mentioned "exactly why [my] fellow citizens voted for Trump". Seriously. This isn't /b/, /pol/, or and your spray-and-pray alternative facts don't work here. Stop lying.


Another $1 if you can point out my "causual reductionism", otherwise I suggest you close your philosophy 101 textbook and stop lying. Why are you like this?
