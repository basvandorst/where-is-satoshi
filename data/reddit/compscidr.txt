Could be, but will be expensive, both for the satellites themselves and the equipment to communicate with the satellites. Probably it will be some combination of a whole bunch of things - satellites, balloons, phones, dedicated static hardware, etc.

There's no reason you couldn't run a full node on a mesh. If you don't want to have a bunch of disjoint crypto networks, you'll want to have the mesh be also connected to the full Internet.
If you try to feed a mesh into the country from the edges, it would need many hops to reach the real Internet as you move away from the border. As you add hops the delay increases. The routers that are closest to the borders would become overwhelmed with traffic decreasing the throughput and further increasing delay. 
You could always design some type of network with high bandwidth wireless links for a backbone and then lower bandwidth links out to the end devices, similar to a cell network, but it would probably be expensive.
You could also deal with capacity / delay problems by prioritizing the traffic so that crypto traffic gets highest priority (or only allow crypto traffic).
Assuming the government got wind of the network, they could do things to jam the signal or triangulate where the routers / hardware are located and physically shut them down. 
To avoid this, you could try to avoid stationary hardware - and use devices that are small and portable (like cellphones), however the since they move around it becomes a much more complicated network to keep connected likely resulting in more delay and lowered throughput - but with the tradeoff that the only way to shut it down would be to confiscate everyones devices.
