You know this is a meme right? "Our coin is currently busy, we might suggest using a better coin in the meantime"

At least they could actually use lotto tickets for something if they win. It will cost you $40 to give them $20 and take a couple weeks to clear.

Longtimer - calls bitcoin a stock. 
You're fooling no one. I'm embarrassed to be an engineer after reading this ignorant rant. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:47
Stop confusing me with facts! Just hodl ok �� ��
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:22:35
Choking on irony.. You can't seriously be this stupid and naive right?

They only produce $1k USD a month right now not $2k. Upfront cost would be anywhere from $49k to $175k depending on where they were purchased and how long he had to wait. That's not including the cost to upgrade the panel in the house considering most houses have a 100 amp main. 100 amp main at 220v would supply 22kW. This setup will use 38kW without any consideration for cooling. In the summer you can effectively double the power draw for cooling purposes. Also the power supplies require 220v circuits to be run. If this is in his house it took a lot of work to get there.

Most likely a hostile demand by evil ver and bcrash users.

The new Bitcoin is not designed for people like you. Sorry bud. Come back when you can pay ur fees.

Thought I was browsing r/buttcoin when I saw people who weren't cuckled by core. What's happening
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:46
Enjoy your ban
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:02:15
I believe within the next week it should confirm. They will cancel your order. Maybe use a different coin? Bitcoin is busy atm

Just hodl for 18 months until LN then you'll be glad you waited. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:17:05
Send me a link for an s9 at $1k each and I'll tip you 1k for each one I buy :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:41:05
I guess we'll see.

LN eta = (current date) + 18 months
According to the past 18 months of data

Kinda hard to be more scammy than a pre mined currency. Just use govt printed paper lol. What you are seeing is a war in the free market over who should be king. I hope they can exist together but it's hard to tell.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:40
I think you are confusing Bch with Bcg. Bcg was a pre mined scam. Bch has bigger blocks and no segwit. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:21:38
The fact that it's acceptable to call it BCash should let you know ur pushing a smearing campaign. Was it not forked from bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:15:15
It's a free market so there is going to be competition. Both sides may or may not be using dirty tactics (They are). If the war wasn't happening now then it would be soon. I feel the bch-btc was has only just begun.

I hope you enjoyed your stay

~30% that night it peaked I believe. Also Asia  doesn't seem to hold the same brand loyalty that Americans do ie iPhone. In their eyes bch is more functional.

USD is terrible, it doesn't even cost $5-20 to spend it. What a shitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:55:59
Based on the data you have seen would you say it's a scam though? Lots of info out there, make sure to check multiple sources. If you personally invested it would be in your best interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:24:54
Would you mind listing a few ways in which bitcoin is more useful? I'm curious.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:48:50
Do you have a time stamped picture? I was watching it but forgot cap.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:30:50
Apparently pretty small since b2x was cancelled..

MVP is being implemented this quarter. Not sure where your numbers come from.

I think you misread my comment. The dollar is NOT backed by gold. I was agreeing with you. Not since 1971
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:48:55
The dollar is not backed by gold lol. Are you a troll or serious?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:41:31
The small current unit of bitcoin is a "sat." One bitcoin = 100,000,000 sat. This means there are 2 quadrillion individual units. One whole bitcoin is how we think of it now but the price of a sat would be more pertinent to the average investor long term.
