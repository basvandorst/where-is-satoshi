Without an real knowledge on how to properly set up an air gapped machine, I generated my private keys using my work computer which I assumed would have better firewalls/protection than my personal computer at home. I downloaded the bitaddress website in a zipped file and them shut off my internet while I generated the wallet.

Been in BTC for a couple of months now with a respectable amount of money and yes I am also invested in several different more traditional assets as well.

Are you saying I need to do the verify account through adding an identifying document? Or just set up like touchID on my phone?
