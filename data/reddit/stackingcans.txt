So its basically a fork off of bitcoins block chain?

Don't be confused! Its awesome buying and using bitcoin and other cryptos, but just don't put in more than you can afford to lose. The markets are very volatile so you can lose a lot of money. Play it safe and do your research so you can understand what you're doing. Cryptos puts banking into your hands so be smart when handling your money. If you have any questions feel free to ask!!!

Do you know of an ELI5 version of what side chains are?

I also believe they are implementing doge as the ingame currency.

It is a real science. People are trying to understand how the quantum level works, this will take years to figure out and the scientists may contradict themselves over New discoveries, but this doesn't make it useless, just means we are learning through growing pains.

I work for WFM and I talked to my regional marketing team about accepting bitcoin, the guy said they don't have plans to accept it, but they are  watching companies that do accept it and are looking to see how they perform. So in due time! At least they are watching it!

But didnt some coins already build themselves off the bitcoin network, how is this different? Like doesn't dogecoin update itself after bitcoin?
