Fiat currency is just a hallucination

No need for insult. I have not insulted you. You need to understand the concept of money to realise that it was a solution once and now bitcoin is the new solution. You're more than welcome to continue using fiat currency but most of it you will find in rubbish dumps. Bitcoin is a technology in line with the evolution of value exchange.

Bitcoin is solving fiat currency problems as expected.

Precisely, and to know the value of your skills and competencies.

Fiat currency has a myriad of problems some more pronounced than others depending on where you are. In developing nations we have the unbanked and the underbanked. Those in the first world won’t understand this. Money is weaponised even in developed nations. They print to wage wars. 
One of the problems is liquidity. There’s more. Inflation as mentioned for Venezuela. They have a national crypto currency now: The Petro.

And what did the communist government of Venezuela do wrong?

Good question. Here are some more questions. Why is everyone using USD or Chinese currency or any other national currency? 
Having asked that, please understand the difference between Bitcoin the technology or protocol and bitcoin the cryptocurrency, plus the 1000 or so altcoins. 
It's about use cases. Cryptocurrencies are applications of Bitcoin just like Reddit is an application of the Internet Protocol. Why isn't everyone using Reddit? It doesn't solve the problem for everyone just like bitcoin. Maybe in the future, we may see more or less adoption of bitcoin or other altcoins just like some fiat currencies have disappeared from nation states. Remember that money was universally accepted only after 400 years of resistance by those using minerals for value exchange. The currency may falter but the technology is here to stay and as more and more people understand it and use it, its adoption will raise.

Now visit that garbage truck and buy yourself a house, a car, and some clothes to cover your back.

Epic. I say understand the basics of Bitcoin and you Don't convincing to join. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:09:54
Not yet. A little bit in countries with hyperinflation or unstable currency. People have been using bitcoin to store value. Adoption is still very low and in the first world the problems with fiat currency seem normal. We haven’t been affected much save for occasional financial crises. We don’t see banks charges as exorbitant. We’ve always paid them. We don’t see clearing a cheque in about a week as a problem because it’s always been that way. So we can’t say it’s solving a problem unless we acknowledge it as a problem. So bitcoin is only relevant in places where such examples are considered problems.

Definitely. There are many variables. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:58:21
And what did the communist government do wrong?
