Overclock, EVGA, Hardforums and other forums have very good used hardware sections.
They are mid range cards these days. The 6870 will run even with it for &lt;$200. 
The problem is that the new 6 series doesn't run bitcoin as well as the older 5 series.
Bitcoin has driven the price up and I did get a good deal even used. Most people seem to want $200 per card. For that price you are better off picking up the 5830 off newegg for $109.
A few months ago you could have gotten a 5970 for $250 and I sold a 5870 with waterblock for $200 a year ago.

Your best bet seems like it would be to get three of the Klondike 16's, using 48 chips and use the last chip for a K1.

Total should be 2.35 BTC for 3 K16's and a K1.

If he controlled enough of the mining, so that he's getting transaction fees back every time. He would have to control most of the network. In that case we have other things to worry about.
That much mining hardware would cost millions upon millions for the hardware and hundreds of thousands a day to keep powered.
The likely way it would play out is some other miner would process his transactions and he would lose the fees. Then any transaction that wasn't processed would make it a later block.

The miner who completes the block gets the transaction fees.
Transactions are prioritized in the block. Higher fees come first. Small transactions may not make it until the next block or later.

His finances are a bigger roller coaster than BTC.
 Make 600k a year for 4 years (2.4 million) only manage to save $400k. Then goes out of business over $1k.
Really impressive BS.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:11:47
It's looking like: 
0.75 BTC if you supply the ASIC's. 
0.1 BTC if you supply all the parts.
No power supply included. 
We can solder on the ASIC's or you can have that done locally. 
Not finalized yet. The design still needs to be proven to work.

Wonder if they primed their own pump.

From that year?
1996 Toyota Supra sold for ~$35k, a used one will still run you about $35k.
going back in time.
Ferrari 250 GTO new was $18,500
used will run you $52,000,000.
Actually I can think of a lot of examples of appreciation. 
Still congrats on the NSX. Take a Drive up here to MI and visit the guys at LoveFab

Recent risk assessment was done. Closing the account in two months.

Thanks for the heads up.

Their holding period is. 
I move cash from Dwolla into CampBX
I then buy BTC with cash
I can't move BTC out of CampBX for 31 days now.
It's a one time deal, but pretty annoying.
I had a friend looking to pick up shares of ASICminer. CampBX was out for this reason.

RMA in two weeks.
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:49:43
To be fair. As slow as BFL is, they do have a working ASIC. KNCminer hasn't gotten nearly that far.
I'm not ready to give either my money though.
This is good. Since they've shipped a few jalapenos. They needed a new piece of hardware not to ship.

I got in on the ragingazn628 US group buy. I may order some chips from zefir also.
Everyone should have a better idea when Avalon releases their reference board specs, and we can figure out what a BOM is and how hard other parts are to source. I'm not ready to commit myself to anything. 
If their are some odd chips on their we will probably seem more group buys to get the 1k pieces or whatever is needed.
The other DIY PCB's seem to be centered around running 10-20 chips while the avalon unit takes 3-4 boards with 80 chips on them each.

I want to peg BTC to tankers of oil.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:25:45
It goes both ways. I was talking to my friend the other day. He seems to have deleted his wallet with ~100 BTC in it.
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:05:23
They use cgminer. So far they have been working at 350mhz. They in theory could clock to 450.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:55:57
You should get an e-mail also.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:03:17
Yes. Their group buys on the forums right now. Avalon has said they will open source their PCB design. It's going to be a good few months before the chips are shipped out though.

It says terrahash klondike 16 and 64
But Bkkcoins designed them. Terrahash is just a retailer.
 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:43:12
Good plan, doing the same.
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:30:30
They have kept up fairly well with batch one and two of the assembled miners. They have had a few weeks delay.
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:10:39
I think this makes them the most expensive of the avalon clones.
320 chips would have been ~26 BTC.
Others are offering to build an avalon for ~37 BTC if you provide chips.
The other non-avalon designs are even cheaper.
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:24:55
I'll have about 400 klondike 16's for sale to those that have ordered ASIC chips or want boards without chips. Were mostly just waiting on test chips from Avalon now.

If you pay a fee it goes off to the person who mines that block. You won't get it back unless that miner happens to be you.
If a group is paying transaction fees and moving bitcoins around at a high rate, they will eventually run out of bitcoins from the fees.
If they don't pay fees their transactions may be ignored in favor of people who are paying fees or are transfering larger amounts.
@_date: 2013-09-23 05:44:23
Since they plan on releasing the hardware / software as open source. I may build one or two.
@_date: 2013-02-01 00:56:52
Odd this one has an Enermax Revolution power supply. Other one had an Antec Earthwatts.
@_date: 2013-07-23 17:39:36
You may be right about that.
 700,000 Bitcoin in BTCST investments
paid 507,148 Bitcoin to investors
= 192,852 left
 transferred at least 150,649 Bitcoin to his personal account at an online Bitcoin currency exchange.  
= 42,203 left
XXXXXX lost day trading
86,202 sold.
So maybe 40k floating around. Hard to say. Most look like they were returned, lost or converted to fiat.

They are probably betting on a price spike if/when MtGox starts trading LTC.

You never know when that broken clock is right without a working clock to compare too. I enjoyed the article though, was funny.
