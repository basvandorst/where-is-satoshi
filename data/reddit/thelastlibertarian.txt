We still have to see how Bitcoin tests recession, we haven't been in one since btc history. 2 scenarios, people think btc as safe heaven and moon, or hodlers sell btc to cover other loss/expenses

I'm Roger Ver, long time Bitcoin advocate and investor.
Today I'm at the Bitclub world headquarters in Colorado.
I had a nice chat with  Bitcoin CEO, Matthew Goettsche, about their current situation.
He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers.
I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at Bitclub are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at Bitclub.
The traditional banking partners that Bitclub needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.
He will get away as usual by saying he actually believed they were legit
