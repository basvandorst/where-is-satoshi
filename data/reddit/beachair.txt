Firstly, very sorry too hear this.
In our society we are bred to believe money is the be and end all - it's a flaw of capitalism.
Money can put you in those situations where you may be happy - yet, it might change those around you, making you less content with what life is. 
Happiness comes from being on a meaningful path, growing and being with people who would be with you if there was no money.
If it's hard to see this, please travel and get out of your social circle for a while - our hierarchical history leads us to want rank, and money often opens these doors. Being away gives us new perspectives.
Hopefully this post can help/prevent others who are in a similar situation.

Hold on a moment. I respectfully disagree. Having read numerous books on money, society, crypos. I believe the fact that bitcoin is the next stage in how we transfer value, one which was long over due due to money being so sticky. (Before Babylon, beyond Bitcoin) The gates are open and this is just the begining of people realising. There are a lot of people with deep pokets coming in to tue game now (CNBC) with an unstable world to futher justify shifting from fiat (Goverment IOUs) to a decentralized value exchange.

For something to be valuable, its value is stored in the minds of people, Neanderthals wouldn't understand money as we do. So you need others to accept it and trust it will be exchanged for something else of value. It took bitcoin a long time for this and through gaps in need i.e. dark web, borderless, now increasing in value.
Edit: typos.

That the value. If it can be used.

Does this have any influence on the other exchanges? I.e. its higher on okcoin it will likely get higher on coinbase? (If ever) it's lower on okcoin it'll be lower on coinbase?

All you need is money for a phone, electricity infrastructure, wifi infrastructure, and $4,000 per bitcoin once youve got your passport and picture verifies by a exchange but well get back to that. So, Buboo, I'll give you 0.00034BTC for that chicken."

Plus interest - but there would need to be a steady BTC value. It only deflates as demand increases which will peak at optimum adoption. I think we are on a similar page but i like the debate -- it's stimulating

Already pretty fucked on that with whales; at least they cant print more. But a) there would have to be loans b) there would be a way to monetize it, even if there were a few failures along the way. I think a futures type mechanism could put the risk in hungry peoples hands

Well loan models would need to represent real value, so once the BTC value is found there should be a base from that. Much like market makers absorb risk, loans may be pay back less later. Does it make you realise that everything is like a chart up or down, rarely sideways.

Pay back more?
