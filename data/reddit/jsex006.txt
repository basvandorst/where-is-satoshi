The Govt. would only ever release one that they could control - Not opensource or decentralized. Therefore, they could inflate the coin supply on a whim, essentially printing money just like they are already doing now.

Bee cards for you
Connect your wallet to the Bee network and experience what your bitcoins can do for you. Bee cards function in much the same way as your normal debit card but with the added security of 2 factor authentication. Virtually fraud proof, use your card online without revealing any personal information in a fraction of the time. The merchants you purchase from have no costs associated with the use of Bee cards, so they may be incentivized to provide discounts for you.

Upcoming Products
Time locked Wallets:
Experience the investment potential of Bitcoin with none of the risk, agree to purchase a value of bitcoins over a pre-selected period of time and get either your original investment back or a prioritised share of the gains.
Euro-pegged wallets:
Maintain and interact with your balance in euros backed at all times by the equivalent value in bitcoins. Euro pegged wallets give your euros the security and functionality of the bitcoin network whilst removing any volatilty a bitcoin denominated wallet may experience. Spend, withdraw and deposit in euros much like a conventional account in any financial institution.

Absolutely, although if I lost them it would've been entirely my fault for trusting someone to hold my seed-phrase. I'll be holding onto my own backups from now on.

If I do that I won't lose access to the current MyTrezor wallet? (just a bit scared as I don't have the seed). Thanks again for your help
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:03:32
Shit. So i'm stuck with MyTrezor web wallet. Which won't give me the seed. Just my luck
@_date: 2015-05-24 20:35:16
Got my coins back &amp; sent them into a new wallet. Thanks
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:30:20
Thanks, will do. its late afternoon here, so ill check again tomorrow morning (16ish hours from now)
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:35:51
I won't be using one going forward, the consensus on reddit a year ago was that it was one of the safest ways to hold BTC. I'll be making more than 1 seed backup going forward too..

Thanks, the issue is I don't have the private key. I lost the seed for my Trezor wallet. So my plan was to send the money out, generate a new wallet with a new seed, then send the money in again.
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:03:37
Trust me, I will be doing that for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:55:47
Amazing! Thank you.. investing now :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:15:56
Fingers crossed - Yeah it's the transaction I posted earlier
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:32:43
Blockchain.info is saying that the transaction isn't found, which is scaring me big time.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:01:07
If I update, what are the chances of losing the wallet?
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:31:35
Noticed something else thats strange - The transaction put my account balance into the negatives.. how is this possible.

May as well be if MyTrezor doesn't rebroadcast the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:02:47
That's not the transaction - I sent 91 BTC to 16udHEkccEeBPj4xKXBB4ovc8SjKEcdt35
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:38:12
Absolutely Not
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:59:09
Not via MyTrezor. Is it possible in Electrum?
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:14:48
Its the former, as I sent the coins to the same address as my test transaction (which went through). Tried it on another laptop, and the transaction is unconfirmed with an error message if I try to view it on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:44:27
Thanks though, do feel slightly better.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:08:41
Tried another laptop, the transaction is still sitting there unconfirmed.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:07:04
Ok, I'll try it on another computer now.

Electrum just shuts down when I try to create a new hardware wallet. Guessing I may need the new Trezor firmware for this feature?
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:47:00
How do I find the Trezor source address
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:49:57
Massive relief - I've been buying BTC since April 2013, set amount each paycheck.. Never sold any. Was so scared that I'd have to start again from scratch. Making multiple seed backups today!! haha
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:57:34
Yeah that was the test transaction. How to I find the source address? looking now
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:57:38
Yes I did, I gave it to my dad with clear instructions to lock it in his safe. He lost it.. I was sending the coins out of the Trezor in order to generate a new wallet &amp; seed
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:12:47
Shit, so I'm basically stuck without the seed. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:43:47
Another part of the reason I sent the coins out of Trezor is because I lost the original seed (well actually my dad did, I asked him to store it in his safe, but somehow it got lost). I was going to create a new seed wallet after updating the firmware. I haven't updated the firmware yet, so I still have access to the old Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:04:47
If the Transaction doesn't go through, do the coins eventually return to the original source wallet?
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:09:46
Sounds great! I'd love to test it out..
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:35:59
I'll look into it.. if I ever get my coins back
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:34:04
Still unsure, but when I logged into MyTrezor this morning the transaction record had disappeared, and the coins were back in my wallet. Must have been a buggy software issue
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:33:30

I'd say 5ish years at least. When I say hold, I mean don't trade for fiat. 
True, there aren't many merchants who currently accept it, but the list is growing rapidly. I will spend some of my coins on the way up to help stimulate the economy and reward the merchants. When the Internet was first created, there were no browsers and most people couldn't understand how it would be used in everyday life. Look at us now. There is massive potential in Bitcoin, it may do to money what the Internet did to communication - for that reason alone, we should all have a small stake in it and worry less about day to day price fluctuations.

@_date: 2013-11-12 01:10:19
Sure, and it is a very interesting statistic. However, we have to remember that Bitcoin isn't a company, it is a technology. If people were able to invest in  the Internet, it probably would have had the potential to produce just as many billionaires.
The exciting thing about Bitcoin is that we can invest in the raw technology without worrying about human error that is generally associated with large corporations.
My argument is that Bitcoin won't actually produce many billionaires, people will be too eager to cash in at different staqes along the way.

That link refers to company investments, which are markedly different to technology investments. The former relies heavily on human decisions, which as we all know are susceptible to error and greed. The latter minimizes that risk, especially in this case, as Bitcoin is an open source, decentralized technology.
