I agree they sound like scumbags. But should being a scumbag be a reason for your property to be seized?

Hey, I’m with you.  But saying probably and stating they are not innocent are two very different things.
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:33:51
This is a very dangerous line of thinking.

Ohhh so we’re *not* talking about the movie staring Clive Owen. Duh.. who would think that..

I was not suggesting that they *were* the problem, just that they *could* be the problem. I've noticed a distinct lack of critical thinking around here lately.

Just transferred my bitcoins out, just in case.
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:00:24
Really? Is asking reasonable questions really the sign of a tool now?

It isn't market manipulation - the entire existence of the market is to facilitate buys *and* sells.

That does not tell me that those 500 other people are not also using Mt. Gox.

I'm not in a position to actually crack this - really wish I paid more attention in my CS classes. ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:28:37
Why? Does that indicate anything specific?
@_date: 2013-05-15 11:42:08
You are severely mistaken I think. It actually makes perfect sense that a lot of people saw the price dipping and decided to nope the fuck out while they still could.

A UDP packet walks into a bar, the bartender says "Hello, what can I get you". The UDP packet doesnt acknowledge.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:27:29
So how do you know this is not a Mt. Gox problem?
@_date: 2013-05-15 11:32:00
Eh its business, ain't no taste about it
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:47:35
That sucks.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:01:09
How do you know this? Maybe someone just decided to cash out because they thought it was time? My point is that even if it causes the market to go down, it doesn't make it an attack. That's how the market is supposed to work.

Thanks. It just seems a little too obvious - like I must be misunderstanding something or there is some catch I'm not seeing. Because when I look at the past charts it seems like I could have followed that methodology exactly and I'd be rich.

what the fuck is wrong with you? 'swag' is the giveaways - bumper stickers, t-shirts, pens, etc. that you get at trade shows and conferences. you are a COMPLETE fucking retard.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:24:57
It isn't an attack, the orders are going through.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:51:59
listen you dipshit fuckwad - swag as a word has been around a whole lot longer than the facebook tumblr yolo swag usage. it pains me because i sort of share your dislike of the slang being used around facebook - but you are totally misinformed here and you look like a complete retard to everyone who knows that OP used it in its (original?) meaning. i mean jesus just google it and you'll get countless online dictionaries which will explain this to you.
again, you look like a complete retard to everyone except yourself here - i'm just letting you know.

Shady as fuck. Page makes it look like $20 bucks has been donated but nothing has. This is a scam pure and simple.
