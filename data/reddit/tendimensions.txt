Diversification is key for life savings regardless of what it is. If he said it was all in gold he should still diversify.

Wait, what? I thought I was the highest level there was and I'm in the same boat on GDAX. What do I need to do with my Coinbase account to get authenticated fully on GDAX?

Sorry for asking, but what are off chain payments? Isn't the point of using it being on the blockchain?

What specifically about IkmoIkmo's comment do you think is "bad" justification (implied when you said it's used for acts of treachery). What would you have Greece do instead?

I thought you were saying that all loans were bad because they allowed manufacturers to drive prices up more than would have normally happened. I was saying cars (and houses) already started out as an expensive item and loans help the middle class obtain them for the benefit of the overall economy.
This isn't even touching on the benefit small business loans have on the economy.

While that's tempting to believe and perhaps contains a grain of truth, I don't think cheap credit is what the initial cause was. GM invented car loans in order to sell more cars because most people couldn't afford them.
According to information I could find ( a new car back then (before car loans) was about $18k in today's dollars.
Cars suddenly didn't get more expensive because of cheap credit. They already were expensive (and so was home ownership). When the credit is **too** cheap then you can see skyrocketing prices and a bubble, but I think it's a mistake to believe any loan is a bad loan.
EDIT: And by the way, I hardly ever see anyone talking about a big reason Greece is in this mess to begin with - tax evasion is a massive problem and has been for a long while:

Why does the employer keep BTC on hand when the price fluctuates as much as it does? Isn't it better for them to convert to BTC only at the moment they have to pay you?

Just don't sell the Bitcoins you have, though. Do everyone a favor and spend them where you can.

Do people want Bitcoin to become a widely used currency or do they want the value to skyrocket so they can get rich quick? I get the impression people don't understand economics if they think both can happen at the same time quickly.

Is the IRS really organized enough to be tracking BTC enough to the extent you'd really run a big risk of getting in trouble?
I'm under the impression there's still a big gaping hole where it comes to BTC transactions and having to pay taxes on it. Am I way off base?
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:12:05
I'm wondering if you're criticizing the FDIC and also hold BTC as a viable alternative because "you can't trust your money to be covered by the FDIC" or something to that effect.
Because, what I'm thinking is - any disastrous scenario in which the FDIC became incapable of covering your USD in an ordinary savings account - that same scenario would definitely result in no one being interested in your BTC.
We're a long way from some Neal Stephenson-esque post-economy world.

That's what I don't understand with all these situations. Why keep BTC with someone else? That's what I'm already doing with my USD.
I thought the point of BTC was to be able to have my own wallet on my own computer. As soon as I convert any USD to BTC I transfer it from the service I used to my own wallet.

Of course! I'm not talking about flagrant abuses.
But at the same time, if I mow lawns for $20/hour I'm not going to report that even if technically following the letter of the law I'm supposed to. Likewise, the IRS isn't exactly set up to be able to even know you didn't report every last dollar you earned.
What I'm asking is - is the IRS even monitoring BTC at all? It's a currency (ruled an asset, right?) that moves through gov't boundaries like they don't exist.
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it more - how is Overstock even going to pay their own employee taxes? I guess they'll pay the taxes first in USD, then convert the remaining to give to employees. In which case, the employee is filing taxes on the original USD earned.
Which brings me back to my first point - tracking purchases for cost basis seems unnecessary. I mean - if I buy something in CAD that doesn't mean I have a tax liability, does it?

I might also argue that OB isn't going to compete with Amazon - at least not right away. I imagine OB competing against sites like Etsy and Ebay at first.

The article isn't saying Bitcoin is bad. It's saying it provides the people with leverage over central authorities to responsibly inflate the currency over time. I don't see how everyone having a choice between two currencies (one inflationary and one deflationary) is a bad thing.

This isn't an anti-Bitcoin article. I think it makes a good case for how Bitcoin should and shouldn't be used in the world.

Are you actually saying someone in Kenya with no financial experience will have a more worthwhile opinion on Bitcoin than someone with a lifetime of financial experience?

And if they make BTC that much more popular, isn't that for the better anyway?

Certainly there are some rules that aren't there to just "keep the man in power". Some of those rules are there for the betterment of society at large. Your grandma needs a safe place to keep her money, she doesn't need super-privacy-no-gov't-can-own-me kind of protection.
Actually, the vast majority of people need the former more than the latter. Coinbase is helping mainstream BTC for the former category. I happen to think saying Coinbase is the same as a bank or Paypal is a bit much, but that's beside the point because BTC is what needs to go mainstream - who cares which are the successful companies?
