BitPOS has a shopping cart solution too!  With several plugins for popular carts on their github.
There's also no minimum withdrawal limit for Australian bank accounts.

Oh, and what gives it that quality?

I highly doubt Bitstamp has $350,000,000

Surely signing a message with a large-balance addresses's private key would be a better approach?

Hi there! Alex from BitPOS here - I work on the technical side.  Would it be possible for you to PM me the transaction ID, or the from/to address for this transaction?  I would be happy to see what happened for you.

The most prominent open-source database engine.
PostGresQL is an SQL RDBMS used by a lot of websites in place of commercial offerings such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.

Mongo is starting to work on the lock problem now - read [here]( for more
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:00:59
Yeah - not so bad at all.  
I discovered they had $4.73 of mine (woohoo!), and it was only a phone call away
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:22:55
Well, we've got Dogecoin - where's CatCoin?
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:24:10
Um.. would you believe, inflation? ;)

You do realise that Postgres has been around longer than MySQL, and that Oracle only 'bought' MySQL 4 years ago?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:01:49
That's a silly attitude, and this being the end of Bitcoin is simply not true.
You're just speaking from emotion, I gather.  In the end, this is no different to a bank becoming insolvent - and in many free market countries there is no government guarantee on deposits.
The same thing happened to deposit holders in 1929

Hi! Alex from BitPOS here.  
Just to add to the above - if anyone would like help in integrating the plugins into their site, we're always happy to help :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:56:33
Hi there!
The iframe integration currently relies on the order being created via a serverside call - but very soon now, we're going to launch our 'invoicing' product, which will be very similar to the Paypal service you mentioned.
There have been a few instances now where we've 'lent' developers to websites to do the integration on their behalf (e.g. CeBIT Australia, Bitcoin Barcamp) - but in both instances these sites were not static (i.e. they had a custom backend server that could call our REST API).
Stay tuned!

Because Coinjar is an exchange - and therefore is directly doing the 'selling' of the bitcoins to you.  Therefore they are required to 'include' the GST in the quoted price.  This means they have to give 10% of every transaction to the government, killing their market.
BTCMatkets is a *market* - hence they are not the seller - the people doing the trades are the buyer/seller
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:50:07
Who's to say, at this point :(
I run a Bitcoin point of sale business, and this kind of crap is why I keep all our coins offline, and have a transaction signing box (like a roll-your-own trezor), using Bitcoin Armory.
That way,  only have to trust myself :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:52:36
I can tell you something interesting: 
I wrote the Postgres blockstore for BitcoinJ - and someone from circle.com has had a patch to it committed in the last few days.
So whatever they are doing, it involves Postgres and BitcoinJ
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:39:35
Very good question.  
I've just come from that situation myself - 13 years of MySQL, and doing my bitcoin project (bitpos.me), in Postgres 
There was quite a learning curve in terms of the tooling,  privileges and datatypes - but I'm now convinced it was worth the effort, and that Postgres is the better engine .
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:16:36
Awesome.  Now if a real estate signs up, you can live off bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:42:24
To me, it's more about performance.
Too many shortcomings when it comes to popular NoSQL DBs (e.g. the global read lock in Mongo).  'Just shard it' is not really an answer

We've had an (old) miner running for a few weeks, to generate coins to donate to the TestNet faucets.
We progressed to using an ASIC because TestNet has turned into an arms race recently - someone bumped up the difficulty by running 1.3TH/s of power on it for a while, so CPU mining wasn't generating anything.
EDIT: Thus far, we've been generating maybe 50 coins/day, and have been giving them to the Mojo faucet.  See link above

Just chiming in here (Hi! BitPOS dev here!) 
We come down to Melbourne every so often to keep in touch with providers and merchants, perhaps we'll see you down there :)

This has been fairly big news in Australia for a while.
Two things to note:
1. They hold your money for a period, while trying to contact you.
2. They send two warning letters that an account is deemed inactive.
3. After they seize it, the money can be resumed by contacting the government, who pays it back with interest.
4. The government has been put under pressure on this, and is now extending it to either 5 or 7 years.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:35:46
Yeah - I tend to swing about.
I used NodeJS/Mongo for a recent iOS/Android project's server side, but found that I came to appreciate SQL RDBMSs even more.
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:34:30
They paid employees.
You'd be amazed how little distance that sum gets you with a few employees.
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:32:22
That's.... not how it works..
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:04:45
'ka' is a common Russian diminutive suffix.  Same with 'ya' - e.g Alyona (girls name), becomes Alya.
'Voda' is Russian for water.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:04:00
That would be a DoS - if it's coming from a single source, you could just nuke the traffic upstream

Are you using a Bitcoin services company to accept, or roll-your-own?
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:03:50
Go BitPOS!

I would find that very unlikely.  You can't participate in fractional reserve banking with bitcoin,  because you can't invent new coins for each coin lent.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:53:26
You just need your wallet.dat file, which contains your private keys.
The rest can be rebuilt on the target machine

Awesome man. 
It's amazing the amount of mainstream (positive) coverage that Bitcoin has received in the last few months.
