I got them as well. I have several wallets, but the only one that received the transaction was an address I have posted on a public website. Whoever sent them must have been scraping the web for addresses before sending

aaaannd both pending transactions are missing from the log again and BTC back in the account. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Great event, thanks @_date: 2014-05-29 21:27:53
I assume they are operating under the theory that, since they are not an exchange trading platform, the fiat to bitcoin transaction is not a "money transfer" it is a property sale
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:08:38
I see

This is fantastic. But won't applications like this cause the block chain to mushroom to unmanageable size very quickly? Most people don't have a spare 100gb on their HD

"There's a bunch of topics popping up about these We can use this thread for discussing it in a centralized place ;)
The two transactions for .00000001 BTC are a malicious spam attack. They were sent without fees, which means that if you wallet doesn't allow you to choose specific outputs your balance is tied up until those transactions confirm. I'm not sure who's behind it or what their logic is, but it's not just a mistake or an Olympic promotional stunt, it's an attack on the bitcoin network and individual's wallets. A nuisance attack, I suppose you'd call it."

Volatility decreases as VOLUME increases. Increased volume subsequently encourages market cap growth as a sign of higher demand pushing individual trading prices up
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:22:26
Not sure about that, it didn't cause any problems in my wallet. In fact the transaction never showed up in the actual wallet transaction log. The only reason I noticed was because it showed up in the blockchain log for the specific address it was sent to.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:41:52
Good question. I know at least part of the difference is that ATMs are an established business model with regulations already firmly in place and enforced, whereas virtual currency trading etc is entirely new. There's definitely strong arguments on either side for regulatory compliance, it's all rather in limbo right now while regulators decide what will and will not be enforced. Along with the prospect of virtual currency specific legislation.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:16:03
Excellent point, although I dont think most people would go through the extra trouble to buy bitcoin to use for one transaction. Good for you going through the extra effort to support merchant's decision to accept it!! I definitely think increasing volume and spending is great for the market, in fact one of the most important going forward for the success of bitcoin.

A lot of people seem to forget that regardless of the short term success of bitcoin, dogecoin, or any other coin, at the end of the day true success will come when these technologies actually replace current monetary systems. Everyone is in this together, and the battle is not won until governments stop threatening and scaring people away. Every nation across the world has expressed hostility towards crypto coins and as much as everyone here would like to think the technology is immune to government intervention they are dead wrong. Crypto coins could easily be regulated and prosecuted out of existence to the point where the value is back to absolutely nothing. We should all work together to ensure this doesnt happen by doing what we can to make a difference and support legislation and businesses that are friendly to crypto coins.

Only if someone is silly enough to make a significant purchase without researching the topic first. I'd argue that at even a moderately lower price point, regardless of future profitability, it's still a good purchases for someone to learn how to navigate mining or merely as a hobby.
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:17:53
Where is the option to change these settings to accept bitcoin? Went into my Yelp business account and could not find it. Is this currently only available to restaurants?
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:52:24
Killer plan!
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:39:26
They are very good with support. Some of my LTC got held up in a transfer and support fixed the issue within a few hours
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:40:02
Definitely not worth the effort

The fact that "you're not selling securities" is entirely up to legislatures and whether or not they decide to classify it as a security. Which they almost certainly will. Especially considering the fact that the Winklevii are already in the process of registering a bitcoin ETF with the SEC:

Its the user to user transactions that are most problematic 
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:11:54
Sent the transaction again, now both of them appear and I'm getting an error stating "We did not receive payment for one or more of your bitcoin purchases which resulted in a negative balance on your account. You can restore your account by sending BTC from an external account or purchasing that amount." Curious to see what happens
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:41:58
Everyone needs to be extremely careful when downloading Bitcoin related apps. I remember being hesitant to download the ticker, thinking something exactly like this could happen. Luckily after the first check my system is ok. But I would advise strongly against downloading any bitcoin/crypto coin related app that isnt absolutely necessary, and even then, only from trusted sources. Once a malevolent dev knows you are looking for a bitcoin app you become a perfect easy target to steal from because it is almost certain you have coins somewhere on your system or an online wallet. Hope no one lost too much!
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:08:12
Most people who don't use Bitcoin don't use their storage..my guess is most people here use what they have or close to it
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:11:40
Check out bitcoinattorney.info There are quite a few listed there.
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:41:12
Fair enough. Figured people would pick up the sarcasm. Maybe I should have posted in @_date: 2014-02-26 02:00:34
This is useless. Second Markets exchange will only be open to Accredited Investors. Raise your hand if you're worth $1M or make +$250k per year...

Great suggestions, thanks for taking the time
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:35:44
I would still run a check with  instructions. Deleting the ticker wouldn't necessarily remove the malware
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:33:04
Thanks for this! I downloaded the ticker a while back but deleted it shortly after.
Just to be clear, I got this message from terminal: "If you see a message stating "No such file or directory, nothing found to unload," the launchd task was not loaded on your system."
That means my system isn't affected, correct? (browser extension wasn't present either)

No, this isn't being sold by TigerDirect... This is being sold by Butterfly Labs, being resold by TigerDirect, being sold at Walmart.com ....HUGE DIFFERENCE. You're completely missing the concept of a supply chain. Walmart is a massive retailer with millions more customers than both BL and TD combined. Still good news
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:37:12
They are registered with FINCEN and either registering for MTLs in the near future, or wait for more concrete direction from regulators on what is required of them. The fact that VoS chooses to only operate where it has MTLs is their own choice. Do you have a source for that info?
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:55:59

Yes! Same to you man :) 
My goal for this project was to create something mobile friendly I can check while on the go, with a nice UX. I wasnt impressed with any of the other options, so I decided to take a crack at it. 
Send me a link to your app when you finish? Would love to see it!

@_date: 2017-04-09 00:49:51
Glad you like it!! I added quite a bit last night. More to come soon!!
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:02:33
I also noticed coinmarket cap asks "Please limit requests to no more than 10 per minute." Do they enforce this? How are you able to grab so much data at once?
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:52:00
I will come up with a solution for $AUD, the current API im using doesnt offer AUD so I wasnt able to add it with the others. I may find another API or do the conversion myself
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:08:13
That's a good point. The math calculating your gain/loss does not round anything, so that is still accurate.
Only the display for # Coins does rounding, I will add a few decimal places for ya
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:52:03
I will be adding initial purchase price this weekend on the individual coin pages :) 
I like the other ideas as well, although I would likely need to use another data store for more detailed tracking of sales info, etc She since localStorage isn't very flexible
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:51:41
Yes, currently that's the way to do it. You can only have one entry per coin
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:25:34
Planning to add currency selection this weekend €£¥$
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:00:46
Nice. How do you like the APIs youre using? Anything they are missing that you wish they had? I think you said   and CryptoCompare
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:56:32
I'm only 9, they will all go that quickly?
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:10:33
Use ShapeShift to convert into a faster protocol, then swap back to BTC
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:43:53
Good point :/

15. Bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:48:58
Transactional use: only based on my personal impression of the market, I don't see many stores accepting Bitcoin and it doesn't seem to be "trendy" anymore
"If users are buying to hold": was posed as a question, and merely a direct hypothesis based on my impression of the transactional market 
Critical mass: i.e. Enough users are making Bitcoin purchases or converting into fiat to support the market ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Transaction fees: only seem to be rising due to an artificially inflated market refusing to activate Segwit or other scaling solution. Additionally if no one is making transactions (only holding); even without scaling, transaction fees will equalize and reduce incentives to mine
@_date: 2019-01-26 02:45:26
Better late than never
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:57:16
You just asserted Bitcoin is a commodity. Commodity does not equal money. That's my point, thank you for making it. You can't fit Bitcoin in a traditional class, and you can create revenue with it
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:23:57
Examples would be better
@_date: 2016-09-23 05:05:32
Anyone used  ?
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:57:03
It's much more than a digital commodity. It blurs the line between many asset classes, one of it's strengths. 
Assuming, for the sake of argument it IS a commodity, you can absolutely make revenue from it in many ways:
Lending it out comes to mind, creating consistent compounding revenue streams

Absolutely not true. An ETF would open up the possibility for institutional investors and hedge funds, which cannot currently buy BTC due to strict regulations.
Institutional investors could immediately pump billions into BTC

Try [Coinfox]( instead, it's completely open source and stores all of your information privately on your device, in localStorage
