yerp keep telling yourself that, maybe you're a big enough narcissist to actually convince yourself that you matter to society, from commenting online. Go up to your boss and ask him for a raise, just tell him/her, i have over 28000 karma, im actually a big deal give me a raise". 
Lol i really am done replying to you dude, cheer up, if wasting your life is your thing, then enjoy what you do.

Another condascending ignorant fool. I am very aware of internet banking considering i have developed a lot of software around finance. I was interested in finding out, why is one so advantageous over the other or vice versa, and more specifically, what aspect of bit-coin cause such rapid popularization. And why a digital equivalent to american cash, isn't developed or isn't popular. You can call it internet banking and wire transfers all you want, but it is governed by the banks and isn't remotely the same. 
P.S. You have done the impossible in my eyes, sounded like fucking ignorant self obsessed sarcastic cunt, in one sentence.
P.P.S. go fuck yourself.

Lol you think that cunts me. I spent about an hour messaging him last night (night in my country which is why i stop replying to you), by the end of it i decided he's a bigger cunt that you are. Either way your original comment was very condescending, if you were annoyed by my replies well tough. Either way peace dude, i don't particularly care what you have to say anymore.

Wow, you really are just a brainless troll aren't you. nuff said. From the original comment, i was asking the subreddit, why online currencies based on that haven't worked out. 
Trust me i type a lot worse than it may appear, i can honestly not give a flying fuck what you have to say, if you're not going to legitimately contribute to the post. You are just another one out of 7 billion people who are starved of attention and need their fix to feel superior. I can honestly say you sound like a very petty and pathetic person. Peace.

wow that is the most disgusting display of education i have ever seen, just because you have talent/interest in a specific field you are punished for it. I personally would say that it's because she is clueless about what you wrote about and made her feel inadequate lol. Even if there is no retribution after your parents take it to the principle, just remember you have talent and are very intelligent, keep your chin up dude and remember academia is the shit, and everyone always has their critics.  : )

Could you explain this a bit further sorry. So are you trying to say that bit-coin holding it's own value is superior because it makes it more profitable? and what problem is it solving exactly, isn't it just like pegging every single currency to the gold, and then everyone also accepting gold as payment?. Wouldn't that just be the online equivalent of the bretton woods system, except with a bitcoin?

Besides Kanye pest, they were all great choices, but the sacrifice Snowden gave for the greater good of not just america but the worlds freedom, is unparalleled. He is truly a martyr and definitely worth being the winner.
