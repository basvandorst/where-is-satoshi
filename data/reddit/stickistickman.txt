If all you're doing is buying you're doing something wrong to beginn with. If you're just gonna wait forever and never cash out it's worth precisely zero.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:12:56
You literally talk like a gambling addict justifying it being stupid to every sane person.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:14:46
where people are so fucking stupid they buy stock and are happy when it goes down.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:22:01
What the fuck are you actually talking about?
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:42:04
Who doesn't love intense censorship and removing everything negative they can
@_date: 2019-03-24 07:13:47
Chaos is literally the opposite of natural. The universe is actively trying to achieve equilibrium.
@_date: 2019-03-26 08:56:46
Just like how you can write your comment however you want and I can still tell you it's stupid.
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:01:05
No idea what you're talking about
@_date: 2019-03-20 08:12:51
It's literally always the same account. Every single time.
@_date: 2019-03-19 10:22:37
Okay, that's actually a lot worse than I expected
@_date: 2019-03-26 08:57:23
That old fake article again?
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:00:08
Are you high or had a stroke?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:01:59
That's the case for 99.99% of vendors ... there is no adoption, there's just more ways for them to get dollars.
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:37:37
Aka: How to make graphs look like the way you want
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:54:46
Well, it's not. All it does is make it extremely misleading.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:36:57
That sounds like someone in primary school trying to be cool
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:55:41
This is such a joke. You do realize they're not getting a single bitcoin but just convert it to dollars?
@_date: 2019-02-20 11:48:29
No, that's still you and you'd go to jail, smartass.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:10:43
The most badshit crazy people come to the bitcoin sub
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:54:29
If that is "argues feverishly" to you, you should really leave your room for once in a month.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:45:57


God this sub is delusional
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:16:03
Totally, that's why the price is 100% stable
@_date: 2019-04-20 01:54:29
Only in America
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:13:29
Yea what a queue, 2/3 people wanting to use it at once by accident
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:42:53
And yet a lot of people can speak English extremely well as their second language
@_date: 2019-04-14 14:20:22
In a recent survey from one of the biggest IT sites in the world, the more experienced a engineer is the more likely he is to dislike Blockchain. Coincidence?
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:24:52
None of them.
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:11:32
Right ... so how isn't the title a complete lie
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:50:00
Cool, so just like Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:01:57
I like how racists like you always completly inflate the numbers
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:04:40
Oh, that's MUCH better! ^^^/s
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:23:31
Every site with HTTPS has encypted traffic
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:43:26
Except the people are obsessed with not doing that because they're delusional enough to think it will go back to 20K
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:46:30
That's basically the reason I and a lot of people come here fyi
Kinda ironic
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:31:49
That's in all of Europe you moron. It's also Muslims, not immigrants ...
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:08:03
If any of them could have cashed out.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:03:31
Less appealing you mean. Companies don't like loosing money.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:10:47
The people who have bitcoin to spend already have a ton of money in their normal currency. That's not true for something like Yen, Pound, Dollar etc.
So no, they wouldn't gain more people.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:16:00
Right ... so not really worth any money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:28:30
So you just implied that your own service isn't worth paying for. Well then.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:24:36
Why do you feel like I was talking about you then? Self reflection much?
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:38:19
I don't see the point why I'd pay for you instead of simply going for someone that's certified enough to guarantee it?
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:37:54
Like loosing the majority of your money?
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:16:08
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:18:35
People have been staying that for over 50 years now. Now WW 3 yet.
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:29:46
Yea totally. Not like all those people use banks and credit cards which already are digital ...
Try a better strawman
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:13:45
This comment is really ironic when you realize this happened 3 years ago and no one noticed or gave a shit.
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:11:36
Sure buddy. Except one is widely used in trading while the other is used by virtually none. But keep dreaming.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:50:37
So Bitcoin is completely doomed?
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:56:54
The money you have in banks is anything but sound.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:28:30
Ah yes, the polls and surveys in bitcoin communities. Nice one.
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:57:54
Yea, all of which never stopped me from doing anything with my money.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:42:14
That's sad .. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:00:28
As someone who's in this sub for the first time, you sound like you completely prove his point.
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:27:52
Maybe take primary school again ... 
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:18:47
Basically, yea. 99% of people have no clue what it is.
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:31:33
That's not a paradox 
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:17:12


That's not even close to how probability works ... AND STILL WOULDN'T BE A PARADOX
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:48:52
Talk to me when Bitcoin is used by millions of people daily.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:01:54
Well, too bad there aren't other currencies.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:43:34
Except they didn't make bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:42:02
Cool, so someone made up?
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:50:08
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:55:52
Your post and this comment sound like something form someone who just read Marx and is high.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:09:58
Well, it can. Easily.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:05:44


Holy fuck you're stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:29:48
You seem to confuse having heard of Bitcoin with knowing what it is and even using it. BIG differences.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:26:01
So why does dogecoin have value even though its completely useless?
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:22:54
As in, don't really accept it because they just convert it to USD.
