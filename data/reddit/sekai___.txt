It doesn't matter if it's true or not, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy, the same thing happen with CBOE settle.

If you're uncertain just average it out, buy some every week or so. This way you won't miss the new ATH and may buy some cheaper BTC.

Never disclose your wealth on the internet, it only adds risk and no value.

BTC isn't being mined with GPUs, other cryptocurrencies are, which are not going anywhere.

Let's say I want to buy/invest in that shiny new crypto/blockchain idea, what do need to do? Buy Bitcoin as it's the main pairing for all coins (and it's not going away for a long time). BTC tech is certainly lacking and might not be up to par with the demand, but many of the altcoins offer truly great ideas that can definitely generate "dividends" (e.g. masternodes, staking, Proof Of Stake system). That's another reason why Bitcoin has value - it's the main pathway to the altcoin land.

Yes, it's called arbitrage.

If you're so sure, why don't you just go short BTC at Bitmex with 100x leverage and become a multi-millionaire?

If you're in for the long term, any price is good.

Not for the first time, it crossed 100B when BTC reached 6000$ the first time.

If it would be so easy everyone would be doing it, trust me, the verification process takes time, transactions take time. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:06:47
That's the thing, "value" is relative. Bitcoin from a simple standpoint is an asset that is experiencing hyperdeflation, that's the main reason big players are scooping this thing up, it has potential reaching price levels exponentially higher (long-term).
That's another topic. You could argue that Bitcoin value represents blockchain itself, BTC being the daddy himself of all crypto is being seen as a brand, as an "index" of the whole sphere, and let's be honest, blockchain is just getting started. I disagree that 100% value comes from speculation, how much full control of your asset means to you? An asset no one could ever reverse or take from you (given appropriate security measures). Speculation is big part of what Bitcoin is today, but definitely not everything.

It's recommend to hold both for a few days after the fork so things settle down.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:15:18
If it's volatile it's a Ponzi scheme? Lol

It could be 7000$ by the end of the week, it's impossible to time the high, just average it out.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:10:58
If you hold BTC DURING the fork you'll have both coins.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:07:04
