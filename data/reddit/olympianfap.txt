I am waiting for BTC to continue to fall so I can get the most of my last deal at GDAX and shove off to Gemini. 
It's a shame things went down this way. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:39:12
Where should I go then?

You paid 60% or you cleared 60%?

Go for it, you might just make it big.

BTC: *exists*

Automobiles took 62 years?  
That seems a little long.  Are they counting individual sales or unique purchasers?  As in person A buys one car and is counted as a user and person B buys one car...

She spelled hodl wrong but gets an A for the effort. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:55:58
