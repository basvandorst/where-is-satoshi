I contacted coinbase twice, neither for issues this big. Both times, they contacted me roughly 3 weeks after I initially emailed them.

There was a flash crash that drove it down to like 10 cents for a few minutes....
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:50:48
What if it crashed to 0 and you were definitely not happy about it in the least but not in financial ruin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:27:30
He murdered a large % of that 23000 by buying shitcoincash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:55:48
LMAO, this is almost as good as the guy who posted that bitcoin is a safer store of value than fiat a couple days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:36:53
I was with you until the last paragraph. Do you have some sort of moral objection to speculation or something? Objectively, regardless of what it’s “worth to you”, the difference in what you could sell it for is around 60% in less than 30 days. Basically you’re saying that because it is (for arguments sake) a bubble, you refuse to make profit.

Remindme! 3 months “this guy will be eating his words”
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:46:56
How about an update on when they will stay up consistently for a full day?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:50:01
Unlike bitcoin, you don’t know the amount of gold that is left. Bad analogy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:04:27
Yeah really strange. How much would it cost me to send you $4 of bitcoin for a cup of Starbucks? How many more people would use bitcoin if it cost $4 to send $4 instead of $19 to $30?
Don’t be stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:00:29
Fuck yea man. Get that $$. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:43:28
And now it’s down 1.8% and climbing LMAO! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:47:05
Yeah, I know that rate can change drastically positive in a second if a new gold strike is found. It’s a stupid analogy. The amount of gold in existence is UNKNOWN. Period. The amount of bitcoin AND the rate it will be mined IS known.
Also, there are companies looking into mining gold on asteroids. That would drastically increase the gold supply. How do you propose that the bitcoin supply be increased? Wait, it can’t.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:29
Why not ask Wells Fargo. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:56:05
Can’t take your belongings to heaven?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:33
May I make the suggestion that you leave 1 coin in. Could be some nice gains.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:56:31
you don’t know how long, if ever, it would take to recover back to this level from that crash. It could stabilize at 7000.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:42:19
It’s almost back to 19,000 again already. So much for this crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:01:01
I can’t use bitcoin to create electrical contacts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:54:28
WTC-7 won’t go away....
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:03:13
Would need a fork or Segwit to drop.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:48:47
This is a stupid idea unless you’re in Venezuela. Bitcoin is way too volatile. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:11:18
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:02:45
You can’t math it. The amount of undiscovered gold on Earth is unknowable as is how close we are to mining it on asteroids. There’s way more gold than whatever number you used.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:24:06
Well, 90% of my portfolio is bitcoin so I’d say I have a vested interest in it improving and pointing out its flaws so people are aware what needs to be fixed that it doesn’t stagnate or get overtaken. But then I could just jerk us all off and say BITCOIN BEST EVER and then watch ethereum and Litecoin rape our gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:34:59
How much did you lose in your panic sell OP?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:31
The transaction fees are high as fuck though and it’s keeping bitcoin down. Imagine if it cost you $15 in fees to buy a $3 gallon of milk. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:33:57
Historical performance does not indicate anything about the future. And what’s the difference, besides adding risk, of getting paid in cash instead of bitcoin then BUYING THE BITCOIN.
The only difference is he’s adding the chance of losing a full weeks pay minimum if it crashes and not getting the option to hold the cash and buy on the dip. 
Why not just get paid in fractions of shares of google then.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:34:44
If it’s 72/75 complete, where did you get 1,0000 from? If 75 is the total, 72/75 is a pretty clear and reliable measure of progress.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:39:50
YES. Please tell us about your pee.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:22:37
You don’t know what those tests entail, they could be entire suites of test cases incorporated into a single test package. I’m sure they don’t publicize “75 functional tests passed”. If my team did that, we wouldn’t get any work done because we would be spending all our development hours publicizing numbers of tests passed. I don’t see anywhere that they were individual test cases.
How about a source relevant to these specific lightning network tests. A source that isn’t “I said so”.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:05
If I wanted to go buy a car with my bitcoin right now, I could do it just as quickly as with a check clearing. Not 100% sure what you mean by “haven’t been able to use it to make purchases”. 
And the thing is, I don’t even see bitcoin as a currency (for the first world), but I still think you’re wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:02:38
That would not increase the # of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:37:25
You’re basically clairvoyant! Would you manage my portfolio? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:39:17
You also weren’t moving per the speedometer.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:38:35
How’s he pressing the gas when the car clearly shows it’s not moving as seen in the 0MPH on the dashboard?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:44:54
Their servers went down when I tried to sell at my limit and then went down when I tried to buy in a dip. If I was to calculate it, they probably cost me about $2000 or so. Yet they will charge me $3 to buy $50 of Litecoin. Why would I say thank you? You can’t fuck up when you’re running a service like this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:54:50
He should have just used freedom units like a normal person.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:30
and if it hits .01 euro you’ll have .0001 euro!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:04:36
Lmao well he’s not pressing that either. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:34:46
I mean, it was like 12000, then it was 8500. That’s a touch more than 500-1000.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:24:31
Yeah but he’s not moving lol. There’s nothing dangerous abuse taking a picture while stopped.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:40
Yes, that too!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:42:24
Yeah, I’d go the other way around personally. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:16
If you aren’t trolling, the first thing I would do is a complete clone of that drive. Then once the drive is cloned, back up the file somewhere else, then copy the backup somewhere else and fuck with it there. Last thing you need is to corrupt the file trying to open it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:22:02
Well if it hits 100,000, you’ll have 1,000. If it hits 1 million, you’ll have 10,000. If it hits 10 million, you’ll have a house for $100 euros.
