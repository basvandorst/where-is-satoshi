The purpose of Bitcoin not to "attack" fiat, that is never the objective here. But here purpose is:

If they want to ban crypto is surely because they are scared of what Bitcoin capable.

I'm from Indonesia, I can say that the article is irrelevant for Indonesian Rupiah.  
Our lowest unit in rupiah is 1.000, well we have 100 and 500 Rupiah but it's on coin and is you can't buy shit with that.
