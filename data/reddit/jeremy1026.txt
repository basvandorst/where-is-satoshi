16k stop limit in place
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:34:29
It's staying out of a conflict that we have no horse in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:05
Yes actually. Stop limits sell at the next available price after the limit is reached. If another event like we just saw were to happen where $4k dropped out in a matter of minutes there is no way to guarantee the exchange will be able to get you a buyer at your limit price. It’ll make it for the highest it can.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:10
I'm looking forward to a correction, I want to get in a bit more. If it drops, I'm in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:05
Stop limit is even higher risk. As if the market doesn’t recover you’re going to sit in the order indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:06:33
Agreed, looks like the average sale price for an ‘04 is about $9500. Maybe it’ll be 1 BTC in a month, or it’ll be .25 BTC, hard to say.

Coins only exist after they are mined. Coins are mined by solving computationally complex problems. Currently there are about 16.7m coins in the wild. Based on the rate of increasing complexity and the trend in computational performance, the last coins won’t be mined until ~2140.

If there are no fees then there is no incentive for people to process transactions. Which means Bitcoin can’t be sent/received. Which would make Bitcoin worthless.

Spare change to a panhandler and $17,000 are two very different things.

You can, under no circumstances, “know for a fact” what bitcoin will be worth in a year.

It doesn't have "nothing" to do with Bitcoin. Just not centralized Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:00
Your money will grow, or decrease, with the price of Bitcoin. If it goes up to $34,000 you'll have $800 worth of Bitcoin, but since its not guaranteed to continue to rise it could also go to $8,500. Which would mean you now own $200 worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:35
I'm glad you're able to keep trying. If it doesn't work out, remember that there are a lot of kids out there who need a home to call their own, and that adoption is always an option.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:55
A bit of a clarification, it'll sell as close to $10,000 as it can. If it plummets quickly you might get less than $10,000 as exchanges can only process so many transactions at any given time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:18
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:49:14
Seems like all the candidates figured out it wasn't a good idea when experts were able to weigh in on the subject. However, Mr. President doesn't believe in the experts so he just does whatever he wants.
Look, I'm not arguing about this anymore, not today. Today is Christmas, and I'd prefer to not spend it talking about this bafoon.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:51:03
Here is my problem with that, with a maximum of 168m Satoshi available, that means that currently 1 out of every 44 people in the world will be able to own any amount of Bitcoin, assuming an even distribution. That is where "limited from of money" becomes a problem.

Would you rather Coinbase focus on getting back up and running, or answering each ticket asking why they are down?

Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. You have the most accurate metaphor in this chain so far.

It was in a post titled something along the lines of, “If the accusers of trump are so sure he did it, why not take him to court?” I posted a link to an article (that wasn’t Fox News, which is probably why I was banned) about the case that is currently in pretrial to see if he can be sued in civil court while in office.
The funny thing was, I was the 3rd or 4th top comment with about 100 upvotes when I was banned. So it wasn’t hated by the community, just the mods apparently.
Edit: [Found it](
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:12
I’m getting really tired of articles that don’t fit someone’s narrative being immediately called “fake news”. There is a stark difference between, “I disagree with the sentiment of this article” and “this article has incorrect factual statements.”
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:40:04
Your input placeholder should be “a coin” or “a currency” instead of “a bitcoin”. But other than that, nifty job.

Right, and blew clear through it.

The “American Dream” is less “being able to pay for stuff” than it is “being able to start at nothing and make something of yourself”. Also, it’s not so much a thing in the past few decades. We have separated the levels of wealth to the point of unless you come across an amazing windfall (BTC?) you are typically fairly stuck where you started. There are a few who are able to move up considerably, but typically it’s just one or two steps up the ladder.

It was probably caught in a spam filter, and the mods just pushed it through.

Incorrect. Please stop spreading false information.
What is a 'Stop-Loss Order'
An order placed with a broker to sell a security when it reaches a certain price. A stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor’s loss on a position in a security. Although most investors associate a stop-loss order only with a long position, it can also be used for a short position, in which case the security would be bought if it trades above a defined price. A stop-loss order takes the emotion out of trading decisions and can be especially handy when one is on vacation or cannot watch his/her position. **However, execution is not guaranteed, particularly in situations where trading in the stock is halted or gaps down (or up) in price.** Also known as a “stop order” or “stop-market order.”

Invest what you can afford. Your returns will be lower than people buying in $10,000 at a time, but your return rate will be equal.

Sure, if you have no other expenses you can pay it back in 5 years. But that also assumes you got a decent job out of school, which many people don’t get anymore due to market saturation. About $45,000 a year salary would result in a take home pay of about $30,000-$35,000 depending on different tax factors you’d have to put every last penny to your (interest free) loan to be able to pay it off in 5 years. Since most people like to have a place to live and food to eat though, they aren’t able to dedicate 100% of their income to student loan debt. My wife actually paid nothing but interest on her student loan debt for the first 4 or 5 years out of college. So that was fun.

If people inside Coinbase who knew exactly when it was going to launch, they could tell friends to buy up the alt before it gets added to one of the largest exchanges. When Coinbase/GDAX adds a new coin, it usually surges in price for the first few hours. If the employee or friend(s) buy in before the unannounced launch, they have an advantage that the rest of the market doesn't.

If by "interest free" you mean, easily up around 10% by the end of the four years, then yes it is very interest free.

If the last 9 months repeat, you'll turn $20,000 into $300,000. However, that isn't guaranteed. As with any investment, there is always risk.
