I dismissed your response at first because I thought there was no way localbitcoins could handle that volume in a single day.  But now I'm not so sure: you're right about the buy demand being high when the price is skyrocketing.
Would you worry about your personal safety if you were doing a lot of high volume in-person trades on localbitcoins?  What about the legal ramifications about high volume sales there?  I wouldn't want to risk getting investigated as a money transmission business.

Coinapult looks like the best suggestion in the thread so far.  It looks like their limit is 10,000 BTC!  I'm planning on emailing them to confirm.  Do you know what Circle's limits are for verified users?  I suspect they're similar to Coinbase's limits, which aren't nearly enough to cash out 21 BTC at 100K USD each.

I'm having the same experience with Coinbase.  No matter what verifications I give, they won't raise my limit any more.  And for a time-sensitive trade, $10K per day won't cut it: it would take 210 days to cash out 21 BTC if we ever hit $100K per coin.
Maybe the best we can hope for is to sign up for ALL the exchanges we can find.  Then, in a pinch, try to cash out as much as possible at each one of them.

So the only way to receive bitcoin in this app is through SnapCard?
If so, you'll need to follow whatever steps SnapCard requires.  This means that if SnapCard requires an ID, you'll need to supply it.  If SnapCard requires and ID and you can't supply it, bitcoin isn't actually an option for you.  Best to go back to your app and select your usual PayPal option (assuming you can change your mind at this point).
On the other hand, if your app allows you to receive bitcoin in another way besides SnapCard, try one of those other options.  The best option (if the app allows it) is to accept bitcoin directly.  In this case you'll need to set up a bitcoin wallet first.  There are lots of them out there, so do your research.  You don't need to supply any kind of identifying information to set up a bitcoin wallet -- it's just another app for your computer or phone.

Thanks for the reply!  I suspect I'm going to go with Coinkite.  I discovered that they have a "Curl Helper" utility that looks useful in helping to create well-formed curl commands that will interact with their API.

Good tip.  But, does documenting a timestamp via  create less blockchain bloat than documenting a timestamp via   I suspect not.
As far as I understand it, proofofexistence embeds the actual checksum into the blockchain with OP_RETURN, but btproof doesn’t embed any additional information at all.  Instead, the checksum is encoded directly into the receiving address.

This makes sense.  Thanks for the explanation!
