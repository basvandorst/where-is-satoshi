What about the two years of 2014 and 2015 where the price dropped the entire time? That's a quarter of bitcoins history that majorly sucked if you look at price action. Those 3 cent tx fees were sweet though.

I removed funds from mtgox because of their ongoing technical issues in the year leading up to Sept 2013. When the price run-up started in September there was a lot of hype. I wanted to cash out my stash but moving funds to mtgox was too scary as they were failing often and people were saying they couldn't withdraw Fiat. So I hedl. The excitement of the run-up was intense. Everyone knew it would drop at some point because the ecosystem was so flaky.
The drop came hard, but it was no surprise. The industry didn't have a good exchange yet and Coinbase had launched only a few months earlier and was US only.
The following two years was a build-out of new companies and better platforms. Big funding rounds came through during the price drop. The protocol saw development and new blockchains were born. It was a great time unless all you cared about was price. 
As others have said, my hodl is now made of asbestos. Nothing can make me sell.

Good read. The article gives some insight into the reasoning that leads to these exchanges listing BTC futures. It's just a matter of time now before coinbase is acquired by one of these big players. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:02:37
The CME website also has an educational section with a complete multi-video course on futures. Time to get educated.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:03:27
I don't think we will. Mtgox + silk road dominated the media for a year. When bitfinex lost all that BTC and then scalped everyone's account illegally, nothing much happened to the price. It would take something insane to push BTC into a years long slump at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:50
How exactly will they massively short Bitcoin? I keep seeing this sentiment but have never seen a strong supporting argument that shows the steps in detail.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:34:07
What if they got rich off other rich people also in Bitcoin? Should they be compelled to give a little back to the rich? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:52:55
30*18,000=540,000. That's roughly the maximum total contribution over that time. Compounding interest would put the maximum balance much higher. Let's say $2mm total. To have that much crypto, you're looking at about 200 BTC collected over the last three years. Of course that's the upper estimate. It could be anywhere from 1 to 2mm, but it's fun to estimate.

It's not quite either. They've publicly said that coinbase transactions are put through on gdax. The exact methodology is mysterious, but you're definitely getting fucked by coinbase if you trade on gdax because they have perfect information and trade against their own customers.

I don't think coinbase is accepting new merchant accounts anymore.

If you want to be cool and donate to something that supports cat rescue -  they accept bitcoin. Pineapples didn't drop for these folks.

It's not that simple. If there is a business reason, then they will. Right now it doesn't make sense. Few people have Bitcoin. Fewer people use Bitcoin for trade or commerce.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:56:22
Something like this is already in play. Most BTC is owned by a relatively tiny number of early adopters.

Legit question. I don't have any source I can link to, sorry.

We need articulate answers to these questions. Peter's answers were average, but not strong. 
1 - What's it backed by? It's backed by the people that use it all over the world, there is no central authority that can freeze or control your bitcoin.
2 - Is it anonymous? No. It's about as anonymous as email or a twitter account.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:43:21
USD balance is covered by FDIC insurance. BTC / ETH / LTC balance is not insured. They have insurance that covers loss of their hot wallet.

Jokes on them. Zuck probably owns twice their haul.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:04:36
The crypto they insure is not yours, it belongs to coinbase. In the example you referred to, the BTC is not insured because it's not the operational hot-wallet.  The person you were replying to is correct.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:53:47
Expect failure -- as with ETC and BCH. Put your crypto elsewhere or suffer the consequences.

Redistribution will happen. People that suddenly find themselves with $50k worth of bitcoin probably have debts, and want to buy trinkets and items they believe convey status. It's inevitable that humans are bad at money management and will pass on their wealth through consumerism.

Regarding identifying info. An exchange employee on the compliance team can look at the amount, the time, the date, the cell network, the language you're posting in, screenshot resolution to look at possible phone models, and some things I'm not thinking of. It's easy to connect your Reddit account with your exchange account. Now they can check all your other Reddit posts too and makes notes about you, or just make fun of you in slack.

I would only argue that you should be free to consume for the good of the economy if it pleases you. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:48:16
Incorrect. Only the online hotwallet is insured. Online. That's not your deposit balance.

Years back I joked with a friend that our grandkids would be amazed anyone could own one entire bitcoin. Even at today's price, most people on earth cannot hope to attain one bitcoin.

NYSE is one of Coinbase's investors, putting an ATM in the NYSE building would be supporting the competition.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:35:21
Not sure why you're being voted down, you're correct. Coinbase makes a clear distinction between 'online' and 'offline' funds. Your funds are stored offline, and offline storage is not insured at all.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:02
I disagree. People in around $13 and before are the early adopters that see Bitcoin as a technological innovation with massive long-term potential. It wasn't a mere financial investment back then. It was much more. For those reasons, we ride through all these years of turmoil and growth. And the $1000 price was less than a year after $13.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:37:16
Well, you are. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:55:08
This. Discussing the strategy of putting 5% of your investments into something with a high risk profile is encouraged. But pushing Bitcoin specifically is pointless when discussing strategy.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:45:59
Online is the key word. Your balance is not insured, only their online hot wallet that is used to process in-flight withdrawals and deposits is insured. That's not your deposit balance.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:29:57
There is no central authority that controls and backs Bitcoin. It is backed by the people who choose to use it.

Luckily, yes. If there was an objectively correct version of everything, we would live in a deterministic and boring world.

Other exchanges have different requirements. It appears that each exchange sets their rules for margin in discussion with the relevant regulators. Maybe GDAX pissed somebody off.

Google Authenticator is just one implementation. There are others that will let you export your settings, if that's the security compromise you want to make. You can also use the yubico app, which stores the secrets on the yubikey. You can store the secret on multiple yubikeys (something you need to do when initially setting up) and not be dependent on your phone.
