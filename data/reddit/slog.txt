Totally a viable currency right now. Yup.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:28:01
Totally viable currency! Lol.
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:19:33
I don't think you understand my point or his in the video. That's okay. You'll get there.
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:22:18
How do you think that is even an indicator?
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:26:34
Yeah, genuine concerns with certain coins are the worst!
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:56:24
Because Bitcoin isn't currently a viable currency.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:22:01
Shh. You're bringing logic and reason to You're probably about to be banned.
@_date: 2019-11-17 02:35:32
Definitely an improvement in speed. Transaction costs are still a thing, sadly.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:41:36
Because bitcoin is a more viable currency? Lol.

This is the kind of helpful comment I come to this sub for.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:02:01
That doesn't answer the question at all.
Edit: I'm just realizing that your comment may have been sarcastic. Getting harder and harder to tell these days.
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:58:08
I fail to see how that's an actual problem. They use this information to profit, as is the nature of business. I'll gladly provide this information if it keeps the service free. Saying they don't provide anything back is disingenuous because, as you state, they're providing this forum. What actual negative effect does this have on you?
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:06:19
Haha. That's hilarious. Ya know some people actually believe this so a /s would be helpful.
@_date: 2018-10-14 15:22:22
You're still not answering, you've just changed it to being about treating each other better. In what way is tracking user data treating people poorly?
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:37:57
Because the children in middle school were waiting on the final bell to ring.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:10:50
That doesn't make sense. Please elaborate. What is a legitimate problem with doing this?
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:40:14
$17 million to buy a lamborghini? I need to sell you some stuff...
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:03:52
So stability and ubiquity don't matter in an actual currency? That's not even covering the multitude of technical issues preventing mainstream adoption. Crypto is great and all but this sub just blatantly ignores the shortcomings of most major ones.
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:19:15
You're right, I don't understand because you haven't given me anything real to go on. So the business wants to increase profits? I'm still confused about how exactly this has a negative effect. Is it directly impacting you in some way? Indirectly? Please be specific. Based on what I'm reading, your concern is "they're tracking their users and I'm angry about that because reasons!"
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:53:12

@_date: 2019-08-13 21:25:30
Actually laughed out loud at this one. Hilarious but people actually think this way.
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:16:20
Right, but your example is about how it affects you.
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:33:24
That's not at all the same to the people invested in either. If you have $10k in Bitcoin and $1k in the stock market, which one will hurt you more when losing 3%? Also, 3% is a joke to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:45:15
Which other viable currency is as volatile as Bitcoin? Do you not understand how currencies work? How about transaction costs, instant verification, backing by any sort of entity, ubiquity? I could go on.
Comparing it to the telephone is laughable.

My USD isn't volatile like Bitcoin. A dollar is effectively the same value every day. You're saying we need to not know if we're going to lose 10% of our money (or more) in a day? is looking for new content.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:06:43
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:16:54
It's more "fiat is and always has been a complete failure!!!1! The most volatile currency ever is all I use to buy anything! Bitcoin 4 lyfe!!"
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:35:10
That makes absolutely no sense. My actual government currency doesn't fluctuate in value by double digit percentage points in a single day making it an actual usable currency.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:22:10
This is the only place I go to to troll the users but only because it's SO EASY. It's hilarious how little 95% of them know about the basics of economics, investments, etc.
There's still around 5% that aren't complete morons and actually know their shit really well. I'd be willing to bet that most of the 95% think they're part of that group. That's what makes this so fun!
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:31:43
So then what's your point?
@_date: 2019-12-29 03:43:46
Are you new to or something? Literally everyone here is 12 years old, they're all forex experts, fiat has failed, Bitcoin is a stable currency, and unicorns poop mining rigs.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:00:12
Ha! Holy fucking shit you people are dense. Are you literate? This sub is full of people less capable of critical thinking than the_donald. Try reading my comment again...slower this time.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:13:18
Show me a more volatile "investment." Every single day of crypto is a rollercoaster. If you don't see that, you haven't been paying attention. It's a gamble right now, plain and simple.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:01:31
Could be and has been for me. Could crash and burn in an hour.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:44:29
Ha, you're ignorant and don't even know it. You thinking you're clever is extra hilarious. Get back to me after you do some reading. I'll wait.
@_date: 2019-09-07 06:10:59
Oh? What drives its movements?
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:33:04
Hahaha. That makes it volatile right now! You're reading this, right?
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:05:32
Please tell me you're joking. If not, here it is broken down into something you can understand...the public doesn't take this currency seriously right now. This attitude which is prevalent (not just one comment, jackass) means that people don't take the users of this currency seriously. No faith + no understanding + jerkoff users = adoption is minimal.
You done spewing bullshit now or do I need to spoon-feed you more?
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:12:39
Because society doesn't change or have different requirements over time? Are you people really this fucking dumb? It's infuriating and absurd how full of ignorance all of these arguments are. Please at least come to the table with a middle school level of knowledge on the subject.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:16:45
But you're supposed to have gotten in at $100 and never ever spend it because its value will increase 100 fold year over year forever! HODL! Totally viable currency!
If you can't tell, I like trolling the children in They're absurdly bad at logic and finance. Keep doing what you're doing (except probably investing in volatile crypto).
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:06:32
Ha. Lasts thousands of years and is somehow a failure. Yes, we all want cryptos to take over in one way or another but this sort of stuff is definitely a contributing factor to slower adoption. Be realistic.
@_date: 2019-09-07 13:00:00
This is about what I expected from your comment. True insight.
@_date: 2019-09-14 04:35:27
Can't deliver an absurd request that isn't representative of the discussion? Nope, I can't. Show me proof that fiat is dying in general. Show me that it's a scam. Show me that it's a failure. Those are actually requests for information you claimed without any information to back them up. Don't move the goalposts again. Back up your statements. I'll wait.
Sorry you don't know how adult conversations work but calling someone a 12 year old when making absurd statements and then presented with the truth is about as childish as it comes.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:14:02
The classic "I know you are but what am I" defense now? Please tell me I'm being trolled. I'm out. Good luck with...whatever this is.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:45:26
Yup. Hence the gamble.
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:59:58
Look up the actual history. A few hundred AD, depending who you ask.
Do you really not understand how currency works? Shit, this is going to take a while...
@_date: 2019-09-14 19:20:56
Please tell me you're trolling and not serious. You're a joke and not worth any more time. Try to be less of a disappointment to the world.
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:58:24
Wow. Just wow. Are you a troll or complete moron? Serious question.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:01:17
Yup. Exactly what I said.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:00:29
You could say that about almost any investment. "You could have made money if you just bought at X time." Thanks for proving my point.
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:09:11
What's "the truth" in this instance? That you're charged a fee to use your currency? I can spend my $ at no cost, it's instant, and I even get money back if using a credit card and pay it off right away.
