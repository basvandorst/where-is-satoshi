Boston Celtics basketball. Get pumped. All jokes aside... Its very exciting... But thought this sub would have more insight into the actual space, discussion about the underlying dynamics at play in terms of trading and pricing, and just in general would have more insights and less masturbatory look how good bitcoin is going type posts 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:06:08
Am I wrong, or is 90% of this sub just "woo look at the price of bitcoin" posts?

He's a cock. Had way too many interactions with him over the years in Tokyo. Not a chill dude. Classic foreigner living in Asia and acting like a big man.

Bch might not replace btc... But if the Chinese decide to reintroduce exchanges and have been the ones buying bch then it leads me to believe they'll push bch as the supported coin, which in turn would be massively bullish for it. I don't have any... I'm in btc and a number of other alts but I can see a world on which we get a very large bch move. Just hope I get paid and can add a little bit before that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:02:35
Jesus... They still didn't give you guys your bch? That's insane... That fork happened ages ago 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:28:17
But If you're of the view that the Chinese want bch to be the go to bitcoin and that they use the Korean exchanges to buy bch then it doesn't seem that surprise or ridiculous that bithumb would be used for the buying.
I don't have any bch right now... But the fact that it's the Chinese buying actually is a positive in my mind. As someone who works in the industry... When Chinese money moves... The market follows aggressively

Yea! Let's make fun of other people who are also starting to get involved in a new field and lost money. Wooooo...that sure is Cool. Tool.
And don't worry... I own btc, had some bch but sold it well... So I'm not even posting out of saltiness, I'm posting because you're negativity sucks and is toxic for the community.

I know. Thats the irony of the whole thing which btc defenders don't talk about or think about. (to be clear I own both btc and bch so don't really care...) the research I did this weekend, a little shallow admitedly, basically boils down to only one thing that matters... The lightning network... Btc will depend on it and thays why they put in place segwit, or you don't want it and you use bch. But Noone on btc can explain to me why they're ok with the network and the fact it is built on taking transactions off the chain... Literally the majority of transactions will be off chain and dependent on pseudo centralized btc pots... Almost like debit accounts... I wonder who will run and control those outside the chain subnodes
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:31:19
Anyone here who doesn't think bch being pumped in Korea is a sign that the Chinese support bch is just dumb, or doesn't understand what the Asian investment landscape looks like. 
I don't own any... But I'm going to buy some on the next pullback... Can't argue with Chinese volumes. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:22:26
Because by keeping the blocks small it makes it so scaling doesn't happen, thus ensuring that the lightning network becomes the default solution, which will take transactions off the blockchain and into more centralized private hands
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:25:12
Yea man... Its terrible. Doesn't help that btc folk go into the bch reddit and shit post non stop too. I found that the forum. Linked in boxminings videos have potential. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:20:21
I'd tell you you're perspective is embarrassingly simple minded.
Altcoins are ways to invest in micro /small cap pre companies which are all geared to blockchain technology and innovation in one way or another.
Alts with solid value propositions and the potential for long term growth with real life use cases are a great tool for investing a small amount of money and achieve outsized returns.
Or in other words.
What of I told you... That in 11months btc went from under 1000 to 8200...but that eth went from 8 to 350?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:19:06
Let me be clear... I've just spent a few hours poking around and I'm by no means sure of anything. But I just find it weird that no one here in btc even questions anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:52:31
Fair enough... But to pump you still have to take risk that the market goes against you
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:03:23
It's not thousands... It is 160000. And yea... It strikes me as a problem. Will see if it clears up, but how long are you willing to wait for your transaction to go through? I would imagine a ln extended wait like many of my friends are dealing with would be a turn off.

How can you see the profitability in the future? Everyone quotes this difficulty adjustment profitability swing as the key, yet I haven't seen anything showing that it will happen. Any help greatly appreciated

Yea... Its fins... Just be totally cool with not being able to move your money. I'm only on 24 hrs now. It's cool... Who wants the ability to actually choose what you do with your money

Bitcoin and anonymity will end sooner rather than later, and it will be a good thing. Without kyc and some form of regulation there will always be an argument made against bitcoin as a way to launder money or do mischievous things and the govt and incumbent corporations will always use that to block its growth. Look at Japan... I just got an account here and it was very ID intensive process... That's because the govt has legislated it and now it is being widely adopted all over the country and legitimized as a real form of currency.
I don't think we can have it both ways...annonymity means it will always be blocked and puts the space more at risk. If you want viability in bitcoin and crypto you need some light regulation.

Yea that's true. Tons of manipulation and large whales drive price actions... But at the same time crowd mentality is what the charts represent... So you know... I assume the patterns will have some similarities

Any bank that touches the usd (all of them) could be brought to block all crypto acct withdrawals into fiat if the US govt pushed sanctions against them for noncompliance.
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:37:55
No trend reverses in a V... We need months of sideways consolidation before anyone should be buying. Don't catch the falling knife.
Better to miss 20% on the upside than be too early. Remember... Just because it falls 99% doesn't mean it can't fall another 99%
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:34:51
The reality is that this meme is nonsense. If the US declares that any bank providing a fiat portal for a crypto exchange is banned from transacting with the US then every exchange gets shut down and btc is driven underground
