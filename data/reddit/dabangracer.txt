Yes, this is true, bithumb is sucking on BTC withdrawals right now. They say they are working on their system to allow for the higher mining fees required under current conditions. But yeah it really sucks and they are not even submitting the transactions. fwiw, Coinone also not allowing BTC movement right now, while Coinnest submits with ridiculously low fees and consequently they're getting stuck as unconfirmed.
Can confirm that other crypto withdrawals at Bithumb are processing w/their normal "approval" time (usually variable from 5 minutes to 1 hr). Have withdrawn ETH, QTUM, ZEC, over the past few days while my BTC just sits there waiting.
Before this past week, was able to withdraw BTC no problem.

For some reason the public entry page shows shows a range starting from 0%, but in fact if you click through as a logged in user this is not the case; the fees are low, but there is no 0% fee tier.
The base fees at Bithumb are 0.15%. You can prebuy fee "coupons" for a fixed volume of trade which effectively reduce the base fee. With these prepaid coupons you pay no fee at time of trade, up to the coupon value. This reduces the effective fees (since you've already paid for the coupon) to somewhere between .075% and .01%. Higher tier reductions are reserved for only high volume traders, and all pre-bought fees expire after 30 days (if not used, value is lost).
They're also having a limited time 4-year anniversary promotion right now where any level of trader can buy fee coupons which bring the effective rate to .04%. Specific example, pay 40,000 KRW, roughly $37, and get zero fees on 100,000,000 KRW, or $92,000 worth of trades. These coupons are only good for use within 14 days.

Bithumb has pretty low fees but they're definitely not zero.
See my other comment in this post for the actual fees.

I think if you search you'll find that this question has been answered many times, but hey, let's go again...
Short answer: capital controls.
Capital outflow is controlled by banks. There is no Transferwise or similar service in Korea. Why? Because an individual is limited to $50,000 (USD equivalent) outbound transfer per calendar year. This limit is extensible to a certain extent for legal residents with a documented earned/taxed income source, but not to the level required for continuous massive profit. An individual must declare a single bank as their gatekeeper for foreign exchange; this bank then records your transfers against the legal limit. There are no ways around this that do not violate Korea's Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. Even businesses need to document the source and purpose of their forex transactions.
If I have time later maybe I'll try to make a top level post about this with sources, as it's really become quite frequently asked/answered.

Just out of curiosity, are you saying you were able to create a full trading account (verified for trade/deposit/withdrawal) on a Korean exchange without being a Korea resident? This used to be quite difficult for non-residents so I'm wondering if the requirements have changed.

Korean exchanges definitely have fees. Not sure where the zero fee narrative comes from but it is inaccurate.
~~(Don't have time to go into detail here, but you can check my past comments on the matter. Can reply back with more detail later.)~~
edit: here's what I've posted elsewhere re: Korean exchange fees...
Bithumb base fees are 0.15%. You can prebuy fee "coupons" for a fixed volume of trade which effectively reduce the base fee. With these coupons you pay no fee at time of trade, up to the coupon value. This reduces the actual fees (since you've already paid for the coupon) to somewhere between .075% and .01%. Higher tier reductions are reserved for only high volume traders.
Other Korean exchanges like Korbit and Coinone, do have high volume tiers where Maker fees are 0%. This is for example limited to traders with over $10mil USD equivalent last 30 days volume. However, it's worth noting that Polo, Kraken, and Bitfinex have similar high trading tiers with 0% maker fees, not to mention GDAX and it's free for all maker orders. So I'm not sure why people consider Korean exchanges differently?

Sure, I'm aware there's a [page]( on their site with the text you've quoted.
However if you click through the [link]( to the fees page you will see the actual fee coupons available. I think you have to be logged in to click through, so I've captured the relevant info in two images [here]( You'll notice that the graphic/banner lists the actual discounted fee range as 0.01-0.075%. In fact, there is no option for zero fees on the site.
So why is it listed like that on the entry page? I don't know... legacy promotion? Lazy editing? The thing is, Bithumb is notorious for poor presentation of information, especially in English. Elsewhere on the site it claims they've "tripped" their staff (by which they mean tripled)... And their [support page]( has a typo in the email address which results in an undeliverable message. Ask the guys in xmrtrader how much fun they had trying to decipher the Monero listing timeline a couple months back.
If there really is a way to trade for 0% fees on Bithumb, I hope someone will post it here, as I myself would like to save hella money on my trades.
In the absence of any proof to the contrary, please consider the information I've presented here. I don't have any agenda, just would like people to be able to analyze market conditions based on accurate information rather than hearsay.

Sure yep I'm a resident so I trade on all the Korean exchanges including Bithumb. I was curious about this guy, because I thought the same as you that due to legal requirements it's not feasible for non-residents to trade on Korean exchanges (which is why I question the 'Chinese trading in Korea' narrative without any evidence other than regional proximity).
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:42:42


This is inaccurate. There are certainly fees.

This is not true. Korean exchanges have fees.

Actually, the Korean government is so far pretty hands off regarding crypto. At least one branch has maintained that it's not actually a currency, and thus not subject to financial regulation.
