Use coinbase for daily use. and once a week or son transfer ~80 - 90% of your balance to a paper wallet. This way your coins are safe too and u can use coinbase's awesome service.

If you move it I think you have to keep it connected to PC. Or just on secondary inbuilt drive:  Copy the blockchain to that drive.  Install Bitcoin-qt again at that drive and import the blockchain. It will take sometime to verify that chain. Then it will download there only.   But first try shutting current.  And 'COPY' the blockchain dont cut if in case it dont work
@_date: 2013-05-20 06:02:44
take your private key and use blockchain.info wallet.

you dont need to pay any transaction fee there just a minimum of 0.01 is to be sent. Also this should like days before. You can transfer to it withou paying any fee. It maight take hours but when u need it u can pay instantly without paying any network fee but still so fast.
Again a caution: Just keep some spare coins there and secure it.
Email from coinbase about transaction is not correct at present..

make a new wallet. Print the key thats it. Why do you want to use externel services when you can do on your own and have the security.
For best: boot new os like ubuntu create neww address and print private key and your address. their you go with secure paper wallet

Theres problem going and they are trying hard to push transactions. Mine processed after about 60-70 hrs. But your situation is different!!. I suggest for sometime keep up a "very small amount" in instawallet.org. Dont lose the address! but their transactions are near instant with 1st confirmation in nearly 20 min. But theres a minimum of 0.01 BTC to send.

Run a virtual machine or ubuntu live cd. Run electrum there import your wallet.....export you private key and you have access to your account.
Now check the problem possibly compatibility issue. Reinstall run. Now TRANSFER ALL COINS TO NEW ADDRESS. You are again on your track. :)
