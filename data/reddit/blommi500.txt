How are these situations not happening with the form of Healthcare you proposed? People without money for insurance or regular care will exist. Then what? The choices are between letting them suffer or die, or bill them for money that they're never ever gonna pay, so hospitals will overcharge other people/insurances to make up for the difference. Yeah, freedom is a wonderful wonderful thing. But it's also expensive, in money or in human suffering. You're also forgetting people who needs crutches to survive, maybe for their whole lives. And they may be not even their fault, if they have a disability, not even arguing about the roots of poverty. So, unless you're implying a society where eugenics is the norm, or simply where people who cannot make it are just left to rot I don't understand what kind of society do you have in mind.

How that solve the problem of people not having insurance for that catastrophic problem or even money for regular care? I mean, it makes sense if you are willing to leave people dying in the streets. Otherwise, other people have to foot the bill, and that's what lead to overcharging. Or universal Healthcare, I guess.

Well, the US may have bankruptcy for medical bills and people who cannot afford treatment but the real problem is people calling a superior form of health care FREE. Good thing he is always vigilant.

People suffering and dying from something they know full well is preventable is what lead to social unrest. If you think that creating a category of people with nothing to lose and full of frustration is a pathway to a peaceful, productive society I don't know what to tell you.

I was mocking josefshaw. I live in Italy and while we have our problems at least we have great healthcare. I pay 2 Euros per box of the medications I have to take every day.
