If you fork another billion Bitcoins, how is that different from inflating the US dollar.
It is not.

When you print money you increase the overall wealth short term, but long term inflation hits. When you fork something you increase the overall wealth as people don't loose BTC value but gain another coin.
How can you not see this is inflation?

Well by holding the original coin you get the new one. Aka money printing.

A technology no one understands except 1% and an implementation case which is not used yet. Sure
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:25:07
Yeah but try explain Blockchain and ensure all understands it. That is a long shot. Usually adoption takes years because people need to understand how it works.

Like with cash it is decided by the market
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:23:28
Well isnt that the same as printing money? Increase the distribution of cash. The value decrease as more cash is released. Here you just put it on top of the marketcap.

yeah... you make something completely new and groundbreaking -
 won't just change the block size...
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:09:16
Dude.. essentially it is the same block chain with different specs. They do NOT provide groundbreaking tech or different aspects on usability.
The market will of course set these as high as possible. In the end causing a massive crash. This is how you REALLY inflate a currency.
Bitcoin Cash fork, 16M new coins, the incentive to push the price on this up and convert your Cash to BTC is //Too// high!

Basically printing new money. Only difference here is that the marketcap should be seen as the currencies combined (BTC + BCH+ Gold + Whatever they are named). I see no absolute difference between the two. Both ways are a way to create "free money" and completely destroys the idea of decentralization and stable currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:44
Exactly! I think this needs a lot more awareness compared to what it currently receives
