This article reads like a high school newspaper exposé on the price of Cheetos going up in the cafeteria.
She found a guy she thought fit the profile and when he wouldn't talk to her went public with just about every last bit of his identity, including a photo of his house.
Grantland [just went through a shit storm]( when one of their authors ham-fistedly outed a closeted trans woman who ended up killing herself. 
They came clean, explained the process they'd gone through, the mistakes they'd made, and what they'd learned. They apologized profusely and explained how they were going to avoid those mistakes in the future. Bill Simmons took personal responsibility.
Grantland made an egregious mistake. This Newsweek article is just sensationalist tabloid hackery.
A man who very, very specifically was trying to remain anonymous was made very identifiable, very locatable, and had a "This man has $400mil worth of bitcoin" target hung on his back. The identities of every person who might be used to coerce him were identified.
Newsweek needs to check itself, take down the article, and examine exactly what level of sensationalist bullshit press they want to be.

Right, the point is it's now difficult to determine what has been compromised.
If you're running Armory and a thumb drive to move transactions back and forth, the "air gap" on your "cold" machine is no longer as impressive if someone can compromise the connected machine, then the USB stick.
I just did a mental review of my stuff as to how I might be exposed. Terrifying.

Charlie Stross wrote a book called Accelerando. 
Though the story itself actually crosses several hundred thousand years, the earliest sections had a fascinating conceit.
In it, the protagonist is an aggressive inventor and patent-or. He specifically invents and designs the kind of "business model" patents that are popular today with patent trolls.
The protagonist then patents these things and releases them to the world, using the patent as a defensive strategy so that big corporations can't hoard obvious patents and use them as a weapon (Is any of this sounding familiar?)
To protect himself individually, he doesn't own the patents himself, but gives them to individual holding corporations that protect them. 
Here's why your idea made me think of this. The protagonist doesn't own these corporations, they own themselves.
There's a "swarm" of thousands upon thousands of corporations that own each other. They are self organizing, and self healing. While "self aware" is probably too far, they automatically transfer ownership shares between themselves hundreds of times per day.
So if "First Blockchain 1234" is owned by "First Blockchain 4321" at Noon, it might be owned by "First Blockchain 7890" by 12:30. And it's all automated.
What you're proposing is the tool to make that sort of swarm a reality. I need to sit down and think this through.

Yes, it does SOUND like a hoax.
But really the speaker/mic thing is not all that far fetched. Ham Radio people have been using sound cards and software for modems for years. The only thing new in this is high frequency.

True, but there's also a sociopathic robot cat and "using sharia law to declare sovereignty over mars" so the entire story isn't exactly helpful :)

Bitcoin exchange is not like walking into a store and seeing a candy bar for a dollar.
Bitcoin is a commodity. Stocks are a commodity. Bitcoin and stocks are sold in roughly the same way.
MtGox is an "exchange". The New York Stock Exchange is an "exchange"
You want to buy a share of google stock, there is an exchange where many people advertise what they're willing to pay for a share of GOOG, called the bid, and others advertise what they are willing to sell a share for, called the ask.
(**DISCLAIMER**: I haven't checked the actual price of google shares so I'm going to invent numbers)
So you go to buy a share of GOOG and there are people out there saying "I will buy 100 shares at $98" "I'll buy 1000 at $97.25" and there are others saying "I'll sell up to 1000 at $100" and "I've got 500 to sell at $101.75"
The difference between the highest "bid" and the lowest "ask" is called "the spread." 
If you call your broker and say "Buy me a single share of Google stock at market price". That broker is going to go to that group of people buying and selling, find that they can buy that stock right now for $100, and execute that order. You'll pay $100 a share.
If you call your broker and say "I've got a single share of Google stock I'd like to sell at market price" they'll do the same thing and you'll sell it to the top bid price and get $98 for your share.
So how does this apply to Bitcoins? Because the exact same type of market is being used at most major exchanges. 
Let's take a look at the current order book at MtGox as reported by BitcoinTicker at around 9:39 EST.
If you look where the red meets the green, you see the lowest for sale is $1054.99999 per BTC. The highest purchase request is $1051.
You can buy up to 5.5575 BTC at that $1054.99999 price, and you sell up to 31.51681 BTC at the $1051 price.
So the same thing will happen. Let's say you've got a MtGox account and there's money in it. 
You say "Hey Gox, go buy me one whole bitcoin at market."
MtGox will match you up with that lowest seller and you'll pay $1054.999 for that Bitcoin (Plus fees, etc)
Or if you have a Bitcoin in your Gox wallet you want to convert to cash, you say "Hey Gox, go sell my 1BTC for market rate"
As before, MtGox will match you up, execute that sale and deposit $1051 (minus fees) into your account.
Let's say you told MtGox to sell 40 BTC. That top buyer only wants 31BTC.
So MtGox will continue to pop buyers off that stack until it gets enough to fill your order, so you'll sell 31 at 1051, some small amounts at each price point and some will be sold, if I do my math right, all the way down to a few BTC you'll sell at $1042.60.
This is how the market price moves. Each buy and sell gets executed based on what's out there.
**So, to simplify the above, the value of a bitcoin is whatever the people who are buying and selling think it is, and that value moves as different blocks of orders get executed at different prices.**

2BTC today? or 2BTC every day?
As the size of the global mining pool increases exponentially your slice of the pie gets smaller over time.
No matter what you build today it needs to scale along with the difficulty if you want to mine reliably.

If I'm not mistaken the discount on gift cards is classified as an advertising cost, it's already in those margins.

What's needed is a way to bring bitcoin-&gt;"Visa Gift Card" out of the grey market.
On Gyft or eGifter I can trade bitcoin for cards that will let me buy just about everything I need during the week, food, clothing, gas, movie tickets, etc.
But my bills are currently too difficult to do that. I can pay my rent, electric, car insurance, cable, internet and cell phone via VISA. 
You can trust random strangers to sell you visa gift cards on places like BitMit, or you can use places like MoneyPakTrader where you're buying Green Dot Moneypak loads for a refillable VISA from a guy you can only communicate with via TorChat. It's all a bit too dicey for me.
I realize that "Bitcoin to Visa" probably runs up against US financial laws somehow, but for me it's the "killer app" that prevents me from autobuying bitcoin every paycheck.

I could be off here, but my impression is that offline has to sign a transaction which has to be "whole," which includes a transaction ID that can only be generated by an attached machine.

QR Codes can contain anything, not just addresses. Here's a QR that contains all 328 characters of the Preamble to the US constitution:
If you notice, it's got a lot more dots than a bitcoin address QR. The number of dots in a QR is dependant on the volume of the data being encoded.
Randomly searching for an image of a paper wallet with both address and key QR codes I found this:
If you look carefully you can see that the QR code on the right, which represents the longer private key, has "more dots" than the QR representing the address on the left.

Actually, no. That's not sufficient in a bitcoin context.
If you're using Armory with a connected machine and a disconnected machine, with your signing wallet on the disconnected machine then you've got a problem. If you want to send BTC out of your disconnected wallet you need to generate a transaction on the connected machine, and then put that transaction on a usb stick and carry it to the disconnected machine for signing.
So, even sourcing anonymous, fresh sticks each time your first step is to stick that into an internet connected, potentially infected machine which has, theoretically, been shown to travel by infecting USB drives.
About the only way I can see this working safely is that you move transactions back and forth by printing to QR code and scanning.

If that's bitcoinity, that's cumulative. It's not a single buy at 200+ BTC, it's all of the buys at $618 combined.

Because a vendor like Amazon sells gift cards to resellers at a discount. Resellers like Gyft sell at or near face value and pocket the difference.
If you empty your piggy bank into a CoinStar machine you get back your money with 10.9% deducted.
If you do the same but take your payout in the form of an Amazon or iTunes gift card you get full amount. 
This is good for Amazon because they get locked money, once it's on their gift card it's earned, you can only spend it there.
~~Also, Gyft is owned by WalMart,~~ so the volume they do is massive. I'm sure they have a fantastic deal.
**EDIT** As noted below, Gyft is not owned by WalMart, my mistake, and I fully retract it.

Yes it can theoretically use the speaker/mic allow an air gapped, infected machine to communicate with and through a connected and infected machine.
But it can't push infection onto a machine over the speakers, it has to be there already.
The problem is that it seems that USB keys can be compromised to carry the malware, which is exactly how you use Armory with a "cold" machine.
So once your air gapped machine is infected it could be "on the net" over speaker/mic.
And yes, all of this sounds like implausible science fiction.

Redlaser on iPhone grabs it just fine. RightQR on OSX which grabs directly out of the screen memory and doesn't use a camera has no idea what to do with it, even when I rotate it "the right way"
