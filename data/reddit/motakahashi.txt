The clearest vision I've read is Timothy May's Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities (from 1994!). It's definitely worth reading.
Those who believe in strong centralized governments shouldn't worry too much IMO. The majority seems to be happy with the current power structures and will continue to support them, including with taxation, loyalty and submission. The main thing that will change is that those who want to be free will have much better tools. The majority will, naturally, resent those who use those tools and will punish those users when caught. The result will be that the tools will improve. It's a long game between a majority who insist on centralized coercive power and a minority who insist on controlling their own lives.

Dear How many bitcoins do you have and how did you obtain them? Please be as specific as possible.
Do you hold any other cryptocurrencies? If so, please list them and when and how you obtained them.
Also, please point me to a scan of your passport, driver's license and a recent electricity bill with your current address.
Sorry if this is intrusive, but my government requires me to ask for these things when replying to one of your threads on reddit.

Thanks for verifying your solvency.
BTW, if I become a Coinbase customer someday and am asked to verify my identity, is it sufficient for me to point to a tweet saying "I'm Mo Takahashi"?
And if I'm asked how I got my bitcoins, can I point to a tweet saying "My bitcoins were obtained from legit sources, thanks for asking!"?
I assume the answers are yes and yes. Good to know, in case I decide to become a customer someday.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:33:42
In that case, maybe we shouldn't consider a tweet to be sufficient proof of solvency.

Sorry if I was unclear. My primary point was that Tor users (like me) are actually not able to get an answer by following your lmgtfy link since google blocks us. Due to that fact, I thought it would be nice for someone (me in this case) to actually give an answer. If anyone is curious how following the lmgtfy link looks for me, here's a partial screenshot:
It claims I could continue by "proving I'm not a robot" (a bit robophobic IMO), but I've done this long enough to know google is lying. After doing their not-a-robot tests it will still block me.
My secondary point was to encourage people to use Tor, even though it makes "services" like google unusable. No one should be concerned about "warrant canaries" if they are advertising their identity (ip address) to reddit and (consequently) *everyone*. I especially think browsing cryptocurrency websites without using Tor is extremely risky and could have unforeseen consequences in the future. Everyone's free to make their own choices though. Maybe nothing bad will ever happen. Good luck.

The increase in supply decreases exponentially. Half of the supply was mined in the first four years. The next quarter is being mined now. Then in about four years the next 1/8 will be mined. A consequence of this is that the last 1% will be mined over a very long period of time.

Funny, but this reveals that you don't use Tor. Otherwise you'd know google blocks most searches over Tor.
I duckduckgo'd it and found a techcrunch article from July 5 2016 about the disappearance of Silent Circle's warrant canary. Apparently Silent Circle claimed it was a business decision and not because they got a warrant. Obviously they'd admit it if they took it down because they got a warrant, right?

It's a nice idea, but the U.S. does not recognize any limits to its jurisdiction. (Otherwise, how would the capture, trial and imprisonment of Noriega be legally justified?)

One thing I like about reddit is that it lets me sign up and use it under Tor. It's never asked me for any private information. At this point, I mostly avoid doing business with anyone who even asks me for my name. Post-Snowden it's clear the right response to such a question is "why do you need to know?"
But I'm extreme about such things, so I can understand why you'd think I'm specifically (and hypocritically) targetting Coinbase.


I don't. If you look through my recent post history you'll see I've occasionally referred to Chinese miners as "Tiananmen Square Massacre miners." This is partly a bit of fun because someone pointed out that "Chinese miners" is offensive. It's partly because I enjoy the thought of a Chinese censor having to block my post. And it's partly because there are far too many people cooperating in pushing the Tiananmen Square Massacre down the memory hole.

While I have no respect for Coinbase, its owners or even the people who choose to remain as its customers, your reply is valid. We have no indication that Coinbase would've cooperated with the Nazis, and this is implicitly suggested by saying they're "only following orders."

Coinbase has their own rules which often lead to them terminating relationships with customers.
This subreddit and bitcoin.org also has rules. These rules may be leading to the termination of a relationship to Coinbase.
One difference is that this subreddit and bitcoin.org have made their positions on advocacy of XT very clear for a very long time. Coinbase's rules on how its customers are allowed to use bitcoin are far more obscure.

I wasn't joking. Coinbase engages in far worse practices than Neither are as bad as North Korea. But I understand we're in the middle of a war. The XT side needs to have its 10 minutes of hate against the Core side. An alliance with Coinbase might seem like a good idea at the moment, but I suspect they're not the kind of allies you'll want in the end.

The difference between using a VPN and using Tor is the difference between privacy and anonymity.
Privacy protects your data. Anonymity protects you.
Use Tor. VPNs are good to protect your from snooping at public wifis, but it's *never* safe to assume a VPN protects you from the NSA. I always assume VPNs are compromised.

People against Operation Chokepoint could respond by making a list of all the organizations and associated individuals who are cooperating with it. Then they could explicitly refuse to interact with those people and organizations. (This would include boycotting some popular businesses in the Bitcoin space and their supporters.)
It could be called "Operation Chokeback." I like the name because it sounds a bit dangerous, violent and potentially deadly. Just like "Chokepoint" does.
Just a thought. I can't imagine this will happen. People opposed to tyranny are usually more interested in talk than action. And the vast majority of people aren't even opposed to tyranny.

Sounds like the right analogy is abortion. Full-RBF is like being pro-choice. The tx isn't alive until it's been born/included in a block. Until then it can be aborted. The most extreme zero-conf view is like being pro-life. The tx is alive as soon as it has been relayed onto the network. Opt-in RBF is like saying you're only allowed to get an abortion if you declared yourself pro-choice before getting pregnant. Of course, no policy prevents someone from seeking out a back alley miner to abort their zero-conf tx.

Comparisons with the Nazis tend to be dangerous. It's probably fair to say that if there is/were a Nazi-like regime somewhere, some people would actively support it, some people would just go along and cooperate with it, and some people would actively oppose it. To get an idea of the percentages, one could look at the percentages in 1930s Germany. Those percentages don't paint a pretty picture.

@_date: 2015-12-28 10:29:46
Yesterday I said Coinbase was "just following orders" by collecting private information on bitcoiners. Someone rightfully called me out for implicitly comparing Coinbase to the Nazis. Between then and now I've seen at least two comments from XT suppoters quoting a version of the "First they came for the..." poem, implicitly comparing mods/Core dev supporters to Nazis.
It's been a tough year filled with attacks between the two camps, and at this point -- in my opinion -- the two camps won't come back together. Why would you want to rejoin with people you consider comparable to the Nazis? You shouldn't. You should want Nazis to be defeated, and to only accept their unconditional surrender.
I had a bit of hope in recent weeks that SW might be acceptable to XT supporters for the time being, and there might be some time for healing. But it clearly wasn't meant to be.
One of the main things that drew me to Bitcoin was the idea that it was "ruled by math" instead of people/politicians. Now it seems like it's ruled by politics after all, and with all the nastiness, dishonesty, accusations, backstabbing and unreliability politics entails. I was also attracted to the cypherpunk/cryptoanarchist ideals, but those ideas seem to only be respected a minority in the community now.
I think instead of trying to be a part of healing this community, I'd rather just look for a different one. I hand in my unconditional surrender. If anyone wants to wish me 'bye', my real name is Felicia.

I know these debates get heated, so I want to say that you (are one of the people on the other side of it I respect. But I have to ask: why do you think "the community at large already decided on BIP101 in the summer"? At no times were there even a significant number of nodes running XT, and blocks mined with XT have never gotten out of single digits.
At best you might be able to make the case that BIP101 might have had majority support *if* most of the Core developers thought it was safe and merged it into Core. But that never happened. Obviously, the opposite happened. And it seems clear to me that XT was only ever supported by a vocal minority. Do you really think 101 had or has majority support? Why?
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:57:53

Coinbase is only following orders. *

I know which I respect more.
Edit to add: We also don't actually know that Coinbase's actions are due to "regulations of the countries it operates in." That's a reasonable assumption, but they're sufficiently opaque about their actions that it's only an assumption.
* Second Edit: I have no evidence that Coinbase would've cooperated with the Nazis. Please try not to infer this from the "following orders" statement. There is only evidence that they may be following the orders of a modern survellience state with no respect for the financial privacy of individuals. There is also reason to suspect Coinbase is cooperating with extra-legal operations such as Operation Chokepoint.

It looks to me like 20 million should be reached around 2026. Let me show my work:
Assume the fourth halving happens in 2024. At that point there will be 840,000 blocks and 19.6875 million bitcoins. This leaves 312,500 bitcoins to read 20 million. After the fourth halving the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoins. So this 312,500 bitcoins will be mined in the next 100,000 blocks. On average a little over 50,000 blocks are mined in a year, meaning it will take about two more years to mine 100,000 blocks. This takes us to 2026.
So it's barely over 10 years away and hopefully most of us will still be alive to see it.

A significant percentage of people, mostly on the left, believe there are more than 2 genders. Saying that there are only 2 genders, or even only 2 biological sexes, is considered hate speech. u/Hiigara85 was being a little triggerish, for fun I assume.

Supporting Trump doesn't imply supporting the government. It's reasonable to see Trump as someone who could do a lot to damage people who see the government as a huge slush fund (public unions, entrenched bureaucrancy) and (Lois Lerner types) who've used the government to silence opposition. I'm not particularly hopeful, but time will tell. It's clear (to me at least) Clinton would have necessarily made the situation worse.
I gave up all hope after people reeelected Obama in 2012, even after FATCA, ObamaCare, the Benghazi-youtube-lie, etc. I at least support Trump in the sense that Trump makes Obama supporters cry. And I love seeing them cry.

In context, it appeared you think putting information about Tiananmen Square into the blockchain puts Chinese miners/bitcoiners "in harms way" -- e.g., that the Chinese government will do what they've done in the past, like arrest, torture and/or kill them. My response is that they should just leave Bitcoin, then. Seems relevant, unless I've missed something. The other clause "which is something they seem to want to do anyway" is a reference to Jihan Wu signalling that he wants to stop mining valid Bitcoin blocks. Maybe that was unclear.

There could, in principle, already be markets allowing people to do this. It could even be done on-chain:
Alice and Bob and an Escrow could make a 2-of-3 multisig with the agreement that the output will be spent in 1 year to Alice on the BTC chain *and* to Bob on the BTU chain. The amount of bitcoins (on today's chain) contributed by Alice vs. Bob would depend on today's perceived value of BTC bitcoins vs. BTU bitcoins.

People like to pretend the invasive questions they ask are just KYC/AML they have to do. It's increasingly clear they're going well beyond that.
They are likely cooperating with Operation Choke Point, an extra legal U.S. operation to punish legal businesses. While I oppose that, I understand that most Americans support Operation Choke Point, or at least continue to support and vote for the politicians responsible for it.
On the other hand, I'm fairly certain Coinbase isn't going to go bankrupt like Gox did. With the massive amount of data they're collecting on bitcoiners and the bitcoin economy, I'm sure there are plenty of 3 letter agencies in the U.S. and China that will be happy to financially prop them up as long as they keep collecting and sharing this information.
So, yes, Coinbase is "good" -- in the way the word "good" is used in the post-Snowden world.

Maybe I misunderstood your point. I'm not sure where you got the word "needlessly" from, but I thought you were pointing out that it is necessary to collect identifying info to run a service like bitphone. I was giving my example to show that there are cases where it's ridiculous to collect such information. Maybe it's a language issue. We'd probably agree that it's not technologically necessary to collect the information. (The bitphone service worked fine technologically.) In terms of government regulation, it might be legally required, and that may be what you mean. I'd interpret such regulation as evidence that the corresponding government is illegitimate, and I think we'd disagree about that.

Not too much should be read into that fact. Sometimes authors miss relevant citations.
The fact that the title of this reddit post makes a false claim and no one corrects it for 11 hours is more interesting to me. Probably many people had the same feeling I did...maybe a little misinformation about a detail like this helps add a little mystery.

Your numbers are obviously exaggerated, but I agree it's a small percentage that have bitcoins.

Let me put on my tin foil hat for a moment.
Bitcoin is inherently political and takes a massive amount of power away from governments. Many people have opposed the fiscal insanity of the past decades and the government's response has always been to ignore this opposition. Deficit spending, money printing, raising the debt ceiling continues with only pretend opposition at the highest levels. With Bitcoin, there are real consequences. It makes it clear there is an option to secede from government fiat currencies. The more they continue with fiscal insanity the more powerful crypto becomes.
As the powers that be realize this, they *might* respond by saying, "well, they got us, I guess we have to give up a lot of our power." It seems far more likely that they will go totalitarian. They already have the full data on who has signed up on exchanges and how much they've bought. Those people will be investigated. Their relatives will be investigated. They'll find some offenses to charge you and your loved ones with. They will be treated like BurtW and lose time and money and in many cases their freedom. In some cases probably their lives. There could be a "War on Crypto" fought like the "War on Drugs."
It can't happen in Western countries? Remember the Gold repatriation in the 1930s.
Whether what I'm describing is paranoia or not enough paranoia will only be known in the future. If a "War on Crypto" happens in the future, then how affected you are by it is largely determined by the choices you make now.
Actually, I think I'll keep my tin foil hat on.

The way to "cease any further halvings" is to create a block with an invalid coinbase tx (with double the btc output than a valid coinbase tx would have). The implication of the "the longest proof-of-work chain" rule is that such an invalid block becomes valid if enough miners mine on top of it. Bitcoin uses a different rule: the chain of *valid* blocks with the most proof-of-work.

No it isn't. An invalid block is not considered part of the chain, no matter how much proof of work was used to create it or to put blocks on top of it.
For example, if state level actors obtained a massive amount of mining power and created a block spending everyone's txout's (with invalid txs) and then kept mining empty blocks on top of that, no reasonable person would consider that to be the valid blockchain.
In the past I've seen write that the only validity condition on blocks should be that the txs are valid. Since he's now talking about including invalid coinbase txs (with an artificially high reward), it seems like he's even abandoned that.

Hitting $100,000 a year from now would be roughly the same rise bitcoin had from Nov 2012 to Nov 2013. It's not unprecedented.  A fall back to around $200 would also not be unprecedented. People shouldn't be unaware of either possibility.

I've started to think this is the fundamental schism. Do the rules determine who is mining or do the miners determine the rules? For the time being, it seems like there are definitionally two different cryptocurrencies which happen to coincide as long as miners pretend to be agreeing with the existing rules.
I'm definitely in the "rules determine who is mining" camp. For those in the "miners determine the rules" camp, it might be worth thinking about how much simpler the node software's code could be if the only thing it needs to check is if the chain is the one with the most work.

had a useful answer elsewhere in this thread:
I can add that many of us believe that "you have bitcoins in coinbase" actually means "you have an IOU for bitcoins from coinbase." Those of us strongly encourage people to learn about private keys and offline cold storage.
One way to do offline cold storage is to burn a Tails Live DVD. Boot up with no internet connection. Start Electrum and write down the seed (twice). This seed generates a family of private keys and addresses. You can send bitcoins to those addresses. You should never type the seed to an online computer.

Eh, to be honest if Coinbase notices bitcoins are being used to fund terrorism and shuts down an account for that reason, I find it quite reasonable. I seriously doubt that's what's happening in the cases that we hear about. Before the Snowden revelations, I was much more flexible about what information I was OK with the government and its clients (Google, Coinbase, etc.) collect. It's probably fair to say that the Snowden revelations made me hardliner. I'm fucking pissed. To be clear, I don't mean I have any sympathy with terrorists at all, and wouldn't kill or threaten anyone. But there are many people in governments and outside governments who have cooperated in a spying program that I consider worse than anything the Stasi did, anything the Soviets did. And I will celebrate when those people die, especially if they suffer first. And I tend to extend that feeling to the people who are still cooperating with it.
In short: I hate.

Fees depend on the number of bytes in the transaction and the amount of demand for block space. It doesn't depend on either the value of bitcoin or the amount you are transacting.
Certainly there are many utxos (spendable bitcoins) of a size smaller than, say, 0.0002, making it essentially impossible to spend them. (The fee to spend them would be more than the utxo itself holds.)

Sorry about all the attacks you have to put up with.
In previous reddit arguments, I've looked up when you joined bitcointalk (early 2011, I think) to give an estimate for how long you've been involved in bitcoin. This quote sounds like you're saying you've been involved since 2009 (maybe even March or April 2009 if I take "couple" literally). Is that correct?

I'm not a fan of Coinbase, and think it's likely they'll be revealed as very bad actors at some point.
But I have to admit I'm considering another, more sympathetic, interpretation.
It's possible Coinbase is being coerced to cooperate with bad actors, like the NSA. Perhaps they've received a NSL that orders them not to admit it.
They don't have a "Warrant Canary" -- I assume -- so they don't have a backdoor way to warn their customers.
Maybe -- *maybe* -- they decided the best way to warn their customers is to go so completely ridiculously over the line with intrusive questions, requests for documents, cancelling orders, and so on, as a way to push customers away from their compromised company. If so, it would be ironic if their purposefully crazy actions led them to be a more successful company, since there is such a high percentage of idiots in the world who'll make excuses for literally anything.

Coinbase seems to be going well beyond any explicit "rules." But maybe you could point me to some laws or regulations I'm unaware of. It's impossible to know them all.
It's more likely, IMO, that Coinbase is acting as an information gathering agency and selling this information to various 3 letter organizations around the world. Basically the Crypto-Stasi. On a positive note, this makes it unlikely Coinbase will be going bankrupt!
