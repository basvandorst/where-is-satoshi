And btw... this isn't about greed (for me anyway). I personally have plenty of money, and am much more idealistic about the technology. I want to see bitcoin's price skyrocket because it will allow it to accomplish more. $500 per coin may seem like a lot, but a 6bn market cap wont allow btc to have any impact on larger transactions... One of the benefits of bitcoin is that it can be used to transfer large sums with little transaction costs... but in practice it can't move shit until the cap is high enough to absorb those transactions.

or you could give a bunch of homeless people androids and have them sit on all the parking spots until they get their toll... like bridge trolls.

I'm not sure how this works, but i wonder if it would be possible to completely automate this whole thing into a DAC where no person had control over any of it, and Full nodes could just be launched every time the address reached its target.
