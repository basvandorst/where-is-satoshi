Must have taken him some real time making that blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:54:23
Personally I use Bitfinex, you can check it out if it suits you.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:39:14
I do this sometimes on Bitfinex, just deposit some money then buy on what you think is low and sell on when higher. There is no fee on trading only on withdrawing so those shouldn't be a trouble.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:41:02
Don't let your hopes down, HODL!
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:55:54
I heard that Bitfinex has opened registration, check it out.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:41:34
Now the question is what crypto, if they decide to add crypto wondering which one they will add.

This community does anything just to keep the hype. Don't tell me there is a blockchain that will track how many times a day I take a shit and create an eco-system that can be used to turn my shit into fuel?
I don't know what the hell I'm talking, probably I got the ICO sickness.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:25:52
This is so misinforming, but hey the whales have to eat too so why not spread some good memes around and see BTC grow before dumping it.
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:00:40
This is the thing with crypto, you can't control or limit how much money enters or get's out, who can own how much coins and others. Ride the wave or ...
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:32:38
I do agree their IOS app is slow. Apple allows only few currencies in their app on AppStore. But in general Bitfinex UI and trading is smooth on browser.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:03:01
Well, to be honest, In my opinion, no it is not. You might get more in return if you invest in some other small coins. OMG, EOS, BAT are my choices when buying small amounts on Bitfinex from time to time. Of course let's not forget Nano, quite promising and hyped, good for a quick return.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:32:44
Even though I'm using Bitfinex to usually buy/sell BTC, I'd recommend this to someone who doesn't want to get through KYC and large deposits.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:01:52
Good news, I do use Wordpress as part of my job, so will definitely give this ago.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:56:01
Depends on your needs, for me, Bitfinex fits them, but the problem is verification for new users so If you can wait a bit that would be worth.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:54:34
Bitfinex has the lowest fees from most of the exchanges, I know that for ETH at least. And after implementing Segwit, the withdraw fees did in fact decrease.
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:58:11
And the transactions are fast and cheap, good job Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:00:52
This guy get's me every time.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:30:08
Depends on what you are looking. For trading you should definitely go with Bitfinex, their charts, tools and a lot of features would give you a variety of ways to earn. If you want to buy and hold you can use the same exchange, or smaller ones, just for buying coins and storing them in a wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:03:03
Did you say, buy the dip? I lost count of dips I've bought until now, yet I'm all red, a submarine.

Keep us informed, pretty interested in the outcome, good luck.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:22:13
This is old news, the price is in the hands of a few people, like everything in the world these days. Most of us are just puppets.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:01:44
Well, that's a good thing for me as a seller on Bitfinex, my sell orders usually are eaten alive.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:11:45
So many people falling for these low life scammers, well actually genius scammers.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:43:46
I would not recommend storing Bitcoin on websites or exchanges, use exchanges like Bitfinex or others just for trading and exchanging purposes.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:24:04
Yea on time sell I would prefer something local bitcoins, but if you want to do more sell/buy I'd recommend exchanges like Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:10:00
Did you post this here to? Man, your account got frozen today for security reasons. They might ask you for some proof of funds or something and then release your money, why being so dramatic about it?
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:48:23
You can use major exchanges, Bitfinex, Binance etc etc. Or small services, but they offer a limited amount you can buy.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:16:20
I know a friend who invested 5k after Jan. He is at 2k now but still holding.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:44:37
Got tell him you have like 150BTC, and post what he says.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:50:16
Quite a story there. Sometimes I wish I was born just 10 years earlier so that when I'd heard for the first time about Bitcoin I'd be In my 20's and maybe drop a 20$ on the coin worth less basically cents. But I do keep this in mind and it motivates me for the future, maybe In the next 10 years history repeats itself and I will remember this and do the right thing.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:12:12
FUD is playing a huge role in the crypto market. Bitfinex and Tether FUD was quite heavy with people being paid to spread fear among investors, whales dumping BTC like it was an altcoin. There are still people who try to spread fear on the masses, but they don't fall for it. Best thing is to do your own research and don't let a reddit tell what's best with your investment. You learn by making mistakes.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:47:57
I'm still buying a small amount of Bitcoin bi-weekly on Bitfinex, but I usually sell it to people that don't use exchanges, for a percentage.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:05:02
Speculations, opinions, ideas and doubts aren't facts.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:33:10
I don't even read this kind of articles. The market is in the hands of few people, in my opinion, so it's not as where some analyst predicts the price, but more as of where that group of people want the price to be.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:49:53
I spent 5$ on BTC now I'm 50% down, how much should I invest master. Please, no more than 10$ since those are my life savings.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:23:49
Yes, it is. I got into crypto to buy a Lambo, so that I can get laid 4 times a day, testosterone fault for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:30:30
Yea, PM me and I'll give you my bank account.
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:31:09
But it is not, korean markets are known for faking volume and everything just to pump a coin/token they hold.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:50:44
Keep them in my wallet, trade sometimes on Bitfinex, sell ETH on different forums.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:43:13
It's arbitrage. Some people do it manually since they know what charts and exchanges to follow, but there are bots that give you an advantage and show exact info about an arbitrage opportunity on large exchanges like Bitfinex, Binance, HitBTC, GDAX etc.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:37:31
This might help you a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:10:55
Depends, you want to exchange go for a quieter exchange or use online sites, Bitpanda maybe. High-roller, trading and exchanging in high volume, go with a bigger exchange, Bitfinex for example or any on the top 5.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:04:09
Forums meet up often work. Find a local forum and you will find people who want to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:20:35
Just a small correction, you can trade on Bitfinex without being verified and depositing $10k. You can deposit cryptocurrencies on Bitfinex and trade/exchange with them, but you can't touch the fiat side without being verified, hence depositing.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:41:19
Sell to get out forever? Probably never. I've been buying ETH, OMG, and EOS like weekly on Bitfinex, holding for at least 2 more years. Of course, I do spend some money on something if I need it, but mainly try to forget about it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:23:07
I will give this a try but might come in handy to people who want to purchase small amounts or don't want to sign up for exchanges.
Also, can you give me the fees list since I want to compare it with Bitfinex. You can send it to inbox also.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:46:02
BCASH username loves Bitcoin.
BCASH BCASH BCASH, really whenever Bitcoin Cash is mentioned all I remember is the Ver interview and the guy saying BCASH BCASH BCASH
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:29:40
Yes, their minimum deposit is 250$, so anything from 250$-1000$ has a certain fee.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:48:58
Of course, most of them avoid audit's, crypto is a shady market in general. We can't be complaining here saying they are doing something shady. We know that most of the BTC few years ago were circulating on the dark web.

You can't ignore the fact that if I calculate all the money that went into Bitcoin for people around me, I can freely say more than a million for sure. That's only money directly on Bitcoin and Ethereum, where are the 80 Ant miners and 60 rigs for Ethereum a guy in my neighbour bought. You are clearly sceptic that a lot of money got in during the bull run?
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:59:26
Good luck Nathan.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:59:07
This has been cleared out. I think it was Huobi wallet or similar.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:43:27
I never like Coinbase, registered on Bitfinex like a year ago and started trading on fiat pairs. Made quite a good buck while the market was going up.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:19:28
Good news is that a DEX from Bitfinex, EOSfinex it's getting on its feet, we'll see in June.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:05:23
Bitfinex implemented it pretty fast, the transaction and fee were pretty good compared to a month ago.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:23:46
Someone is behind, not directly on the transactions or related, but definitely it didn't just show up one day by itself, that's why I ask.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:14:02
I'm a 16-year-old, please upvote my comment.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:39:25
I'm surprised why other exchanges are not following Bitfinex example. Test Segwit and it worked perfectly.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:34:11
I personally hate the community. And naming their subreddit is retarded. Name it @_date: 2018-02-28 21:49:28
Yup, and stop asking for donations.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:51:50
Will be trying this now. 
EDIT: am I doing something wrong, been loading for like 5 minutes now and yet I didn't find any product.
EDIT 2: changed to Amazon, it found something. Will update.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:22:53
It can't be proven a scam, at least not fully. They might get caught that they don't have 100% backed in USD, maybe 50%-80%, but that wouldn't worry me at all, at least personally.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:26:21
I think they would like to keep it this way. Imagine buying like a million in BTC at 9500$, then selling that amount of BTC at 10,000$, that's roughly 50,000$ profit. This is how whales earn even more.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:07:29

@_date: 2018-03-15 19:51:47
May I ask if I missed the information. Are you associated with this in any way? Just curious?
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:48:11
Really confusing post and answers???
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:36:01
I read the article, and not trying to be negative, but you can do that on your own. I mean hold 3 different signing devices on 3 different places one of them being a bank safe. Please, someone give me an idea why I can't do this by myself for example. 
PS: not trying to bash or anything, just curious.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:21:44
Can you explain to me, like does anyone control the wallets?
I read above that they use multi-signature wallets, can someone explain that to me?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:48:15
If you understood me right, I never doubt on BTC or crypto in general, but the possibility for new coin/ico/projects that maybe would pass even Bitcoin in a year or two is now really low. 
As Trump said: If I had $10 million to invest, I would buy $1 million worth of chicken, $9 million in advertising. 
Advertising in this century is everything.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:34:09
Bitifinex has already implemented it, I tested it a few days ago and it works perfectly.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:57:18
Wait for more than 3 confirmations and make sure to check on multiple explorers just in case.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:07:26
I'll be waiting for this final dip, like the final boss fight scene on a video game and buy some on Bitfinex with the speed of light, since I believe that this might be the last dip before a bull run.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:56:02
Thanks for the link man, I got into Bitfinex a while ago and I have traded without a problem, but all this "FUD" makes me a bit doubtful, I'll have a look on that report, better than trusting some theories, I like facts.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:25:41
I thought this is a joke, but I saw your comment. Yes, you can sell your BTC for money to other people, exchanges like Bitfinex etc, or at any local BTC atm's.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:00:45
Can you inform your loss, we want to grieve together.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:46:21
Agree with that, Coinbase used to be great, recently they started having some troubles. Definitely Bitfinex is better if you want to trade on different pairs.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:58:27
Everyone bought Bitcoin during the bull run, everyone around me was talking about Bitcoin during that time. I doubt someone or something did inflate the price, it was just bound to happen. The growth was there since the start of the year, but everything exploded mostly because of social media, news and FOMO, that's what I think at least.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:53:27
Everyone hoped to get rich, by making the first ones richer.
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:51:21
If you want to get fiat and you have a large amount, try Bitfinex, they speed up withdraws recently.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:01:27
Yep, saw the huge dip on Bitfinex, hope he will do something smart with that money.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:49:48
Of course, his job is to protect his stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:13:54
October 2018, give me that time machine.
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:58:55
Indeed what you said, Bitfinex trading tools and charts can't be compared with any other exchange, really insightful informations.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:37:39
Pretty accurate, holding in long term might be profitable, but If you have the fund to start doing leverage, you can double, triple, quadruple earn what you'd a year from a month of holding. That's what I used to do for a while on Bitfinex, but since I'm pretty new, I stopped for now since the market is quite volatile, while I do sometimes get in a dip and hope that my calculations are correct. Just research more on this topic.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:53:16
Faster and cheaper in Bitfinex indeed, tried it a few days ago and it was nice to see my hopes comeback for BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:28:44
Bitfinex implemented Segwit, so the fees are lower now. Go check it out yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:45:07
Why don't you just buy and forget?
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:03:31
You might be right, but yet I never heard a report from them that's there is something wrong with them, we only know one part of the story, to be honest, and yet I'm just checking facts, not holding sides.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:38:06
Yep, depends on the day and the events. Since December, Bitfinex was holding the top spot almost doubling the volume in comparison to other exchanges. Recently it's ranking lower, but I read some articles that some "top" exchanges are faking their volume, don't know If that's true.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:49:53
The best news was that I got back to trading Bitcoin on Bitfinex after they implemented Segwit, lower fees, and faster transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:53:13
I'm not facing away from the Tether and Bitfinex audit issue, but I'm trying to explain to you that the December bull run was 80% natural, we got a jump from 1000$ to around 4000$ from November to May and that's where people FOMO'd. Also buying rigs and asics adds to the price of Bitcoin since miners will try to sell their mining profits and get the best value from their mined coins. They always place higher sell orders than the current price.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:20:06
The withdrawal fee is even lower on  Bitfinex after SegWit.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:50:27
I doubt that will happen, Bitfinex is a nest place for big traders and whales, you think they would allow someone to manipulate them? Money is dangerous and powerful people don't like to be played.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:21:41
You might wait for EOSfinex from Bitfinex, launching in June. It's a decentralized exchange so no third party in between.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:27:11
Will be waiting to sell some coins bought during this dip on Bitfinex. You know the rule, one week dip, one week pump.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:10:29
This price is still too high. I would like it to see somewhere between 5000-6000 or lower and grow slowly while people use Bitcoin and not just hold/trade. I currently own none, even though I buy maybe $1k weekly on Bitfinex. I pay quite a lot with BTC and Ethereum, as it's part of my job. The key to a healthy market is to use Bitcoin for more than just profit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:41:26
Great news for BTC adoption, hopefully traders on Bitfinex are happy now xD
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:19:37
Google ban is not FUD, definitely something everyone holding crypto should consider and analyze carefully. This is actually happening, being banned to promote crypto from Facebook and Google, like the 70% of the online marketing world is quite a huge step back. Bot saying it's the end, but we need to consider this situation and not go with the HOLD strategy.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:00:20
Damn Reddit makes me laugh every step.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:18:13
Is there an option to calculate what if I bought BTC with 20$ in 2010, it will tell me how much could I have bought.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:48:09
Best is during a bearish market, so they won't buy at ATH xD
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:11:48
What to explain here, on a high volume exchange like Bitfinex for example, a $50k order will get filled instantly.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:03:50
Fees are pretty low now, with exchanges like Bitfinex and Coinbase implementing Segwit, will be testing on Bitfinex tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:46:41
Would like to hear more about this $30k gaming computer?
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:56:30
Pretty much tested it on Bitfinex and it works perfectly faster and lower fees.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:35:46
The best place to short BTC right now is probably Bitfinex. They offer a few things that might help you more.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:27:29
We lost our sense of humor from that quadruple dip that happened a while back. Too many casualties, basically all those who put 50$ on crypto where posting memes, It's just us the old dogs left here and being played by whales xD.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:49:44
Try getting used to big exchanges, find how things work. If you want to sell BTC fast you can try Bitfinex, big rollers will eat your 100 BTC sell order in a matter of seconds. Withdrawal might take a bit, but It is big money. Also don't withdraw all at once and better yet, leave 10-20 BTC for the future, maybe you can profit even more from that.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:49:02
Most of the people, or let's say 95% doubt that you can sell it for real money, that's is what is keeping new money from coming into the market.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:17:39
Day trading is quite risky, even though better than doing shorting. You can hop around on Bitfinex Demo and try the platform, get familiarized with the charts. Watch Youtube videos on explaining day trading and in general about crypto. After a time of knowledge register to a exchange and start trying out with money you can afford
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:14:13
Good news from Bitfinex, where is the competition now???
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:07:29
If you are a big trader, try out Bitfinex, that's where all the big players trade.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:36:43
Here it is, to the people who often bash exchanges like Bitfinex. Most of the "chinese" exchanges fake their volume, that's why most of the reputable exchanges are a bit down on the charts.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:50:04
That's why Bitfinex implemented Segwit.
"Since SegWit adoption we have managed to decrease our BTC withdrawal fees by 25%, to 0.0006 BTC.
We are working hard to reduce this number further in the upcoming weeks and we are excited by the improvements made possible by SegWit."
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:41:58
Well, it is on Coinbase and Bitfinex, where most of the people buy and trade BTC, quite on time since it was terrible exchanging BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:50:49
I think that a standard day on most of the exchanges, in this kind of market.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:57:15
I've used the Blockchain.info wallet for a long time, pretty good and usable in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:44:56
I almost missed this dip, being manipulated by people saying it's going down. I almost sold my ETH on Bitfinex to pull out, but then thought of the time I got in, it was to ride or die, already on profit so if I don't lose something I invested then it's fine by me. Everyone has to decide for himself, almost learned that the hard way. While hear can someone explain to me why ETH is growing like a bit slower than BTC (I understand the prices of both are a huge difference, but ETH used to follow BTC on trends)?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:17:46
I guess it's just people who bought at 8,9,10 selling for some quick profit. That's what I did quite a while back on the good old days for a 20$-50$ profit while trading on Bitfinex, would buy at a "normal" dip and sell when price recovers, basically.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:29:33
Bitfinex has one of the lowest fees if you do withdraw often and small amounts, also their charts and tools are useful for trading.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:41:07
It is fragile since any amount can make that market move, just a sufficient amount of money and boom. Also, people don't understand that the market cap is not the total amount of money in crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:00:45
He is a meme, do you really think that he has the power to play with Bitcoin in this scale. I doubt that someone is forcing the price down, however, I refuse to put a single cent in this market since from the chart you can see that big whales are pumping and dumping BTC on every 500$ that it's down.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:44:03
It is temporary USDT while you exchange in Bitfinex, the moment you want to withdraw it converts to USD. See it as in-game currencies, just so you can navigate on their site.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:02:31
Any news on this would like to hear what you found.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:32:51
I might try this, but more eager to wait for EOSfinex going live on June.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:47:41
Depends, riding with some coins and day trading (mostly 2-3 trades a week, but...) on Bitfinex with BTC/ETH.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:51:31
Yes, that is your address, supposedly. Do you know which wallet did you use, can you access your wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:11:46
Yep read it when they announced. It really made me go and purchase some BTC just for they joy, but I spend all the money on Bitfinex buying Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:27:50
Where is Bitfinex, which was top one for a long time and yet has more than a billion in volume?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:12:12
Where do you guys exchange Bitcoins for fiat?
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:11:56
I don't know where you are based, but on local sites like "craigslist", similar sites like that. You can post your ad that you want to sell BTC and want to do the exchange live.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:52:35
For large amounts no, anything online is never safe. But I do use blockchain.info when I want to hold some ETH from Bitfinex to make transactions in the following days so that I can send money on the move to the person I sell the ETH.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:01:13
And they are buying from other exchanges, looks like dropshipping to me.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:12:31
Saying that Bitfinex pumped the price during Q4 of 2017 is quite ridiculous. You must admit that there was a global hype and FOMO about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. People were literally taking loans to buy in and not miss the train. Some of the people I knew, who were completely clueless about Bitcoin bought more than I've ever bought until now. One friend of mine bought 150,000$ worth of Ethereum mining rigs. A lot of money was poured into the market and now it's a correction since people realized that they won't buy that Lambo they dreamed.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:31:36
Noticed that, the overall trading volume on crypto markets has dropped like 60% according to CMC.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:32:19
As a user said, it's your own responsibilty to take care for your own coins. Don't keep anything you don't want to lose on exchanges. Regarding to Bitfinex, speaking as a verified trader there, I go there quite early, saw the ups and downs and the exchange still continues filling my needs, so would not be afraid to recommend it to people.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:33:57
Doubt it's a bubble, It's just that it's easy to manipulate the market, like that guy two days ago, dropped the price of BTC on Bitfinex for like 500$ in a matter of seconds. Volatility also plays a huge role in this market
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:38:01
Will be planning to do the same, I've been putting a side some of the profits from trading and exchanging on Bitfinex. Might go for a 2-3 week trip on a coastal country.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:24:01
I'd jump from the 10th floor when i would hear the word pizza.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:10:47
I heard that both Bitfinex and Coinbase have implemented Segwit. As I don't have a Coinbase account, but I do have a Bitfinex account, I tested it out and the transaction fees were noticeably lower.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:38:23
Yea, I think the same. Yesterday I bought some BTC on Bitfinex and it was super fast. I used BTC until a year ago when, when Ethereum was popular. Then the high transaction fees pushed me further so Segwit is a good announcement.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:00:42
Right today I thought good for me, since I'm from Belgium, gov is not talking a lot about taxes. Now this news comes and I might need to declare my profits from trading on Bitfinex and give more to the government.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:14:11
Depends on your wallet, you might see a Request BTC or Request button, click that and you can see an address.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:21:22
That's why4 I hate reading this articles written by a 50-year-old book who had to read a whole book to understand the basics of crypto. Bitfinex already implemented Segwit to lower transaction fees and make them fast, as If I'm not wrong Coinbase is at beta.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:32:07
Doubt they will run away. Run away where? With 2 billion in their pocket, Uncle Sam doesn't allow anyone to get rich, let alone to commit this kind of crime. Bitfinex for sure is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:58:11
I used to deal with BTC on small forums like in 2016. Forgot about it until the pandemic in 2017. I went and bought some on Bitfinex but it was too late.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:09:44
Maybe, but the main thing is that after Bitfinex and Coinbase adoption, other exchanges got requests to do the same, so we are going in the right step.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:16:00
That's the bad thing, you have no idea so why talk when you have no idea because you talk since you have no idea you don't know what you are talking because you have no idea. Troll post, your username is crypto420 tf?
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:06:14
No Lambos, I guess that's bad news.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:01:27
But they offer the "best alt's" on the market. Maybe adding Nano would complete the list, but as a trader, I'm happy with the variety Bitfinex has. Note that it's quite hard to get in Bitfinex, but after a coin/token get's added it really doubles in price and stays there. Check BAT, it was 0.20$ when it was added, it spiked to 0.80$ the corrected to about 0.40$ where I think it is now.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:40:17
That's an improvement for sure, but I remember that Bitfinex went as low as 0.0004 BTC after implementing SegWit, which is quite low 
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:41:25
All I've been hearing today is about this big whale on Bitfinex. Guess the guy is flattered.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:17:36
I used to frequent a forum years ago, something about hacking and computers. They used Bitcoin in like 2010-2011 for privacy reasons. I had to do a deal with a guy to buy 100$ worth of Bitcoin, but he canceled so I forgot about it. At ATH I would have had $200k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:35:01
Probably OP meant Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:06:27
I was going to ask about this since I don't know the bank. Good to hear that the bank has a reputation.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:59:27
Usually, sites that offer only buying and selling have higher fees. Exchanges like Bitfinex for example who offer trading also, have way lower fees for buying and selling crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:05:39
I have been waiting for this day, will now sell my BTC from Bitfinex after I send it to my wallet. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:50:16
The one that fits your needs is the best. Despite all the FUD from people who never used Bitfinex, I do trade and exchange there and I'm pretty satisfied with their platform. So everyone has to choose for themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:01:28
With that money you can freely get into Bitfinex, trading tools and charts are great, the market is populated with big traders and they offer company-organizations accounts, even a fast-process verification might be enabled.
If I'd be you I'd talk to u/social_bfx
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:28:35
This might be wrong, but some people don't check every detail and seeing that people are eating that ETH Scam Giveaway by "Vilatik Buretin" I think this is even better.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:58:25
Depends, but If I wouldn't need the paycheck urgently I'd take it in BTC, maybe then exchange the BTC on Bitfinex during a bull run xd.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:14:40
Quite a point here, what is his cut on this "job" he is doing. No one in 2018 will work for free just to help others, that's absurd. This guy in a way is promoting Bitfinex more than any other FUD around. You can see the daily volume there, even during the dip Bitfinex is full or traders, yes, traders that's what you find there. Hope the will solve this audit and tether thing and things continue for the best.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:05:41
It's not that no body want to talk about Bitfinex or Tether. Those are old FUD topic after the bull run on Dec-Jan. People need to realise and adapt to a change. It's easier to keep USDT on a exchange and buy/sell with that, rather than credit USD every time. When you withdraw you will get USD on your bank account.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:16:46
That's a thing that is bothering me. If everyone buys and hold, who is gonna drive the price up? Supply and demand does. I do have holdings, but I'm actively using crypto as a payment form online.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:45:48
It's fudsters finding something every time. But on the bright side, I can buy cheaper BTC on Bitfinex with even lower fees.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:25:31
Only gamers understand the pain :( I've just bought new monitors and upgrading GPU, paid 200$ more for the GPU.

What if he was the whale's partner, triggered a panic and bought back all of those?

This wallet makes me sad:
No transaction since 2010, this guy has 350,000,000$ in it he maybe forgot his 12 words, maybe forgot he has a wallet or died.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:39:10
Bitfinex has a $10k minimum deposit for first-time traders. So in order for you to activate your account to trade you need to deposit $10k at first. As they mentioned it, they want to have serious traders, since low traders are cluttering their support system with their "mistake problems" and much more. Glad I got in before this since their platform, charts and tools they offer are pretty useful.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:15:37
This site has to be renamed to suicidemotivation.club
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:21:35
You can do shorting on Bitfinex, their charts and tools might come in handy.

Better looking and faster than CMC, keep it up.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:45:53
I think Bitfinex is getting close to 190,000 Bitcoins, doubt any other exchange has more!?
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:02:46
I'm sticking to main exchanges like Bitfinex, since on Robinhood you buy a paper saying you have 1 BTC so you can't withdraw it in your wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:29:50
Genius way to promote your business.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:05:50
That's a good point if you were an early investor. What will you say to the people who got at 10k, 15k or even 20k?

Most of us understand what the tweet said, but there are people that bought at 1$  years back and right now are up hundreds %%%, screaming HOLD and bashing newcomers and there are people who bought at 18,000$ and saw their investment reduce at least double. I think this what was trying to say.

@_date: 2018-04-07 21:56:40
You meant to say:
As the price is rising: "omg it's going up! It went up 30%! I should buy it because this will clearly continue"
As the price is falling: "omg it's going down! It will go up again! I should put everything on this low price"
That's why the image above is dumb.

Why do you afford now to buy Bitcoin? You can buy weekly like 100$-200$ or depends on your budget and that way you can slowly get to 1 Bitcoin.
