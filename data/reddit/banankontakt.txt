Sure, but when you're selling a company you don't really shut it down like this.

Nope. I have sent money overseas and internally and have never needed to actually contact my bank at all. I just login to their homepage and enter the account number(and iban/swift if international). Sure it still takes the normal processing time for banks, but still.

Nice! Do you have to book a table or can you just drop by around that time? Is that nice deal available on the menu so i know what to tell the waiter?

Yup. Since Mark apparently used his PERSONAL bank account for all customer deposits and other company related stuff he most likely saw all the money in there as his personal money since he had no good way of separating the two.
