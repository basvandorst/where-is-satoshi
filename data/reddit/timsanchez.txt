Wouldn't that be a moot point or a negative? If I wanted to buy a DVD from Amazon, they kind of need to know who I am.

How? My politics teacher, although not at university, said you should always vote. Even if you hate every candidate, go and spoil your ballot to make a point. Not voting means you have no right to complain. (his words)

That's true, but that is an issue in candidate selection and parties, rather than voting. Voting is useful, but its importance is reduced by the choice of parties. I'm not really sure how Bitcoin helps in all of this; as I said, I am interested in Bitcoin but my knowledge isn't deep enough to understand how it solves fundamental political issues.

I agree, and if you haven't seen my post below then I replied by saying that is a problem with the country and government, rather than voting. I don't really see how Bitcoin helps with this though.

If you voted, then complained to the government (eg a petition) that they are not doing what you wanted, then the complaint is valid since you participated in the process. In terms of difference, probably very little, it is simply something he used to say.

I agree, but I believe anything that gets people out and voting is a good thing. Votes do make a difference, and if you are arguing that parties are too closely aligned, see below. That is an issue with the country and parties, not voting itself, which remains useful. 
I still fail to see how bitcoin helps any of this.

Then it isn't really a reason for other types of businesses to start adopting bitcoin, it is just a reason why the current businesses have it.

I'm aware of what Bitcoin is, and saw this on This post seems really ridiculous, is it sarcastic?
"your own ability to think clearly about the way things are"  
"useless bone in the form of voting"
Seems a little far-fetched to me, and if given the choice I would choose government. Bitcoin is a great idea, but I hardly think it could replace our government, which is not as bad as this conspiracy suggests.

That is what I said originally. Your personal vote might not make a difference, but the concept of voting itself is very useful. Your vote might not make a difference, but if 100 people all decided not to vote because of that it could change the result. For example, [the difference here turned out to be 66 votes.]( Whilst one vote doesn't matter, an individuals vote wasn't useless, since just 33 votes is all it would take to dramatically change the outcome.

Good point, and I would love to hear this on Radio 4.

He didn't mean you can't complain, but he was saying in order for complaints to be valid you should have voted. If you don't vote and then say "Obama is doing it wrong", then why didn't you vote against him or spoil your ballot to show distaste against all candidates?
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:52:15


That's not true at all. Obviously you are speculating about dying, but I'd argue it is more important to go and vote than sit around doing nothing. Maybe the problem here lies with the US voting system, which once again, I fail to see how Bitcoin sorts it out.

I'd consider this off-topic since he never refers to Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:20:42
Voting is clearly important. Whether your personal vote changes things is a different argument, but to call it "useless" is ridiculous.
