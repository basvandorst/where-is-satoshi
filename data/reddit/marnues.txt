The world prefers leaders be called president and establish their legitimacy through some vote of the people.  A sham version of this is better than abandoning it.

This is an assumption, not actually true.  Its desirability and functionality doesn't make it a given.  Nor does its absence make blockchain useless.

Nailed why a gold standard is bad.

I completely agree with you.  However, the more I learn about the technology, the more I see this *eventually* replacing our informal trust schemes in society.  Those trust schemes usually underpin our major institutions and thus are partially responsible for institutional problems (racism, sexism, nepotism, it's who you know not what you know).
This isn't leading to some utopian dream, but it is an improvement on what we have.  For instance, a version of these algorithms could revolutionize doctor-doctor information sharing by placing patients more in control of their health information.  Doctors get a snapshot when patients give them access without having to rely on the goodwill of other doctors.
Basically, it isn't about currency, that's just the starting point.

I wouldn't call it anarchy.  Anarchy implies some sort of choice in participation of institutions.  Bitcoin is the future of institutions, but I don't see there necessarily being choice in those institutions.  It still looks like a have vs have nots situation.  One crypto-currency to rule them all.
Better than where we come from, no question.  Just not the utopian anarchy we all dreamed of in our teenage years.

Fraud requires some authority to decide what is real.  Doesn't that strike you as hypocritical?

That's a dangerous place to be.  Certainly he can dominate it, but what happens when he ends up on the wrong side of a fork?  Cults of Personality do not end well.

Bias isn't bad.  In fact it's often good.  I'm proudly biased against white supremacists, for instance.
