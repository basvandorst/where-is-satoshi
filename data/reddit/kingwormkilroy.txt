I've read it.  During the last bubble I had several old friends come to ME asking about bitcoin.  I answered their questions as best I could, and strongly suggested that they start with the white paper when doing their own research (before Youtube videos, etc...).  Not a single one of them have read the white paper to this date!
A large part of the reason I'm still bullish is the ignorance of the masses.  Part of my original case for investing was that even many of the people who had heard of bitcoin didn't understand the halvings/supply schedule.
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:40:56
This exact perspective is why I bought my first bitcoins, after nearly a year of technical research.

I'm imagining a retelling of "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" or "Rat Race" where instead of a bored millionaire, a shadowy technologist lures a heterogeneous group of participants into a contest with Satoshi's stash at stake.  Throughout the movie, various smart contracts based on pre-planned criteria activate to inhibit the contestants and gradually siphon down the prize amount.  Hilarity ensues.

Are there any significant differences between BTC, dogecoin, altcoin, etc...?

So then what is preventing anybody from buying low from one exchange, transferring the bitcoins to an account with another exchange, and cashing out at a higher rate?

$370.  Hope I'm still in time to claim the prize tomorrow, if I'm the only person guessing it'll go down.  I don't really think it will, but going against the grain is my guessing game strategy tonight :)

Even though this is just a comment, this is actually the first bit of bitcoin code I've ever seen.

Large in regard to transaction size in KB, yes?  More inputs/outputs means a "larger" transaction.
My understanding is that the transaction fee amount is NOT related to the actual # of bitcoins moving (e.g. moving $1 vs moving $1,000,000 might cost the same).

Dollar cost averaging: buying a fixed amount at regular intervals.  For example, using $200 or some other fixed amount out of every biweekly paycheck to gradually increase your bitcoin stash (aka build your position).  This has the advantage of smoothing out volatility, and since it is nigh-impossible to "time the market" effectively you generally end up getting a better overall unit price.

This reminds me of a point made by Andreas A during once of his talks.  In a few years, when some kids (who have already been using bitcoin for this and other reasons) reach the age where they are able to open bank accounts, they will have some questions.  For example:
Why do I need a minimum balance?
What is an overdraft fee and why can I even try to send more money than I have?
You mean I have to go to a bank-sponsored ATM or it's not free?
Why do paper checks cost $30 a book?
et cetera, et cetera...

That would bother me too, if I lost money.

Real Life Story:  A woman I work with knew that her middle-school-age son was hosting a Minecraft server, but then discovered that he was accepting bitcoin donations from members to help run it.  Her first reaction was "Is this even legal?!?!" so she investigated it, understood that it was legal, and was fine with it.
Although she didn't say so, I think she may also have been impressed, although certainly not as much as I was.

Diversification is a tried-and-true investment technique.  In any field or industry (including cryptocurrency) if you have a better technical understanding than other investors, you have an advantage.  The trick is to invest your own time to increase your own understanding.  That is why this is all so exciting.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:45:24
Thanks both of you for the question I was embarrassed to ask, and the explanation I needed.

Maybe it isn't.  Although anecdotally I know more engineers with relevant skills making them capable of running a business than programmers.

Beta testing itself, like segwit/LN on litecoin.
We don't want anything new with bitcoin unless we're sure it will work, or at least not eff up anything foundational.

One night a bear wearing a bowler hat broke into my home and stole a suitcase filled with cash.  Magpies have been known to abscond with shiny objects including jewelry and gemstones of high value.  I've even heard tell of pick-pocketing monkeys preying on the wallets and fanny packs of jungle tourists.
But not even dolphins are smart enough to steal my bitcoins.

One of my favorite scenes from one of my favorite stories is Jim Hawkins and his mom fumbling through the hodgepodge of coinage in the late Billy Bones’ seachest trying to get exact change for the back rent he owed them, while the hour when the pirates will arrive approaches dangerously.  They grab the treasure map at the last moment to settle the score, without knowing what it is.
Before I got a hardware wallet, my old wallet (now empty) passphrase was “Billy Bones, his pile” inspired by the ledger he kept as Cap’n Flint’s first mate.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:55:32
I can see your point, but on the other hand the bigger our community gets, the more we should expect to see bitcoin-related fan art, references in pop culture, etc...  which is kind of cool.

Dude I love this.  It's like mental gymnastics.  Sometimes it just takes the right explanation to "get" something.  Like how a year of calculus in high school didn't do as much for me as reading that calculus is just a tool to "add up an infinite number of numbers".

I'm 26 years young.  Got an engineering degree in 2010 and somehow ended up in healthcare IT.  Also in 2010 I heard the word "bitcoin" for the first time from a high school friend with extreme libertarian leanings.  I certainly wish that I had researched it more thoroughly back then.  It wasn't until 2014 that I really read a lot about it, and understood why it's such a game-changer.
It still took me a few months to work up the nerve to buy some.  Now I'm a hodler.  I also enjoy asking merchants if they accept bitcoin as a payment option.

House down payments are often 20%, there are plenty of cheap houses, mortgage interest rates are historically low, and you can add into things as you go along and let time work for you (instead of thinking about it like going all-in to something all at once).  I dunno, with good planning it seems pretty easy to retire early, faster if you cut expenses, learn to cook, etc...
