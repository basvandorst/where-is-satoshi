I'm personally invested in Bitcoin, but to ignore negative news is sheer lunacy. To ignore it and actually try and stop others seeing it, potentially to their detriment, is the behaviour of a complete twat
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:18:21
True, but it might not be two missing letters. The words also need to try different capitalisations and perhaps even switch round. I'm just fairly certain that it was some form of the two words.

Oh but you all like monopolies and big business if it suits your finances? It's fucking bullshit. Every day...BANKS MUST DIE....CITIGROUP MENTION BITCOIN!
Endless hypocrisy
The end point for most people on this board is to get Amazon and Paypal to accept Bitcoin. That's the defined 'Moon' that I've noticed in the last 18 months. Not to give freedom to the unbanked and the fucked over...to get the biggest monopolies on the planet to accept bitcoin so that the price will make a bunch of neckbeards rich for doing FUCK ALL.

@_date: 2014-01-16 13:16:56
People seem to forget how big Amazon is. If they wanted to accept Bitcoin, it would take more than a week with a Coinbase team...it would take a year or more of planning and signing off, testing etc...that's before the business case has been considered over and over...Big companies don't just decide things and do them.
It's not going to happen this year.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:25:02
Quite obviously sarcasm there. My point was that this guy is saying 'its because ghash is doing so well!' When that is irrelevant, no one should have control of bitcoin because they are in a position to offer the best deals to miners

I think Andreas would disagree with you here. Centralising Bitcoin is entirely self defeating. Especially to this scale. If companies like Bitpay and Coinbase have to make up the shortfall between what Mastercard and Visa can do, and what Bitcoin can do, that's like 99% of all transactions going through centralised agents.
Which is EXACTLY what we have with cards and cash.

That someone like Citigroup, or the other big banks (which half the profit chasers on here are wanting) will embrace the technology and take it 'to the moon', yet all of a sudden everyone will drop the banks - who now have a multi trillion dollar influence on the Bitcoin world in every way shape or form.
That's not what I signed up for. I didn't buy in so that I could make a quick buck and gift the biggest technological innovation since the internet to the same evil bastards that have been fucking everyone over for decades.

@_date: 2014-09-02 07:30:43
Haha, being a core developer isn't good enough I guess.
You need to get a grip, discussing negatives of Bitcoin is good for it, there's simply no other way for it to improve. Blindly claiming it to be infallible, and anyone who disagrees has an agenda, is toxic and idiotic.
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:43:51
Sadly there are a lot of people on this board who have no concept of how the world truly works. There's hugely hypocritical threads popping up every day about how Bitcoin is this perfect unstoppable beast that will topple banks, then the next everyone getting excited because PayPal or CitiBank mentioned it. Then of course, there's any negative thread gets downvoted to oblivion and anyone pointing out real world issues and going againt the frankly ludicrous idealogy is labelled a troll. A company says they don't want to accept bitcoin and this place loses their minds like a bunch of 10 year olds.
To be honest, this subreddit is one of the worst on reddit for circlejerking, hivemind behaviour, blind faith and just general bullshit. I find to be more balanced than here. This 'community' becomes more cultish by the day. I'd be interested to know the average age.
I actually have a lot of my money in coins, and want to see the technology take hold, but sometimes this subreddit makes me want it to fail. Some of the people on here are quite frankly an embarrassment that would cringe at

I see you point, however, I don't really think they are equivalent. The 419 scammers takes an active effort from the victim and really preys on people's greed or empathy. Bitcoin is INCREDIBLY easy to steal at the moment! Online security is just not there yet, or if it is its not user friendly enough. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:27:05
You're right it has that use, but so can any one of a million altcoins.
Saving $10 and hoping for 80 years is not saving. If you think Bitcoin is going to be the dominant force in 80 years then you're mad. Even if it is wildly successful, 80 years in tech is completely unthinkable. No one can pay their kids college tuition like that.

Ok...so because it wasn't responsible for the whole Gox theft, it's not a problem. That just doesn't make sense. 
I'm not saying anything remotely like that about andreas you deluded fucking idiot. I was saying he talks shit, he is wrong on occasion. What the fuck is wrong with you? It wasn't easily fixable, else it would have been fixed. Did you rad that developer conversation on github I posted? At least you've finally admitted it was a problem, good job the developers of Bitcoin aren't as pig headed and arrogant as you.
I haven't ignored the points you've made, I've addressed them but you keep on completely twisting them into something that I have not said, or completely misunderstanding the complexities of the problem. You don't seemingly understand basic fucking logic, let alone the technicalities of something like Bitcoin, and the legitimate problems it faces.
I know all you children in think that sticking your fingers in your ears closing your eyes and going 'lalalalalala' whenever some bad news comes up, or a flaw is discovered, is in some way positive for Bitcoin...but it isn't. It's SUPPOSED to have flaws, we are SUPPOSED to find the weaknesses, and we are SUPPOSED discuss and fix them. Not come up with some utterly ludicrous, disjointed reasoning for why everything is fucking hunky dorey and hope that no one notices. That's a recipe for disaster and if you pulled your fat fucking moronic head out of your arse for 10 seconds and actually looked into this you might see that.

@_date: 2014-07-10 16:49:31
I'm not a fucking troll you moron, I just don't agree with you. That is not the same.
In the same way that ramifications for any bug don't become clear until something happens, once coins WERE ACTUALLY STOLEN and the bug became public knowledge, it became more easily exploitable.
I haven't ignored this point, I've just stated it enough times I thought you might have fucking read it.

Only if they can spend those coins does it. Otherwise they need to change it over.
I agree, there will be some value (i believe somewhere between where we are and $5k), but the scarcity of Bitcoin will be massively negated by these services that transfer the bitcoins immediately to and from fiat.

Well, that is true, technically. The price is largely irrelevant to the technology. As is this whole currency bullshit Bitcoin, which is looking pretty likely to finally collapse completely, taking all these whining delusional fuckwits with it.
But the underlying protocol certainly has a use, even most strong opponents of Bitcoin agree on that, tho it's a very bloated and inefficient version right now.

There are lots of things that need to be added to the protocol. The fact you don't get this means you're woefully ignorant on the subject so I won't bother anymore
You want Bitcoin transaction volume to be able to rival Visa I guess? Well that is going to require an absolute fuck load of work.
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:59:48
Pull your head out of your arse. If governments the world over decided to outlaw Bitcoin, then the investment would completely pull out of it and the price would completely plummet. No exchanges, no new businesses, no payment processors. My point about China, look at what happened there! It happened LAST MONTH and everyone still thinks this thing is going to the moon regardless what the government thinks
We need governments to be favourable, make it less risky for the average joe and generally just allow adoption to go on unhindered, otherwise this will end up being a footnote in the digital currency changeover. Maybe it would eventually build up to something, but it would slow it to a complete crawl, after it had had its legs taken out.
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:04:03
Perhaps, but I think the authors points are valid. The bigger bitcoin gets the harder this change is, especially if it's something that is not in the miners best interests, but is in everyone elses. People are not rational when it comes to money, they can't be expected to do what is better long term. I think it would be more likely that a new coin would learn from Bitcoins mistakes and pick up from whatever glaring fuck up there may be on the horizon.

I work full time for a central London digital agency as a back end developer and devops 'engineer'. I really enjoy it.
On the side I have 3 projects I work on as a hobby, some freelance clients, and I DJ in a few bars which hands me a nice chunk of pocket money.
I've previously done contract and freelance work for number of start ups and big corporations, and also left my job to complete a project which fell through when my partner screwed up the business deal. I'm continuing with the system in my spare time, because even tho there is a market for it, it would be 6 months to a year before it made any real income, and that's before I actually fully tested and completed it - something that would take another year of full time work probably. Unless I wanted to release a substandard shitty product that could be hacked and everyones money stolen and my career destroyed. AND all of it may be pointless if a better solution comes along, or I can't find enough clients to use the damned thing.
Aside from that, I intend to jack it all in when I have built up a decent number of contacts and clients to support me remotely and go and work whilst travelling. This is a long term goal, and certainly not something I would rush into.


Literally miracles? That doesn't make any sense. I get the extra motivation from necessity, contentment is the enemy of invention after all. But that doesn't mean everyone with a vague knowledge of a new technology should quit their job, with no plan, or savings, and A CHILD. This guys isn't following a dream, he's following a vague notion of a very speculative endeavour

Did you not actually read his title? YOUR LAWS DO NOT MATTER TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. Not that the US does not matter. Adoption may be higher in america, but that is not something that will remain. Even this subreddits god Andreas points out regularly that the rest of the world will find a bigger pupose for Bitcoin than the occasional pest company, or furniture store accepting bitcoin.
That is of course, unless you're freedoming up the place with your enormous military. Then I guess your laws matter, because you're the protector of the world aren't you.

@_date: 2014-08-08 17:23:25
Not really, because you say this is spreading fear uncertainty and doubt, when really it's not incorrect. They ARE stealing bitcoins, through a fairly original means. And it's a problem.
What the fuck is wrong with this board when you can't admit problems with Bitcoin? It's pathetic
@_date: 2014-07-15 10:22:29
Constantly get this on this board....
'I tried to use Bitcoin for something'
'You fucking idiot, you shouldn't have used it like THAT. Only a NOOB would use it like that'
Well done guys.
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:58:23
You know...it's a bit silly to gloat about something like this a month before the deadline...and even so, the 'deadline' is just some arbitrary number. Bitcoin is not invincible, we honestly have no idea whatsoever what can happen. If some critical flaw was exposed in Bitcoin the value could quite feasibly completely plummit to 0.
Gloating isn't clever, this is the 2nd article about this. Firstly these are premature, and secondly it's immature.

I'm a lazy man, xgrp. A lazy lazy man.
Technically tho, the two words are interchangeable and there might be more letters. I'm just guessing based on another format I use. So whilst it might take 5 or 6 hours, I'd imagine that there's a tool to automate this. Especially as it's slow and awkward  - write out in text editor, copy and paste, fail, change letter, note down which one you've tried, repeat.
So I might have to try 10 combinations and brute force those missing letters. So that's a long time that I don't really have (who has a few days to do this?)

Not sure why you got downvoted for that. Have an upvote to even it out.
Anyway, yeah that's ok I guess. But really the benefits over debit/credit cards for a consumer with Bitcoin right now are practically none existent.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:03:24
This kind of thing scares me tbh. Once a Bitcoin is worth more than a Bitcoin, we're in trouble.
To explain...as soon as a bitcoin becomes worth more than market value, it makes a 51% far more profitable, and therefore probable. 
May I remind the wondrous zealots on this board that the downvote is not for shit you just disagree with! It's for something that is not contributing to discussion. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:57:57
Do they keep Bitcoin on it? Are there any bitcoin wallets that work on a 3 year old phone, and came out 3 years ago?

This is one of the stupidest fucking things I've seen on here. You should seriously reconsider this, you have no plan, no back up funds or savings. You have a family. This is so grossly negligent that if you told me this in person I'd be tempted to take you to a doctor, as I'd be convinced you're delirious.

That vast majority of people the world over do not save, or cannot save. So really that's a small percentage. We're talking remittance here, generally speaking these are poor countries.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:26:49
But we've had a lot of bullish news and the price has gone sideways, if not down. The majority of bullish news is based on merchant adoption, which is all using the immediate selling of bitcoins into dollars system that I talk about.
I agree there's some good news coming out, but many of these new companies look likely to be helping the transfer of bitcoin to fiat and vice versa, which strengthens my argument.
@_date: 2014-07-10 08:45:59


Ok then, glad we got that cleared up.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:21:07
Bollocks. How is a multi conglomerate just going to be 'cut out of the loop'? Are you completely mad? So they'll take it into their systems, perhaps really launch it...and then you think people will just leave them alone?

@_date: 2014-01-30 21:20:04
Excellent, so we can just start centralising Bitcoin then? A huge point of the blockchain is not to have to use these big organisations that take it off the chain and say 'oh this happened, trust us. Also pay us.'
I always see these valid arguments getting dismissed as tired because of some magic phenomenon happening some time in the future. That will never happen if people don't face facts and deal with the issue.
Look at the 51% threat from ghash. Has that gone away? No. Does reddit give a shit, because its a negative opinion? Oh fuck no, that'll 'get solved in the future', quit bringing your tired arguments.
Saying 'oh visa is 50 years old' has absolutely no fucking relevance, because the pace of technology is thousands of times faster now than it was back when credit cards were invented.

The wiki just further proves my point of the naivety of some of the Bitcoin community. 'It'll work in the future', the future has a habit of sneaking up on you and this is something that needs discussing now, not just postponing to some magical time when all the problems will go away on their own.
Fortunately this discussion is going on elsewhere...sadly never here because bitcoin is perfect here!

It's not just that simple, something has to be done with that money. Unless of course you have zero concept of how a business works. And their reasons are theirs, nothing to do with anyone else. It's the heights of petulance to say, about the people behind a fantastic open source os, that they are idiots because they haven't accepted bitcoin. I don't want to be associated with such arrogant dickheads to be honest. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:36:23

They've been putting this patent in for years and it gets rejected every time. As gets pointed out in every thread on this, companies like JP Morgan try and patent EVERYTHING. It doesn't mean much.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:12:04
Well, they are to do with each other. I sold because I understand why Bitcoin is severely lacking right now and why that is effecting the price. It's certainly not the 'TA' bullshit they try and peddle on bitcoinmarkets.

@_date: 2014-10-04 17:53:02
Not really, there's emerging companies that are built on the technology, and don't give a fuck about the price. Established ones like Bitpay, Coinbase, Circle. All of these at their core are about transfer of ownership using the Blockchain - the price is irrelevant. The technology is important, not the price. 
The vast, vast majority of people who give a fuck about the exchange rate are people who wanted to get rich for doing NOTHING. Oh and miners of course, which is still speculation

Oh I see, is this where you tell me I don't understand because I don't buy into the bullshit? I fully understand, I still think the technology is revolutionary. But you're an idiot. Bitcoin doesn't allow you to do whatever you want, it let's you do less. More traceable than cash, and plummeting in value from an overblown price that was proven to be market manipulation.

At the moment no, you can't pull transactions from BTC, only pull. Thats one of its features. Short of a reminder to pay (which would be crap), I can't see how this would work.

My point was that your reasons for saying one thing is obviously a scam can be attributed to the shite posted on this forum by bitcoin zealots
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:32:39
Yes I saw your comment, and then watched it get pulled apart instantly. Do you have any ACTUAL evidence to back up anything you're saying? You don't sound like an expert, you sound like a pump and dumper...this board is frankly full of them at the moment, half of them not even intentionally

No, the words really don't matter when all you're arguing are technicalities, what matters is selfish scam like, pump and dump behaviour, of which sadly Bitcoin is filled to the brim with

A bunch of people pleading to hand over their consumer protection and lose all their money? Fantastic, wish I had less morals and I'd get involved in the scams. Glad I'm out, if morons like you are anything to by.

He says that he thinks the price increase will be 3-5 times that of this year hence $5k. That doesn't make sense, the increase this year was about 6000%...so 3-5 times that would be approx 24000% - therefore a price of $216,000
Can't see that myself, but would be nice!

This really stinks

You're right I can't have a civil discussion with someone who skews my points repeatedly and will not actually pay attention to what I'm saying, asking the same stupid leap of logic over and over again. Certainly not on the internet
Ha, my post history, what because I'm keen in getting training at work? That's just common sense pal. Programming is something you never stop learning and if you rest on it, you're fucked. Same with apparently innocuous bugs in code.

No, MIGHT be more secure. That's a huge risk to take when you're trusting the device with your money
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:40:52
Oh I see, so because only a few hundred coins were lost due to it, and only those known about once the bug was made public, it's not a problem? We don't know how much was stolen through Heartbleed, maybe not much? But that was a serious problem for OpenSSL. You've got some low expectations for a worldwide currency buddy. 
Exchanges, services and bitcoin developers shut down and fixed bugs BECAUSE IT WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:07:38
Except that its deceptive, as it doesn't take onto account the fact people will spend more on exchange fees and variance. So you'll just keep up the appearance of Bitcoin being a scam.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:29:34
You mean, you think it's ok if it serves a purpose you agree with. 
There is no justification for monitoring someone's money in this manner.

I take it everyone just ignored the talk from that guy who actually went to Kenya to try and get this going, came back and gave a very frank and realistic discussion about why he went from evangelist to heavy doubter.
Bitcoin is just absolutely nowhere near ready for 3rd or even 2nd world countries and suggesting it does highlights a complete inability to comprehend the seemingly insurmountable troubles they have to face, well before you can even consider introducing bitcoin.

Very witty, but alas exceptionally dull. I'm off now, and I think you've got some bad news to proclaim to be good. Quick, back to the main board to tell someone that the scaling issue will be totally fine in the future, and there's no need to discuss it now. 
Also be sure to call them a troll

Double standards on this board. If gox had done this for localbitcoins spelling mistakes, you people calling it 'smart business' would all be kicking off.

Sorry, I like the guy, and I love his enthusiasm...but he talks a lot of shit.
@_date: 2014-07-03 16:35:18
That's not the point is it!? Why wouldn't you want it to get better?
It CANNOT rival Visa/Mastercard without increasing transaction volume by several orders of magnitude. That's not currently possible with the Bitcoin code
Besides, if Bitcoin just stagnates, developers drop off, bugs are exposed...and a new robust, innovative coin that can handle the transaction volume, discourages pooled mining comes in...its very possible that can take over

Yeah, $28m of Bitcoins coming back onto the market would definitely drive the price up (sarcasm for the slow to understand). This board is a parady of itself sometimes.
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:05:19
I didn't request a long version? I said he had said nothing. His original point didn't make any sense, and wasn't relevant. I didn't ask him to clarify it. I then didn't request a short version. Can you read?
This subreddit is pretty famous for being massively hypocritical, which was my original point. I wasn't 'trolling'

Not take over, but reach close to their current transaction volume, yes provided scaleability is resolved
At least on there it's not just an endless circlejerk of how either 1. Awesome, or 2. Great Bitcoin is. Anything construed as 'negative' on here is met with downvotes and derision

@_date: 2014-11-21 14:40:05
Except this is false isn't it? Because the cost of getting into and out of exchanges on either side, and the dropping price during that time, means they'd lose far more than $5. This has been repeated over and over again and no one on here has managed to properly refute that Bitcoin is fucking TERRIBLE for remittances.

It isn't, because your number is cached in everyones phones as using imessage, so you have to get everyone who you've ever text to reset their network settings, delete you and add you again.

You realise that there is nothing wrong with critical discussion right? Downvoting real issues is childish, as is saying 'oh well you don't have to use it'. Critical outsider reviewing of ideas is pretty much fundamental to software development, whether you like the tone or not.

I'd be very surprised, given that the NSA is probably recording my every move whilst I type, if there wasn't information to profile you based on every single thing you do with your bank.
'Oh this guy takes out money at 3am, therefore gets shitfaced, dock him some lending points.'
Also, no offence but being a teller is not a source on the intricacies of abnking software and what it is capable of. I know for a fact that a lot of this scoring is based on profiles and scores that are generated automatically from information tellers do not have access to. Only on rare occasions does a human intervene. (Source: apply online for something)

What a strange version of events you have in your head. Also, you're the one who made the incorrect assumption here.
If you are not indeed one of the true believers of what specifically about my comment history means I don't understand Bitcoin? If you don't want to be called a cretin, don't behave like one.

Sort out your website. The different between looking professional and trustworthy can be as simple as the design and feel - like actually cross browser testing the formatting of you forms and such. Most of your links don't work. Fork out for a proper designer.
At the moment it looks very amateur. In fact I'm very wary of this site, looks quite scammish. The fact that you are not registered in the UK has alarm bells ringing
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:54:14
Which is quite funny really, as that is currently the biggest reason for adoption.
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:58:47
I'm not expecting it to be magical, what pisses me off I'd the blatant hypocrisy of people on here because all they give a fuck about is the price. It stops realistic discussion and problem solving because they are so blinkered to this ludicrous idea that because they bought some coins that they should get rich. Are you seriously denying that that is not the overwhelming concensus on here?

It's just a fucking stupid term. Trolling is chronically over, and incorrectly, used in 2 places: the media and on this board. Everything is trolling apparently. Concern trolling is just an extra stupid version of this mindset - oh you're asking a question I don't like? YOU CONCERN TROLL!
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:34:27
I wouldn't have thought so. It's obviously not something that would stop Bitcoin, but I think if this is successful then it would slow adoption in developed worlds. This would  be extremely convenient

@_date: 2014-07-30 20:44:22
Well I mean, unless I'm misunderstanding, if stock in a company is held on the block chain and that stock value rises to a value higher than the value of bitcoin, then the risk reward ratio is tipped in favour of an attack. It would be irrational to carry out an attack to get coins because the value would plummet... Unless the coins stolen were worth something else, in which case it would be perfectly rational and therefore more likely. 
There was a really good article about it a few months back on bitcoinserious. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:03:09
Haha, on my phone. Edited
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:42:16
But it's a vicious circle isn't it? It's free, they can't afford to develop it, did you even read the article? Too many people expect to be given thousands of man hours worth of software for free nowadays. I'd rather pay a small fee to support the developers to minimise the chance of a bug when handling my money.
@_date: 2014-06-24 16:28:53
Sorry, I disagree with you entirely. You're the one who's called him an idiot and a troll for disagreeing with him when he raised pretty solid critical points. 
Whether you disagree with him on some other issue is irrelevant.

As I have said, this is a question for discussion. I'm looking to discuss, I'm not stating this as fact.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:10:36
Well, there's no point in continuing with this discussion if you're just going to fill in the blanks. 
You don't have to go there to set up the business to get first hand experience of why it is not currently anywhere near feasible. Education, infrastructure and cost are all discussed first hand.
You keep believing that this 'killer app' is just round the corner tho, regardless of the evidence.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:11:20
This is really serious, why is everyone completely ignoring this?
People saying they'll react after the event - this is the event that cripples the credibility of Bitcoin. People saying that people aren't that malicious - whats the fucking point in a trustless currency that you have to trust someone not to just burn to the ground?

Have you not seen that the big companies are now banning the vouchers that were the only way of getting fiat into BTC China? 
And on what planet would funnelling money through the CEOs personal bank account for a financial service be in any way sustainable? He's doing that til he can get away with it, but its pretty fucking clear that the PROC don't want Bitcoin, at least not yet.
You know anything about China? It's not the US. It's just not comparable. They say don't do something, you sure as fuck don't do it. Especially not with currency, and not so publically.
At no point have I criticised Bitcoin you dribbling spastic. I know it's being adopted, but that is only going to continue if governments look at it favourable or neutrally. Ideally we want them to give it regulation and blessing so the real adoption can take off.

Why would you bet your child's future on something as speculative as that? 
@_date: 2014-07-16 00:30:36
So Bitcoin is not a currency but a puzzle? You have to use trial and error to find out how to use it? I KNOW about Bitcoin and I wouldn't have had any idea not to use Coinbase as a spending wallet, why would anyone know that?

What I just said, quite clearly, was that the vast VAST majority of people who care about the price are greedy speculators. Which is undoubtedly true. You keep on clinging to this pathetic little argument tho if it makes you feel a bit better.
What I defended was the fact that Bitcoins utility is not related to the price. You clearly couldn't grasp that despite me writing it pretty plainly. And then when I continued to repeat it.


I'm bored of this, I'm sure you arguing that there are some edge cases, where people who aren't speculating give a shit about the price, will make you feel all warm and fuzzy as the price plummets.

The scalability issue is a very real problem, but don't expect anyone on this board to take it seriously...merely wave their hands and say it'll be solved in the future.
Truth is, no system has ever scaled up a few orders of magnitude like Bitcoin would need to compete, without a complete rewrite of the code

That's because there are many other factors feeding its adoption, China was pure speculation, we're still getting started.
Do you SERIOUSLY believe that if governments banned people from trading Bitcoin, using it for goods and services or any of the other industries that this is capable of, and banks went fully militant on their attack, across the world, do you really believe that Bitcoin would find it so easy to shrug off?
If so then I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.

Ah the response to an argument....'wahwah wahhhh you troll!' get a grip.
That's not what I said is it? You can understand the importance of something but you can't comment on a TECHNICAL problem if you don't understand the technology behind it. The developers on all the major exchanges and other bitcoin sites thought it a big enough problem...as did the bitcoin devs.
But not to worry cos you, who doesnt understand the technical aspects, don't believe it's a problem.
As I said, you have low expectations.

That's all well and good except that money is a necessity. Bills, house payments, clothes, college funds. So it's not just about your happiness, it's about providing for your family, and making sure you don't end up homeless. It's not exactly rare for that to happen is it?

I didn't edit anything out you lunatic, you're thinking of someone else.
Also, I don't need to read your stupid literature on paying less tax. Worldwide tax evasion is a major contributing factor to poverty
You just want to pretend that it all goes to the military, rather than hospitals, schools, roads, infrastructure and everything else, so that you can justify to yourself that you're effectively stealing from the state. Living in a society rightfully has a cost, and your net cost is almost certainly higher than what you put into the system.
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:43:25
Yes, I do actually. And I know that this is not how you do it. You don't just quit and hope that you get an idea. You get an idea and then work on it a bit in your spare time, then quit when you're in a better position. This guy has no idea about what to do except...BITCOIN!

A merchant is liable for stolen funds with debit or credit card payments, however we are not talking about that are we?
With Bitcoin, this liability doesn't exist. As long as they have the coins, fuck where they came from. If they were stolen...oh well, merchant still owns them. No legal recourse for the rightful owner. No consumer rights.

I'll update this with a link when I get a chance, but basically they put the app on the market with a totally different description and use case to what they then updated it to. Totally went against Apple policy and Apple were well within their rights to ban it.
Now many people argue that they only lied to get the wallet on there in the first place, but 2 wrongs don't make a right imo.
Edit: Here we go 
@_date: 2014-07-03 16:08:07
What has wallet got to do with anything? 
You don't really understand how development in collaboration works do you? Contributing to it is not the same as modifying the code.
What is desperately needed? Erm..bug fixes, code clean up, implementing new features (of which there are many). Do you want Bitcoin to just stagnate? One of it's key features is that it is open source and can evolve. That CANNOT happen if there is not opportunity, or more importantly, people around to actually do the work.
What are you even arguing?

That's what I meant. And I don't believe that to be the case anyway, I dont think Bitcoin is the be all and end al of crypto currency - it doesn't have to be high value to succeed. It can just succeed in many different forms.


Also this, just because we have had exponential growth in the past it doesn't mean that it will git that high.

Just essentially introduce it in various ways. The price almost halved whilst he was there, and there was nothing he could do to sell it. On top of that the price of data over there is a large proportion of their whole salary.

@_date: 2014-07-04 00:15:16
I don't believe hiver followed up with a question, but otherwise yes. You seem to think I was interested in hivers opinion? You may think it was well thought out, but actually it was just defending a point that I did not attack.

It's a cool idea and all, and well done for it, but I really can't see this being incorporated into any bar I would ever like to go to.

3-5 times THE INCREASE, not 3-5 times THE PRICE.  I wasn't being  serious with my post anyway, I thought I made that obvious with the last sentence, I was being deliberately pie in the sky. I'm quite bearish with my Bitcoin predictions.
But if he really does believe that we're entering the S curve and it's getting steeper, than 3-5 times the price is not much of an increase in comparison to 2013

Props for fixing a major bug in a payment processer 'after hours'? Are you insane? You don't get props for that, that is their job, and should be. It's what the merchant pays for.

The realism (or scepticism as you put it) has always been there, just now it isn't being voted down en masse by people too caught up in their investment to have a reasonable discussion about the problems with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin may not have started as a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme, and I'm sure someone will delight in pointing out a technicality that says it still isn't, but that's what it has become. PUMP THE PRICE TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO BUY IN SO I CAN MAKE SOME PROFIT.
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:04:38

You talk about the distribution of wealth but want to reduce tax? Not only that but the distribution of wealth in Bitcoin is horribly skewed to a few early adopters - it's worse than the current system.
I have no idea what you're talking about with a decentralised government, it sounds like absolute nonsense.
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:14:52

"Gox will be fine", "Transaction malleability is not an issue", "Bitcoin will help the poor and unbanked"
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:24:22
I don't really give a shit about the money side of it - thats not important. Making some people rich is not what Bitcoin is supposed to do, it's supposed to take the power away from the central authorities and give it to the people. The price rising or not rising is not a concern for me.
I truly hope that one day we all use this crypto currency, I never intend to 'cash out' except by spending my coin.
However, and this is a big however, I don't believe that Bitcoin will continue to go up in value because its main value is from its use as a protocol, not a currency. So the fact we can have millions of altcoins - each one used by a different company to facilitate remittance for example, means that the value of each BTC, and its first mover advantage, have reached their peak in my view (or at least close to it)
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:36:59

Like dis-incentivising large pools, increasing transaction volume by an order of magnitude
These are real problems that face us now.
There are bugs in the protocol, like transaction malleability, that was known about but not fixed for a long time, it's still not fully fixed, specifically because we don't have the developers. FFS even Mike Hearn is saying that development has ground to a halt

So, if it does allow chargebacks - why not use a credit/debit card?
If it doesn't allow chargebacks and you have to hope you can cut off your coinbase account before the thief spends all your money - why not use a credit/debit card?

Ok, so maybe not no value, but not hundreds of thousands like some people expect it to go to
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:11:10
Haha, yeah I bet you do, that's why everyone on here is so desperate to pump them and downvotes anything remotely negative. 
That's why you have people openly calling for collusion to pump the price to make believe levels, to recruit members to bring the price up

It helps create a bad vibe tho. People I know who ive been talking to about Bitcoin who were looking into getting involved, have looked up today and seen a bunch of frantic, idiotic, talk from others about how worthless their coins could be if [something*] happens. Hardly anyone who is bashing on about this on the front page and in the forums has a single fucking clue what is actually being proposed, or discussed. Or understands that discussion is not a Bad Thing

Well, awareness is actually quite an important weapon against despicable behaviour. It took awareness in the west to end apartheid. I also know that there is a determined effort by Israel to rewrite history, and in this digital age it's important to point out that that isn't possible, or ok.

Well, perhaps there should be more discussion about that? There seems to be plenty of discussion about the West's influence over economies and the crippling effects they have, the 1% etc...the human rights abuses in the form of breach of privacy, oil market rigging and things of that manner.
You're right I guess. I just can't help but get a little pissed when I see a post about how hunky dory everything is in Israel considering what it is all built on.

@_date: 2013-11-26 20:46:55
Totally different. People hoarding their fiat doesn't effect the price of the money in the economy, and this money is already an established currency in widespread use. If people just hoard bitcoin through speculation, the actual use of Bitcoin is minimal...it then fulfills the accusation that it is a pyramid scheme, because then it DOESN'T have any value except speculation. When people hoarding bitcoins decide to sell, it often facilitates a fall in prices. So it quite often seems that the high price is an overvaluation.

This subreddit is hard to stomach at the best of times, but your strategy is pretty spot on
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:14:24
It's fucking true! Half of this subreddit is about circlejerking, it's a bigger joke than Look at what happened around the China news recently, some people were so deluded it was actually hilarious.
Look at myself, what as a solution to the global bitcoin adoption problem? Yeah good going chump.
The point is not that Bitpay is not international (tho at the time they advertised they worked in the UK, well obvious mate), but that there is an extreme adoption issue in the UK, the financial capital of Europe. You dont see that as an issue?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:17:22
Pulls in more impressionable people, who get burned and has a long term detrimental effect on Bitcoin imo
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:03:25
I don't think they chose the phrasing because of that, I think it was more of a dig.

The people sitting on thousands of coins will surely sell (its an arbitrary milestone but one that nets them millions), and the limited supply that is governing this current high price will rapidly increase. I'm pretty sure the next crash is going to be particularly devastating.
I believe in bitcoin but this price is artificially high - adoption is just not that high yet
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:22:56
No one is saying that are they? But the people on this board are more fanatical than a bunch of christian fundamentalists. ITS NOT A BUBBLE ITLL BE A MILLION B4 CHRISTMAS. 
Was the same in April. Hopefully these people will shut up with the circlejerking for a while.

Again, no one is disputing that. Are you just intent on having your own argument? Bubbles can and will happen many times before we reach the peak... and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. And people downvoting negative news, and shouting down people who point out rightly the bubble we're in, is dick behaviour by this subreddit and actually harms the long term goals.

Dont worry tho cos has been saying for weeks that this wasn't a bubble
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:29:23
No one is saying that...why are you continually arguing a point that no one is making? Unsustainable gains will lead to a rapid devaluation. Bitcoin is not worth $1200 yet, it just isn't. It will be sure, unless something happens, but this upward trend is not realistic...but the over excitable children on this board keep banging on like its untouchable and frankly that is dangerous. It brings in new money without thinking through the consequences and feeds a more destructive bubble. That's when it fulfills the prophecy of it being a pyramid scheme and it burns people who otherwise would have got on board with it.
Stop with this fucking bullshit 'NEW PARADIGM' nonsense. It is not healthy for the future of the protocol
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:03:25

You've got a pretty weak definition of fun if you regard 10 new threads all with the same 'LOL they didn't have a gif' post, followed by OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING, by another 10 peoples...swiftly followed by 'OMG COINBASE HAVE RIPPED ME OFF'...endless screen shots of the same chart.
This follows the circle jerking of the century that has been going on for 2 weeks...during which time there was a witch hunt FOR NO REASON because half the place couldn't understand what was going on with the Coin Validation nonsense.

That's bullshit and you know it. Anything on here that isn't 'TO THE MOON' and is serious warnings to not get ahead of ourselves is downvoted to oblivion. Often ignoring facts and just going for the tried and tested fingers in the ears 'lalalalalalala' approach that worked so well back in April.
I'm not asking any questions, I'm pointing out that the people who pump the price on this subreddit were and are wrong, again. And hopefully these idiots will stop doing it one day but only when the attitude on this sub changes from 'thou must not speak ill of Bitcoin', to 'lets take an objective and pragmatic approach'. One guy pointed out to me the other day how we couldn't possibly be in a bubble because we have more infrastructure now and we've already had 2 bubbles. It's idiocy like that that gets upvoted as fact and then some poor bastard gets taken up with the hype and loses out.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:17:46

You can have 1) multiple bubbles 2) bubbles that last a long time.

Agreed, we are in a bubble, there is no doubt about that. Stop screaming new paradigm and just take it into consideration, it's imbecilic sometimes on this board. Does it mean the end of Bitcoin? No. It just means that there will be a correction. Pointing that out is not against the holy divine commandments of Bitcoin, so sayeth Nakamoto... FFS
Will get downvoted by the religious zealots because it detracts from their memes and pie in the sky riches.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:05:32
No it didn't. It was clearly VC's, media attention, China, merchant adoption, the US Senate. A coupe of guys posting the same shit gifs and LOL 2 THA MOON character had nothing to do with it.
