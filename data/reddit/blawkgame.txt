Funny thing was i was about to mention it to u myself. Yes definetly! Just dipped but like always we can expect the bigger the dip the bigger the rise. U came at a great time to make money. Also if u invest now and by tomorow it still whent down by maybe a couple percent dont be scared away really i mean it. Im not saying bitcoin is perfect but we can expect it to sqeeuze out a bit more profit for us! Also thank you for being very polite to me and sorry if i made some sloppy grammar/spelling mistakes, English is not my mother tong. :-)
Edit: Yes, with all due respect BCH can fuck off and stop leaching off bitcoin. Just my opninion hahahah but again as i said i would definetly invest in Bitcoin right now

Quite confused why  someone would say that about eToro, dont know what they were trying to accomplish but in my expirience, Not even so much as emails from them trying to sell me something. And also must not forget this website had been a long time and has Huge investors who exclusivly use eToro for theyre trading of stocks so also that must say something. Just imo an all around great website with all that a hobby investor might need.

I found the telephone number for the owners of the machine. U reckon i should call them or wait because its only been half an hour

also i want to be completely honest and all the advice that came from me is just what ive put together from other reliable sources with a touch of personal experience but in no way do i want to give u a false illusion that this is a free money source. Also i’m only 15 years old and think you should know. I truly wish you the best of luck and if u ever buy a lambo with your bitcoins give me a ring hahahaha!

U mentioned ur quite new to crypto. Gemini does have more options for buying many diffrent coins but if ur looking to buy the most “known and reliable” cryptos such as ethereum or bitcoin and about 10 others. eToro is the way to go considering u can rlly sit back and everything is done for u. No complicated ways of trading or selling. Really everything is done for u and u sacrifice only not being able to buy random coins
