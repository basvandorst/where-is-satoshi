As someone who when through the process of switching to tmo, that's not how it worked. If you're right, mind linking to exactly where it specifically says I can trade in a cheap phone and have them pay a $350 fee?

Nah, they did alright. The first speaker gave a good summary, and the second guy dumbed it down.

White screen.

Ahh, made some successful transactions then? Cool. I just traded between my phone and tablet just to see how it works. 
Is there a way to get to the 'profile' screen, without initiating a trade? This screen:  And how does Rating work? I can't find a way to leave feedback...

I don't think you understand, (for example) if you have a Galaxy S4 and your termination fee is $280, they will only cover $145 of that fee. So you'd have to pull out another $135 from your pockets to break your old contract. It's a trick to gain customer interest, and if the customer does decide to trade in their phone, it's just more profit for them. If they don't, well, the advertisement was still successful.
It's a great offer how they present it on TV ads, but not so great when you drill into the details. Its not like you hand them any old phone and they make your ETF go away.

This is a marketing trick. They require you to turn in your devices for this, and access a value for each device towards the money they give you for the termination fee. Spoilier: they undercut you. Their offer for my Galaxy S4 was $145, I sold it privately yesterday for $290.

Key word is "Up to".
Also, what's with the wave of replies? Try to stick to a single thread.

what you're describing is installing another software repository. someone would still have to do the steps I described and upload the resulting new version to the repository before you can download it.
