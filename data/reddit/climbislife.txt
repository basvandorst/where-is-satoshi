I removed the orginal image because it had my name but the text is as follows. 
NOTICE OF ACCOUNT CLOSURE AND PENDING DISABLEMENT
Dear User,
We have reason to believe you reside in a country in which Coinbase is prohibited by law from doing business (Cuba) per the sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to close your Coinbase account.
If you are not a resident of a sanctioned country or otherwise have received this notification in error, please contact us at support immediately and provide us with a copy of a photo ID and proof of your current address.
If your account has a balance you will need to contact the U.S. Treasury Department to request permission to access your funds.
Respectfully, 
The Coinbase Team

I can't even log in to do that.

Yes actually! And what a relief. 
I don't think I would have gotten anywhere if not for posting on Reddit. Let me know if you have any questions.
