Is this the most circlejerky subreddit of all the circlejerky subreddit?

Neat 
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:02:44
seeing as how bitcoin literally could not work without the internet.....

Sorry I'm late

See reply above

Or a giant crash at the end of the year. Its really anyones guess.
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:10:59
I bought LTC at like 3 dollars. Didn't sell at 40. But hey, I'm still in the positive!
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:26:03
That is just dead wrong. You separated the market manipulators into 4 categories when in reality anyone in the position to manipulate the market would be doing all of those things.
They want the price to go up, they want a crash in which they sell right before (The goxxing), they want it to repeat. There were 3 of your 4 categorical manipulators explained into one. The 4th isn't there because the only people that want that are those who are not in the position to manipulate the market.
Don't kid yourself. Nobody is in bitcoin to be noble, especially not those who made the most money. They are in bitcoin for profit.

Apparently it's the second highest documentary on iTunes
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:28:39
This is like my mom when I jokingly told her about the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. "Oh nooo, you didn't have a Bitcoin with the did you?" 
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:25:10
I think the recent buzz around The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin documentary is putting a bit more confidence into the market. Lets see where we go.
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:41:32
Markets are inherently competitive though. In simple terms, the manipulator is competing with you to buy and sell at better times. Sure, your goals may sometimes seem to line up with that of the manipulator's, but they still have more aces up their sleeves and you're more likely to be on the losing end of the poker table.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:12:58
Yep. Just like Bill O'reilly, he plays a roll. A character. There are people that actually like to have *news* screamed at them with the constant accusation of conspiracy theories by the NWO.
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:18:51
That is definitely the behavior of an insolvent company.

They are shipping 3-5 days UPS ground.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:48:42
Same with my LTC
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:26:09
ZeroHedge is an okay website for financial news. I haven't seen any bias reporting on bitcoin from them.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:20:32
Oh yeah, I can't speak for the commenters. Those guys are idiots. Worse than youtube comments.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:19:39
I too saw that post a few days ago about benders apartment number.

Those who program the robot may not be.
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:22:21
Don't downvote this post. It's true. There might be a large number of people new to bitcoin seeing it, but the main audience are those already familiar. It's not a bad thing though, putting confidence back into the people actually willing to buy some.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:30:27
You have a very narrow view on the fundamental purpose of market manipulation...

And the circlejerk commences once more

Quick Hodlers, save face!

Tide goes in, tide goes out. You can't explain that
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:43:22
Dude I'm thinkin even 100 is possible
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:22:22
Can people stop calling it investing. Crypto is speculation at best, gambling at worst.
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:37:51
I dont think its going to die. But its going to go down. Waaaay down
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:36:54
I was thinking 1k, but I think you're right. Lemme get that sweet discount tear coin
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:17:46
I got out after the first Goxxing, long ago in the days of BTC. Ever since I've watched this repeated mass sell off occur after record highs. Leaving the new "investors" upside down.
Shady puts it lightly
At least with silver, JP morgan doesn't pump n dump every year.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:31:18
It's almost like you're investment strategy is actually just to gamble?
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:52:08
I know you're joking, but please nobody do this lol
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:29:25
Almost got me to buy this time too. Haha
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:38:18
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:34:21
Ok, have a downvote! 
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:00:24
Are you saying the crypto markets aren't plagued by fraud?
