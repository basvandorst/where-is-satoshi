I have my LTC in there, where can I move my LTC to?
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:41:42
Whats the alternative? BTCmarkets? 
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:49:48
So basically, You get to keep the same profit as buying and selling bitcoin on mtgox minus all the hassle cashing out?
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:43:02
so its CFDs? ..You have to guess it the price will up or down??
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:18:24
Bought it! 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:42:15
How can I do this double spend with block chain app? 
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:46:23
What does that mean???
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:04:45
If you put that money into bitcoin yesterday and waited, you would have made a couple of hundred by now. Thats like doing this 4-6 times. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:06:57

@_date: 2013-11-11 09:56:45
So you are missing 20 cents? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:59:18
That is the dream!!....
EDIT: Reality in 2014/2015
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:44:45
Ahahah..Naw, thats too complicated. Just the logo.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:19:13
Bought it! 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:33:59
Wait.. I don't get it. If you invest in round one and just leave it.  And people keep going up round d 30. You will make a decent profit? If the tree dies do you lose your investment ? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:37:13
should be fine!..I beleive its 10k+ in one single transaction ?
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:19:24
Do they accept bitcoin for all their products?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:45:37
What ever happens it will go to $330 dead set. So its not too late to get $50 profit on each coin ;) . And if everything goes good $1000 by the end of year. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:39:48
Hey, I'm from Australia, send me a pm on how much you are looking to buy. I can sell the bitcoins to you at mtgox bid price at the time of transaction. 
edit: only in sydney
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:48:41
Of course you should be. What you are saying is stupid.  It's like you saying " I bought a home on  mortgage and I'm a noob. I know people own houses with no mortgage. "
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:59:01
7 days and 15480
@_date: 2013-05-10 07:06:24
Do you need download the whole 3gb of block chain or something for offline wallet? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:45:49
Well there goes my incentive to help promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:48:06
Keep the private keys with you. Put a expiration date on the paper wallets to let people know to move the bitcoins into their own wallet. If they dont, then you should claim it back. This is because, most people would forget or just lose the paper. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:54:08
True change the name to mtfap or something 
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:32:25
I was just looking at it. So what happens when you press buy? It buys the Bitcoin? so you can cash out the bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-27 08:48:22
how big was it?
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:46:22
Seems like no one uses it.  0 trade volume
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:41:37
It's 3.40 am. My body is shaking from all the stress.  And my stomach is in pain and I can't sleep. I want this to finish . I'm not going to be too greedy. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 07:11:45
So if I do that?  Would I still be able to use that computer to go online without the risk of hacking?  
@_date: 2013-05-05 09:05:17
My transfer took 2 days.  4% fees is better than the 8% at bitinnovate 
@_date: 2013-05-27 08:50:01
how can i remove it from block chain app???
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:10:32
OH nice. If you dont mind me asking for statistics. How long ago was it when you applied for verification and when did you first decide to try and buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:23:23
A crash is very soon!!! BTCCHINA fell 200
@_date: 2013-06-09 10:57:06
their australian accounts through technocash have been freezed. Any transactions during the freeze ( yours) are just stuck in the middle. So it will be while for you to get your money back.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:10:57
Yeah, that was after I posted this...Didnt want to do a new one!
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:22:46
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:03:17
pretty safe for small amounts!
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:36:15
Can you explain more about this??
Like local bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-09 12:15:20
They basically gave no insight for a new customer on how to adapt bitcoins. Just rambled non sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:35:43
smart!...watch it become 200 k in 2 years ;)
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:17:40
How is it gone?..Post the blockchain link. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 00:29:56
Are you going to offer a buy service also? 
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:11:34
Don't forget to put sydney
