My favorite moment was when the market slayed the bear whale...and then continued the bear market soon after.

I wonder..even if the block reward halves, if the price of btc goes up due to larger blocks and increased user utility, then in fiat terms the reward is stable. The price jump from the 230s to 460s already doubled the block reward from just about a year ago. To keep pace with the halving, price needs to double every 4 years, giving time for user adoption to grow and eventually for fees to become the block reward.

It's at night because the Greek referendum was announced after midnight.

Why would someone holding btc sell for depreciating bolivar?

Hasn't the block size increased according to demand for the first 6 to 7 years of bitcoin's existence, only to reach satoshi's spam cap in the last year?
And doesn't sw change the economics of bitcoin by altering the fee structure for witness data?

With 1mb block size limit and corresponding expensive fee market, if I had to fall back into the main chain safety net, wouldn't I have to eat a huge transaction fee? Or related to that, wouldnt I also have to eat a huge transaction fee to open a channel? How is this conducive to payments and more specifically, micro payments?

If capital requirement is a problem, why would LN as a distributed network work better than a hub and spoke?
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:51:20
Can blockstream create and run their own LN nodes first and grab market share? LN nodes likely work best as a hub and spoke network, and not as a distributed network. Its due to the liquidity lockup.

Thanks! Great list of charities, may I reuse?

I synced both xmr and eth blockchains in under a day using a usb 3.0 ssd, on a 5 yr old desktop. At the same time.

So homeless people should use their nonexistent money to buy phones to get a nonexistent low paying job thay pays in bitcoin. 
Even if btc replaces fiat, these people are still not going to be able to access the system. Technological barriers are a huge hurdle.

I vigorously disagree with the contention that homeless people usually have a phone. Maybe the ones on reddit do, but that's definitely not representative of the homeless population. I know bitcoin is great and all but a homeless person is going to get paid in cash if anything. It's infeasible to think a homeless person is going to know btc.
Maybe if btc takes over the world and becomes the dominant form of money transmission and the state issues an ID card with a btc wallet chip in it. Then I see btc helping.

Except whenever a ln transaction settles to the blockchain, everyone eats the onchain fees. Which are currently about $1 - $2. So if anyone in your ln chain of transactions wants to settle, everyone on that ln chain would have to settle. I still don't see how ln would allow for small/micro transactions. I know how ln would help with speed though.

Nice app! What are the options in terms of oracles? Can it be a large amount of people judging?
