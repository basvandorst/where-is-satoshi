But if bitcoin reaches 1mln wont the fees (assuming they are locked at a certain percent) go up alot
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:42:11
How much exactly?
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:51:37
What are you doing with your bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:49:29
It will not, in any time period. Bitcoin's sending fees are enormous.

@_date: 2017-10-21 12:30:51
Have you tried google?
Reddit != google

You really took advice from family guy, when they said "if you dont like it go on the internet and complain"
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:42:16
Well that is the same as dropping 176 percent, compared to the larger jump in price.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:34:16
English 100.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:09:55
