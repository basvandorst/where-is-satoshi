Is there a list of places accepting bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:48:38
I don't see a link on that page to what you quoted.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:36:14
Are you finding a lot of places accepting bitcoin? I read an article mentioning they were going to to turn Madeira Beach into a bitcoin town. I was going to make the drive just to show my support since I'm only a couple hours away. I find it ironic though that I couldn't purchase tickets to the game with bitcoin directly.

I used it fine several times at the ghettoest of Burger Kings even before they implemented the bar code system. You should try asking them to enter the numbers manually.

What he is implying is that the author dug up facts to fit the narrative in her head in order to publish the story. She worked backwards having already decided on the conclusion.

You make a very good point. Blizzard does this also with their pricing structure. By accepting Bitcoin, the price inequality amongst regions will be more obvious.

What do you put on the "name" field when ordering online with the card?

Who's up for the ["North Korea tours for the budget adventurer!"]( deal. Maybe we can get a group discount.

When you cashed out did it tell you the amount you had left in SwC chips or in BTC?

So government agency + gag order? Sounds likely given the tone of their post.

How do these new rules apply to current Chinese exchanges? Can they still use their bank accounts for customer withdrawals?

Have you attempted adding Prepaid Visa/Mastercards?

I was in the market for a 450w+ micro atx power supply but was frustrated by their poor navigation so I opted to buy an Amazon giftcard through [btcbuy.info]( instead. I would be happy to support bitcoinstore if they can improve their navigation and search function.

According to this [page](  it is suppose to be by the marina main stage, which is at the center of bayside. There is a cover band that just finished playing there.

Got a source on that SR figure? Not doubting you, i'd just like to read more about it.

Come on Gyft, you're almost there, next step any supermarket.

Is blockchain.info getting ddos? 
edit: nvm, looks like it's fine now. For about 30 minutes I was getting 0 nodes connected.

Bit365.eu doesn't even require an email address, the odds are consistently better, and they have esports.

SR does $3 million in transactions in a month.

Sweet, that worked. I'm off to test my Burger King gift card.

Maybe r/Bitcoin should organize a LOL tournament. It's the most popular competitive game at the moment. The player base is said to be 32 million. This would surely create  buzz in the gaming community.  
Theymos can provide the prize money.

Guys, I'm bad at internet. How do I get to this [screen]( on the app?

Mtgox is processing withdrawals to Japanese bank accounts?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:38:03
The solution is to use the same banks the Mexican drug cartels use.

Where at Bayside? Food court? Stage?

It looks someone asking for donations accidentally sent 5 btc.
Edit: Nevermind. I'm looking at the table wrong.

They should set it up so that transfers go through an ebay wallet.

I was using btcbuy.info exclusively up until this month to make purchases from Newegg and Amazon, and pay for my cell phone bill. They were a reliable service that even gave you the option to use PGP, it is a shame they have shutdown. 
If you live in a municipality that uses [E-Gov Link]( for their payment processing, then you can use bitcoins to pay for your utility bill.

Alright, I'm here by the stage watching the band setup. Blue linen button up. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:54:06
Thanks, that worked for me. Order is stuck on the "Notification Method" page but the problem might be on the server end.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:29:13
How did you purchase a gift card? I don't see the option to "buy" on the app.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:42:56
I have a feeling you've never donated plasma before.
@_date: 2013-02-17 04:53:15
They need one that dispenses cash for bitcoins.
