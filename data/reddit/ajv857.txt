To test your statement, I just went onto coinbase and purchased 50$ worth of bitcoin. I was successful, so I'm not sure what you're talking about...
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:48:06
based on your post history, you clearly have a poorly represented idea of what bitcoin is, can be, and will be/
Thanks for the luck though :)
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:59:48
It doesnt bother me per se, however I like the idea of remaining more or less anonymous. I think for day to day transactions, I am ok with a company like Bitpay having tabs on me, but I'll also have a separate wallet with "washed" coins, just in case I suppose. To be honest, I'm mostly just tired of multitrillion dollar corporations controlling the population and government in this country, and I'm done supporting them. I was just charged a 40$ fee because I was charged a 40$ fee. That was my final nail in my coffin.
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:09:20
clearly my understanding of a bip38 password is incorrect, thanks for clarifying and the link!
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:17:53
I was thinking that, about the passwords. However, aside from writing down the passwords and keeping them in a safe, how would you recommend "remembering" a BIP38 encryption?
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:45:56
If bitpay gives you an account and routing number, couldnt I just use that instead of bitwage? (if that is actually the case, I havent checked)
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:39:49
I dont feel as though you understand anything in this post, or anything regarding the use of bitcoin, or the idea that some people dont trust the banks or the government as much as you do. Just for instance, you CAN buy a house without a bank. Or, you can transfer that bitcoin into a temporary bank account for said deposit. Or, you can use a lot of alternatives. The point isnt to be "more convenient" for payments, or to save money, the point is to have control over my own life, without trusting a corporation to handle my financial status. Which, if they drop the ball, can make a significant negative impact on my life. At least if I drop the ball, it's my own fault and I should have prepared.
@_date: 2016-08-31 12:02:31
Realistically there is no way for any government to "shut down the internet" yeah, they can order isps to stop service, but with how connected everything is, there would be riots and a lot of bloodshed. And, if it is shut down from "natural cause" (solar flare) we're going to have other problems too. And, in that event, while fiat would technically survive that scenario, the economies would crash so hard it wouldn't matter
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:12:17
sounds sarcastic, but thanks anyway! :P
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:52:28
Ok, so then another thought: If I were to create a bip38 encrypted wallet from bitaddress.org, and physically go through the trouble of making a paper wallet with it, aside from "why would you do that" would it be (reletively) safe to store the encrypted private key in an unmarked file on, say, google drive?
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:09:26
I haven't made the move yet, but I've been looking into it for some time. What I've found, in regards to the debit card, is 
Basically, you transfer the funds you want to be using for the day/week/whatever onto the cryptopay wallet, which is linked to your card. You then spend how you normally would, and it does the rest for you. Other than a monthly 1$ fee, I don't believe there's other fee's. Correct me if I'm wrong though
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:39:16
Really... I suppose skipping the paper wallet makes some sense, I think my rational behind it was that if I ever wanted to load my savings (any amount) onto a hot wallet, 1/4 a bitcoin would be much safer than a larger amount. However, as you point out a hardware wallet would do the same.
How would I have a service like bitwage send my "paycheck" to the hardware address? From what I can tell it has to be in the wallet on their site first, but from there I can transfer of course.
Unfortunately it is necessary for the spending to be in fiat, however I really wish there were more options than what we have in the US.  What I want IDEALLY would be a POS conversion, so I never have to manually load the card, it just converts when I spend.
@_date: 2016-08-21 06:02:51
Thanks for the luck and tips!
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:17:54
ELI5, why does it matter how long it takes? From what I can tell you can almost instantly tell someone sent you money, but it waits to be confirmed. So, why's it matter if it takes that long to confirm? For example, if I were to purchase 1000$ of something on a website, would they want to wait for the confirmation? And why?
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:37:30

They are, and I dont intend on living in the US forever, however I'm not leaving for at least several years
@_date: 2016-08-27 01:16:28
Coinbase and Circle. Have used both, both had a "newb" time (For circle it was a verification to lift the 300$ limit. I also activated some automated thing when I bought coins and immediately tried to send them, so it delayed things by 4 days)
Granted other countries have less "restrictions", but yes, you can buy coins in the US
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:04:59
I've never heard of egifter, I'm gonna have to check that out. 
I do have a quick question though, why would that be easier than using, say, a bitpay card? You can load it just as fast from their website
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:53:48
I use one every day. Love it. One thing to note is that the delivery took longer than it should have which was annoying.
Also, something I had to learn was when you use your card at the gas pump, it will withdraw (for me all) of your money and refund the rest the next day. Just a heads up. To avoid this, just go in and pay
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:39:26
I dont remember off hand, I THINK i had to submit my ID (picture and number blurred, just the address was needed). However that may have been for bitwage, it was a while ago
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:02:44
I've been doing something similar since around July of last year. I live in the US so maybe this wont apply to you.
I've been using bitwage to get paid in bitcoin. I'm not sure how/if that would work with paypal, so in that situation I use Gemini to purchase my coins as well. Instant delivery, and a 4 (i think) day wait time for cash-outs
I have a bitpay debit card that I use for transactions. Just load it up quick from either their app (have to use their wallet to do this) or on their website (can use any wallet, currently use Mycelium) and you can spend instantly most of the time, or wait for a confirmation (very very rare, I think it's happened once so far). One nice bonus I've found with bitpay is there's no fees, nothing monthly or yearly, and a $2 USD fee for atm withdrawals. You can also spend/load $10,000 a day, so there's not really a limit that way. Daily ATM withdraw is $750 per ATM, or $3,000 total.
I also have a KeepKey for most of my coins. For my budgeting, I figure out how much I'm "allowed" to spend that week/month and load it to my phone's wallet. Then as I'm going about my business, I try to buy what I can with bitcoin (purse.io, steam, etc), and use my card for the rest.
So, for example, my average day shopping would look like: I figure out how much I'm able to spend, and transfer the coins to my phones Mycelium wallet. I go to the store, grab my stuff, do some rough math in my head and load how much I need onto my card + a bit because just in case I was wrong. I use my card, then head over to the ATM for some cash (cause IDK) and withdraw $200 from the ATM. Go home, and I'm done.
It's pretty nice, the only thing I've had an issue with is paying bills with bitcoin, most of my providers don't allow it. One option I've found is paying manually per month for my cell phone bill, and I can just use my bitpay card. Paypal also allows the use of the card, so anywhere that accepts paypal can use your card no problem. Rent I've still not figured out how to do without using cash.
Good luck to you, honestly living without a bank locking my account for 2 weeks because I bought a new cell phone has been pretty great. Let me know how it goes!
EDIT: I should mention, purchasing gas at the pump can cause issues. The pumps pull a default amount from your card to make sure you can cover the price, and then refunds it in a day or so. It can be annoying if you don't know it's happening, so I just go inside and pay for my gas in person (I know, gross human interaction)
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:44:00
Well I don't really have complicated taxes, mostly just income. So, for that, I just use my W2's sent from my work. However I think they have a tax report option if you need it. As for experience, I haven't had any issues with it. My job didn't like the routing number I was giving them, but that was on their end not bitwage. Pretty streamlined to be honest
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:39:33
oh cool, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:54:49

Honestly I've been wondering the same thing. On top of that, at least in USD, there are so few buy options on bitsquare that it's not worth my time to set up (unless I'm doing something wrong?)
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:43:38
I'm not familiar with Uphold. However, it still stands. Even with 2FA or any other account measure, if you don't exclusively control your private keys, you don't exclusively control your BTC. You may have access to use them, however if the service is, say hacked, you can very quickly lose all your money. Only keep what you are ok with losing on an exchange
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:44:54
honestly i'd still do it, interstellar trip sounds dope ;)
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:40:11
Hold up, you're saying you dropped almost 3.8k on btc during finals week? I'm sorry but I call bull. No one throws 3.8k at (while I actually live off bitcoin) what is essentially in investment without knowing more about it.
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:30:28
Well, if your issue is that you don't necessarily trust exchanges to handle your money with no issues, then you're really only left with a couple options IMO. I use circle, I've verified with them (all that SSN and shit), and I've had no issues at all.
However, that being said, LocalBitcoins, Bitsquare, or a  BTC atm are your best bets. If you live in Massachusetts, there are a few in Boston and Keeny and Manchester NY (depending on where you are). [Source](
I'm curious if you get a different answer, I'd also be interested.
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:57:28
Do it
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:35:36
Ok, so in that regard you're USING the full node as a wallet client for incoming/outgoing bitcoin, not just running a full node in the background
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:28:25
Just out of curiosity, why does running a full node "make you a bank"? Other than continuing to keep a record of transactions and helping the network along, is it able to do something more than what I'm aware of? Or is it just running a full node in the background on some server like i am
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:26:27
But, if I create a new address, publish that linked to my twitter account, win, and launder the coins into my normal wallet, I've published an address that has no association with my normal wallet and nothing about my life changed.

@_date: 2016-09-17 22:12:27
I'm not sure if it's based on amount, but I'm able to load 100$ (USD) to my bitpay card, and it is available within seconds. I believe it only waits for the transaction broadcast, because it certainly isn't waiting for any confirmations. However this may not be true if you try to load, say, 1000$ onto it.

Honest tag-along question, why can't the full node hosts confirm the transactions instead when miners lose their value? From what I can tell, if the BTC Core users start handling transaction confirmations, it would be just as secure and less costly spread out

Problem with Shift, doesn't work in MN
@_date: 2016-10-07 04:15:06
I think it will, but I'll actually give a serious answer.
As a lot of other sources out there have pointed out, cash isn't valuable. It's a loan from the government, and other members of the population accept it for various things (such as rent and food). The problem, however, as seen in the Great Depression, the Deutsche Bank, the Federal Reserve, is that the value of the currency is entirely based off of the mercy of the bigger powers. For example, if the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates, not only would the value of the USD go down (however much/little), but it would create a ripple in the lending market which would result in other national issues. The Deutsche Bank is experiencing MASSIVE financial issues (and ignoring the fact that hundreds of banks rely on it) if/when it takes a high dive, the market effect in the EU alone will likely affect several nations as well. (I'm not an expert, and go off mostly my own research, I could be wrong in this part. However this information can help the answer).
As other users have mentioned, the majority of the population obeys authority. Bitcoin currently holds a special place in the media's heart as the "criminal currency", which has thus implanted itself in the populations minds. However, the time is coming where people are going to start looking for more secure alternatives to FIAT. This is due to several factors, ranging from the government inflation (see [this]( and yes, it's from zerohedge but some quick googling will pull up more info like this) or the control that banks have over your life and dictate what you do. If you cant tell, at least in the US, a lot of people are beginning to become fed up with the powers in play and are acting out on that. Having your livelihood based in the government you're sick of isn't necessarily wise. Even though people obey authority, the basic human instinct for self preservation can and will break that authority (self preservation in that we rely on money for everything, and if you lose it to hypothetical inflation, you're pretty fucked). To tie into this, the US economy is bubbling again, and several well known economists have stated that we're about due for a crash. Lucky us? ([Source]( again from zerohedge i know, but they're the top result and i'm pretty lazy)
The next part is in regard to the whole "online currency". Currently, to pay on any website, you have to put your credit card info in, and they (usually) keep it for later use. If anyone were to break into that websites servers, they could steal your card info and thus your money. However, paying with bitcoin never allows the recipient to have access to your funds, just as if you had handed them the exact amount of cash and had nothing else on you. Someone breaks into a bitcoin markets servers, they can steal the companies money (aside from normal safe practices by the company) but can only see that you paid them. The card issue isn't limited to online companies however, paying somewhere like Target will store your card info in their system for an amount of time, and can still be stolen. At the same time, devices such as ATM scanners will swipe your card info on the spot. However, as with online payments, paying at a store will never expose your information to the vendor or 3rd party.
However, there's an argument to be had that someone can give you a virus and steal your money that way, or get on your phone/computer and empty your wallet. That's true, but as with most things these days, good security practices (such as a good passcode for spending on Mycillium, for your phone, encryption technology, hardware wallets with passcodes, etc) will counter these very well.
Finally, the biggest appeal for people still using cash is the convenience and anonymity it provides. Buying drugs from a local dealer? Cash is best. Paying a friend for lunch? Cash is almost always easier. However, bitcoin provides those functions as well. Coin mixers will erase traces of your coins from your purchase/acquisition method, and you can just pay the address of the person on the other end.
However, the biggest question is what will drive people to bitcoin. In china, that answer is the instability of the economy. India has something similar happening, and their growth is pretty substantial in the use of BTC. the EU bought a decent amount around the time of the Brexit, and continue to due to the Deutsche Bank fiasco. I predict that the american bubble pop will see an increase in BTC use, and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the current election will do the same. The only things in my mind that will push bitcoin into the mainstream are a system like Lightning Network to make payments faster, more scale-able, and simpler to handle, as well as a major financial issue in the country of the new users. Several well-known and well-versed people have predicted 2017 to hit 800$, and 2020 to hit 5-10k$. I dont know if those numbers are going to be accurate, however those prices indicate a migration to the bitcoin.
BTC has several huge advantages over FIAT, primarily not being at the mercy of the large corporations and entities that run the world. For people to use it, a service like Lightning Network must become available by default, and for there to be a financial crisis in the country of the new users. Target time? Several trustworthy sources predict a huge price spike by 2020, an increase by 300$ by next year, which implies that it'd be soon if those numbers are semi-accurate. Maybe not mainstream, but well used.
Sorry for the wall of text, inb4 i get downvoted by the circlejerk. Hope this answered your question OP
@_date: 2016-10-13 23:53:45
I've tried a LOT of password managers, and honestly the best one by FAR is Enpass. It's non-server based, uses AES-256 encryption for the wallet file (I have a stupid long password for it), and allows you to back up the file on a file-sharing site (such as google drive, or dropbox). It also has a plugin to chrome that allows you to autofill websites on your input, and a very well made app for iphone and android. Both apps can link the backup file on drive, so your passes are synced constantly. The ONLY downside was that the apps cost money to get more than 20 passwords synced, otherwise it's completely free and open source. 11/10 would recommend
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:59:32
Their app added the ability to, however it doesn't work in the state I live in so I have no information about it.
However, if you don't mind having some limits, Circle allows you to buy bitcoin almost instantly, at a cap of 300$ a week (rolling). I BELIEVE they require ID information however, I know I sent them mine. If you don't care about that, i'd just use circle. If you have a large capital to invest at once, however, I (personally) think that coinbase is pretty good. I know that a lot of users on here have issues with coinbase, but I've run into no problems. I wouldn't keep my money on there long of course, but for buying a lot or selling they work pretty well.
The service bitpay has on their app for buying/selling is called Glidera
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:53:50
Just out of curiosity, did you use any trace removing steps such as mixing? Or just straight from circle to dark net? 
@_date: 2016-10-08 16:51:34

@_date: 2016-10-01 07:10:02
I had this issue when I opened my account. It was just a verification cycle, though I'm not sure what they were checking. It took 3 days I think, and then I haven't had an issue since
@_date: 2016-10-05 03:50:26
I haven't done almost any research in this field, but I BELIEVE that bitpay does something like that? I could certainly be wrong however...
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:05:28
No problem! After you get and activate the card, to load it you just log in to the website and hit topup. It'll ask how much, and give you the QR code to send to, or allows you to open the payment in your wallet. Takes about 30 seconds. Plus, since bitpay just launched their app, it became much easier. I would recommend it fully
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:56:33
I use bitpay, so I can load a prepaid visa almost instantly from my phone. So, yes, I do (like most people would), but not before I actually am purchasing something.
For example, today I needed gas. So, I got my gas, paid inside, and loaded my card for 30$ right there. I keep about .25 bitcoin on my phones wallet, the rest on my keepkey. So, if I can pay with bitcoin I do, if not I use my card.
@_date: 2016-10-29 19:46:16
I do it, and will keep doing it. Even if it is a bit more work to get things done, it's just better than using FIAT imo
@_date: 2016-10-05 03:48:16
Something to keep in mind is that even with the USD, there is a huge chunk not being spent. For example, any very rich person has millions, if not billions, of dollars sitting. If they were to spend every cent of that amount, the effect would be felt (though, certainly not in such a large way, because of the large acceptance of the USD). While yes, there is a large amount being held, personally I don't consider it in anything, because almost any FIAT currency has the same thing
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:12:09
I agree, it would completely change the way bitcoin is used. However, without setting up something like BitPay, but when the card is swiped it handles the transfers and payment for you, is it even possible to do something like this? As far as I know the CC machines of today MUST have a card connected to an actual networked bank swiped to work
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:24:31
I'm just wondering, as I'm not well versed on the various softwares and methodologies of bitcoin (mostly stick to mycilium and electrum),  how did you bump up the fee (assuming other than the child-pays-parent method)?
Also curious, along those same lines, how did you set your fee to 0? I'm only given preset options based on average fees -_-
