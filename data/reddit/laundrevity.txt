I completely agree with you. Most MSM sources I have read treat it as a fact, and if they condescend to offer evidence then it is simply some executive from a cybersecurity firm that has a clear incentive to sensationalize worries about Russian hacking.
Granted, I think the probability is around 50% that Russia is behind it, but it is really depressing how the media seems to ignore the nuance and just assume it was them.

If you really wanted to maximize the people using the service, you would also make an app (or other service integrated with your app) that lets people buy iTunes apps with bitcoin. I feel you will lose a big possible segment of your market due to people not knowing how they can use the bitcoins which they'd earn through your proposal.

With respect to 2), a problem with government auctions is that no company wants to have to win a bidding war. Companies often signal the highest amount they are willing to pay, and with surprising frequency the company willing to pay the highest final rate wins the item at the minimum bid.
