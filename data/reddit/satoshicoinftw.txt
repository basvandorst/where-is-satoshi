Thanks for buying my coins back in December. I'm planning to buy them back in a few months - get ready for selling.

It was $90 in 2011? I remember buying in 2010 or 2011 when it crashed from something like $20 to $4 or so.

I have a question about a potential optimization in regard to taxes that might be interesting to several people here trading regularly:
None of the existing exchanges allows "specific identification" of Bitcoins (for tax lots) so users are stuck with FIFO (or potentially LIFO) when trading.
Last year I did all my purchases in a way that ensured that funds from different purchase dates never get intermingled. I did this by using several different sub-accounts on my Ledger device. After each purchase on an exchange I immediately transferred all the funds away from that exchange into a new sub-account on my Ledger device.
Assuming I want to sell some of my coins: Would "specific identification" be an option if I execute that approach in reverse. So making sure there aren't any funds on the exchange prior to selling and then only sending funds from a particular sub-account to the exchange. Or would I be still stuck with FIFO?
The large advantage of "specific identification" is that it would allow for huge tax optimizations. Let's assume you bought at several dates last year and want to sell some of your Bitcoins today. With FIFO you'd be stuck with the coins that have the lowest cost basis, while with LIFO you'd potentially not be able to benefit from the long-term capital gains rate. With specific identification you can chose whatever coins are best for a particular trade.
