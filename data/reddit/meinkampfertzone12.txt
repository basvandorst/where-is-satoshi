Ehm... people that actually use it instead of speculating?

I honestly don’t understand your question. I would pay 1 dollar for an alt that can buy me things I would otherwise pay one dollar for. What do you mean with your second question? What is funding in this context? Coins are not companies.

It maybe would if they can’t pay for mining operations anymore. Still not a valid reason for a free market to go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:10:50
Sure that’s absolutely true.

The real question is, was she hot enough to be equally crazy and be above the Vicky Mendoza Diagonal?

What loss? He made a fucking 500% gain. That is immense, please educate yourself on investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:31:18
Yup had this happen yesterday!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:36:26
Why would the halving increase the price? Is that because the inflation lowers and therefore supply is limited? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:28:18
Ok I can understand the selling pressure, but the need for fiat doesn’t do a thing for price other than having sell pressure on the markets. Then again what  is the average BTC daily volume over the past month? Is 1800 BTC substantial enough to influence the price?
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:55:51
Nope, I mean, the supply grows less fast, it is not halved. The supply is still 17 million or what but now growing at a slower pace. How can that double the value?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:51:45
I’m stating that by making mining more expensive the price will not go up. For that you have to have buyers. The only way this could happen is of the halving will result in less bitcoin being sold in the market therefore dictating a higher price.

Why mention the Dutch when we are obviously not German? I know a long time ago they tried to make The Netherlands German agsin but that failed... PS: don’t ask about my random German name.

H4x0rz it was if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:27:03
The fact that miners want to sell for more money doesn’t do a thing to price no? I would definitely stop to hodl then and just sell everything for a million a piece already. That’s just not how the markets work. Unless I’m missing something here, would be happy to be corrected.

RemindMe! One year "bitcoin is 2-3x what is was Aug 2017"

Damnit I wish they invite me some day ��

Any backup for your claims?
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:25:48
You don’t need to remind me. I know. That’s why I’m asking you why you put out these claims.

What investment would yield 85% per day? This is shit.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:01:16
Yeah right. If you had this opportunity you wouldn’t let me in for sure. Next please!
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:51:00
I didn’t suggest anything. Bitcoin is simply an asset that is valued high or low, not yielding returns.

After refresh it was gone. Definitely a glitch but had to share it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:07
Yea baby!

Haha yes!

It’s an exchange, GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:09:07
Or maybe an error in the data? Red candle seems too perfect. Also the trend is too flat.

What makes buying BTC with € more painful than with $?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:30:21
Yes that's what I thought as well. However the EUR/USD isn't up, rather down. 1,187 right now compared to 1,195 or so yesterday.
EDIT: stupid mistake.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:17:52
My guess is that crypto really is priced in USD... So the BTC/EUR pair is more like the BTC/USD pair divided by the EUR/USD value. For normal securities this shouldn't matter (due to arbitrage) but with crypto these spreads can be quite big.
Maybe I'm just wrong. Anybody with an actual finance degree may correct me :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:10:43
Could you elaborate please?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:43:09
I usually either use google, if you search for the pair EUR/USD it usually gives you the rate. On my phone I use the app from my brokerage account.

With more trading there will hopefully be more arbitrage between exchanges. That will drive down the differences between them and actually make them follow the EUR/USD rate as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:25:33
What about Litecoin?

What do you mean you cannot live off rental income? Lots of people can...
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:15:08
Nope, even with a mortgage you can live off the returns. Look it up, do the calculations. In my experience a 60% LTV yields the best cashflow relative to the total cash invested. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:15:10
I can also get about 30-35k EUR in unsecured loans, based on my income and living expenses (the difference is what determines the height of the loan). The legal maximum is 75k, if income is high enough and/or living expenses (mortgage or rent) are low enough.
