This is awesome! I know people are kind of cold to the idea of bitcoin represented as a coin though. Maybe drawings some lines between the coins would help?

I just finished watching this. I am really amazed at the presentation. Talking about the financial system apolitically with impact is a feat. I will be spreading this around.

I'll try to rephrase. Gateways like Bitpay and Coinbase provide fast conversion of funds from BTC to USD and adjusted BTC prices for vendors to give buyers. Ideally a vendor would hold onto their BTC, however a government might encourage them to receive local currency. This relies on the liquidity of USD and BTC provided by these exchanges. If the US shutdown these exchanges or regulated them more, the value a vendor perceives to gain from accepting bitcoin is less, since he also can no longer price goods in USD effectively nor pay taxes. In turn fewer vendors accepting bitcoin, leads to less perceived utility of a bitcoin.

This is great! I hope to talk to you at MIT and interest you in speaking at WPI. The Bitcoin interest is lacking here.

I imagine it will far exceed $10000/BTC by the end of 2014. The primary reason being the number of vendors who accept Bitcoin is doubling roughly every 1 to 1.5 months (combining BitPay and CoinMap estimates).  Thus the utility of a Bitcoin is increasing very quickly. Coinbase is experiencing 30% growth in accounts per month and had 650,000 in October. People are taking notice, and the benefits of Bitcoin are becoming more well known. 
Equally, the effects of the Federal Reserve Quantitative Easing will begin to be noticed as tapering begins this year. Aside from tapering disturbing the markets, the increase in bond money will inflate the value of the dollar, reducing its value.

I highly recommend listening to the original conversation.

My question for Andreas:
Do you think that a bitcoin economy will show preference to governments who tax assets, such as land, rather than transactions, such as payroll and sales tax?

Sorry, I was in a rush to reply. Here are my sources.
**CoinMap numbers (since 2013-11-13):**
**BitPay estimates:**
**CoinBase Estimates:**
**CoinBase Verification:**
He says they had 10k-15k users in January. With 30 percent growth per month we would estimate they have 15000*exp(0.3*10)~=300000 users, which is less than stated, but the same order of magnitude. 30% is probably an average or conservative estimate.
**QE Tapering:**

I originally had some background acknowledging the ease of which taxation could take place. However taxation and pricing in certain countries, like the US for example, needs to occur in a currency backed by the government. This means gateways like Bitpay and Coinbase can possibly reduce the liquidity of exchange and thus utility, which wouldn't be an issue if the vendor was holding bitcoin and paying tax in them.

I started a "Bitcoin Outreach" at my school as well. We have not met yet, but had some preliminary discussions. Some important things addressed were the importance of staying apolitical in discussion and difficulties in conveying the relevance of bitcoin.
I think staying apolitical is easy, but often brought in as a discussion point. Having alternative political ideas often makes bitcoin seem more radical than it really is. That said, most people connect well to the idea of faster and low cost transaction. This is an immediate economic gain. Also the possibilities more participants in the economy will have, i.e. 1 billion banked people and ~6 billion with cellular phone or internet access, strikes a good chord with people.

Thanks for the feedback. Most of my initial distrust for Bitcoin stemmed from the amount of strawman and political arguments that were made in its favor. I use a few talking points besides for the core possibility, my pitch, to encourage people to take a look at bitcoin.
* The value of a bitcoin has increased about 5000% in 2013, and will increase even more as the utility is realized.
* Allowing equal access to economic participation might lift many people out of poverty.
* Transactions are almost instant and have significantly reduced fees over existing methods.
* The value of bitcoin is truly in the amount of merchants accepting it, which seems to be doubling every month and a half.
For the most part I am trying to talk to people middle-aged on Long Island (New York), who for most purposes are doing very well economically and have little political interest.

That is most likely true. BitPay is showing a doubling time of roughly a month and a half which I think is a much more conservative, though still optimistic, estimate.

This looks interesting, but it is 2 hours long. Could you summarize?

Not sure if I should file this on the bug tracker... Also props for open source! [Relevant GitHub Link](
I'm having trouble. First I had some difficulty getting it to accept my phone number. I entered it incorrectly a few times. But after a few more tries I was automatically logged out. Now I cannot log back in.
I was able to register multiple times with the same email which is kind of confusing too. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:12:28
My math says that is a doubling time of 21 days. The powers of exponential growth!

It is the most neutral means of economic exchange in existence today.

Seems to work now. Thanks!
