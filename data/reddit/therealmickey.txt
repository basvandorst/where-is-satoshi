I laugh when people try to make comparisons to the Nasdaq in 1999.

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:37:24
The thing everyone needs to remember is that bitcoin is now being lumped in with any and all financial instruments on planet earth.  So bitcoin will no longer go up or down in a vaccuum, or whether or not early adapters like it; it will likely also trade relative to what other global assets are doing.  Ohhh, world stocks are down?  Shed exposure and buy BTC with the proceeds.  Ohhh, stocks are back up??  Sell my BTC and buy back stocks...  
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:01:50
The Fed will not bail out a hedge fund.  It simply will not happen in this current environment - in fact it's happened only one other time, and that was Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, which was bailed out because all of the major broker dealers on the street had exposure to them via derivatives.  But all the political capital spent bailing out banks in 2008 will prevent another similar event going forward.
I can't find the quote, but in the 70s when currency futures were first going to be cleared by the CME, many scholarly people in the financial community thought it was a silly idea.  That there could not possibly be an utility to hedging currency risk.  Imagine that for a second... 
No, I do not think that bitcoin futures will prove to be harmful to the btc ecosystem.

Bonds are not a store of value, at all.  Not even close to gold in that sense, much less bitcoin.

That is an empty proclamation.  Look at a daily price chart for gold.  If it were acceptable as payment, I promise you no one with a brain would use it.

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:33:58
I disagree.  I think the vast majority of WS players are smart enough to see that there is more upside than downside.  I would not completely discount nefarious thinking such as you mention, but I honestly think that guys either understand it, own it, and want it to go higher or they are just staying away.  The loudmouths you hear on television are krusty old fuxx that are loud but won't take a side with their wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:25:03
I agree with you... the volatility renders it mostly useless as a transactional medium.  But why does gold have value?  Because there is a consensus that it does and supply is limited.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:09:02
The worst part of that is these aholes are typically very hawkish and bitch about the fed "printing money" all the god damn time.  But in the face of some new technology they can't/don't understand and a price move that they have missed completely - it's "well, we've done very well under the fed"

I think there are a couple of strong technical factors that are going to take place...
1. Futures will attract investor interest from large established players - mostly everyone agrees with this
2.  People are going to have that conversation that they had at Thanksgiving dinner and go, OK shit - I really am going to do it this time
3. White collar workers are going to get a 2017 bonus, and be reluctant to plow it into a stock market that is making new highs.  So what to do?  Buy BTC.
Lastly, the black swan event could be looming...trump impeached or similar disaster in the admin; little fat man in NK launches a nuke; etc, etc, etc.
Buy it now.

It's more about acceptance than anything else.  When you have venerable institutions of the financial community with a vested interest in seeing it exist/succeed, that is a good thing.  Forget about the daily price, this is cementing it's long-term viability.

@_date: 2018-03-07 21:12:51
Knee-jerk reaction would likely be a risk-off scenario, ie selling of bitcoin.  But if it's bad enough and the central banks around the world are easing/printing money, then that is bullish for BTC b/c the value should rise against fiat.  This is all theory and perhaps worse, opinion, as for now overall adoption is still too low to follow fundamentally discernable patterns.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:03:37
You are right in that banks have other business lines by which they make money.  But you're forgetting how they make loans...by using depositors' cash.  If deposits are diminished, then so is their ability to loan that cash.

I agree with what you are saying for the most part but we have been in a tightening phase for a while now (at least in the US), and it's been well telegraphed by the Fed.  Just my opinion, but if equities/risk takes a dump here, buying BTC could be a new flight to quality trade that market participants are willing to put on.  On top of that, we know that the tolerance for market losses in developed  markets is low, so if/when this equity dump comes - do we go back to easing?
