That is entirely the point.


No, that is exactly what Bitcoin is against.
If you want government regulated and controlled currency just use $USD like everyone else. You have nothing to gain with Bitcoin.

Stop using government controlled currency and form an alternative currency system. One that undermines any government's attempt to control or regulate it.

With a dating site the general idea is not that you look at a catalog and pick a mate. You have to put yourself out there to others, make a profile and post pictures. Once you do this the anonymous factor goes away. When you can sort people by age and location it is fairly reasonable to expect a friend or co worker of the EX might come across the profile.
I just don't see how you can join a website devoted to sharing personal information about yourself and expect anonymity. If you don't need anonymity then there is little incentive to use Bitcoin.

I think this has been said lots of times before but it is THE major issue facing the adoption of Bitcoins, why should people SPEND Bitcoins? People like to collect them and watch them go up in value but few people want to spend them. No one wants to spend Bitcoins on a dating service when those same Bitcoins could be worth double or triple in a year. It is hard to displace something that sucks even as much as PayPal does if there is no incentive to spend.

I dotn think people will take out a credit card, buy bitcoins, then use bitcoins to pay for a service. When they can just use a credit card direct.
And to be honest, while bitcoin is good for privacy it has no consumer protection for bad merchants like a credit card chargeback.

I would not say they are devoid of valuable services. Just that they offer nothing that can be easily replaced.

Or the systems used by the bitcoin community will get better and more reliable as problems are discovered and fixed. Then once it gets stable late adopters can join in.
