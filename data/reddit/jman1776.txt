Everybody needs to read this post and take this as some of the best "don't invest money you can't lose to afford" advice on this sub. OP seems like he has his head on his shoulders and has finances planned out. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:28:27
Fuck yeah
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:13:21
I honestly like these posters a lot and think they have a cool aesthetic 
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:27:05
Thanks for the advice

That's my plan once I start getting my Army stipend from scholarship. Gonna drop more or less 10% of the $350/month they give me.

USAA is definitely one of the better banks out there. I’ve had it all my life since my grandpa was army, and I’ll have it for as long as I need it (hopefully BTC steps in) after I commission into the army.

Nice one bro

I’ve got the summer job, making minimum wage at a movie theater. Just needed to save to afford fraternity dues and school costs. 
Luckily the Army will be giving me a stipend since I’m on scholarship. Gonna be putting a consistent 10% monthly into BTC
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:07:37
I got it a lot better then you got mine

There are companies that buy OSRS gold from accounts for ~$0.80 per million gp and then flips it to sell for a $1 per million

The membership bundles are cheaper, but a player who is ready to quit can sell their 50 mil bank for a quick $40 on these sites

Thanks for the feedback. Part of the reason we offer our service is to streamline the blockchain and the bitcoin learning curve. A lot of the basic articles from big name websites make it difficult to understand.

Damn man, he wanted criticism not people being assholes
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:28:44
I’m not going to buy one since it’s not practical for me, but you might as well accept BTC! There isn’t any harm to it
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:34:01
I don’t consider myself to be anything too “different” so I’ll go w a creamy chicken mushroom soup. I’m paired well with french bread and cold day. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:42:04
I completely agree, it can make our community look like a bunch of tin foil hat wearing freaks. But only if it’s done aggressively or too much. 
I explained on r/Supreme for instance that using bitcoin instead of PayPal or Venmo for transactions could be worth it since selling clothing and accessories on that market can be very peer to peer. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:57:01
If you are in bitcoin for the price or to get rich instead of establishing a global currency that actually is designed to serve the people, you’re wrong. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:48:08
Good news is there a quite a few, so personal preference is what it really boils down to. Popular ones are Coinbase, Bittrex, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, etc. 
Coinbase is really easy to setup and is very beginner friendly, though people may have their own issues with the company itself and choose not to use them. If that doesn’t matter to you, I’d recommend them. 
Good luck. Shoot me a PM if you need more help or recommendations
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:18:44
I’m going to keep it real with you chief. I don’t think you are going to be able to on your own. You are better off joining a mining pool or working for a company that runs a bitcoin mining farm. 
That or join a cloud mining service- but those are risky and most avoid them entirely bc of a slow payback. I joined one in my early days and got scammed out of $350 when the mining service was hacked. 
If you choose to start trying to mine on your own, you’ll need ASIC mining rig. An Antminer S9 is a modern one but costs at a minimum around $1500. You’ll need software and power for it. And you’ll probably need lots of them to turn any kind of profit worth your time. The electric bill will be pretty high and you’ll need to keep everything cooled off with fans and such. 
I personally don’t mine and never will just because of the difficulty and high barrier to entry.  Maybe someone else can offer more details and insight?

Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:10:17
Perhaps, but I'd argue that gentle pushes towards us couldn't hurt
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:05:18
Definitely not. The computing power necessary to make any kind of profit worth your time would cost thousands of dollars in parts alone, and adding the increased electricity bill for operating it and keeping it cooled would be extremely expensive. 
Mining BTC on a private and personal level is no longer the hobby people made it out to be in the early days w Antminers and old desktops. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:15:29
That’s a possible downside to bitcoin- people have to take responsibility and act as their own banks in this way. Keeping the recover phrase and private key safe is super important, and it is frightening to know some people can’t handle that
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:42:42
Yeah, that would be a better word to use. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:06:21
I’d probably recommend chinese food, but a sub sandwich also is hard to go wrong with unless you go somewhere like Subway. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:34:52
Depends on mempool and how clogged it is. Going to be worse during bull runs and super high volume eras
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:21:54
Yeah you're just a shitty investor. Don't invest money you can't risk to lose. That's probably rule  to bitcoin

Why should Ross be punished? People should have the right to do what they want with their own bodies. He didn’t make any decisions for anyone else. 
Government is afraid of a truly free market. I hope the petition going around actually generates some steam.

Yeah this post is bad and you should feel bad

Can’t say Germany was solely responsible, the treaties and political state entagled with family’s relations across borders was surely a large part of the reason it went as it did in my opinion. 
Cats are weird. Some like stereotypical things and some like Elmer’s glue. The nose thing sounds kinda cool, does it not work or like he straight up has no nose?

I’ll sell them in small amounts in exchange for goods and services- also known as using them as currency
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:16:17
Online exchange is gonna be your best bet

Definitely doesn’t contribute anything to the crypto community because, like other commenters said, most of these ICOs are just there to pump and dump for some quick money for them to use as a resource. 
Having these 1000s of alt coins really can make it both intimidating and confusing for new people- which to choose? How to choose? Why are there so many? Do I need watercoin for my waterbill and taxcoin for my taxes?
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:55:38
Bought sox using bitcoin. Super easy- y’all should take a look
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:37:19
This is frustrating to me, since having banks that store crypto and use it for people is literally the opposite of what Satoshi wanted. It instantly loses credibility as peer to peer this way. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:31:17
I used to be like that for a few months, and kinda just fizzled out of daily checks. Will go a couple days, sometimes weeks w out opening my Exodus wallet. It’ll come naturally 
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:22:49
You’re fucking dumb. Try trolling somewhere else. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:53:12
It has been recommended before that you own 1 whole bitcoin before you start investing into other alt coins. For some people, however, this can be hard to do and can be a bit much to invest- even at the current relatively low price. 
I would recommend that you maintain a strong majority of your crypto in bitcoin, and then a much smaller portion in various altcoins.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:32:38
That’s the coinbase transaction. The mining reward payout is the first transaction of every block and (I think) helps tie the previous block to the new one. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:17:56
I commented the same thing lol
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:53:11
You’re just assuming the user’s crypto experience. You don’t have any facts to back that up. 
You’re very credible.
