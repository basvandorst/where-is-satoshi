For the same reason why it works so well, and the same reason why we all did it and others will do it in the future:
Self interest.
In my case = self interest to get rich quickly with a reasonable  risk/return value proposition (according to my subjective valuation)
For others could be self interest to 'feel' good because they help free the poor and fight the Rotschilds and Rockefellas
And yet for others, because they want to feel loved, by being part of something bigger than themselves.
But the root of all this is the old self interest that make the true capitalism and free markets work so god damn well!!

I don't really buy it, pal.
Too little, too late.
Now let the free markets do their magic by giving you what you deserve now so you can feel the lovely 'invisible hand' of the market teaching you good manners in this Bitcoin jungle.
Live and learn, buddy.

Amateurs. These guys ve been trying to deliver something for like a year but no real value yet. Seems they cannot execute.
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:36:03
Damn! The dream is over now. These guys are f* serious an a real threat to the global financial stability. We are doomed now, time to sell and adhere to their noble policies...

I just did withdraw my last insignificant (0.04) balance from them.
Was a nice ride, ol´fella.
Thanx to you I bought my first BTC, and magic was what I really felt.
I will miss all the obscure sites and codes I had to redeem to get money there.
Sad you were not up to the minimum standards.
Very sad indeed.
Hope some day we'll meet again, it´s up to you now.

Xapos CEO created a bunch of companies Internet and Finance related since the 90's, sold all of them for more than U$D 1BB. When in doubt, Check your premises.

There is nothing inherently wrong about monopolies in a pure free market as this expresses the customers decisions to choose. Except most of the time we tend to see artificial monopolies thanx to corrupted bureacrats govt. officials who  use violence and coercion (masked ad 'the rule of law) to benefit their interest groups who own some privileged companies who later become monopolies without free competition.

That s it guys. Game over for Bitcoin now. Argentina bureaucrats says so and they are f* serious, really. Time to get back to the past and trust our noble central bankers who love us and have as always our best interests in their actions ...
Bizarro world, indeed.

Proof or it didn t happen
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:47:16
Be careful, man. Argentina's central banksters (the most corrupt country in the western world) just issued a statement today saying to be careful with this stuff. So, be careful man. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:46:03
Welcome to the jungle, my friend...
Here with great powers comes great responsibilities.
Here learning to be unconditionally responsible for our own mistakes is a steep painful, though enlightening, journey... 
Here no-one will 'bail you out' socializing the risks you (consciously or unconsciously) decided to take.
Want the red pill? Man up.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:09:39
Nahhh. Price did not move so did not happen.
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:28:38
Argentina: 'A country of good fellas'. Yeah, that s actually the current govt. motto of choice. Stranger than fiction.
 Good thing in this crazy country is that what govt. says, the opposite is always true and what everyone does. So these are good news for BTC as they are, in their corrupted twisted way, endorsing Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:46:02
Money talks.
What´s wrong with that? I mean is the profit motive that drives all of us towards the future.

Feels like the guy is reading this from a screen and being threatened at gun point by Mark and Tibanne the cat (The real mastermind at Mtgox)  .

That will depend on your mental model. If you think bitcoin is like a robust tree (which will keep growing and growing and endure all kind of climatological challenges thrown at it) then your question is similar to ask "Should I plant a tree now?" and you can answer yourself this question. Now, if you don´t know what Bitcoin, capital 'B',  'is' or 'could be' (in your own mental model I mean, because there is not such think as 'reality' in this matrix) then the answer to your question is similar to ask 'if a toss a coin, will it land on head or tails'? And you can go ahead, just toss a coin and then you can predict the price will go up or down based on the result.

Argentinian guy here. Been there. Not so bad, never it is to wake up to the reality. Best thing could happen is to default, pay the price for the party and unmask the illusion. Sadly the ones who pay are not the ones who enjoyed the party... Yeah, That s democracy sadly,  (privatize profits, socialize loses). Only way out is anarchism...Bitcoin will help you get there, for sure.

Facts: 
1- Your mother wants to get into BTC out of the blue
2- Backpage only accepts BTC 
Your mother does some 'business' in Backpage, what could that business be?

With great powers come great responsibilities... Bitcoin gives you the possibility to be your own bank and yet you decided to put ALL your faith in a startup (startup definition = guys who never done that before)? C'mon... As a biz. owner you never put all your eggs in the same basket. So it's 0k to complain about Coinbase and blah, blah, bla (after all they are a startup and using the customers as the guinea pigs while they learn how this new industry should be managed, right?).
BUT it's not 0k for your business to depend on this single point of failure...
No, my friend, YOU HAVE THE POWER NOW.
Please use it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:45:29
Officially now? 
They (and we) were already slaves long, long before from our 'elected benevolent officials' or masters.
Whether some people choose to believe in unicorns, does not mean evils are not out there...
Sad, very sad indeed.
Time to man up.

I've been using their services for about 3 years and good experience so far. And yes, they asked me for id and verification for the source for my U$D when I had to move out some amount from my bank to BTC. Good service, trusted CEO in the SV community and a dozens of U$D MM in VC funding so I don't think they are shady. If you are unwilling to share your personal information and how you obtained the money you transact with them, then it's not a good fit for you. The reason why the need to do this is because they want to stay away of any possible implication with money laundering as they interface with the old banking world

Another explanation for the same story:
Imagine you are a sheep wandering happy thru the sunny Athenas mountains. Imagine you find some nice looking wolves in suits, very well educated (Harvard, Cambridge types.  MBAs and such). Now Imagine those wolves tell you they are good and will always protect you and serve you. And they even pass what they call 'laws' to make you really believe them that you will always be protected.
They even force all people to go to 'schools' where they push into their child minds  some fictitious 'ideas' like patriotism, borders, sovereignity and democracy.
So after those long years being schooled by force, your mind ends up believing these fellas (they are so well dressed after all!! They could not be evil), so you continue wandering happy thru the mountains, trusting these guys (after all they promised you will be safe, right?)
Now one day the wolves investments go wrong (they pushed the limits) and they are are particularly hungry, very VERY HUNGRY.
Imagine they see you there, vulnerable and yummy...so yummy...
Can you imagine the rest?

Cool guy this Wences, he promoted the Argentinian meetups about bitcoin and helped a lot to push bitcoin to this country I happen to live in (the most crazy, corrupted in the world!! 40% inflation / year, capital controls, 6 presidents in one week and sh* like that). For us (people who is slave of the Argentinian political class) bitcoin is the salvation and guys like this Wences guy are true leaders chosen by the free market.
