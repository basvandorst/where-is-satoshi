If I knew how to invest it better, I would.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:17:00
Yeah, what can I actually usefully do with just that much? I know next to nothing about investing or doing business.

It has been bobbing around in the range of a few hundred. It is currently down less than a thousand £ from its peak.

Gone up £30 over the last 2 days, frantically trying to log on to LocalBitcoins.com.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:26
It is up like 32 times on a couple of years ago. People who know what Bitcoin is were already joining back then.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:00:01
Dunno, but you will know when that has happened by the fact that the numbers are no longer getting smaller everyday.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:28
It is only down a few hundred.

Be honest with yourself, the most true part of that list is the playing of video games.

It strikes me as careless to buy when it has only just started to drop - let it get down a bit more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:12:52
Why would you buy now when it is going down? wait till it has stopped going down, then buy.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:24:02
It is plummeting, do not buy until it has stopped plummeting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:54
That makes me feel better about my paltry 12 coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:47
Aaaand... It's down again.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:01:17
Just don't buy when it is dropping, it really is that bloody simple. It is basic common sense that you do not watch it reach astronomical highs and then start buying as it falls from that high.

If the state is the people, then we have no need of a government. Just by acting like people, the people exert their influence.

He celebrates psychotic murderers.

What next? Food free at the point of use? Shelter free at the point of use?

The flaw here is thinking the population is the state. It is not. Whilst the population and the market are inseparable, and if *people* stopped respecting property, accepting currency and upholding good behaviour the market would function less well, it is fallacious to assume that this is necessarily the state, and that without the state all these bad things would happen.
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:23:03
I see. So its a good idea to get some before then, eh?
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:46:43
Good point, thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:35:47
I see. I suppose I should have realised. I thought it just got harder the more were mined continuously, and that the limit could never quite be reached.
@_date: 2015-11-02 12:58:52
What does this mean?
@_date: 2015-11-06 23:44:14
What has a popish plot to do with cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:09:15
I'm afraid I have no idea what 'inflation' refers to in this context.
