Learn how to store them yourself. Its not hard. Only keep/invest what you are willing to lose. Dont keep all your bitcoins in one basket.
Seriously, dont be lazy. There is lots of fun ways to play with your bitcoins and the more you play with them, the more comfortable and secure you will be with storing them.

I've seen one that lowers the fee based on volume, but it starts out at 10%!
I understand there's costs to running a BTM, but there is no way I can justify a 10% fee. I'd rather meet a new bitcoiner and trade personally.

The overhead and isolation of a private blockchain is nothing as absurd as bitcoins 3tps, when a spreadsheet would accomplish the same thing.

Needless to say, I was scared as fuck the whole way. Luckily I made it to my destination without even seeing one cop, but any number of things could have brought my transport to their attention, beyond my control, and caused me to suffer a complete loss. The only thing they could not have taken from me was the bitcoins on my paper wallet and phone.

Right now, its a complete sausage fest, with all the participants offering liquidity, and very few actually mixing coins. Everyone there seems to want to mix, but is waiting for everyone else to take the hit on fees.
I understand that this will change in the future because wallets like electrum and mycelium have expressed interest in using the market, making it easy for nontechnical people to get access to the coins for spend mixing.
Here is the market orderbook: joinmarket.io (so you can see fees and liquidity)

This is a big problem actually. I've talked to people that answer this question with "oh yea, I know what bitcoin is, what the blockchain is, of course", but digging deeper, they don't really know even the highest level what it is.
People do need to be embarrassed into understanding it because it is complex and difficult. That doesn't mean you can or should be a dick about helping them clear up their ignorance. But unless you do publicly ask someone to stick their neck out and tell you what it is, they are going to just cruise along with whatever misconception their casual browsing has lead them to - and spread their version of ignorance to countless other uninformed people along the way.

A private key is simply a very large number. As in, there is a number for every atom in the known universe - that large.
A private key has a corresponding public key that is derived from the private key.
The two keys are mathematically related. 
If you have a message such as "pay joes bitcoin address 5 bitcoins from my address", you can sign that message with your private key. Then, anyone can take the public key associated with the private key and and verify the signature on that message was made by the private key. A valid signature proves that the message has not been changed and that the owner of that private key signed the message.

No they are not equally prohibited. The blocksize cap was put in place as a **TEMPORARY** mitigation against spamming the blockchain. Read the historical discussion. Everyone knew/agreed the limitation was temporary and it didn't change the core values that guided the creation of bitcoin.

Better to have it if you need it, than need it and not have it. It really depends on the situation.
If you carry it in a open holster, then it's a glaring statement that you intend to defend yourself. The chance that they will choose an easier target, before anything bad happens, increases.
If you carry it concealed, then it's infinitely less of a deterrent and will only become an effective means to make him rethink his position AFTER he shows you his. At that point, it can go one of two ways, 1) he starts shooting and you are able to return fire (an option any logical and free individual would chose to have as an option), or 2) [he backs down]( to live another day and perhaps finds a weaker victim.

Chains dont attack each other. People with resources do and the reasons are varied and personal. Game theory says individual chains dont care about the other side of a hard fork. All their available horse power will be applied to the chain they believe in to strengthen it and earn subsidy and tx fees, not tarpit the other at a complete deficit in operations.
Two sustained chains can happen depending on the veracity of the proponents. If all the TBTF banks forked bitcoin into some dystopian nightmare, you can bet people will continue to support the original chains protocol and hash power and the TBTF fucks would continue to create their own mess.

There are lots of things you can do to gain an advantage. Each one depends on the circumstances. Maybe its shouting real loud as you draw. Maybe I just grab the slide or cylinder so it can't fire and wrestle him for it (your scenario was up close). Even a sweep with your hand to get the muzzle off you might be enough to draw in time. Or lock his up like I described so it can't shoot while I'm drawing mine. I don't know. But I'll take my chances and my surviving into my own hands, not leave it in his.


I carry a combat handgun. It doesn't have a safety. Pull it out, shoot. There are safety features that prevent the firearm from misfiring if dropped etc.


There is no aiming at close range. It's all center of mass. It's very easy to learn (but it does require practice), just like closing your eyes and being able to touch your nose. It's a learned muscle movement. 


I'm betting that I train more than an attacker does, and consider the scenarios much more in my head than an attacker does. Not having to think about it when it happens give you an extreme advantage. In high stress situations, trained people often don't remember reacting at all. Their brain just does what they were trained to do.
And ultimately, I choose the option that grants me, at minimum take him with me, or give him something to remember me forever.

Here's the thing... if it takes bitcoin another 20 years to get to a trillion dollar marketcap, thats $74,000. 20 years is 240 months. For bitcoin to get to $74000 in that time frame, it would have to increase, from today's price of $230, over $300 a month for 240 months straight. If bitcoin "works" to that level, its goins to be nothing short of a violently wild ride in the marketplace.

If bitcoin takes over 1 trillion dollars from the global economy, it will have to be upwards of 50k-80k per bitcoin, depending on where it happens in the inflation cycle. if that happens in 10 years, then bitcoin must increase 5000 to 8000 per year (on average) to meet that target.

You're only an accomplice if you have knowledge they will do something illegal and you contributed to their actions by giving them bitcoin.
The difference in the case between cash and bitcoin is traceability. It's plausible that if someone does do something bad with bitcoin that comes from you, you may be questioned about your involvement. But if you weren't aiding with intent to conspire, you're "safe".
If you simply exchange "bitcoin" with "cash" or "gold" or any other commodity, you'll find that there really isn't any difference regarding the legality of ownership and transfer. If you can do X with cash, you are going to be able to do X with bitcoin without any legal issues.

Do you think this is a developer forum or something? Not everyone has the ability to write code or create some kind of service ontop of the protocol. Plenty of people can see where this is going without that technical expertise and be excited about it. If you don't like the circlejerk here, then by all means, join the one going on over at and use your powers of sociopathy to make fun of people you have no compassion for.


This doesn't kill bitcoin. "They" copy it and do something else with it while Bitcoin remains what it always was.


So you actually think that $3 billion dollars in the bitcoin market is enough to satisfy a global economy? Bitcoin will have nothing but massive price swings until it is a massively used currency. There is no other way.

The block size change does not conflict with bitcoins founding principles, therefore, it can be changed and still be called bitcoin (some evolution was/is expected). Changing the number of bitcoins, without equally compensating the divisibilty, is a forbidden change.

They can make all their own blockchains in their own image all they want. Nobody is saying that isn't a possibility. No "alt"coin can destroy bitcoin - which is what you are suggesting. Bitcoin won't replace any fiat and no fiat/altcoin/govcoin will eliminate bitcoin. All of them will compete on their own merits. For me, there is no alt/gov coin that i can even imagine i would syupport while bitcoin exists given its current proprties. Go ahead and do your alt/gove coin, see where it goes, and the rest of us in and those who have yet to learn about this project will stick to the system we believe is better.


Crime only reinforces bitcoin's utility - How many criminals have you heard of that lets you pay for his illicit goods/services with monopoly money? **Fucking NONE**, that's how many. Criminals ONLY use good money that contributes to their real, measurable wealth.


Do you even know what premine means bro? It is mathematically provable that Satoshi did not start mining before anyone else, in fact, he informed everyone months in advance that the project was going live and invited participation.


No, its not. pools are made up of individual miners that can move away from a pool with too much control - as was recently demonstrated.

The most legitigate chain is not based on length. Both sides of a disconnect will continue to try to create blocks with a 10 minute target. The deciding factor is not which one was lucky enough to speed through one or two extra blocks during the disconnect. The deciding factor is a chain's aggregate difficulty, which is a factor of the work being done (i.e. computing power).

OP_MUL could get consensus because it was a fatal bug.

Bitcoin private keys are simply integers in a large finite field. You could search through it and find a public address with money in it and spend them, but its not probable.

Imagine a private key for every atom in the universe and only a couple million of them, randomly spread out across the universe, have something worth taking.

Bitcoin, like gold, does not require any sort of backing. They both have properties of good money, which give them value: fungibility, scarcity, durability, etc.
"Backing" is something an otherwise worthless thing requires for it to have value. That is, paper with some numbers printed on it is otherwise worthless, so it needs to be backed by men with guns or something naturally valuable like gold, silver, and now, bitcoin.

The blockchain cant exist without the currency it generates. You cant have any of the "wonderful benefits" of the blockchain and the currency it generates be a failure in any measure.
And a million bitcoins "showing up" doesn't kill bitcoin. The protocol knows they are there and will allow them to be forwarded to another account. That is how the system works. The market may not like it but some will. The market and prtocol was working just fine at sub $0.06 6 years ago. Someone dumping a lot of coins just means someone else is buying them, most likely many other people, and not just another single buyer. Now where is your critisism? No one single person owns a million coins anymore and they have been distributed to several (hundreds, thousands?) others. Oh look the market is much more distributed now.

1000 bits is way more than enough for people to play around with each other during/after the presentation, but hardly enough to be useful beyond that (purchases, etc). What i suggest is giving one person $12 or so for giving the best summary of your presentation and ask them to make a purchase (starbucks?) before they leave and let everyone watch. and give everyone else 1000 bits or so. Also, consider asking every one to give you a dollar or their pocket change and give them an equivalent in bits.

The second they do that, it will have already failed because they will have tried to centralize the ledger or they will premine the currency (which detroys ~~all~~ 99.99% the benefits that bitcoin affords). If its not premined and does have a centralized ledger, then why redevelop all existing software and services to this new coin when perfectly good infrastructure already exists in bitcoin. Their problem is their coin has no value proposition to anyone. And even if some company or consortium did try this, it only becomes a competitor - not a destroyer of bitcoin.

Yeah, imo, spending from an exchange account is very bad form. You should only be in an exchange for the purpose of buying selling and move out to a regular wallet immediately when you are done. Spending from your exchange account introduces many failure points for a variety of situations (refunds, failure to send in time, exact amounts, etc).

Owning bitcoin and owning gold is essentially the same.
If someone runs a metal detector over your back yard and digs up your gold and spends it, its theft. Its the same for bitcoin and hiding them in a large field of finite integers.
And if you happen to find that integer with lots of bitcoins, knowing they are not yours, and spend them, you're a theif. It gets more of a moral question the longer the coins have been there, but morally, you're still responsible for doing due dilligence to find the owner before you "steal" them.

You are misusing the term authority. In the context of fiat, authority means by rule of law. In the context of Satoshi, authority only means expert. An expert can only advise. An authority commands.
Only an authority can force something worthless to have value, like a paper note with numbers.
The value of gold, silver, and now bitcoin, are granted value by voluntary consensus, not by any authoritys decree.

Consensus. Do you ever recall hearing an authority demand under penalty that people run satoshi's code? Nobody had to force the early adopters because they voluntarily saw the benefits.


Because people saw the financial windfall of creating shitcoins and being the first to have them before the pump.


It could be argued that they are not held by voluntary consensus, but by necessity to pay taxes, avoid other complicated tax matters like capital gains, AND the hidden fact that they are not backed by anything of real value - only the threat of violence for not using them (iraq, libya).
If, as an authority, I declare that this paper note is fully redeemable at any national bank for a specific weight in silver, and then over generations, subtly remove that promise of redemption, do you really, honestly think that its fair and accurate to say the currency holds value due to voluntary consensus? When the value of that money has been stolen right out from underneath its holders?

@_date: 2015-07-27 05:34:32
Mining is the act of processing other peoples transactions, verifying they have the funds and authority to spend them, and move the funds. For doing this work, they receive the tx fee and new monetary inflation (they are actually creating the currency by mining).
Programmers can and make new crypto currencies all the time, but they are all incompatible with each other. Because the system is decentralized, anyone trying to create bitcoins outside of what the protocol allows, everyone just ignores their invalid transactions and work they did trying it.

I'm sorry for DPR's loss, but I don't keep my bitcoins unencrypted on an online computer. If you do it right, your bitcoins can't be seized.
Using a payment processor is not the end game for bitcoin, but direct exchange with merchants and other individuals. Bitcoin is censorship proof in that nobody can stop a person-to-person transaction. If some miner in the US wants to ignore my transaction, another miner in another country, or even myself, has the possibility to route around that censorship and mine that transaction into a block and it must be accepted by everyone else. Also, there is nothing that can stop me from speaking a private key to another individual and give them access to those funds.

In the interest of international trade, multiple national currencies are inefficient. Governments constantly inflate their currencies to have a better trade stance, exchanging for trade involves middlemen and costs.
A one world currency, that all can trust to not be inflated by anyone else makes global trade more efficient than anything we've ever had in human history.

The only private way to use paper keys is to use many of them. Each month when I give myself bitcoins to spend, I print out about 10 of them and fund each one with a random percentage amount of coins. If my total discretionary spending is $100 for the month and I have 10 keys, one gets 2btc, another 3, another 1.5, etc. 
This way, not one person knows exactly how much you have available to you.
You can scale the QR codes down pretty small if you're handy with gimp so it's convenient to store all of them on a smallish piece of a paper. PROTIP: **MAKE AT LEAST TWO COPIES**, one encrypted and one not. Keep the unencrypted one at home and the encrypted one in your physical wallet.

Centralization is a certainty of any crypto due to the issue of variance. With PoS, there is a worse incentive for people to give their coins to a central authority to increase the pools variance in return for interest or dividends - the bad part being you lose control of your coins. Further, PoS requires keys to be unencrypted online (in ram at least) to sign mined blocks. 
You might be able to temporarily hijack asic gear, but you can't steal the mining gear itself, unlike online PoS coins.

I spoke with the owners a bit. Their initial plan is mining, which everyone knows is a loser, which turned me off a bit. Their future planned offerings involved deploying a merchant payment processing system to everyone in their network. This was the most exciting to me because they could then afford to use the processing fees to pay sales people to push it and set it up. They were trying to work with BitPay at one point to get a white label deal with them, but I don't know what happened with that. I think their desire was to be their own bitpay and keep it all inhouse.
Another downer was that they wanted to create their own altcoin for in-network purposes/promotion.

if you want to pay me off the blockchain, you would sign a post dated transaction, but not broadcast it - only give it to me so that i could broadcast it later. While its off the block, both of us could renegotiate the amounts and reduce the postdate until the postdate has one more day to live or the amount is zero. at that point, or any point really, i could broadcast the signed transaction to receive the value and have it recorded in the blockchain.

The literal definition of fiat is "let it be". The only meaningful context is as a command of a authority. It makes no sence if anyone can make such a declaration, otherwise the planet earth is fiat because I say so.
paper money is fiat because if an authority didnt say "let it have value", nobody would ever consider it to have value. 
Things like gold, silver, and now bitcoin have value from voluntary consensus, not an authorituve decree. Therefore, they are not fiat, by definition.

The term fiat has nothing to do with whether the thing is physical or not. And you have a deep misunderstanding of what backing means.
Backing is a promise that if nothing else, this this will be worth this other thing. Dollars use to be backed my the promise you could exchange it for a weight in silver.
There is nothing backing gold, silver, and bitcoin other than the physical and mathematical properties that make them good money.

The threat is handled by consensus. If a bug is introduced into a different piece of software that emulates the protocol and causes it to process blocks in an incompatible way, then everyone has to re evaluate how they are processing and decide on their own what is right. If they feel they are right, they do nothing. if they feel they are wrong, then they fix the bug. If there is not 100% agreement, then a new protocol, and incompatible accounting legders, are born and must survive the ecosystem on their own merit.

If you come to with an inquisitive mind, you will be greeted with open arms, comradery, and insightful knowledge. ESPECIALLY with a zero day account and/or no post history.
If you come to with tired arguments and misconceptions that have been addressed ad nauseum and you fail at using the search function, or you just have a generally negative nancy posture, then, yes, you are going to get treated like a common butter and disrespected. Deal with it.
All the anti-social behaviour here in was seeded from trolling. All of it.

You are not even "relying on the efforts of others" in a bitcoin transaction, especially if you are "wastefully" CPU mining as if everyone else stopped mining, you would be fully capable of processing your own transaction.

Buttercups rarely get anything right.
In reality, there are two forms of inflation: Monetary in/deflation are changes to the monetary base, and Price in/deflation is the result of differences in supply and demand of traded pairs. 
That is, when bitcoin subsidy ends and farmers produce too many tulips, then what you have is price deflation.
When tulip production is stable, and bitcoin continues its subsidy for miners, you have monetary inflation which causes price inflation.

Im thinking of a way to use this to combine an infamous old internet thing and tipping for more personal/trusting social networks.
Basically, it is the old chain emails we use to get that dared you to forward some crazy myth or topic to at least 10 people, and tipping. The idea is to send $10 money packet to 1 of your friends, dare them to claim $1 and pass it on to one of their friends. Part of the chain letter could be info about bitcoin and an additional dare to add more funds each time it gets relayed and everyone could follow the history of the tips claimed and donated to the moneypack address in the blockchain.
Thoughts, additions, changes?
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:15:59
The key point you are missing is the details of the outcome. If I take the bitcoin code and change it so the subsidy is 51 bitcoins instead of 50, everyone running the regular code will not recognize my chain that is giving out 51 bitcoins. My protocol is still valid and operates as expected BY ME. Bitcoin and MyCoin are now operating side by side and completely accurate in their own contexts but different.
The same thing applies to a bug between an implementation of bitcoin core and bitcoin.
If the bitcoin developer doesn't fix the bug, then a fork in the blockchain occurs. They both continue to operate as if they are correct and two incompatible networks arise. The only way to "fix" the problem is for one of them to get back in alignment with the other. This will almost certainly result in the "wrong" side rolling back their blockchain tovwhere the blocks diverged and pick up with the new code/bug fix.

False, the IRS will put you in a cage if you do otherwise.


They have value due to their properties of good money PLUS their usefulness. Its a additive function. Just because you can't eat a bitcoin or stuff it in a cavity doesn't mean it doesn't have the properties of good money.

Confirmations happen about once every 10 minutes.
Some merchants accept zero confirmation transactions, some don't.
The reason they wait is to prevent you from double spending your money to back to your own wallet. It's not a likely event, but its they only protection the merchant has. With a credit card, the merchant is actually waiting 3-4 months to find out if the transaction confirms because the processor can claw it back under certain circumstances.

Consider the case of using a shared wallet. When you spend, the address you spend from is not the address you received at.

And how long did that dip to $152 last? I believe it was measured in minutes. amirite? Dumps don't count in my statement. The context is a sustained double digit price over a substantial period of time - that is, not a dump and immediate market recovery. We will never see double digits, in that context, ever again.
Example: When the first mtgox theft happened, and the hacker dumped the price to $0.01 in order to get the maximum amount of bitcoins under the daily withdraw limit, it was not a "true" market price.
