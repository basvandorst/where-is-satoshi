 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean by sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

I have two things I would like to share with you. The first is why bitcoin is unable to be the currency you want it to be... at least not before the price of bitcoin reaches infinity. The reason can be found in a monetary principle called Gresham's law. It states that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two forms of money in circulation the more valuable money will disappear from circulation. Think two different types of dimes but one actually being pure silver and another being base metals. The silver dimes will disappear from circulation while the base metal dimes will be spent. Obviously as long as bitcoin is a deflationary currency while inflationary currencies exist, bitcoin will *always* disappear from the market. Fiat will always be preferable to spend.

That depends on the level on analysis.
Consider one specific match of football and only that one specific match. If you want to win that match you should do absolutely everything you can to win. Pretty simple. Nothing else to really think about since it a low resolution view of the world.
Now consider one specific match of football in the context of the game of football matches. Suddenly you should *not* do absolutely everything to win that one specific match. Maybe you...
* should be a little more careful so yourself, other teammates, and opposing teammates aren't harmed. If you get injured you might never play again.
* should not cheat or at least take significantly less risk to do so. After all, eventually you will get caught.
* should optimize the team for more wins overall at the cost of a specific match. Your weaker team mates can get more experience for more wins later.
If your level of analysis is just the ~~match~~ war between bitcoin and some specific shitcoin called bcash, then you should do absolutely everything you can to destroy bcash. It is pretty simple really. Not only don't help secure their code but also consider exploiting their vulnerability. Why not. It is obviously the correct thing to do.
Now consider a level of analysis not between bitcoin and one specific shitcoin but between bitcoin and all shitcoins. Now what about a level of analysis of bitcoin against not just other shitcoins but *all* other threats like software bugs, state actors, changes to technology, etc. But wait. What about a level of analysis where you consider bitcoin not only against all threats but all threats that currently exist and those that will ever exist.
If you are at that level you don't really care that much about the shitcoin of the day and you engage in things that are good across time such as trying to make all software more secure and foster an environment where developers are encouraged to help one another.

I think he currently runs in circles that is semi-anti bitcoin by way of "alternatives" to bitcoin. His show site links to bitcoin,com and I think he has close connections to the founder of cop block which is one of the big dash players. It would not surprise me if he still referred to Ver as Bitcoin Jesus.
Regardless, I know in the long run he would be happy for bitcoin to completely disable or greatly disrupt involuntary state funding and also stop the inflationary theft used to fund essentially all war. Good to find common ground.

False. Price of a good is always historical. A good not being traded for a time does not reset the price to zero. On the contrary, generally the lack of trade of precious things indicates the thing is too valuable and the price rises. Think of authentic Renaissance art, such as a painting, being bought and sold very infrequently.
Of course this entire conversation is mighty silly because we don't live in a world you are describing. You can neither buy all the bitcoins nor prevent others from not selling theirs lol.


If I ask you what the price of a gallon of milk is you're instinctively gonna say, in your mind, well whatever the seller lists on the bottom of the shelf where the gallons of milk are. That's the price, right? That's actually not the price.

* Your phrase "the odds have turned" describes gross malinvestment into counterfeit bitcoin.
* "Crypto market cap" is a less than useful indicator of Bitcoin's long term value. Be wary of people using it.
* If you want to obtain something undervalued at the present and transport it into the future when it will be valued much higher, you exclusively buy bitcoin. If you want to try to outscam others for short term gains at other's expense you buy altcoins such as bcash. That and make posts like the one I am replying to.

I was somewhat rude earlier. Perhaps I can comment on that. After all I do want peace and prosperity for all humans and/or cats.
Having an open dialog is always essential to peace. When communication breaks down the only interactions possible are hostile[1]. You cannot have a conversation with someone if you both cannot agree on the fundamentals. We disagree not just on facts but also about the state of being actual or real. Practically speaking, that is identical to lying or insanity from each other's perspective.
I have already very clearly corrected you with cold evidence yet here we are. You say you were there but so was I. What you call "economic majority" I call 7 men, their companies, and their enduring quest to break Bitcoin's consensus. What I call "economic majority" you call ... well nothing; You don't recognize it as existing in spite of watching it act front of your very eyes. You say you want to "agree to disagree" but you had no interest in that when you saw Luke Dashjr's post. You want others to believe you.
Your "disagreement" isn't welcome in a similar manner that a Bitconnect scammer's "disagreement" isn't welcome. Perhaps one day we can share the same ground. Until then I would show you do the door if I could.
[1]If Diversity + Proximity = War then peace is still possible with enough distance even if communication is lost. I think.

1. Luke did not need to provide "a source". It is not contested that businesses supported the BIP148 UASF yet...
2. You claimed otherwise and did not provide a source on your extraordinary claim. If you do not know something you should not assert your ignorance and ask for others to prove you wrong. Furthermore...
3. Upon being obviously and simply corrected you unsuccessfully tried to push your lie. again.
Many businesses were in fact explicitly on-board with BIP148. Publicly. Major businesses. Including exchanges. Months before the UASF. Anymore goalposts to shift? Any more baseless lies to push?
uasf.co literally hands you all this information on a silver platter. For example, Bittylicious was a UK exchange [started in 2013]( and publicly supported the UASF [in April 2017]( That is a major company and an exchange. Bitrefill publicly supported the UASF [in April 2017]( Also a major company and exchange. They are literally in 160 different countries with contracts with hundreds of companies.

Actions have consequences and a reputation is one of the most valuable currencies we work for but is owned by others. Having said all that, I always try to take the Christian approach of forgiveness and humility when it comes to interaction with others.
I don't follow any bcash drama or anything recent to BitcoinABC or you. I know you were essentially the only developer that made bcash happen last year. I do find it slightly amusing to discover the people who forced a change without consensus are having issues with people trying to force a change without consensus. Perhaps that has given you pause to consider your actions.
Either way I can tell you that *if* you come to the conclusion you may have been deeply wrong and wish to rejoin others here or else where then do not fall into the trap of having to repeatedly apologize for your past self.

You are saying there should be a "free market" on the blocksize, a thing that the people who can change it are different than the people who incur the costs of it. Is there anything else you would to put to a free market? Perhaps a free market on the how many Bitcoins can be in existence? But only let one part of the community (i.e. miners) decide it of course.

This may blow the circuits of your mind but some of us (me) wanted SegWit but with the blocksize initially halved to keep capacity the same. Later in a few patches the blocksize could be increased back to 1MB if necessary. That was my biggest issue with SegWit but was willing to live with it because of the malleability fix it provided.

I do *NOT* choose to incur ever centralizing miners being able to set the blocksize to whatever. People that support BU are the ones choosing that. I am choosing soft forks and immutable rules.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:13:53


This looks right to me.


This does not look quite right. Security encompasses many things. Right now there is a significant amount of electricity that goes toward distributing. Even with China rattling it's saber right now, all nation states would have a difficult time attacking Bitcoin in part because of the miners. If there wasn't 17000 Terrahashes/sec or whatever doing this work the distribution could quite easily attacked by nation states. They could interfere with the distribution and your node would be none the wiser. The 51% attacks would be the norm.
Miners help secure the network.

@_date: 2017-03-24 14:50:47


I sort of agree but there is a significant distinction necessary. There is the free market and then there is the protocol/code itself. The code that we decide to run has many rules/parameters that are irrelevant to the concept of markets. Does the code on my full node take into consideration supply and demand when a miner presents me an invalid block? Certainly not. The parameters set by the code are immutable. The code that has all the right parameters as chosen by "the free market" could wiggle a bit before I just get out of Bitcoin.
What was doing in conflating these two things with a bonus of using emotional language. I have seen quite a few libertarians and the like in here and they just might be more easily blinded because the ~~government agent~~ user was speaking in their language but twisting the application ever so subtly. Also because they are autistic. =)

a user calls the bitcoin community a safe space. "safe space" is a very loaded word and has a very nasty meaning to some. Others not so much.
A user calls AA a SJW, something that some of us really don't like. Assuming it is even true (I don't know or care) it is not relevant. I would also like to point out that to some people the use of words like degenerate and the word that rhymes with maggot are actually a very positive thing to quite a few people. For example If you are hard core free speech type then these words might be apart of your lexicon for that reason alone. You see the language you like and associate yourself with it. Either way it is dividing the community along lines it does not need to divide. Let us focus on what unites us: Bitcoin. Let us be as a bundle of sticks. Alone we are weak but together strong! Ok maybe too far with that last bit =)
Some of the magic of language (and a defense against propaganda) can be found via this wiki article. Essentially there is a carefully constructed layer around everything and and you (generally) have to be aware of this layer and how to get under it to have meaningful conversations. My personal favorites emotive conjugations are:
1. Russia has spy planes. The USAF has surveillence platforms.
2. That's not a man down there, it's an objective, target, or MAM.
3. Objectives don't have wives. They have feathers.
4. Targets don't have kids. They have chargers.
5. IED facilitators don't have homes. They have bed down locations.
When you get people to think using the language you want, you get them do things they may have not done otherwise. That guy might have needed to die just outside his home while his wife and kids watch but perhaps it should be done calling it was it was instead of something like " Target neutralized 40m west of bed down location one feather and 2 chargers incoming." Idk if this is helpful or relevant though.

It's own politics, yes. Outside politics not so much. I hold very strong (non-bitcoin) political views but I don't think I have ever stated them or even hinted at them in this sub. I would expect others who care about bitcoin to do the same. It is respect for the topic of the subreddit (i.e. bitcoin).
Having said this you occasionally see some libertarian or AnCap stuff here but this is vastly different than say Trump love/hate, feminism, gender issues, nazi-stuff, anti-nazi stuff, cop love/hate, race stuff, Social Justice, etc. I really, really don't want to see this on bitcoin.

2MB, 4MB, 8GB, 16TB are all examples of limits. BU unlimited, by its definition is unlimited. BU supporters can think of any such limits they want in their heads but they are not actually supporting them.
Also there are some fundamentals that BU changes. For example, right now it seems the prevailing thought is that miners call the shots. Like if most miners wanted a 2MB blocksize they could just make it happen. Thankfully this prevailing thought is false. The economic majority of the nodes is what actually decide things. Miners make the guesses and the economic majority of the nodes either punishes or rewards those miners guesses. With BU the prevailing thought becomes reality with miners actually making decisions with nodes just along for the ride.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:02:52










And 's reply how the costs of keeping the sacred blockchain are incurred by the users and thus miners deciding how big it is with a "pure free market" adjustable block size would create externalities. I further pointed out the absurdity of trying to make more sacred parts and rules of Bitcoin "free market" like destroying scarcity. The burden of the size of a block isn't carried by the miner who produces it but by all nodes in the network.

Ya know what I like about SegWit? Here's a few things off the top of my head.
1. Soft fork. I don't have to use it or even care about it. My older node will still work.
2. It is well written code, reviewed by many, over a long period of time.
3. It fixes malleability.
4. It was introduced in a cautious, inclusive, and most agreeable method.
5. It doesn't seem to effect me being able to run a full node in the future much. What it does effect is clearly defined and not variable.
6. Miners will make more shekels since more tx can be processed.
Ya know what I don't like about BU? Here's a few things off the top of my head.
1. Hard Fork. I have to decide to use or not. My older node will not work.
2. It is poorly written code, reviewed by few, quickly thrust upon us. If you must use the insulting "kludgy" then use it here.
3. It fails to fixes malleability. Might make it worse actually.
4. It was introduced in a reckless, exclusive, and most disagreeable method.
5. It creates incentives and increases possibilities of me not being able to run a full node. The blocksize becomes highly variable.
6. Who the heck knows what will happen but miners are now extremely distrusted employees of mine. I would be tempted to fire them all, sacrificing the immutability they provide by turning all full nodes back into the original nodes (i.e. miners as well).
EDIT: Also for the record I don't want the block size to increase at all. I would be quite pleased if it was still 1MB in 2025. I would also be a lot happier about SegWit if it halved the blocksize to something like 512KB or something.

Also miners can only generate so many coins at a decreasing value... and nobody is allowed to vote on this. Seriously. How are we not leaving this to the miners to decide. They are the ones mining they should be able to decide. We should allow consensus to emerge through mining in the way it was originally meant to happen. ^/s

One of the arguments against bitcoin from gold bugs such as Peter Schiff is the stuff inside bitcoin might be scarce but cryptocurrencies are not. There are infinitely reproducible and thus not scarce and thus not valuable in any way like gold. Even if there were only one cryptocurrency in the space doing one job then it might not be bitcoin like how friendster and myspace are not the major social media platform anymore.
Anyhow, viewing it like this means that LTC isn't a companion but something to snuff out. If just bitcoin then 21million coins. With others the number rises. I don't exactly see it like this but some do. I think it is possible to have multiple blockchains that do certain things and LTC is one of three altcoins I don't completely distrust, ETC and dogecoin being another. ETC because it is an honest currency and dogecoin because doge is love and no distrust love.

This sounds fascinating and would to read up on on it. I would say what you linked was a good read but you didn't source anything. I did some digging though and it turns out Roy Seabag, the CEO of GoldMoney was a fan of bitcoin but according to Forbes:




On his twitter is he is all pro bcash / anti bitcoin. I say pro bcash but he doesn't actually promote it, only promote it in a manner to mock bitcoin. He speaks about the absurdity of bitcoin going to fork again.


I did not find anything indicating that his company kept any of the bitcoin, but is plausible enough I suppose. You would think there would be some press about it though. Most companies convert directly and do not hold so it would follow that goldmoney does the same. Who knows.

@_date: 2017-08-26 23:41:33
The reasons they say this are likely technical. (yes I realize you are being silly if I understand you correctly) With hard forks, the previously invalid becomes valid while with softforks the previously valid becomes invalid.
When applying this to blocksizes you will notice that any increase to 1MB, even a byte, **makes the entire block invalid to all participants** except those running new code and thus creating a hard fork. Meanwhile any decrease to the blocksize **will be automatically accepted by all** the participants regardless of what previous version of software they are all running.
The dusty node setup by some dude for a small business doesn't break with a soft fork to 500kb. The business owner doesn't need to call someone to repair his bitcoin. He doesn't need to know anything changed at all. It just keeps working.

Just because your body can handle a certain amount of poison over time does not mean you should force it to endure it.

This is false. Peter has stated repeatedly that his "acceptance" of bitcoin merely converts it to dollars and he at no point actually holds bitcoin. Any bitcoin transaction you use to buy gold with him will show that he is not holding anything. He uses this as one of his talking points against bitcoin. Furthermore you are confusing Goldmoney with his gold company. Goldmoney is like a checking account where the "currency" is actually gold instead of dollars and you can use your prepaid MasterCard that is backed by gold. This has nothing to do with bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency.
Source: I am a customer of his, a long time viewer of his YouTuve, and admirer of him,his father, and their combined honesty.
EDIT: It turns out the CEO of GoldMoney actually hodls/held huge amounts of bitcoin he gained from people buying gold with bitcoin and he has bought the r btc cool-aid about bitcoin's doom. He sold a bunch last June (prob part of why bitcoin went down to $1900) and is very upset about the possibility of hard forks being a thing with bitcoin. Him and Peter must have some interesting conversations.

Firstly, thanks for the civil reply. There never is enough of that, so good on ya. One of my favorite quotes from Dr. Jordan Peterson is "What do you call someone can you can't talk to? Your enemy." Having said this, I am not interested in dialog. I have long since stopped trying to communicate with certain groups of bitcoiners. I am not tying to convince them. I am not trying to learn from them. I am not trying to understand their position. I present basic information that might rescue someone but I basically don't care anymore. Mostly I engage only for kicks and to help organize my thoughts.
So the purpose of non-mining nodes is the heart of our disagreement or what I would call misunderstanding to be less forgiving. Some may say people hold ideas but I like to think ideas hold people. Some ideas I have noticed seem to all live in roughly the same people. These include:
* The current limits imposed are a problem and it should be fixed yesterday
* non-mining nodes don't do anything
* miners decide protocol upgrades
* core is this massive problem
If I knew how to dislodge these things from people very simply, my name would be renown in the bitcoin space for decades. The linked article seems to be the best possible way of explaining this but clearly it did not work for you. What really stuns me is how you could possibly still be using bitcoin or even be in the space if you thought you had to trust miners. The whole point of bitcoin is trustlessness. The reason people are using extremely expensive networks is so they can be certain the rules are followed. Think about if every single facebook user had to keep a copy of every other facebook user's stuff. Or with youtube. That would be a very expensive social media platform. But this is exactly what we have with bitcoin. If you can't verify the blockchain yourself then you might as well use a centralized server at 1/10000th of the cost. I am not interested in playing a game of seeing just how big blocks bitcoin can take before it breaks. I have done my moral duty of forcing miners to upgrade via BIP148 (an increase in throughput).
Now, yes, sure there are some free riders that will benefit from those of us actually runing a node. I am completely fine with that. If they wish to make bitcoin not trustless for them they are welcome to it. What is completely unacceptable is me being unable to run a node. I don't expect you to understand but I do expect you to be repeatedly beaten into submission by the code run by those who understand how bitcoin works. For years people have tried various stunts but my node checks blocks like a careful goldsmith checks for fool's good. You don't need to understand why this matters and do hope one day you can find some altcoin you can call home and have at least some sort of success.

On one hand, doing time is almost always a black mark on one's reputation and says a decent amount about a person (teaching an old dog new tricks aint easy) without ever needing to know at thing. You don't need to understand time preference, demographics, culture, whatever. You just know such and such was convicted of such and such. The world is hard enough to sort people out.
On the other hand people should be given a second chance. It is literally the Christian thing to do. He did his time. Let us welcome and reintegrate him back into society as best as possible. With the US courts being what they are today, being in the slammer means less and less too. That is the downside of man made laws drifting away from natural law. Let's put aside reputation and consider the merits of individual actions.

umm what? You can't periodically delete everything to solve a problem and then claim nothing changes and the blockchain history is still immutable. Bitcoin's blockchain history should be immutable. If you go back and change a blockchain's history then it is not [immutable]( Making the entire blockchain only a few GB is changing the blockchain history. Deleting something from the blockchain is changing the blockchain history. You can't have your cake and eat it too as the saying goes. Perhaps you are talking about how clients interact with the blockchain?
There is a difference between how some software/clients interact with a blockchain, the blockchain itself, and the protocol/network.
1. The blockchain should be immutable. If Bitcoin's blockchain could be altered then Bitcoin would lose quite a bit of value. The altering of a blockchain's history is the thing that destroys the meaning of a blockchain. Is it even a blockchain at that point?
2. Thanks to core, some clients can interact with Bitcoin's blockchain in a manner such they only need a few GB to operate. For example there SPV mining or node pruning. The blockchain remains intact regardless of the software used.
3. Then there is the protocol/network. In order for bitcoin to continue to maintain certain properties, certain properties must be maintained. If the entire network or too large of a percent of the network was running pruned clients then the network would fail. Pruning only works after you download the entire blockchain, a cost applied to those not pruning. You require the entire thing to determine what you don't need. Furthermore even with nodes to download from, the who of these nodes can change the network. A network where the average Joe being able to verify the [rules]( is vastly different than a network where the average Joe is unable to verify the rules. One is Bitcoin and the other is nightmare superstate I would hate to live under. We need to be careful about continuing to shift the costs onto the average Joe who wants to run a full node. A node used to mean a miner and now it means someone who doesn't mine and doesn't keep the blockchain. We need to be more careful more than ever because full nodes are essentially the [only]( thing keeping bitcoin (the protocol or network) what it is.

For starters, I don't think it is possible. Men and women are very different creatures with different temperaments and stuff. If women tend to focus on more on people while men more on things and ideas then it follows that there will be more male engineers, politicians, etc. and female nurses, veterinarians, etc. It turns out reality aligns. Focusing on getting an equal outcome seems at best a fool's errand and at worst a very malicious thing. Remember that communism was all about equal outcomes. Focus on freedom and don't be resentful of the outcome.
Secondly, it just strikes me as the [PC Game]( a Marxist pastime:
1. Identify an area of human activity.
2. Note a distribution of success
3. Identify winners and losers
4. Claim that the losers are losing because they are oppressed by the winners
5. Claim unearned allegiance with the losers

8. Target your resentment towards your newly discovered enemies
9. Repeat. Forever. Everywhere.

Luke isn't a religious fanatic, you have no moral high ground, and trying to separate people from their deeply held and religious view is like separating a person from their immune system. Also bringing up his faith is an inappropriate thing to do in a bitcoin subreddit. What would you think if someone posted, "Congrats to on his new role as a bitcoin revolutionary but we really need to get him to stop being a disgusting faggot." Not so appropriate now is it, yet somehow you think it is with Christians.

The million dollar question is do we need to actively deal with it and if so how exactly.
It is possible the continual forces attacking bitcoin will weaken over time. For example the near monopoly on mining equipment should eventually vanish as the limits of what an ASIC can do is reached, which it basically is already. If we can wait long enough the average Joe can become a miner without having to upgrade quite so fast and without having to pay bitmain to do it.

And now you are accusing me, and in such a way without evidence but that I should do the work to defend myself. I did not accuse "OP of insinuating bad shit" nor did I "insinuated bad shit about OP". I pointed out there were several posts, of which the OP's post in included, that "posting the same misinformation" with the misinformation being the implied message I have been responding to. I did not imply intent to this OP. For all I know this OP is a good person. It is the misinformation I am after. If I cannot try and fix the misinformation without "insinuating bad shit" then communication is going to be very difficult. The question of the use of dishonestly was a question to you. If you don't think the OP is dishonest then we are in agreement.
I have no interest in having a blocksize debate and thus I did not address it. I addressed the broken link from the number of unconfirmed transactions and "high" fees to the blocksize. I thought the post was very detailed in explaining this. If you are looking for me to counter why +1MB is not responsible I have nothing but disappointment for you. I think +1MB is completely reasonable and thus would not argue against it.
I also want to point out in the time of writing this I have sent some bitcoin and it was confirmed within the 10 minute window without me second-guessing my wallet's fees. What exactly is wrong with this cryptocurrency again?

Just a friendly reminder that if your wallet on on a website then someone else holds to the keys to your wealth. If others hold the keys to your wealth then you don't actually own it. You might want to look into getting a proper wallet or consider not using bitcoin. There are links in the side bar of this subreddit that have links 'Getting Started' or how to download Bitcoin Core.

Since there is limited space in each block, the transactions that get confirmed by miners are the ones with the highest fees, and the other transactions never get confirmed and eventually get dropped.
Essentially that means there is a "fee market" and there is competition to get each transaction recorded, so there is a kind of auction to ensure your transaction will get confirmed. Since there are more transactions happening on the network lately and blocks are full, you have to ensure you are paying enough in fees to have your transaction confirmed.
You can find a fee estimator here: 
Currently, if you want to get confirmed right away, you need a fee of around 91-100 satoshi's per byte or more. If a hypothetical transaction had a fee of 0.0001 BTC, and the transaction size was 817 bytes. That means it was only bidding about 12 satoshi's per byte, not nearly enough. Its fee should have been about 8 times higher.

Those who read something correctly (in line with the actual truth) and take risks (act on it) deserve their gains under a moral and free system. Right? When the dusts settles shouldn't the people making good choices be the ones rewarded?
As for hard forks...
Maybe a passive attitude toward hard forks isn't good. I used to be somewhat indifferent but my view is changing. Considering the bcash trojanhorsecoin, maybe an active attitude against hard forks is necessary.
With hard forks, the previously invalid becomes valid while with softforks the previously valid becomes invalid.
Using the example of changing the blocksizes you will notice that any increase to 1MB, even a byte, **makes the entire block invalid to all participants** except those running new code and thus creating a hard fork. Meanwhile any decrease to the blocksize **will be automatically accepted by all** the participants regardless of what previous version of software they are all running.
The dusty node setup by some dude for a small business doesn't break with a soft fork to 500kb. The business owner doesn't need to call someone to repair his bitcoin. He doesn't need to know anything changed at all. It just keeps working.

Great question. There seems to be a lot of posts lately either 1) highlighting either that there is an excess of unconfirmed tx or 2) someone asking for help with why their tx did not go through in a timely manner. Now personally I would love to just make a sticky about it and "censor" everything else. But since I have zero powers and since there might be some people legitimately concerned about this I post to educate them.
I cover the reasoning behind the volume. I explain how this is not some bug but a feature. I show where to actually look at these transactions. I explain how to calculate fees if they actually want to. I explain how their money still safe in this event. I even mention the best general purpose wallet IMO. It is all the shills (and a few good people) that keep posting about the tx as if they are significant to people who have good wallets or smartly set fees.

I’d just like to interject for moment. What you’re refering to as bcash, is in fact, Bitcoin Cash/ABC/BCC/BTH, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Bitcoin. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

I never liked this argument. He was promoting gold long before he has a business selling it. As in loss of profits. He started a gold business because he was a true believer. He has ~~done so well~~ become a billionaire because ~~reality has aligned with him~~ his view on fiat is correct. And his business is his not the other way around. It is hard to listen and read his works honestly and not have good faith that he is being honest.

I think I am done with coinbase. I just checked and, again, they have stopped my recurring transactions I have setup. The first time was about a year ago the second sometime after September 2nd. It said it ran it on October 2nd but there is no transaction for it (a month later). This is likely due to their new limits (a laughable 25 USD a week for me by the way). I need to keep purchasing at regular intervals to mitigate risk with DCA/automatic investment but over the last year I have missed roughly 4 months of this. To be fair it would be less if I paid more attention but I do automatic transfers so I don't need too.
So anywho, my question is, how do I go about looking for a new exchange? Is there a wiki that talks about some? Or perhaps someone reviews.

I am fine with this bus not ever providing free or "low" cost rides. It is like saying there is a steady supply of 100 units at any cost and previously there was always a demand lower than 100. When the demand goes above 100 units then the standard supply and demand curve develops. I don't see why I should not be ok with this.

Lets say at the current rate I need to upgrade every four years. If tomorrow a 2MB block limit and segwit are mass adopted then that four years is cut down to just one. If it was a 4MB block limit it would be six months. From what I have read from the big block folks 4MB with segwit would be conservative.
It is not my issue of buying new hardware. What concerns me is that all changes to increase block sizes are **irreversible** while the future is uncertain. A new generation of game consoles came out about every four years. Until it they didn't. Hard drives capacity has increased at a fairly steady rate and will continue to... until they don't.
Another has mentioned pruned nodes. Pruned nodes certainly don't hurt the network in of themselves. What does hurt the network is having fewer full nodes (aka nodes). If changes are driving full nodes to become pruned nodes that does harm the network. I can't wrap my head around why people disregard this concern.

Having bitcoin replace fiat as the base layer of all money that others build on sounds great to me since bitcoin is a harder and more efficient global medium of exchange.
The current base layer isn't gold but fiat which is the definition of soft. It is a yardstick that instantly grows to any size requested.
Obviously there will be people and institutions who fraudulently build on top of the base layer. I don't think it is preventable. The major exchanges might be doing this to some degree right now with bitcoin. If you hold your wealth in the base layer or layers that are more difficult to scam then you should have nothing to worry about. Furthermore...
What the layers look like will change over time as they did with gold. Initially we start where fiat is the base layer with several layers built on top like credit &amp; payment institutions such as banks, visa, paypal, etc. The base layer is the softest layer imaginable. Banks are literally the thing that keeps our current money as hard as it is. Chew on that.
When bitcoin becomes the base layers everything that touches it can be held accountable. The degree it is held accountable is anyone's guess but all of it *can be* held accountable. I eagerly look forward to seeing what Visa, MasterCard, Paypal, and CitiBank will look like during and after the transition. Some of what they do are valuable services that will probably remain centralized for good reasons.
Perhaps as a TL;DR It appears to me that bitcoin will replace ~~playdough~~ fiat as the base layer of all wealth, forcing ~~playdough~~ fiat to operate only in other layers where it is easier to be held account. 1s and 0s cross the world in milliseconds while gold takes days.

Correct. Which means there is a risk calculation (market) for this. If you are very risky you can have no fees or very low fees but if you are risk averse you will up it (say $.17 instead of $.15). Or just use Bitcoin-Qt and not think about it like I do =)

great question. take a gander at this:
 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean by sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

@_date: 2017-11-26 04:47:15
Fortunately, that understanding is incorrect.
There are a lot of nodes out there. They are decentralized, meaning no single or a few particular entities comprise them. They are also widely distributed. They are all across the planet under different environments. There are literally nodes in outer space.
These nodes don't all use the same client. Just looking at the bitcoincore client, there are different versions for different architectures. There are some compiled from source and others not. This is distributed across time as well. There are clients running software from years ago. Some clients connect over open internet while others connect over Tor.
The reason these clients still work is bitcoin can't really change in a method that breaks the compatibility of all these nodes (i.e. a hard fork). Instead all changes must be done in a method that these older nodes still accept (i.e. a soft fork). A change that makes the previously invalid into valid is a hard fork while a change that makes the previously valid into invalid is a soft fork.
As a sidenote, you may start to realize at this point that is not the client developers that are making consensus with their software but instead making software that works within the parameters of the existing consensus.
Any entity wants to change bitcoin in a consensus breaking way requires nearly all (like 95%) these nodes to update. The type of entity that tries to break consensus in this way is obviously not trying to gain consensus (by definition) and thus it is they that removed from the network.
You might be thinking the number of nodes the entity controls is important. It's not. If a hostile entity spins of hundreds or thousands of nodes, then all the honest nodes actually running on the network will merely ban them one by one as they try to connect.
Now that is about nodes. What about miners? The number of miners is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of nodes, of which they are a part of. Miners have the power of ordering transactions by crafting blocks. A node can accept blocks but cannot craft them. This might seem like nodes are the mercy of miners but alas they aren't. Mining is expensive and it is literally the nodes that pay miners via transactions (and by holding but this is too complicated to explain here). Miners not following the rules are like miners that decide to dig in a desert. They are certainly welcome to do so but I am not paying them and they are no longer being employed by me. This could be disruption but it just takes a few honest miners that love money and patient holders for business to continue as usual.
So all miners can do is decide to not participate in bitcoin.
I hope this was helpful.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:51
Indeed. The top layer absolutely must be secure, immutable, decentralized, distributed (*meaning nodes can participate in the network using cheep hardware and infrastructure both now and in the long run (i.e. after you are dead*)), etc. Lower layers can open up other possibilities like reversible transactions or micropayments that are impossible with the top layer.
Bcash suckers don't seem to have any concept of this.

Best to not get your financial advice on reddit but having said that, buying $500 on coinbase and leaving it for year is fine. Ideally you spend at least some time actually figuring out what this thing you bought and take possession of your bitcoin. you can read more about that [here]( I like to advocate buying small amounts (not $500 but maybe $5 or $50) gradually so you can get used to the price swings and get to understand what you just bought.
Bitcoin works like a dollars  in some ways but in other ways it is different. One way that is is different is the absolutely immutability of transactions. If you spend some money with a credit card you can do a charge back. If you pay for something with a check you can take legal means to get the money back. There is literally no way to actually reverse a bitcoin transaction and whoever holds the private keys actually owns the bitcoin. Coinbase is fine because it is a FDIC insured bank and has a great track record... but technically an insider could take a bunch of the bitcoin and there is technically no way to get them back. Or there could be some screw up and they lose the private keys. Whoops.

I don't recall stating that bitcoin wasn't a medium of exchange.
Credit cards, which aren't even money or currencies, are much better mediums of exchange than bitcoin has ever been in 99% of a normal person's daily life. On the other hand, bitcoin has perhaps been mankind's best store of value that it has ever seen. The store of value is the clear way forward for bitcoin and the medium of exchange will come later as more people are holding it. Even if bitcoin never becomes a good medium of exchange it will have done the world the better service as an exit from the corrupt and inflationary financial system instead being a really convenient method of purchasing coffee.
The initial price was whatever someone decided to pay for it and that was not zero and thus the initial price was not zero as you state. Bitcoin did not have a price until at least two people decided to hold it. The first person and then the next who wanted to hold it even more. It is the holders that give bitcoin its value. It was not someone wanting to buy something and thinking, "golly gee, I really want a rubber duck and I think this bitcoin thing is the best method to purchase it." That would be retarded.
It is indeed the holders that give bitcoin its value. The article is quite clear. Consider giving it a read.

5. Be especially wary of scammers! "Bitcoin Cash", "Bitcoin Gold", Bitconnect, etc are **not** bitcoin. They are literal scams.
6. The links in the sidebar are good.
7. Learn about Dollar Cost Averaging / Automatic Investing and do that after you are comfortable with your $20.
8. Realize that you, yes you, value losses far greater than gains. If you have $100 to your name and you gain $50 you value this less than losing $50. If you are not aware of this, and you only buy bitcoin because of a fear of missing out then you will inevitably sell at a loss ensuring you lose money. Better to instead get your cash and lite it on fire. At least you get to look at a pretty flame.

**If You Sell Bitcoins, You Aren’t “Selling” Bitcoins**
I’m sure you’ve heard a story like this. “I’ve been going to all the local stores and telling them how awesome Bitcoin is! But none of them wants to take payments in Bitcoin! Why don’t they like it?”
Let’s think about that for a minute. You are essentially telling the merchant, “Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it!” Not actually much of a sales pitch, is it? Why would the merchant want something that you, apparently, don’t want? If you really want him to start accepting bitcoins himself, ask him, “Do you take worthless paper money at this store? Good, because you’re not getting a satoshi from me!” That will convince him that you think they’re valuable. 
How about this instead? Tell your local merchants that you want to be able to spend cash in their stores and get the change in bitcoins. That’s the kind of store I’d like to shop at. And then when the merchant later says “I’m not going to do that anymore. I want you to pay me in bitcoins!” you know he’s become a true hoarder.

Certainly comparing properties of Bitcoin verses PGP will result in massive differences. PGP isn't a very good cryptocurrency and Bitcoin aint that great for encrypting everyday mail.
That was not what I was doing though. I was comparing one revolutionary, decentralized technology that was supposed to take off and it didn't to Bitcoin. It is possible, even if unlikely, that Bitcoin will not become the settlement layer for banks, captains of industry, and the like. If this were the case it seems likely to me that the price would not be sunbathing on the moon as this article suggests. The price might look something like it is now or, who knows, lower.
Having said all this, my long term bets are hedged quite strongly toward the moon. Any why not! Bitcoin is pretty dang cool!

Assuming 8 MiB blocks plus 1.7x increase with SegWit that makes the 4 TB drive full in less than six years. Also Hard drives are actually one the last things to push non-data center nodes off the network. Memory would be one of the first followed by bandwith.
Of course all blocks will be full almost immediately. The the demand to put non monetary stuff on the blockchain is high resulting in blocks being full regardless of size.
Your words ring hollow. You will neither pay the first year of storage costs for a single node nor 500 nodes, regardless the reason (i.e. someone seems worried on the internet). And who cares about the first year lol? My entire point is people (i.e. ) want to make irreversible, unnecessary decisions today that will only be felt at a later time. I say no thanks and good day.

absolutely false. If 51% of hashpower or more starts enforcing different rules then the hashpower of the network drops in half immediately with blocks taking twice as long to mine until adjusted back to 10 minutes.

I recommend [continuous, automatic investing]( Do not buy a lot at once because Bitcoin is volatile and without question there will come a point Bitcoin is worth less than what you payed for it. Because of [loss aversion]( you will probably sell and lock in your loses.
Also it is generally a good idea to not spend money on things you don't understand. Having said that there is no way you can understand everything and everyone does some sort of risk assessment. But I would *not* buy a lot of Bitcoin right away and instead spend time learning more about Bitcoin.

This illustration is vomit. Let us clarify some terms.
* **surplus**: How much extra wealth you have over a given period of time; the antonym of deficit. *At the end of last month I had an extra $45 to my name. Wooho!*
* **deficit**: How much extra debt you have over a given period of time. This only works if people will lend to you; the antonym of surplus. *I had to replace my tires last month and now I owe Tim another $500.*
* **debt**: the total amount someone owes another. Deficits add to this number and surpluses subtract from this number. *Because of last month's deficit of $500, my debt to Tim increased from $2500 to $3000.*
* **revenue**: Captains of industry have profits and loses. States do not. States have revenues only. If revenue exactly covers expenditures over a given budget cycle than there is neither deficit nor surplus.
In addition the soup of different information, you may notice the x and y axis of the graph. Every 5 years is denoted but there is some arrow to some ambiguous point. Instead the vertical lines could be every 4 years denoting an election. or perhaps have brackets showing it. Or very faintly color coded. Or anything.

I believe you, redditor for 3 months.
Mocking aside, I do accept that very rare exceptions do actually occur. It is possible someone somewhere sold their Bitcoins for $1000 and rebought them and more $300.
What I perhaps did a poor job pointing out is the mindset that caused someone to sell off their Bitcoins at $1000 is not the one that buys it all back at $300. Obviously. Also the mindset doesn't change easily when the apparent information supports the mindset. Furthermore, only random people and insider traders are actually able to buy at the trough and sell at the peaks.

Hearing you detail out why exactly you thought supporting things hostile to the bitcoin ecosystem and how you see differently would go a long way towards restoring your reputation.

Secondly pools that signaled for S2X were not signaling for a 2MB block size. This is dishonest for many reasons. Stop being dishonest.

However, you should be able to buy gold and silver bullion from Peter Schiff using bitcoin. I have liked him for a long time. Anyhow he is strongly against bitcoin but since he wants more dollars and gold he has allowed "bitcoin purchases" for a long time. The quotation marks are because, like most people "accepting bitcoin", the the bitcoin is converted at the time of sale and he never sees a satoshi of bitcoin.
I feel obligated to say that you should do your research before buying or making financial decisions, and also that reddit is probably not a great place for research.

Segwit was originally designed to not offer any capacity increase. As a compromise, thanks to Luke-Jr's code amusingly enough, Segwit was converted to a capacity increase. This capacity increase was designed to more than double the blocksize via a thing called blockweight. This was throughly tested and released to the public via bip9. Dishonest actors immediately shifted the goalposts as they always do and wanted double of the double all the while pretending otherwise. You seldom heard a S2X promoter acknowledge this. They would call their 8MB block weight Segwit2MB. Only later did they even give in to calling it S2X. You pretending S2X was designed to double the capacity is dishonest. It was designed to offer roughly double via segwit and then double that later via a hard fork.
The other way you are being dishonest is focusing on one detail as if that is all there was. This one is easier for me to see but harder to explain. It is a sort of slight of hand. If you focus on "increase to 2MB in December" you can ignore the backwards incompatible and consensus breaking nature of S2X. You can minimize any criticism as merely some preference instead of addressing the literal centralized and closed door "New York Agreement". You can ignore how S2X was a literal attack on the open source model. S2X was an attempt to wrestle control of bitcoin away from an open source project of literally the best bitcoin developers in the world into basically one person. One person that introduced not one but two bugs that would have halted the network... requiring an at least one emergency hard fork. You brush that all aside as some preference. I would chalk this up to not being aware of this but you scolded me as the one who failed to "remember" so...yeah. 
Again you pant me as thinking everything I disagree with is a hostile takeover. This is exceptionally sleazy. It is like saying if I have some problem with hard forking to remove the 21m coin limit as just "something I disagree with". While I may also casually disagree with that, it is also many other things such as literally a hostile attack against bitcoin itself.
Also it is bad form to downvote the person you replied too.

Coinbase is a fairly significant player here and to my knowledge they don't sponsor even a single open source developer. Perhaps if they did they would be able integrate the "complicated" code in a timely manner. What you wrote implies maximum effort and time to not introduce new bugs and restrictions wasn't paramount when it actually was.
The software development for things that touch the chain, and specifically the open source project known as core, are much closer to hardware development than regular software development. When designing software you can often expect it to get patched and updated so things are released in an incomplete state. Hardware has to be complete because if there is a problem you generally can't just fix them without sending some person to do it or have the customer mail the hardware back to be fixed.
Segregated Witness, and the secure and backwards compatible implementations of it were excellent and efficient code. Literally the best code on the planet for it written by the best developers on the planet. There is only as much complexity as necessary. Core often [refactors]( their code. Simpler software that interacted with the chain years ago sill interact with the chain and newer software without issue. Maximum effort to not introduce new bugs is paramount.
The code isn't "too complicated" and be wary of anyone trying to convince you that it was or currently is. The attempt is often the first part of a hostile effort to push consensus breaking, backwards incompatible, poorly developed changes by discrediting good code as "complicated". Leave "hello world" for learning programming, bitcoin's code for the best open source software developers in the world, and "adoption" for those in the right phase of adopting.

I am hoping bitcoin will be more or less like linux. Linux absolutely lost the desktop war but it kinda won the infrastructure war. And you can still run linux on your desktop. Bitcoin might become the layer that literally almost everything is built upon. The fill up and coffee at the local gas station is paid for with bitcoin but never (most likely) actually makes it to the blockchain. This is some layer 2 / sidechain / whatever thingie. Only if the layer is corrupted will you see your transaction on the blockchain via some failsafe.
It appears the big block folks want bitcoin to literally be some sort of paypal / line of credit itself where at any given second there are hundreds of people across the planet paying for their gas with bitcoin that goes directly to its blockchain. This sounds nice but can't be done with a blockchain and maintain [sovereignty]( Also where the heck is the competition? There are no different currencies for differing and regional uses?

Thankfully, Bitcoin is not a democracy. The majority vote of 6 foxes and 5 hens deciding what is for dinner is a democracy. Consensus is 6 foxes and 5 hens each individually agreeing on the same solution, with 11 animals agreeing to the same thing. Think of the word consent.
 you know why the Bitcoin rules can't change? The answer may surprise you! (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

Traders and cost averaging investors will thank you for you generous gift. If you look at history you will discover those with "weak hands" are those that do poorly. If you understand the value proposition as well as the volatility of bitcoin, holding is less risky to you and thus you do not sell on the lows.

I am so, so sorry to blow up your inbox. The creative juices are flowing and I have to get my thoughts down. I need to start a blog or something and have something actually presentable.
Ok so the most recent thing I am thinking about is about wealth. When we say that Peter has 1 million dollars you think he 1 million dollars of wealth. You assume the dollars to be the wealth itself. This is false. It is actually a claim on wealth. Peter could claim 1 million dollars worth of wealth with his dollars but the dollars itself is not wealth. This might seem like an awfully silly distinction but it is helpful to understand how debt based money vanishes when it encounters hard money. The thing Peter was holding, this claim, was actually fradulent. It never was worth the amount of wealth he thought. Everyone just thought it did. Hard money shows what this million dollars worth of wealth is actually worth.
I feel at a loss for words to explain some of these things but I do hope you or someone finds them insightful or useful.

* In order to compromise with those demanding an immediate blocksize increase this upgrade includes a doubling of the blocksize from 1MB to effectively 2MB. This was immediately disregarded by dishonest people, thus moving the goal post and pretending there was no compromise.
* Meanwhile some influential (i.e. Digital Currency Group and Bitmain) but very confused people sought to control bitcoin.
* Due to a unforeseen attack vector known as [BIP9]( some of these people (i.e.Bitmain) held the development and scaling of bitcoin ransom. 
* BIP148 came into existence in order to provide an immediate bugfix to BIP9 and activate SegWit.
* Horrified, the now malicious actors (i.e.DCG and Bitmain) met up in a closed meeting to collude amongst themselves.
* They came up with the least damaging and most believable lie that could be spread: *They* were deciding to activate Segwit but they will implement an unnecessary, dangerous, rushed, untested, and highly contested hard fork later.
* They called this the "New York Agreement"
* The BIP148 UASF activated segwit in as expected.
* In the month of August, a premined altcoin and bitcoin impostor named bcash was created and the first segwit transactions appeared in the bitcoin blockchain. The altcoin sought to pretend to be bitcoin and replace it but wasn't dishonest enough to be slapped to death by the market.
* Now and in the upcoming months, whatever the least damaging and most believable lie will be spread to explain why bitcoin won't incorporate an unnecessary, dangerous, rushed, untested, and highly contested hard fork (aka segwit2x).

I wish I knew and had something meaningful to say about it. The whole thing is fascinating. I don't really have anything off the top of my head about this. I am not actually an economist but I did study it in college and on my own via books. I do have one model or way of looking at this that I thought up but I am not sure what to make of it. It might be incredibly stupid, something fairly standard that is only new to me, or perhaps somewhat innovative. I can't tell.
Okay so visualize a number line or a spectrum for a moment. Now put the inflation based systems we live in today on one side of a number line and deflation based systems that don't really exist on another. You can rank the various systems we have today and the direction of travel. You might say hyper inflation is where some system moves along this line off to infinity in that direction at an ever increasing rate. If this is true then what is hyper deflation? Bitcoin is probably the closest dang thing to hyper deflation anyone living has ever seen. Yes technically bitcoin is a decreasingly inflationary system but that does not account for growing adoption as well as lost keys. Bitcoin compared to the massive and inflated systems of today is tiny. Like super tiny. The price in terms of dollars is skyrocketing because of the massive pent up energy trying to escape the system. Things like the artifically low rates are creating this massive demand or force pushing toward the other end of the spectrum.
Also what happens when an inflation based system moves to a deflation based one? At some point it has to pass zero on its way to a deflation based one. Now what the heck does that look like. What does it mean. If Mike Malony's [description]( is correct that essentially our current money is literally debt then all of that has to be deflated before passing zero. It is like how a the temperature of a body of water can't go below freezing before a state change happens. Again it is just one way of thinking about it and not sure what to make of it. I would love someone with rigorous economic training to lend me their thoughts, preferably from the Austrian or Classical school.
Oh and the other thing would share with you is a comment that really stood out to me in another recent thread:








And thats when deflation was the norm, because most trading was done in hard currency.

Litecoin actually has the longest bitcoin chain. We don't call it bitcoin though because it is not the longest *valid* chain.
Saying miners follow the longest chain is like saying Army officers are ranked by age. It is true but misleading. Military officers are first ranked by grade (2nd Lt is subordinate to 1st Lt) then by time held that grade or in the service, and only then by age. So if you have 2 Captains who signed up on the same day and promoted the same day, the older one outranks the younger. So if you have two competing blockchains who strictly follow the rules then the longest chain is the only not discarded or rejected. Lieutenants don't outrank Generals because they might be older and Litecoin is not bitcoin because it's blockchain got longer than bitcoin's.
Without consensus (which is not the same thing as democracy by the way), S2X is an altcoin. And S2X is the farthest thing from consensus.

Blockchain space is a scarce resource. The greater you scale the more scarce it is. Scarce resources have to be handled in some manner and thus a market for fees. Scarce resources like getting your transaction in a block vary from time of day to day of week, and in other ways. Because of this fluctuating demand setting a fixed price is impossible.

hmm true. Just don't let anyone tell you there are only x nodes signaling no2x because of the user agent. All previous core clients and (probably) all clients out there automatically reject 2x. Btc1 is the only one is 2x. It is literally how hard forks work.

That is certainly one way to look at it.

Sadly this is it. I am not sure you will find a better discussion on reddit.com then in In addition to the endless price threads, there is a war going on. Each time you view any bitcoin or related subreddit you will have to evaluate something in context to this war. Failure to do increases the rate that propaganda is effective on you. The experience is degraded even when the evaluation is painfully simple and obvious. How many times do I need to read and respond to very obviously technical falsehoods?
Best I can say is upvote meaningful posts and comments, and downvote the rest. Report things that will harm the weak.

just as a followup, this is one reason why additional layer solutions are so important. The sooner layers are built, the more settled the code in the base layer. The additional layers can add heaps complexity, additional risk, and features without effecting the base layer.

I am so glad you asked. As it turns out you are not the only person unsure.
 misinformation on Segwit2x and btc1
“Segwit2x”, a proposal for an incompatible change to the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network, has received increased exposure recently. There have been attempts to mislead people into believing that the btc1 project, the implementation of the Segwit2x proposal, is a necessary update to existing software—it is not. Instead, it is a contentious deviation from the existing network rules, and its users will soon find themselves disagreeing with the rest of the network about the validity of blocks and transactions.
Please be aware that:
* Segregated Witness (or Segwit, a soft fork which will be active within the coming days) is not related to the Segwit2x hard fork. Segregated Witness is backwards compatible with all previous Bitcoin software. For the vast majority of Bitcoin users, no action is required.
* bitcoincore.org is the official website and  is the official Twitter account of the Bitcoin Core project. Any other websites or Twitter accounts claiming to represent the project are fraudulent. Bitcoin Core is an open source project that welcomes contributions and review from anyone through its GitHub project. Bitcoin Core binaries can be obtained from bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org and are always digitally signed by the release manager’s signing key. The latest version of Bitcoin Core at the time of writing is 0.14.2.
* btc1 is not connected to Bitcoin Core in any way. No regular Bitcoin Core contributors support btc1 or have any connection to the project, nor were any involved in the design of its proposed hard fork.
* We strongly advise users not to download any Bitcoin full-node software claiming to be an ‘upgrade’ to Bitcoin’s consensus rules without carefully considering the impact of the proposed changes on the Bitcoin system and the level of community support for it. This includes proposed consensus changes in new releases of Bitcoin Core.
* While it is difficult to determine what the broader Bitcoin community supports, be wary of claims suggesting the large and diverse Bitcoin community is moving entirely to one fork or another, without independent verification. Sign-on letters have been used by companies claiming to represent their clients/users without their agreement, and have often used imprecise and misleading language. In the past, letters for Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited, as well as others, have been circulated to indicate general support of an idea, while being trumpeted as commitments to run software irrespective of community considerations, only to be dropped some months later.
* Concerns raised by Bitcoin Core contributors and Bitcoin community members about the Segwit2x proposal have not been adequately addressed by its proponents. The details of the proposal were established before Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness activation, and before the recent creation of the BCH currency. It is irresponsible to ignore the outcome of these events when planning for the future. As an example, we’ve seen the confusion that arises when a single address is valid across two chains, yet the Segwit2x proposal intends to repeat the same mistake. Furthermore, BCH’s implementation of strong replay protection provided significant protection to users of both BCH, as well as Bitcoin, something Segwit2x does not plan on providing.
* Bitcoin’s consensus rules should only be changed sparingly and with broad agreement from the entire community. Segwit2x, in both its process and implementation, has been opposed by many. Bitcoin Core will continue to support the Segwit soft fork and we look forward to helping Bitcoin scale to new heights over the coming years.

Ambiguity is a bug for those promoting the backwards compatible version of bitcoin... or also known as bitcoin. Having "bitcoin" in the name of some other cryptocurrency that is similar and in the top 10 is not good. People will be buying one thing thinking it is something else.

I want things when they are good and ready much more than I want them now. Half-baked is unacceptable. You can't rush excellence.
I also look forward to promising tech such as lightning networks.
Only a 2xer would consider support for an unnecessary, dangerous, rushed, untested, and highly contested hard fork. Both of your posts include a sense of urgency and conditional statements of "support" for s2x depending on things in the next few months.










Therefore, yes, you are a 2xer. Furthermore, a 2xer is hostile to those running nodes. Hard forks, unlike soft forks, are not backwards compatible. A contested hard fork means there will be a contentious split of bitcoin itself. Therefore s2x as a contested hard fork seeks to split bitcoin itself. Therefore I title you as an anti-node 2xer when I quoted you.
 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

I find myself at a loss for words in replying to you. Your comment is packed with a lot of things conflated together. Unpacking it is difficult.
Well first off in answer to your question this video comes to mind: 
Distributed and decentralized systems can be a very hard concept to grasp. Bitcoin has a lot of difficult concepts baked into it that make it and systems surrounding it difficult to understand. Some of them are outlined very well in this [article]( Many others are very simple and obvious but are still often missed. Sometimes it can be difficult to articulate what is happening. I am going to try to do this by summarizing as many semi-relevant things that I have time for. I hope someone gains something from this.
* **causation**. It might appear to some, perhaps such as yourself, that core is this ruling entity that bitcoin is subject to. Perhaps you see core and miners as competing ruling entities that are battling each other. As if core decrees that x should happen and y won't and therefore x happens and y doesn't. This appearance is false. Think of the relationship that Sir Isaac Newton and gravity have to each other. An apple does not fall out of the tree because Sir Newton said it would. There is this objective reality and if you describe it correctly you will appear to control it.
* **identity**. What do you mean when you say core? If you had to describe core in three words what comes to mind? I am guessing it wasn't "*an opensource project*"[1]( If you substitute "*an opensource project*" every time you hear "core" a lot of statements and assertions are shown to be absurd. It is very easy to get confused when it comes groups. If one component of a group does x does the group do x? CNN likes to think so when it suits their purposes. "BREAKING NEWS at 10! Bitcoin is x." Part of the conflict is because the both the component and the sum of components is a person or entity.
* **tokens**. It would be hard to visualize core doing something. You can think of dev meetings over IRC perhaps but otherwise it is difficult. The same is true with miners. How do you visualize miners. It is much easier to instead conflate all this into simple tokens. Core is 1MegGreg who is also EvilBlockstream and Chinese miners are "Jihad Who" who is Bitmain. All is simplified into tribes and now we can know who is the us and who are the the thems. I treat my family different than I treat those trying to destroy my family and therefore all conduct against those damn gigablockers is justified. Blockstream NorthCoreans are literally trying to hold bitcoin back! Right? be wary of this.
* **4 dimensional thinking**. Many things are discussed and framed as if we are not moving through time. Do you want to protect the environment? Which environment? The environment of today is different than the one 50 years ago, the one 500 years ago, and 5000 years ago. When someone says they want to protect the environment do they really mean just try and make it stop changing? The decisions in the present have lasting consequences into the future and the decisions in the past shape the present today.
* **reputation**. What core does or says today is just a drop of water in a large bucket of water. Everything they have done in the past is a component of anything they say today. One way to describe this is a thing called reputation. Reputation is perhaps the most valuable currency that everyone works for but is held by others. If I gain the reputation of being a lier, everything I say today (a drop) will be filtered with my history (the bucket) of being a lier and added to that statement.
* **trade-offs**. The uncomfortable reality is trade-offs exist everywhere. If I get a really nice knife to cut steak it will not be able to be a good spoon. If I get a good operating system for servers it will not be a good operating system for my grandmother to browser facebook on using her phone. Priorities and hard choices have to be made. It would be amazing if bitcoin could be a chat service, a platform to buy and sell goods, a reputation system, money, and place to store cat videos. Obviously doing one of these things prevents the others. Bitcoin has certain properties that make certain use cases impossible without significant changes.
* **competing visions**. It appears bitcoin in it's current form and attributes literally can't compete with lines of credit and payment systems like MasterCard, Visa, and Paypal. Doing so changes what the properties of bitcoin. All participants of bitcoin should determine what is important to them and ensure the integrity of vital attributes are not compromised. For example one of my failure states is if the rate the blockchain grows becomes great enough that no average Joes can store and verify it. Furthermore it doesn't actually have to hit this point now. It just needs to have this future set with irrevocable changes to meet this failure state. Others have different priorities and failure states and they are literally at war with one another.
* **altcoin skepticism**. There is an exceptional amount of dumb money that is malinvested into altcoins. It is entirely possible a small handful will be healthy, popular, and serve an important roles in the future. Determining this is a like trying to do a 5k run across a field full of landmine. No thanks. Speaking practically, they are all scams and scams are not going to take over, flippening, or whatever these fools call replacing bitcoin. It is all concern trolling and I have spent enough time evaluating the merits of it.
* **scarcity**. The limit on the total number of bitcoins is a feature. The unlimited amount of cryptocurrencies is a liability. One of the semi-valid complaints against bitcoin is that there is no scarcity of cryptocurrencies. In order for gold to serve the use case of censorship-resistant digital gold it must be the only one capable of this. Because this is one of bitcoin's current use cases, because of the network effect of bitcoin, and because of the irrevocable damage of bitcoin not being able to fulfill this case there will never be a competitor. If bitcoin is not capable of being censorship-resistant digtal gold then literally nothing is capable of being censorship-resistant digital gold. If someone was able to take all the gold(Au) in existence and create the exact same amount of fools gold with nearly identical properties(Au2x) with atomic number 72.5 then gold would have some serious issues. You can't have have two things being gold. There is only gold, only bitcoin. Silver is an entirely different story but that is of course an entirely different altcoin (i.e. litecoin) that already exists and does not pretend to be bitcoin.
some others that i didn't get time too are:
* other coins doing other things as positive and not competition/threat. diff use case
* they won't just fork off already. they MUST be bitcoin to deceive. not by their merrits. fearful of altcoin skepicism.
* bitcoin as infrastructure vs your facny phone app for grandma. linux for infrastructure vs your app.
* what exactly moves the unmovable object like bitcoin. core's role given to it/earned.
* x possible use cases promised at beginning(digital cash to pay for coffee!) and x-y+a+b actual use cases actually possible(speculative asset, settlement layer) with a single cryptocoin.

As you understand what bitcoin actually is you will discover you need to hold bitcoin yourself to have [sovereignty]( Having said this, it is probably actually easier to create a bank account at coinbase.com or Gemini, buy something like $10 and wait. Both are fine but I have personally used coinbase.com for several years. Anyhow you can slowly learn more over time and after you are a little more comfortable you can buy more.
There are at least 5 things to look out for:
* scams. There is so much dang money around this there are scams around every corner. There was literally a scam in this subreddit about how to donate to one of the well known developers who had flood damage from the recent hurricane. Absurdity. The address to send bitcoin wasn't the developer and he wasn't asking for donations. Many of these devs are independently wealthy or have great jobs at universities and corporations and have zero interest in your measily donation. Also basically each and every single ICO and altcoin is a scam. Think dotcom bubble. Most of them are not really decentralized and distributed. I am going to catch a lot of downvotes for this but even everyone's favorite, ETH is basically a [fraud]( For your own sake beware of altcoins and ICOs!
* Counterparty risk / improper wallet security. You might want to google MtGox and learn what happened there. Anytime you use an exchange or bank such as coinbase there is some risk. As they become more popular they become a bigger pinyatta to hackers. Ideally you should store your coins in an hardware wallet like a tezor, or on your own node, on in a paper wallet. Unfortunately if you don't take it seriously, like most people, you run a risk of permanently losing access to your funds. Think about it. If you have $5000 in your wallet and you accidentally drop it in a roaring fire you no longer have $5000. Same thing with your digital wallet. If you forget or lose your private key, delete your data on your harddrive, etc you are essentially done. Best to keep it on an exchange for a short time despite the counterparty risk. When you are capable of being responsible move it. This might sound odd to you but if you "buy" bitcoin on coinbase you didn't actually buy bitcoin. You have to have the private keys to actually own bitcoin.
* Are you buying because of the price of bitcoin or because of what bitcoin is? This can make a remarkable difference. There are many things that can screw with the price of bitcoin. It is very easy to see a major downturn and sell at a loss. Slowly investing, over some time, and understanding what you are buying helps ease this. Be wary of investment advice on reddit. Some of us are very convinced of some remarkable things but if you take our word for it, you will be wondering why you did during hard time.
* Whenever you encounter people, adds, etc. you will encounter many people with hidden agendas and who are accidentally malicious to bitcoin. Some of this is a lack of understanding of something such as economics or computer science. Other times there is understanding but with a different vision and values. There are several fields of study that are essential to understanding bitcoin and the lack of one can lead to faulty thinking / undesirable results. Read more [here](
* As almost a summary of everything I just typed, there is a huge divide between those who understand bitcoin must remain decentralized and widely distributed and the deeply confused trying to change that in some reckless attempt to be the next paypal for a few years. Some of this is purely business motivation. For example Erik Voorhees owns a company that is sort of put out of business with certain changes to bitcoin. Therefore, he tries to reject these changes and supports only those that support his business, Shapeshift. Many innocent people are hoodwinked into a very negative attitude of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. They listen to others and lose money to pump and dumps. They hear how bitcoin is doomed and believe falsifiable conspiracies. There once was something to [debate]( but there is only bad blood these days. There is so many times you can correct something verifiable false and harmful before there is animosity. They mostly hangout on altcoin subreddits and anti-bitcoin subreddits like r buttcoin and r btc. It might not hurt to take a peak in these from time to time but do be aware that propaganda works on the best of people and especially well on someone new to the idea of investing bitcoin such as yourself. I like to read criticism but there is sadly more valid criticism at the comedy subreddit buttcoin than btc. It would be hilarious how they refer to this one particular open source project if they weren't causing so much harm. Be alert to emotional language, concern trolling, a demand to HARD FORK NOW!! for bigger blocks, etc. Don't be a sucker like this [guy](

False. An individual user cannot change the protocol. 12 angry men meeting in ~~a club on Jekyll Island~~ a hotel in New York cannot change the protocol. The Digital Currency Group with a super majority of miners cannot change the protocol. Developers cannot change the protocol. A democratic majority of nodes, miners, and exchanges cannot change the protocol. Consensus, and only consensus can change the protocol.
There is some risk involved in *determining* consensus but sometimes it is incredibly obvious such as the attack known as S2X. If something is backward compatible the risk is reduced.
What you are describing is the voluntary nature of using bitcoin. Obviously you are not required to use bitcoin. Obviously you can do all sorts of things to open source software. Obviously you can use your internet connection as you please. Obviously you can use your money, time, and property to try and compete or attack bitcoin. What you cannot do is contentiously change bitcoin. Bitcoin would be a lot less interesting if you could.

If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

Miners are welcome to mine in a desert but they best not expect payment for uselessly shoveling sand.
 Shadered, do you know why the Bitcoin rules can't change? The Answer May Surprise You!! (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.

Well that was incredibly risky. Moving all of one thing into another thing is generally a dumb idea. You should cost average it instead to make volatility your friend. Google "Dollar Cost Averaging".
But alas you cannot change the past. If you want to do a dumb thing again be sure to move everything back all at once. Maximize your loss. Traders and cost averaging investors will thank you for you generous gift. If you look at history you will discover those with "weak hands" are those that do poorly. If you understand the value proposition as well as the volatility of bitcoin, holding is less risky to you and thus you do not sell on the lows.

With the exception of transfers into and out of an exchange and a few others, all exchange transfers occur in a private database and not on a blockchain. I would rather have my transaction be apart of a lightning network than a Microsoft Access database.
I don't see why you have a problem. Bitcoin only provides limited privacy and anonymity by default and thus Lightning Networks providing this should be welcomed for providing this service. Obviously.

Well my point was 530 GB (download) in a day isn't normal. It might be the initial amount to setup a node. This is a problem and why many of us are resist the reckless gigablocker crowd trying to push things like S2X. If you limit your peers to something like 8 to 12, keep it pruned, and don't open port 8333, it would be vastly less than what I described.
Well [this]( explains why to run a node.
Essentially, the nifty and unique things that make bitcoin what it is are completely lost if you don't run a node. If you do not run a node, you are treating bitcoin as a vastly overpriced and expensive database. I am fine with others having the ability to interact with the bitcoin network in this manner but would under no circumstances continue to hold or use something if I was forced to interact this way. I don't "run a node for free". I just use bitcoin and that is something that is necessary. I don't do an oilchange on my truck for free. I just drive my truck and that is something that is necessary.

The argument isn't bitcoin can't handle 8MB blocks. This is misleading. The argument is bitcoin can't handle increasing the size the blockchain grows whenever it needs to scale.

First off, welcome to reddit! Ok so it sounds there is some communication issue here. Let me see if I can clear this up. Bad money drives out good money, a phenomenon known as Gresham's law. If you have wealth in two different monies, people will always circulate the bad one and hang onto the good one. 
An example of this is the Coinage Act of 1965. Previously dimes were 90% silver and 10% copper. Dimes minted after the act did not contain any silver. Both dimes were $0.10 but the more valuable 90% silver dimes nearly vanished from circulation.
Another example of this is United States Dollars and bitcoin. At the time of purchase you can choose a certain dollar amount of either currency but ultimately the inferior money (USD) will drive out the superior money (BTC). When buying, if I have a choice of using dollars (cash, bank transfers, credit cards, etc.) I use that instead of bitcoin unless there is a significant discount. Please consider reading the article I linked. It sounds like you could find it insightful.

*Bitcoin is supposed to be antifragile and therefore because it is antifragile you don't need to do anything or say anything. Instead remain silent and don't do anything. Let bad actors and enemies of bitcoin do and say what they will and just don't do anything. Anyone that does or says anything should be pointed at like jester.*
This is absurd of course since it is the users (and the devs who write code) that make bitcoin antifragile. Users are discovering attacks vectors and dealing with them all the time. Users call out bad actors and enemies. Users run nodes. In this particular case replace "antifragile" with "weakness" but it is the same concept.

Not quite, Quantum-Avocado.
* The New York agreement was a ~~compromise~~ collusion ~~between~~ amongst those advocating 'big-blocks' ~~and those advocating for Segwit~~ in order to maintain the illusion of control. The "agreement" is the least damaging and most believable lie that could be spread. In reality, the USAF for BIP148 activated segwit. A small group of like-minded people in some closed door meeting do not control bitcoin via "agreements". This is not even close to how distributed and decentralized systems work. Not. Even. Close.
* Segwit was crafted to also be a blocksize increase as a compromise. This was immediately disregarded by proponents of s2x, thus moving the goal post. The "agreement" depends on bitcoin being something other than bitcoin.
* In the month of August, a premined altcoin and bitcoin impostor named bcash was created and the first segwit transactions appeared in the bitcoin blockchain.
* Now and in the upcoming months, the least damaging and most believable lie will be spread to explain why bitcoin won't incorporate an unnecessary, dangerous, rushed, untested, and highly contested hard fork (aka segwit2x).

 misinformation on Segwit2x and btc1
“Segwit2x”, a proposal for an incompatible change to the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network, has received increased exposure recently. There have been attempts to mislead people into believing that the btc1 project, the implementation of the Segwit2x proposal, is a necessary update to existing software—it is not. Instead, it is a contentious deviation from the existing network rules, and its users will soon find themselves disagreeing with the rest of the network about the validity of blocks and transactions.
Please be aware that:
* Segregated Witness (or Segwit, a soft fork which will be active within the coming days) is not related to the Segwit2x hard fork. Segregated Witness is backwards compatible with all previous Bitcoin software. For the vast majority of Bitcoin users, no action is required.
* bitcoincore.org is the official website and  is the official Twitter account of the Bitcoin Core project. Any other websites or Twitter accounts claiming to represent the project are fraudulent. Bitcoin Core is an open source project that welcomes contributions and review from anyone through its GitHub project. Bitcoin Core binaries can be obtained from bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org and are always digitally signed by the release manager’s signing key. The latest version of Bitcoin Core at the time of writing is 0.14.2.
* btc1 is not connected to Bitcoin Core in any way. No regular Bitcoin Core contributors support btc1 or have any connection to the project, nor were any involved in the design of its proposed hard fork.
* We strongly advise users not to download any Bitcoin full-node software claiming to be an ‘upgrade’ to Bitcoin’s consensus rules without carefully considering the impact of the proposed changes on the Bitcoin system and the level of community support for it. This includes proposed consensus changes in new releases of Bitcoin Core.
* While it is difficult to determine what the broader Bitcoin community supports, be wary of claims suggesting the large and diverse Bitcoin community is moving entirely to one fork or another, without independent verification. Sign-on letters have been used by companies claiming to represent their clients/users without their agreement, and have often used imprecise and misleading language. In the past, letters for Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited, as well as others, have been circulated to indicate general support of an idea, while being trumpeted as commitments to run software irrespective of community considerations, only to be dropped some months later.
* Concerns raised by Bitcoin Core contributors and Bitcoin community members about the Segwit2x proposal have not been adequately addressed by its proponents. The details of the proposal were established before Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness activation, and before the recent creation of the BCH currency. It is irresponsible to ignore the outcome of these events when planning for the future. As an example, we’ve seen the confusion that arises when a single address is valid across two chains, yet the Segwit2x proposal intends to repeat the same mistake. Furthermore, BCH’s implementation of strong replay protection provided significant protection to users of both BCH, as well as Bitcoin, something Segwit2x does not plan on providing.
* Bitcoin’s consensus rules should only be changed sparingly and with broad agreement from the entire community. Segwit2x, in both its process and implementation, has been opposed by many. Bitcoin Core will continue to support the Segwit soft fork and we look forward to helping Bitcoin scale to new heights over the coming years.

I am so sorry but I have one more thing. Positive and negative feedback loops and time preference. In a negative feedback loop winds blow the bridge which in turn moves it slowly and the the movement slows the movement. Or something like that. In a [positive feedback loop]( the winds blow the bridge which in turn moves it more which in turn moves it more until systemic collapse of the bridge.
Anyhow very great fear and wacked out doomsday conspiracy speculation assumes an endless positive feedback loop. The reality is postive feedback usually is a temporary thing to move something far out of equilibrium into equilibrium. Event x causes power to go out which causes riots and all manner of things and power can never be restored which means, further collapse, etc. In reality, the longer power is out the more resources are fed into getting it restored. The worse the problem the more is done to fix it.
The same can be said for bitcoin annihilating debt. The interest rates if lending in bitcoin might be hundreds if not thousands or millions of percent but this is not permanent. Assuming a long history of deflation, one could assume that a system would be fairly close to zero on the number line I talked about earlier. It would be fairly stable and loans could happen.
Oh and one last thing is the fear that nobody will never spend because something will be cheaper later is dumb. Consider all sorts of dumb stuff like preorders and buying stuff right away. This desire will still be there but it will be tempered. Nobody in their right mind is going to say "I am about to buy this coffee at Dunkin Donuts but I know it will be 4 cents cheaper next year so I think I am going to skip it and never buy cofee." It is absurd to even say that out loud but this is exactly the main argument against deflation you will hear from very scholarly people.
Also consider the massive issue with today's population being unable to defer gratification. You look up time preference and how different demographics have different time preferences it will really stun you. Look up the marshmallow experiment. It explains an awful lot. Well a deflationary system would help correct this by punishing those with low (if i am remembering it correctly) time preferences and rewarding those with high time preference. I always confuse which is low ad high sorry. It might be the other way around. Essentially the opposite of what it is today.

 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

I am not exactly sure what you would like me to respond to. The reason for copy pasta is reproducing a clear and persuasive arugment can take a considerable amount of time and still be worse than the original. There are a few things I like to link that have changed my mind and thus I share them with others. Furthermore, I place a not insignificant chance of people I reply to being completely disinterested in anything I have to say, regardless of how I say it or argue one way or another. Not everyone is seeking the truth, i.e. that which is, and aligning with it. Many will refuse this at all costs.
So I guess one point is how hard forks by nature are not backwards compatible, [1]( a lot of significant infrastructure is currently and will likely be on a different network than the one btc1 (aka S2X), [2]( will be on and thus btc1 will be departing the network. This seems highly relevant and not debatable. I grow weary of trying to convince others but let me try to steel man your position as best as I can and then destroy it. What I understand from you ... you people is you think:
* there is some sort of overwhelming support for btc1. Certainly enough to dismiss any legacy infrastructure that does not run btc1. It is not just a few important people but many people from all strips.
* essentially only a clear majority of miners and nodes that transact the most such as exchanges really determine what not only the rules are but also what "bitcoin" is. If 90% of all bitcoin miners mine btc1 and most exchanges call btc1 bitcoin then bitc1 is bitcoin.
* because of the previous two, all the rest of us luddites will be forced to "upgrade" to btc1 to rejoin the network to participate in bitcoin. You also think this because you think btc1 will treat us like how bitcoin treated XT, Classic, Unlimited, and so on. Ultimately they had to bend the knee if they wanted to continue using bitcoin. You think we will have to bend the knee to continue using bitcoin.
* bitcoin core may have done some nice things in the past but now clearly present a clear threat to bitcoin and thus the loss of them is really a positive. Those that care about bitcoin will obviously continue to contribute to btc1.
I think this is total rubbish. Let me tell you what I think.
* there is astroturf support for btc1, mostly coming from those who risk going out of business if they don't innovate such as Erik Voorhees and his baby Shapeshift. I think that miners' incentives are on the timeframe of their electricity bills and the duration their hardware is not obselete. This timeframe is too short. I also think their interests are not aligned with users' interests or how bitcoin remains distributed and decentralized. I think there is mixed support for hard forks and overwhelming support against btc1.
* I think bitcoin is not a democracy and am pleased if miners who act against my interests exit the network, even if it is 90% of them. This is a feature to me. I do partially agree exchanges control branding but I will not concede the brand. If btc1 forks like ~~Bitcoin ABC~~ ~~Bitcoin Cash~~ ~~bcash~~ btrash and coinbase calls it bitcoin then so be it. We will be at perpetual warfare about this since I know they will lose in the end.
* You vastly misunderstand how hard forks work vs soft forks. The reason the BIP148 UASF was so powerful was because essentially everyone was onboard with segwit and it was backwards compatible. It was literally a boycott of all misbehaving miners. XT, Classic, Unlimited, and so on were not only backwards incompatible but also they did not have overwhelming support. btc1 will not be BIP148 but instead another bcash or XT. If the btc1 crowd backs down or proceeds to make an altcoin is outside of my realm of control and I don't particularly care one way or the other. I am vehemently opposed to the idea of btc1 ~~succeeding~~ taking the name bitcoin and thus will exit the entire cryptospace since if bitcoin cannot succeed with all it has going for it, then why would I risk so much of my earned capital, thousands of hours of my life saved up on dollars and bitcoin, on something inferior that clearly does not value censorship-resistance via the ability for every person in the network being able to verify and enforce the rules of the network. 
* Bitcoin Core
 *  is an open source project. Let me repeat that. Bitcoin Core is an open source project. How so many don't seem to understand that is beyond me. It is FOSS. Do people get all upset about about contributions to CentOS from RedHat people? Every single time you hear these garbage consirpaces substitute BSNorthCorea with "an open source project". Bitcoin Core is literally the best programmers, coders, and devs in the world. Think about it.
 * Bitcoin core has a stellar reputation and almost universally adopted and embraced because of their continual wise, patient, and conservative actions. Reputation is a currency you work your life for but others control. They have decades of earning their reputation, almost perfectly without mistakes. It is incredible really. Adam Back has earned his reputation. Learn about him. You or others may say condescendingly about how tribal humans are but the reality is sun shines, grass grows, and humans have intricate trust networks. And I trust the history of core vastly more than Ver, Jihan, Fake Satoshi, r btc, and the gigablocker crowd. I will *never* follow that crowd.
 * Bitcoin core is vital to bitcoin and I believe them when almost all of them say they will not touch btc1.
1. With hard forks, the previously invalid becomes valid while with softforks the previously valid becomes invalid. 
2. roughly 80% to 90% of all public nodes, which include miners, will reject btc1 blocks the second they do something invalid such as exercise the 2x part of S2X.

**Correcting misinformation on Segwit2x and btc1**
“Segwit2x”, a proposal for an incompatible change to the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network, has received increased exposure recently. There have been attempts to mislead people into believing that the btc1 project, the implementation of the Segwit2x proposal, is a necessary update to existing software—it is not. Instead, it is a contentious deviation from the existing network rules, and its users will soon find themselves disagreeing with the rest of the network about the validity of blocks and transactions.
Please be aware that:
* Segregated Witness (or Segwit, a soft fork which will be active within the coming days) is not related to the Segwit2x hard fork. Segregated Witness is backwards compatible with all previous Bitcoin software. For the vast majority of Bitcoin users, no action is required.
* bitcoincore.org is the official website and  is the official Twitter account of the Bitcoin Core project. Any other websites or Twitter accounts claiming to represent the project are fraudulent. Bitcoin Core is an open source project that welcomes contributions and review from anyone through its GitHub project. Bitcoin Core binaries can be obtained from bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org and are always digitally signed by the release manager’s signing key. The latest version of Bitcoin Core at the time of writing is 0.14.2.
* btc1 is not connected to Bitcoin Core in any way. No regular Bitcoin Core contributors support btc1 or have any connection to the project, nor were any involved in the design of its proposed hard fork.
* We strongly advise users not to download any Bitcoin full-node software claiming to be an ‘upgrade’ to Bitcoin’s consensus rules without carefully considering the impact of the proposed changes on the Bitcoin system and the level of community support for it. This includes proposed consensus changes in new releases of Bitcoin Core.
* While it is difficult to determine what the broader Bitcoin community supports, be wary of claims suggesting the large and diverse Bitcoin community is moving entirely to one fork or another, without independent verification. Sign-on letters have been used by companies claiming to represent their clients/users without their agreement, and have often used imprecise and misleading language. In the past, letters for Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited, as well as others, have been circulated to indicate general support of an idea, while being trumpeted as commitments to run software irrespective of community considerations, only to be dropped some months later.
* Concerns raised by Bitcoin Core contributors and Bitcoin community members about the Segwit2x proposal have not been adequately addressed by its proponents. The details of the proposal were established before Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness activation, and before the recent creation of the BCH currency. It is irresponsible to ignore the outcome of these events when planning for the future. As an example, we’ve seen the confusion that arises when a single address is valid across two chains, yet the Segwit2x proposal intends to repeat the same mistake. Furthermore, BCH’s implementation of strong replay protection provided significant protection to users of both BCH, as well as Bitcoin, something Segwit2x does not plan on providing.
* Bitcoin’s consensus rules should only be changed sparingly and with broad agreement from the entire community. Segwit2x, in both its process and implementation, has been opposed by many. Bitcoin Core will continue to support the Segwit soft fork and we look forward to helping Bitcoin scale to new heights over the coming years.

Segwit **was** the compromise, silly.
Segwit could have been implemented such that the blocks remained roughly 1MB. I would have preferred it since I realize no concessions to reckless antinode gigablockers was or is necessary. They can be safely ignored. After all...
**Blocks are too large right now:**
^by ^Luke ^Dashjr
* Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
Despite this, **Core developers have conceded all possible block size increase compromises.** The soft limit default was raised prematurely, and now even segwit is proposed with a block size increase to 2-3 MB. Further increases are beyond the control of developers and miners, and require consent from the entire community.
**No block size increase is needed now.** All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient.
**No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future.** Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.
Personally, **I expect that another block size increase will be necessary eventually.** But that's several years (decades perhaps) away, and hopefully the problems outlined in the first paragraph will resolve themselves by then.
At the end of the day, **the decision for hardforks is made by the community as a whole**, and no niche group (whether that be developers, miners, or anyone else) can force it on the network. Most of the community has rejected bigblocker hardfork proposals, and even a recent minimal increase proposal by myself (set 7 years into the future) saw significant opposition. **Polls show that at this time, no block size hardfork is acceptable.** Hopefully this will change in the future, at least when we begin to need it.
While [much R&amp;D has been done]( (mostly by the Core team) toward such a future hardfork, **today, hardforks are not safe.** GIven a few years more on this research, it should be possible to make an *uncontroversial* hardfork equally as safe as a softfork. (Perhaps this will improve community acceptance of a hardfork.)
Note: Bitcoin Core is an open source project with many independent people working on it. There is no formal/organized development team, only contributors. As such, while I think most developers would agree with at least most of the facts and opinions presented here, **I speak only for myself.**
EDIT: Furthermore **any concessions you give to ~~people~~ confused or malicious actors who think that the rate the blockchain grows over time needs to increase each time they arbitrarily think bitcoin needs to "scale" is a pointless effort since they will discount it and immediately move the goal post as is shown by the 2x movement and the post you just replied to.**

People don't want to be mechanics in order to be able to drive their car. People don't want to be computer scientists, classical economists, security researchers, etc to be able to hold and send money.
In 20 years Bitcoin will be what PGP (pretty good privacy) is today: a mostly unused but amazing technology. Only a tiny few will ever use bitcoin and it will be kinda worthless because of it.
Also freedom turns out to be a very unnatural and high energy state like a very reactive element. Distributed and decentralized systems just don't work very well.

Welcome to reddit, It appears you have some confusion as to what "core" is as well as what "open source" means. Allow me to clear this up.
Here is some starter information about Bitcoin Core:
* Bitcoin Core is an open source project which maintains and releases Bitcoin client software called “Bitcoin Core”.
* It is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous Bitcoin whitepaper.
* Bitcoin Core consists of both “full-node” software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet. The project also currently maintains related software such as the cryptography library libsecp256k1 and others located at GitHub.
* Anyone can contribute to Bitcoin Core.
And here is some starter information on Open-source software (OSS):
* The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.
* A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public.
* The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code.
* "Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term free and open-source software (FOSS).

As far as I understand it you are correct here.
You may notice that civility tends to break down when someone spouts propaganda for a hostile takeover attempt from unscrupulous outsiders. Do you know what you call people you can't talk to? Enemies. One of the quickest ways of becoming enemies is trying to take over and destroy something they love.
If you are not sure of how B2X will play out, waiting it out in something else like fiat is probably a swell idea. You said that you don't understand why increasing the rate that the bitcoin blockchain grows over time is a bad idea. I could mention that when people say "*we should increase the blocksize in order for bitcoin to scale*" are also saying "*the burden of nodes needs to increase whenever ~~I arbitrarily think bitcoin needs to scale~~ bitcoin has full blocks*." But I won't bother with any of that. Instead I present you with

Kind is related to kin, a word for family. When you treat everyone kindly and as the same with no sides you are deliberately trying to nullify an immutable category structure itself. If you treat strangers, enemies, and just random people as your family you are also treating your family as strangers, enemies, and just random people.

So this might sound silly but I don't think you two are talking about the same thing.
Recently, the capacity of the network is at least doubled but the actual "block size" has not changed. Bitcoin transactions are not actually smaller and older nodes still never add blocks bigger than 1MB. Ya see increasing the "block size" cannot be done in a manner that is backwards compatible and changes that aren't backwards compatible have not happened in a long time. Due to certain actors taking advantage of Bitcoin's requirement for consensus, or something very close to it, a very nasty taste has been left in the mouths of people. Many such as myself were fine with hard forks but no longer are. The environment bitcoin is in now is not the same one 6 years ago. I share view that we may never have a change to the network that is backwards incompatible and thus will never actually see a "block size" increase.
However we have already seen effectively the capacity of each block increased with SegWit. I am glad you have discovered Core, an open source project, as well. They have been really awesome. The open source model in its design never cease to amaze me. Anyhow being an opt-in technology this increase will work as quickly or slowly as the demand for greater transaction throughput is, which isn't the sky-falling hype some have led others into thinking. This demand for an increased capacity increase just mostly  isn't there. By the way, be wary of people throwing caution to the wind and telling you some aspect of bitcoin much change right away and in reckless manner. History has not been kind to those who listen to them.
So I guess in summary, I 
* agree with Uzibread that I don't think the block size will increase
* think your credibility is damaged by using such strong statements yet ambiguous statements when speculating about the future
* and I too look forward to the open source development project has to scale bitcoin in a manner that does not compromise its censorship resistance.

 Hoarding Bitcoins, and No You Can’t Have Any
^^by ^^Daniel ^^Krawisz
**If You Sell Bitcoins, You Aren’t “Selling” Bitcoins**
I’m sure you’ve heard a story like this. “I’ve been going to all the local stores and telling them how awesome Bitcoin is! But none of them wants to take payments in Bitcoin! Why don’t they like it?”
Let’s think about that for a minute. You are essentially telling the merchant, “Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it!” Not actually much of a sales pitch, is it? Why would the merchant want something that you, apparently, don’t want? If you really want him to start accepting bitcoins himself, ask him, “Do you take worthless paper money at this store? Good, because you’re not getting a satoshi from me!” That will convince him that you think they’re valuable. 
How about this instead? Tell your local merchants that you want to be able to spend cash in their stores and get the change in bitcoins. That’s the kind of store I’d like to shop at. And then when the merchant later says “I’m not going to do that anymore. I want you to pay me in bitcoins!” you know he’s become a true hoarder. 
**Hoarders Give Bitcoin Value**
The initial price of bitcoin was caused by people who wanted to hold it, not people who wanted to spend it. Furthermore, each subsequent step in Bitcoin’s advance must begin with more holders, not more spenders. The business that...

EZYCYKA said that Steve Ballmer is  moron. I counted that not only is this incorrect but also that he should be ashamed for his vulgarity and mis-characterization. What I wrote is never addressed. by anyone.
juanjux comes to EZYCYKA's defense, I think, stating that Microsoft was "incredibly successful, almost monopolistic" before Mr. Ballmer, implying it wasn't after. I attempt to counter this, converting criticisms to strengths and use numbers from the most popular encyclopedia as a backup. I expand how I think the behavior of calling people that you disagree with  morons should be heavily criticized. Again, what I wrote goes unaddressed by all.
Now you, kurokame, are saying what exactly? That the bully Microsoft is nothing like the superior Linux and ... ? That this wouldn't be the case if Ballmer wasn't the CEO? If Bill Gates stayed on there wouldn't be a problem? That we should vilify Steve Ballmer because he isn't Linus Torvalds? That "incredibly successful, almost monopolistic" is the wrong counter point to me?

Almost every business, such as Valve or Microsoft, that "accepts bitcoin" actually immediately converts bitcoin to fiat. What they are doing is allowing you to realtime trade your bitcoin for fiat and buy the good in fiat. In their view, they are allowing you to offload the inferior currency bitcoin to purchase their goods while they get the same amount of fiat for it. The small fee they would pay to a credit card company or paypal simply goes instead to Bitpay for the conversion. It is also a bit of a marketing gimmick.
The reasons companies do this are many but one of them is the idea of cashflow. Your purchase is a drop in flowing liquid. They have to convert 99% of your purchase to the inputs that created that purchase. Those inputs which are all in fiat.
What overstock is doing is remarkable and a pro bitcoin thing to do. A company holding 50% of their bitcoin revenue is bullish. Like really bullish. They are essentially taking risks saying they will deplete their fiat cash holdings in order to amass bitcoin cash holdings.

It is nice to say freedom of choice. It rolls off the lips and sounds great. Who, especially in this subreddit *isn't* for freedom of choice? Perhaps ~~you are being dishonest~~ more is at play here.
In reality it is the [restrictions]( on choice that give bitcoin its value and there are many circumstances where freedom of choice is absurd. Would you support my freedom of choose to steal your belongings? How about my freedom of choice to harm you? Obviously not. Instead you can promote freedom of choice within a limited and restricted framework. Speaking categorically, you are taking the properties of the thing and applying it to the container that holds the thing, all the while pretending you are not. Anyhow, by doing this you called anyone that seeks to protect the network (i.e.Bitcoin) as an enemy of freedom of choice. Not cool.
Remember folks that bitcoin will not be splitting in November. There will still be only one network and only 21*(10^6) bitcoins. Further do be careful of ~~snakes~~ people like using your favorite terminology and ideas to sow discord and confusion. The best scammers get the scammed to be scammers  too.

**Blocks are too large right now:**
* Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.
Despite this, **Core developers have conceded all possible block size increase compromises.** The soft limit default was raised prematurely, and now even segwit is proposed with a block size increase to 2-3 MB. Further increases are beyond the control of developers and miners, and require consent from the entire community.
**No block size increase is needed now.** All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient.
**No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future.** Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.
Personally, **I expect that another block size increase will be necessary eventually.** But that's several years (decades perhaps) away, and hopefully the problems outlined in the first paragraph will resolve themselves by then.
At the end of the day, **the decision for hardforks is made by the community as a whole**, and no niche group (whether that be developers, miners, or anyone else) can force it on the network. Most of the community has rejected bigblocker hardfork proposals, and even a recent minimal increase proposal by myself (set 7 years into the future) saw significant opposition. **Polls show that at this time, no block size hardfork is acceptable.** Hopefully this will change in the future, at least when we begin to need it.
While [much R&amp;D has been done]( (mostly by the Core team) toward such a future hardfork, **today, hardforks are not safe.** GIven a few years more on this research, it should be possible to make an *uncontroversial* hardfork equally as safe as a softfork. (Perhaps this will improve community acceptance of a hardfork.)
Note: Bitcoin Core is an open source project with many independent people working on it. There is no formal/organized development team, only contributors. As such, while I think most developers would agree with at least most of the facts and opinions presented here, **I speak only for myself.**

If you are running on a laptop, have bandwith issues, or something it is perfectly acceptable to prune. It is a feature that is available. I will state that pruning is to allow more people to be nodes, not reduce the number of archival nodes.
A pruned node can inspect blocks like a careful goldsmith inspects for fools gold. You inspect these blocks not just for yourself but others you share the information with. You just can't help anyone else become a goldsmith.
If the costs are not too great it would be best if you ran an archival node that had the entire blockchain though.

Most simply because it is false. Segwit as implemented allows for a capacity increase more than double the old 1MB block size. The maximim theoretical "block size" is already 4MB. B2X increases that theoretical maximum "block size" to 8MB. 
"B2X increases the block size to 2MB" disregards the concessions made by core and me via Segwit as it has been implemented. Segwit does a lot of things and only one of them is allow for the effective increase of thoughput by at least double. This was of course almost immediately disregarded, as you have done, and the goal posts moved to frame B2X as some sort of compromise. As adoption of segwit increases (currently roughly 10%) so does the possible "block size".
A slightly less dishonest gigablocker might point out that the throughput in November would be increasing from probably 1.2MB to 2.4MB but firstly it is actually the possible throughput and secondly it increases over time. Changes take time and there is literally no rush to increase capacity, especially by way of backward incompatible hard forking.
B2X, assuming it gets off the ground, will be another dishonest altcoin like BCH.
Firstly, unless you are running a very old core node or compatible, the sizes of blocks are measured by blockweight. Technically the blocks will still appear to

It turns out changing the mining algo to allow CPU mining would be a terrible idea. The following is a long read but excellent.
The absolute skinny is nearly nothing is ASIC proof given enough value and any gains we have made thus far will have to be made again.  With ASICs basically already at the limits of what is possible (7nanometers), it is only a matter of time for the centralization to ease up some. There will always be some centralization though of course.
Also, bitcoin would be vastly less secure with going back to CPU mining because of bot nets then GPU mining where you have hundreds and soon thousands of other currencies competing. Think EDA crap with bcash.

* You should HODL.

These two statements are recommendations that the OP points out can come into conflict with each other.
Previous state: Your net worth is $50k. You determine you can afford to lose 10% and thus you sink up to 5k into bitcoin.
Current state: Your net worth is $200k. You determine you can afford to lose 10% and thus you are massively over leveraged or something with your 155k sunk into bitcoin. Your afford to lose category is actually around 75%, vastly higher than 10%. Therefore you are not heeding the advice of not investing more than you are willing to lose.

 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

Furthermore, since most transactions are already not in the chain lightning networks could actually *increase* your security. A lightning network can be configured with exchanges such that if they are compromised or in anyway try to steal your bitcoin, it will come back to you. Very cool.
Even still, lightning networks afford parties increased privacy. You can have transactions happen without them actually going on the permanent and public blockchain. Be wary of anyone pushing the "lightning networks are a hostile takeover" narrative. They are either ill informed or malicious.

Cost averaging using an automatic investment of your income is a smart behavior. You might be kicking yourself with your 20/20 hindsight that you didn't invest more, but that always happens. It is easy to make judgments from the future. Cost averaging part of your income is a sound investment strategy. You can look up Dollar Cost Averaging or DCA to learn more. While you are at it, it might not hurt to cost average other things like into a mutual fund of stocks or index funds, gold, emergency fund, etc.
Having said all this, be wary of investment advice. Many professions are lousy at it and so are many amateurs (such as myself).

 Hoarding Bitcoins, and No You Can’t Have Any
^^by ^^Daniel ^^Krawisz 
Those nasty hoarders! You know the ones. They won’t use bitcoins because they think they’ll be worth so much more later. But how can we convince businesses to accept bitcoins if no one will spend them? We need to guilt those hoarders into spending their bitcoins to support the merchants!
**If You Sell Bitcoins, You Aren’t “Selling” Bitcoins**
I’m sure you’ve heard a story like this. “I’ve been going to all the local stores and telling them how awesome Bitcoin is! But none of them wants to take payments in Bitcoin! Why don’t they like it?”
Let’s think about that for a minute. You are essentially telling the merchant, “Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it!” Not actually much of a sales pitch, is it? Why would the merchant want something that you, apparently, don’t want? If you really want him to start accepting bitcoins himself, ask him, “Do you take worthless paper money at this store? Good, because you’re not getting a satoshi from me!” That will convince him that you think they’re valuable.
How about this instead? Tell your local merchants that you want to be able to spend cash in their stores and get the change in bitcoins. That’s the kind of store I’d like to shop at. And then when the merchant later says “I’m not going to do that anymore. I want you to pay me in bitcoins!” you know he’s become a true hoarder.
**Hoarders Give Bitcoin Value**
The initial price of bitcoin was caused by people who wanted to hold it, not people who wanted to spend it. Furthermore, each subsequent...

a. the one worth less to you
b. the one worth more to you
The correct answer is a. This is [Gresham's Law]( in action. When you spend bitcoin when you could have spent dollars or some other currency you demonstrate you value bitcoin less. This is especially the case since spending bitcoin is almost always more costly than spending dollars. For example I literally get extra money from my bank when I use my credit card. I also have built in fraud protection with my credit card.
It raises the question of why do you even own any bitcoin if you value it less than dollars.

I realize that if you want Bitcoin Cash to become Bitcoin then having people remove the Bitcoin part of the name is not helpful.
Here's the thing though. BTC, or Bitcoin Settlement or Bitcoin BSNorthCorea or whatever you might call it, is backwards compatible to bitcoin. BCH or bcash as I like to call it is not. It is therefore on the fork to ensure there is consensus or at least something resembling consensus. Since BCH is contentious, the opposite of consensus, having Bitcoin in the name creates ambiguity and could confuse new users. It is my position that deliberate dishonesty like this is deceitful. Also it is this sub's position to call Bitcoin Cash bcash. [source](
I am a very forgiving person but I assure you that you will get nothing but resistance until you either A) gain consensus with backwards compatible nodes so they upgrade (not likely) or fork off as honestly as possible in the friendliest of terms. You can look at Litecoin as an example of how to do it correctly. You and your people do this and I might actually, for the first time ever, diversify from my Bitcoin into an altcoin. Your altcoin. I will also be friendly toward ~~your~~ our coin.
You haven't done this. You are being deceitful. You are working against bitcoin. You referred to what I wrote as gibberish. You called me a bot. So ya know what, you and your worthless coin can take a hike.
Ninja edit. Oh yeah.

Accepting 0-conf transactions is unwise due to a very real possibility of fraud. Wait for at least 1 conformation at the very least. 6 conf is much better. Generally speaking, I wouldn't recommend accepting 0-conf bitcoin transactions to anyone I cared about, with the exception of smaller amounts among people you already trust. You can always build faster transactions for your coffee on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin will likely be several things such as the base layer of all money or a [settlement network](
Pushing merchant adoption prior to people wanting bitcoin will be like pushing fat rope through a skinny hole. As more people want bitcoin merchant adoption will just [happen like magic]( My one hesitation is for the exceptionally tiny group of responsible people (e.g. [DerrickJ]( who have been unfairly locked out of the banking system but have a lot of bitcoin. Your futile and costly struggle may make very small gains here and there for those people in the short term.
Spending or selling bitcoin is generally unwise in the shortrun. Taking a little money off the table when your unrealized gains become very high is fine. Liquidating some of your holdings to take care of events as they come up is also fine. Ideally you want to build your holdings over time in order to transport an undervalued bitcoin in the present to a highly valued bitcoin in the future. Generally speaking, I wouldn't recommend selling or spending bitcoin to anyone I cared about.

Don't rush. Get an account at one of the major exchanges like Coinbase. Buy less than a whole bitcoin. Setup and get comfortable with a wallet. Send some of your coins to your wallet. Buy more. 2 or 3 bitcoin is actually a fairly hefty amount these days. Best to start small like .05 bitcoin or something. Just so you familiar. Cost averaging is a great way reduce any risk of price volatility.
Obviously I do think buying bitcoin is smart, but patience is very important. Sorry if that was not helpful. Do give bitcoin.org a gander. They have a lot of good information including a [list]( of decent wallets. I use Bitcoin Core myself for my desktop.

GDAX/Coinbase has been a reliable exchange and trading platform for quite some time. They have been a force for good in easing the transition from centralized and inflationary fiat to bitcoin. For example my bank is directly linked to Coinbase where I can see my personal Coinbase balances within my bank's website.
If or when they stop using bitcoin I will certainly stop using them. Regardless I may look into perhaps less hostile exchanges in the future. I suspect all exchanges will have the same incentives and thus similar inclinations though. They probably just have better PR (propaganda).
Also for the record, as far as I know Coinbase has not taken any stand on S2X by the way. The only statement I have read thus far was by DCG, a different company. Digital Currency Group (DCG) is Barry E. Silbert's venture capital company focusing on the digital currency market.

Firstly, I don't like your implication that the responsibility for u CSI_Tech_Dept  to understand bitcoin is actually mine. My response was plenty good enough and if you want to improve you are certainly welcome at it.
Secondly, I agree that that is a good thread from that link. Even u justsomebadadvice, who is notoriously antinode/antiBIP148/proB2X or in other words anti-bitcoin, has some decent points.
The two issues I take with the crowd aligning itself with bigger blocks is
1. There is literally no rush. Stop rushing. We will literally never, ever get a hard fork to a bigger block size if you keep rushing it. Besides there is compelling evidence that suggests the supposed requirement for bigger blocks was a [spam attack]( Regardless, the sooner they collectively realize you can't rush some change onto the network, **especially a backwards incompatible one**, the sooner they might actually get their way.
2. When people say they want the blocksize (or now blockweight) to double they are also saying other things. Unfortunately when they say this they are also saying that **the rate the blockchain grows over time needs to increase each time they arbitrarily think bitcoin needs to "scale"**. Furthermore ^^I ^^love ^^this ^^word people that say this are also stating that they think **the burden imposed on nodes over time should be increased** at a time so young in bitcoin's life, when the number of nodes is relatively low, and almost universally against the devs' (in the open source project for bitcoin that is known as core) judgment. They **refuse to address or acknowledge that nodes (which miners a sub 1% of) have ultimate control of the network**. These fools think I will keep paying miners if they decide against my will to dig in the figurative desert. They also don't get that I and others have voluntary and willingly chosen core and not the other way around.
3. There are of course other issues but who has time to write an article in response to a a random redditor.

He may be an honest man but he certainly ins't open enough to tell you.
In his book, The Art of the Deal, he describes a process of putting things back on the negotiating table. If only two letters of the alphabet, say b &amp; c, are on the table then negotiation can be hard. Each person doesn't feel happy about it and don't make a deal. Remember that both people have to be ok with a deal for it to happen.
If you put *all* the letters back on the table then the other person can start taking them off one by one. When you finally get a deal you get one where you still got your letter b &amp; c but you possibly got more and generally both persons are happier about it.

I am not sure what metric you would use to define success, but by definition a hard fork needs consensus to remain bitcoin. Only people that physically download and run new code will be using S2X. All the older nodes and infrastructure will reject it... because it is a hard fork... obviously. I don't think I am going out on a limb by saying there is zero chance of S2X somehow being bitcoin. If you are concerned do give [this]( a read. It is great at clearing the fog of uncertainty for these types of things.
Having said this, I am very interested in how S2X plays out considering it has support from DCG and some miners which is somewhat influential. They are not insignificant. Perhaps we get bitcoin3 (assuming bcash was bitcoin2) and it has some future use. Maybe it could be successful doing something different than bitcoin. All these things are unknowable but at the end of the day all cryptocurrencies compete for electricity. There will only be bitcoin and S2X isn't it.

SegWit2x demonstrates exactly what many of us were thinking. There literally is no compromise possible. SegWit didn't have to be a blocksize increase. It could have been implemented as net neutral or even as a block size reduction.
When ~~reckless gigablocker fanatics~~ respected people such as seek a block size increase you should translate it to:


The argument isn't bitcoin can't handle 8MB blocks. The argument is bitcoin can't handle increasing the size the blockchain grows whenever it needs to scale. Stop trying to compromise with infinity.

I will make two things very clear for you though.
1. There are not two bitcoins or two versions of bitcoin. Beware of anything else that is attempting to trick others such as yourself into thinking it is bitcoin. If you are in doubt, as you seem to be, bitcoin.org will keep you sorted out.
2. There is no "both sides". This implies like two teams in a soccer match or something. There is only consensus. There are groups that want to mascaraed their will as consensus or others that want to destroy bitcoin but they aren't another "side".

In response to the UASF of BIP148, some people who thought they controlled bitcoin colluded together to do something called SegWit2x.

**What is a 'Speculator'**
A speculator is a person who trades derivatives, commodities, bonds, equities or currencies with a higher than average risk in return for a higher-than-average profit potential. Speculators take large risks, especially with respect to anticipating future price movements, in the hope of making quick, large gains.
Hodlers are [investors]( "hodlers" are speculators.

reply was massively simplified answer and partially incorrect even so since B2X is not increasing the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB.
[This]( might be a semi decent summary of the spirit of BIP148. BIP148 was the user activated soft fork (UASF) that would force miners to activate their miner activated soft (MASF) fork BIP141 that had been stalled by a rather centralized and hostile group of miners for a very long time. "The UASF" aka BIP148 is the reaction to people realizing miners were bad actors and had a very limited scope of power.
In a paniced response to BIP148, the bad actors colluded in a closed meeting in a hostel in New York to come to an "agreement". They therefore agreed to implement Segwit if in a few months a hard fork happened to double the capacity again. The narrative they wish others to belive is they, those 13 something people own bitcoin and they merely compromised with us. It is beyond laughable. Miners can go dig in a desert in Utah but they are waisting their time if nobody pays them. They think they are the king of bitcoin when in reality they are literally the easily replaceable employee. The moment one miner or all the miners do something invalid, the nodes we run will ban them.
This is a very limited summary. Someone could make a TV series about bitcoin. There would be several seasons worth of material in 2017 alone. this is also a great read:

 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean by sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

I'm aware. I am also aware what you are defending is misinformation. The best thing to do is not to double down but to stop doing that.
I incur zero fees if I interact with my bank in a responsible manner. I literally get paid to use my credit card. Every time I move bitcoin I pay for it. I want more infrastructure built around bitcoin not less. Bitcoin has very strict restrictions. Almost everything in the infographic is wrong.
My credit card is *always* nearly instant and handles fraud like a champ. My checks take slightly longer but I don't care because they are budgeted and used with trusted parties like my church or the sweet old couple that are my landlords. Bitcoin right now does a pisspoor job competing with these things. Buy and read "The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifedean Ammous to find out why bitcoin is awesome.

The two examples you used are Charlie Shrem and Jeff Garzik. I like Alex B's [comment]( about those people:






The purpose of SegWit being rolled out in a backwards incompatible way is so not everyone has to use it. SegWit *never* needs to reach 100% adoption. And for the purpose of implementing segwit so you can use it, it did only take a few months after BIP148 was used and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread by SegWit has been in the core client since 0.16. If you want to use SegWit you are welcome to use it. If you are talking about speculation of how long other people will start using segwit then most people I followed here and elsewhere never said a month.

Let's do it!
I get my money deposited from the good people I work for into my bank's checking account about four times a month. There is no fee for this. I spend money via a credit card and physical checks. Both of these have zero fees. Also my bank refunds ATM fees but I generally don't use cash because... At the end of the month a get some money back (i.e. I get extra money) for making my purchases using my credit card. Then. and only then, I buy bitcoin with the extra unused money. This, of course, has a fee.
You lose some of your wealth every single time you want to move bitcoin. It doesn't matter if you want to move it to another of your wallets or someone else's wallet. It doesn't matter if you want to move it quickly or at other's convenience. It doesn't matter. Each and every time you move bitcoin you will lose some of your wealth to some miners who craft a valid block. Ouch.

I think you may be confused. I will happily help you sort this out even though you don't sound interested. You used the word imposter incorrectly. For one thing being first is not part of the definition. Facebok com could have been around before or after Facebook com but it still would be an imposter if and only if it was tried to pretend to be the real Facebook. Secondly you compared a company with a multinational conglomerate. Not all comparasons are imposters. Not all similar things are imposters. Furthermore just because two companies or entities provide some of the same services as one another does not mean somehow one is an imposter of the other.
Oakleys you buy for $20 from a sketchy vender in Afghanistan is an imposter. It may look like the real thing and the dude selling you might even think it is the real thing but it is not. If you look casually they look real. They have the Oakley logo and look fairly close. If you look closely you will notice the logo isn't quite right and it crudely done. The pair will be far less durable. They probably don't actually provide any UVA or UVB protection. They probably aren't polarized. The pair of "Oakleys" is actually not a pair at all.
Shitcoins start with bitcoin and introduce some flaws by changing some variable or two. They then market the flaws as somehow better or more "innovative". They will say how "development" is stagnant on bitcoin and their shitcoin of choice is so much better because of x, y, and z flaws. Flocks of careless and ignorant people will be attracted to these shitcoins like flies.
Time will teach you that there is literally just Bitcoin and its imposters. Hopefully the lesson is only just painful enough to guide others.
P.S. oh and for the record, no, Bitcoin is not a horrible waste of resources at the moment. Just because you don't understand or don't like why something is being used a certain way does not mean is a horrible waste of resources.

Yes, both are accomplished with Charlie being the creator of Jaxx wallet and Jeff being on the board of directors of the linux foundation.

I have never heard of that Alex. You are welcome to call these people liars, fools, mistaken, whatever. They do *not* represent this subreddit.
Having read the two tweets in full I generally agree with you concerning those tweets.  Jeff Garzik and Shadow Puppet are exactly right:




Jeff Garzik


Shadow Puppet
I don't feel compelled to find you anything since I don't recall anyone that I respect or has been well received on this subreddit making claims that segwit would be implemented in a short timeframe like a month. I honestly started searching but stopped after several minutes when I realized I am searching for your claim. Certainly anyone with flair or a moderator of this subreddit wouldn't be saying Segwit adoption would happen in a month and thus massive tx throughput increases so fast. It seemed to me everyone understood that the rollout would take some time (much longer than a month).
Having said this I do now see the confusion and possible deception that was probably very real and felt like betrayal. I have no doubt someone used the argument of segwit being an effective blocksize increase that will be immediate. Implementing segwit so you can use it did happen rather rapidly once BIP148 was enforced by the economic majority of nodes. Getting a high adoption of segwit, the carrot for then big blockers, is still perhaps only halfway there. These things are easily to ambiguously screw up. Segwit has taken and will take a long time to roll out since demand is for higher tx throughput is low. The ability to use segwit on bitcoin, and thus enjoy its many benefits, has been here for a long time. In your first post I thought you were talking about segwit transactions existing on mainnet and only now realize you are talking about mainnet having (nearly) only segwit tx.
If I am not mistaken bockchain.info is merging with the bcash (i.e. fraudulent altcoin) site bitcoin.com. I do not expect blockchain.info to adopt segwit until it is vastly beyond necessary for them.
Peace and prosperity to you.

 the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.
The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.
Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

Well you are the perfect candidate for cloud mining. Full of assumptions and in need of hand holding, you don't want to do any work, just want to give someone else your money and forget about it while you watch your "profits" go up.
Unfortunately no one in their right mind would sell (or lease) an asset such as mining power for less than they expect it to earn for them. This means that while you can "take part" in cloud mining, all you're really do is at best making someone else an bigger profit faster or at worst you're just funding a ponzi scheme.

This is a pointless conversation.
The increase I am talking about is not due to extension blocks. If you would like to find out more about extension blocks you can from Matt Corallo in his [post](
The increase I am talking about is due to Segregated Witness. Segwit, being a backwards compatible change, allows old nodes and new nodes to continue to operate on the same network.
Now that segwit is active on the network, the old nodes:
* continue to see a max of just 1MB blocks as valid
* do not fully understand everything in the network and thus
* are not quite as sovereign as newer nodes, though still more than SPV clients
Now that segwit is active on the network, the new nodes:
* see up to 4MB blocks for a specially crafted block or generally like 2MB for normal traffic as valid
* fully understands the network and thus
* are the most sovereign entity in the network
Of course none of this matters to [big block numpties]( who want to frame B2X as "2MB Bitcoin" and bitcoin as "Core controlled 1MB bitcoin" since they will be universally rejected by both old and new nodes in harmonious unity. B2X is not bitcoin. B2X is not a different version of bitcoin. B2X, assuming it gets off the ground, is another altcoin that I look forward to adding to the graveyard of forced consensus failures.

You don't pay taxes on dollars and you don't pay taxes on bitcoin. Instead you pay taxes on things like sales, income, or real estate. If the shoe fits by all means pay taxes, or don't, but bitcoin is only tangentially related. I have personally not really encountered a scenario where I would pay taxes because of bitcoin but that is mostly because I have a job that pays in fiat, sales tax when I buy things in bitcoin are handled by the business, and I don't pay taxes because one currency changes in value to another. When the Euro falls in relation to the dollar that isn't a "capital gain" or "dividend" and I certainly don't pay taxes on it lol.

One gem from this is around the 51 to 53 minute mark where sidechains are argued to possibly be the only scaling solution due to the unending argument about the costs of running a node.
I don't care about the sidechain part of that argument as much as the idea that the costs of running a node is the only topic everything else revolves around and is not solvable by changing the costs of running a node. There will *always* be some based folks like Luke Dashjr wanting smaller costs and there will always be crazy nuts wanting increased costs.

Something being a solution, or presumed to be a solution, to some other problem does not prevent  it from being a problem.


I am glad to hear you agree. I see you quoted my first paragraph where I referred to cancer as a natural phenomenon, which it is of course, but what you may not have noticed is I referred to it as a mostly acts of god or nature what have you. You do draw an interesting comparison when you say there are components to cancer that are preventable but it doesn't seem like a fair comparison. For one, when you choose to smoke you, well, choose to do it. When the Federal Reserve and states choose to destroy wealth you have no choice in this regard. And before you say you also have no choice about a hurricane destroying your house, a hurricane does not have agency like a person or a group of persons does. It is like I would not have righteous anger at an earthquake that enslaved/trapped someone in a house for three days but I would if you had enslaved/trapped someone in a house for three days.
I am afraid i am not going to continue the conversation further. Ultimately I did not like your comparison for whatever reason and did not think it contributed so I downvoted it.

The famous 51% attack is very difficult (I would say impossible) to sustain.

I am not sure how you can possibly say this with a straight face. ^Did ^you ^have ^a ^straight ^face? SegWit is nearly universally seen as a positive addition to bitcoin by any metric you can come up with. The only issue people seem to have with SegWit comes from my "blocks are too big" camp and even we are mostly on board because of the elimination of tx malleability and a slowdown of the [UTXO growth]( And yet...
Miners [abuse]( core's MASF power to act against our interests. They do this even while the most predominate miners agreed to activate segwit nearly 2 years ago. They do this as mining becomes ever more centralized. They do this as essentially the only maker of ASICs (aka the gateway to being able to mine) [is cheating other miners]( while blocking any efforts to scale, and putting [killswitches]( into his hardware.

They, as a group, have proven themselves consistently as competent coders, designers, and engineers acting in good faith. You are free to point out undesirable outcomes or mistakes they may have made; however, painting them so poorly with such a broad brush results with all the paint on you and none on them.
You mentioned Eglin AFB. I am really like the United States Air Force and are proud of them, including the men and women serving at Eglin Air Force Base.

If by stalled you mean installed yes. Instead of implementing SegWit as agreed, the miners promoted Bitcoin Classic.

The USAF of BIP148 isn't essentially about segwit. It is about how segwit had years of testing, millions worth of development hours put into it, is nearly universally accepted by any metric I have seen and yet a pesky miner problem holds everyone ransom for higher fees. It is about the mistaken idea that miners are some authority users need to beg instead of literally the employees paid in full by users. It's about how Miner Activated Soft Forks were a [mistake]( It's about making covert ASICBoost impossible for (essentially) the sole manufacturer of the equipment necessary to mine bitcoin. It is about keeping bitcoin resilient.
Of course it is also about segwit too: an engineering marvel, a complete and permanent fix to tx malleability, a curb on [UXTO bloat]( an avenue for decentralized offchain scaling solutions, as well as of course a direct onchain scaling solution.

Why, all of a sudden and right after UASF became unstopable, was there some special meeting where the ever centralizing miners, for the second time in bitcoin's history, pledged to implement SegWit? UASF only requires 51% to avoid a chain split and works with even far less hashpower. Yet they promised 80% hashpower. Think about this.
I don't enforce BIP148 merely because I like SegWit.

SegWit as deployed in BIP148 breaks any possibility for covert ASICBoost and gives an immediate scaling boost (even though that is not SegWit's primary feature). You are correct in that there is a miner centralization issue. It will be slightly addressed [in August]( when SegWit is implemented but clearly this will be the topic to discuss for the next 2-6 years or until it is resolved. Firstly I don't till I will ever run code that contains a [MASF]( again. Anyhow that is all a conversation after August since we do not know if miners will decide to split the chain or not.
Do note that SegWit can be implemented in such a way as to not break covert ASICBoost (such as BIP149) so be learly of any future promises to implement SegWit. All the "solutions" and "compromises" you are suddenly seeing and will see in the next couple months are a lame attempt to derail the UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:23:35


Doesn't sound so bad to me. If you care about ASICBoost, SegWit, and the miner issue that is developing, you will enforce BIP148. If you do not and end up eating the consequences then it will become a learning opportunity. Your "worst" case scenario sounds dandy to me.

I am not going to have a bitcoin where I have cross my fingers and hope Jihan plays nice. I would rather bitcoin die than support that. Thankfully there is the BIP 148 UASF. See you in August.
EDIT: the UASF isn't a hard fork and it isn't a PoW change! If even 51% of hashpower support the UASF even once there is no disruption and it stays. A hard fork guarantees disruption and you are out of your mind if you think the community is going to support a 8MB segwit. SegWit with 500kB blocks is already a compromise to me since it increases the blocksize. Segwit ^^how ^^do ^^you ^^capitalize ^^this ^^dang ^^word   as deployed in BIP148 is double this. The hardfork you propose doubles this.

Again, I respect this sentiment. I really do. Practically speaking though there are tradeoffs to maximizing certain attributes such as unchanging software. Being slightly little less than maximalist is a slippery and scary spectrum but it is where where I want Bitcoin to be. IMO (and thus my node's opinion) a small amount of slow and deliberate change is more healthy than no change since it can evolve and deal with threats never before seen in our ever changing environment.
Hopefully you won't hold any ill will when we implement BIP148 via a UASF. I consider you an ally against the cleverly disguised r BTC idea of blocks growing ever larger as Bitcoin grows.

A User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is not a hard fork. A hard fork is when the rules become less restrictive and thus everyone single client that has not upgraded continues with their old rules. A soft fork is when the rules become more restrictive and each and every single old node continues to play with the clients that just soft forked.

false. With bitcoin, if you do not own the keys you do not own the bitcoin. There is no exception to this. Again with bitcoin, possession of keys equals ownership for all practicable purposes.
Let us say you buy coins on some exchange, for example MtGox or Coinbase. Those are not actually your coins until you have the keys to those coins. There could be other things that happen outside of bitcoin like a wrench to the face, or law compelling an exchange to compensate you but these do not change what happens within the protocol itself.

Ok having said that, we all raising this thing called bitcoin and I am totally fine with changes I don't like (such as increasing the size the blockchain grows) as long as:
1. they are pretty well agreed upon and
2. they don't compromise certain aspects of bitcoin such [being able to enforce the rules](
3. they provide some benefit that is worth the cost (e.g.SegWit).
It seems like a year is a nice safe timeframe to (1)get everyone (i.e. the economic majority of nodes and those who specialize in writing code) to agree on something like a hard fork and (2)rigorously test what happens to bitcoin with the hard fork and the nodes over time. Seeing as there is some bad blood I presume it will take even longer.
Speaking of bad blood, eventually all the "Bigger blocks now!" crowd will burn themselves out trying to go against consensus. I would be much happier if the gigablocks folk were not apart of the discussion because I don't trust someone when they say:

Secondly security is not some alternative name for hash rate. Hash rate is a small component of security. For example the following miner related events and things *decrease* the security and health of the network:
* one entity producing almost all of the hardware miners use.
* one region / nationstate owning a large majority of the network
* one entity threatening to ~~save~~ take over the network with secret mining, centralizing development, setting "consensus ", etc.
* one entity that has the exclusive ability to be 20% better than other miners for the same work.
* one entity that can hold the entire network ransom with just 5% of the hash rate.
* one entity that is essentially the only manufacturer of ASICS putting backdoor kill switches into the equipment he sells

You may think you are advocating for is an increase of the size of the blocks or even an increase of the size of the blockchain. These things of course have increasing costs and diminishing benefits.
What you are actually advocating for is a permanent increase in the rate the blockchain grows over time and a decrease of time in years that the average working man can actually be their own bank. With 300 MB blocks, which you said we might be able to handle now, this time would be months. This is not within the window of reasonable discourse for r/bitcoin.

Well I would have prior to committing to UASF. Now BIP148 will break covert ASICBoost.
The Barry plan only furthers my resolve in UASF. It is more promises and hearsay without code. It does not address the problem of miners (specifically the largest, most expanding, and essentially the sole manufacter of ASICS) using MASF as a means to [hold the community ransom](
Furthermore, if I understand it correctly, the Barry plan of SegWit proposed will not break covert ASICBoost since it is a hard fork. I am not entirely sure about that last sentence though.

This may be hard for you to see but BIP 148, the UASF, was what activated SegWit and BIP91 is just a way for certain actors to save face. There isn't going to be hard fork in August and their wont be one in November either.
There is no way to actually combine a soft fork and a hard fork. Hopefully time opens your eyes.

@_date: 2017-07-25 19:38:45
lol. Just who is involved with this agreement? Not me. Not most of the people that are part the network. Not the development team that has 95% network running their code. They were specifically not invited to the party.
I am not saying big actors such as mining companies and exchanges can't impact the bitcoin network in some way but they do not control the network. Their agreement means little. They really only control the price in the short term or cause delays. These are things I don't care about.
The reason segwit is coming to a bitcoin near you is users who are enforcing BIP148. The "agreement" is something for those who think they control bitcoin to continue the illusion. Hmm... it sounds like you need to reread just why the bitcoin [rules]( can't change.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:20:26
Indeed. I am ok with a short term (couple of years) monopoly on ASICs or miners doing insanely well. I also like the idea of ASICs doing the hashing for bitcoin's PoW.
Having said that, it seems they are doing almost everything in their power to force conservative users to do a PoW change to brick their equipment. It is incredible really. Hopefully the USAF kicks off without too much issue, the power of ASICs start leveling off, and more competition starts to enter the ASIC market over the next few years.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:37:58


I respect this sentiment. There are some things I would like to highlight to you:
1. We have miner problem. For example consider covert ASICBoost. We are not likely to ever get a fix with a Miner Activated Soft Fork.
2. We have a gigantic misunderstanding that miners are somehow sovereign and nodes need to convince them to do things. A UASF to force miners to activate a MASF corrects this for anyone even vaguely conscious.
3. Because of   and because miners seem to operate on a two year timeframe of incentives, they are stalling any changes to the protocol to ensure high fees for them. Remember some changes to the protocol are fine such as multi signature wallets. Not every change increases the 21 million cap. The only MASF we will get will only give them more power. obviously.
4. Because it is possible miners can spam the network with tx to increase fees and because they have an incentive to do it, they are doing it as far as I am concerned. These high fees are unnecessary thus actually a problem. Also why are you employing miners hostile to you? You are paying them to do this.
3. SegWit is sound with years of testing.
4. SegWit better allows offchain scaling with fixes to malleability.
5. SegWit is (mostly) backward compatible with old clients.
With these things in mind, I find a UASF to enforce BIP148 compelling to say the least. There's more though :) I hope you like game theory. It turns out there are some crazy madmen who will be UASFing and not going with them is actually the less stable, and immutable thing to do lol. I hope you join me August 1st but if not that's fine too.

First off there are more women in civilized societies like the USA. Women are the majority.
They have to "deal with this crap" everyday because women have the passive roll in mating. Men compete and pursue. Women be something worth pursuing and reject.
Because women are inherently worth more than their male counterparts they don't have to work as hard to receive the same recognition. When they disguise their gender, like you can do on the internet, they painfully realize they are treated differently. The reality is girls gossip about boys behind their backs and men do the same thing to women. The only difference is a man will lose his job/career if the wrong women hears about it.
Feminazis have earned their name with the vitriolic waste they spew from their mouths. Their unquenchable thirst to give up their femininity in in pursuit of being more manly leaves them bitter and hurting cat ladies. People are a bit sensitive to it and will probably get even more sensitive to it in the future... which is fine by me. Nobody likes a raging feminist.

You seem to be deeply confused.
* Core is incapable of forcing anyone to run their software. It is run voluntary by the masses because of their proven track record.
* Core's software is open source. You can get their software and examine its code or even change it as you fancy.
* Core's development is open source. If you don't suck, even you can contribute to core. Submit code.
Perhaps you are thinking of the one miner that essentially has a monopoly on the hardware used to mine Bitcoin. Or perhaps you are thinking of the one company that puts killswitches into their miners? Or perhaps you are thinking of the company that wants to control development under his centralized control? Or perhaps you are thinking for the manufacturer that puts in a proprietary and restricted advantage into his hardware? Or maybe you are thinking of how one entity possibly owns at least half of the hash rate?: This is all the same entity by the way.

This does not follow. Bitcoin could double its users and half it nodes at the same time with a heavy shift to SPV users for example.
More importantly and specifically, if you make irrevocable changes that make it so the average Joe can't run a node in 5 or 10 years then the average Joe won't run a node in 5 in 10 years... because he can't. It doesn't matter if you get 100x or 1,000,000x more average Joes, for zero of them will be running a node. This exclusion of the average Joe from being able to verify the rules of the network by definition would be centralization.
This complete disregard of something so [vital]( is why there can't be a conversation. Gigablockers must be treated with extreme distrust until they all go burn themselves out trying to destroy bitcoin. You have many ways to pay for your coffee but only one to donate to wikileaks.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:59:42


umm running a node doesn't *become* important. It *is* important. Do you know [why]( the bitcoin rules can't change? The answer may surprise you.


Also hash rate is king at determining the order of transactions and little else. Any and all miners that do not exactly follow the rules enforced by nodes are ignored, regardless of how much or little hashpower they could provide. Miners don't get any sort of vote by the way. The perception of miners voting is an unfortunate [mistake]( made by core devs when they implemented BIP 9. .

Perhaps I am bit to snappy. But then again you were stating falsehoods. I don't have much patience for that.
In the original whitepaper if you were a node you were also a miner. If you were a miner you were also a node.
Today if you are a miner if you are also a node. If you are a node there is perhaps one in a million chance you are also a miner. This one aspect of that paper alone changes incentive and security structures. The whitepaper is obsolete documentation.
Some more interesting things not found in the whitepaper:
* Essentially all mining equipment is produced by one entity.
* There is a good possibility of one entity owning more than 50% of the hashpower.
* Miners are not even doing any validation they are supposed to via SPV mining.
These things make non mining nodes even more important than ever. Despite this you say the tired old "hashpower is king" mantra, as if validation is non-existent.




@_date: 2017-07-03 10:00:21
The falsehoods I refer to are the claims about his statements. If you actually listen to what was asked and what he said, there isn't anything that an honest person would hold against him. For example Jihan never advocated to foolishly increase the money cap or add more inflation. Only you did.
Oh and just for the record bitcoin's rate of inflation won't get down to 1% for at least another 7 years (2 halvenings).

When did libertarianism get overrun by leftists?


People aren't incarcerated because they "made poor decisions".
Calling it a poor decision implies insignificance. I made a poor decision yesterday when I decided to try out this one joke and it landed a little flat. Suzi made a poor decision when she decided she would fill up her car's gas tank tomorrow. Violations of natural law such as murder or theft are much more specific and carry so much more weight than just a poor decision. People aren't incarcerated because of insignificant things.
Calling it a poor decision implies blamelessness. We all makes decisions and many times they are poor. Who hasn't made a poor decision in the last week? If you aren't making poor decisions from time to time then you are not making decisions. You are merely existing. The fact people make poor decisions is as arbitrary as people breathing. People aren't incarcerated because they did something blameless.

* Incarceration as a means to break the cycle of violence. The Hostile Brothers: [Cain Abel]( Hatfield Mccoy. Mankind's innate 6x to 7x increase in violence increase per retaliation
* Incarceration as evolved over a very long time as necessary component to society and disrupting it quickly, especially not really understanding, could cause massive and lasting damage. Frederick Niche's predictions of god is dead and the ramifications of it. Ideologies as a parasite on the underlying religious substructure. Hitler as inevitable and a creation by the left.
* Leftist's cancerous and pathologically verb to people displaying distress. cat and runt as correct and natural vs reaction to it. r/k selction. the devouring mother as the norm of society today. risk as evil and must be eliminated/minimized. 
* Natural law.
* Someone receiving punishment of the body and/or physical removal because they committed fraud as morally valid a function as is delivering parcels of mail.

2. Exactly the correct amount of energy is being spent on mining as there needs to be from a market perspective. What you are uncomfortable with why this is the case. It is like seeing the million dollar paychecks from athletes who just throw a ball around and saying their paycheck should be less and yours higher. Same thing.

In this case, I agree poor taste. After segwit is activated and Jihan's monopoly on ASICS is weakened (probably with a couple of years) you will not see any more of this.

Although I look forward toward a bright future as well, I think it is important to not refer to Jihan Wu as, "the little prick Jihad".
I think any reasonably informed person would come to the conclusion that Jihan has acted at least partially malicious to the bitcoin network. Between covert ASICBoost, backdoor killswitches on his miners, the misuse of BIP9 to hold the network ransom, gaining absurd power of supply of bitcoin mining equipment, gaining massive amount of hashpower, likely well greater than half of it.
Having said this I think any reasonably informed person would come to the conclusion that Jihan's intentions were probably honorable in his view. The solution isn't to smear his name in the mud but to identify the problems that lead his actions. BIP148 is part of fixing it.
You saying little prick Jihad is talk that is unwelcome on this sub. You are welcome to it elsewhere.

I'll tell you why. I am trying, desperately even, to undermine all this appeal to the authority of Satoshi or his original statements. That is why, in case you didn't notice, I mockingly referred to the paper as the holy scriptures and Satoshi as Lord Satoshi the Great and All Knowing. Satoshi would be ashamed people are using his name around to try and back arguments.

He is exploiting a [flaw]( Bitcoin. The flaw (casually known as MASF) was put into Bitcoin by cautious core devs to be a feature to make upgrades as least disruptive as possible. Turns out this caution has been used as a weapon to hold the bitcoin users ransom. It also doesn't help that he is essentially the only manufacturer of the equipment (that is ASICs) that can mine bitcoin and thus for every one ASIC you buy to mine bitcoin Jihan will deploy 2 to 3 of his own to devalue yours. Because of this he has a substantial amount of direct hashpower, and if you consider his pools, a clear majority of bitcoin's hashpower.

naw I wans't trying to go to deep with r/k. I was just referencing it since it seemed appropriate for the video of not to be a bunny.
In case anyone reading isn't familiar, take all living creatures like animals and divide them into two groups depending on their reproductive strategy. You will notice they seem to fall into two groups, r and k.
r's are lower down on the food chain and are generally prey. Think of rabbits. They breed rapidly caring little for their offpsring. Resources are easily available to an r. Misfortune happens randomly like when a hawk swoops down on them. There is little they can do to prevent it.
K's are usually higher up on the food chain like a pride of lions. They are predators. They are slow breeders and have few offspring. They take a very long time to raise their offspring and invest heavily into them. Resources are scare and a lot of energy and skill is required to get a meal.
Now take these two breding strategies and place them onto the political landscape.
Rabbits want universal heathcare and resources to be abundant. They shouldn't have to plan, take risks, and spend great amounts of energy to thrive. They want no restrictions on sexual behavior and don't really care if a child is reared correctly. Single motherhood is fine by them and should be subsidized even. Rabbits are the perpetual victim.
Starting to notice something? What you will notice further is these strategies are incompatible. The environment only selects for one or the other. You can read more about it in the book Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics by Anonymous Conservative or just search out r/K on youtube or wikipedia or something.

Yeah their actions are malicious even if their intentions are not. There has been a gradual awakening of the userbase that core has lulled to sleep with their conservative and sound code. We (including you) do not know what bitmain will do but we know what he said he would do.
If they cause a chain split it is going to be cocaine directly into the blood of of all of the userbase. Nobody will be asleep.
Personally I think bitmain is not going to push it even though I think Jihan has effective control of well more than 50% of the hashrate. There are some things you can do only once and I think he realizes this very clearly.

I am not sure what you are asserting or asking but what happened is some people in core agreed to finish coding up segwit, miners would activate it, and later a blocksize increase would be supported by core. Segwit took longer than the promised time and by that time miners were ditching core for new sweethearts like XT, Classic, and the like.
The most one could say is core did not deliver on time but I think most reasonable people prefer it with a couple month delay when dealing with something as valuable as changes to bitcoin. Core essentially has a clean record from the HKA while miners not so much. Miners and certain people really burned their reputation and the goodwill of others by their reckless and hasty actions. Did they get their 2MB, 8MB, Unlimited MB scaling solution. No.

Oh ok. Yeah essentially you are good doing nothing. Holding is essentially always good. If you care about making Bitcoin into ApplyPay/PayPal etc at the cost of complete loss of decentralization you might want to do something or if you want to be a crusader for ensuring bitcoin stays decentralized you might want to do something. But... the reality is the cake is already baked and the eternal vigilance of others has kept bitcoin sound, as evidenced by the price of it. I wouldn't even know where to start to bring you up to speed.
Mining is heavily centralized both in manufacturing and regional use. Nobody is comfortable about it but it doesn't really matter too much. It should fix itself given enough time. ASICs can't get much better. The Queen can dissolve parliament whenever she wishes... as long as she doesn't try to dissolve parliament. Same thing with miners. Core devs started implementing upgrades using [BIP9]( to be less disruptive to the miners but the miners then used it as a weapon to hold the entire network ransom. Mining cartels literally think they own bitcoin and are very angry at the pesky core devs and individual user who dare to defy them. It turns out one miner who happens to make most of the mining equipment everyone uses (and also probably controls a disturbing amount of hashrate) found an attack vector to cheat at mining. It is called covert [ASICBoost]( Fav [remix]( of him btw. He is great. and so is the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast. Anywho this miner, the great leader Mr. Wu, still has to do work but is like 20% more efficient than everyone else. This is the same guy thatput a [backdoor]( kill switch into the equipment he sells. It is not provable that he is cheating so he claims plausible deniability. There is a upgrade called SegWit that changes bitcoin. It is almost universally seen as a sound upgrade but there is disagreements about it for political reasons. The person cheating doesn't want it because it removes his ability to cheat. Oh and fun fact, it turns out a lot of the hostility was a manufactured byproduct of the cheat the one miner was doing, for if any significant changes would remove his cheating ability. The gigablockers don't want it because they lose even more ground (as if they have any left). For perhaps the first time ever, there has been some actual pushback against core but only because they (as a group) did not support a user activated soft fork known as BIP148 to enforce the miners to activate their miner activated soft fork. They all support it now but it kinda doesn't mean anything because it is way to late to submit a release (they already felt it was rushed even before). This means for the first time in a long time people have run non core software which is probably best in the long run. Still terrifying not using core if you know what I mean. Anyhow sorry for the wall of text. Best of luck.
EDITs: oh and btw there is another sub called /btc. Don't trust anything that comes out of there and you can ask about it. He is very active over there and here. A snapshot of the split can be read [here]( Oh and don't trust Roger Ver, "Bitcoin Jesus". He is unhinged these days and is the founder of /btc and owner of bitcoin.com. He is user slash memorydealers. Oh and Craig "IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO RUN A $20,000 NODE YOU CAN PISS OFF" White is obviously not satoshi, even though he claims to be. Oh and there is a youtube channel called World Crypto Network (the main guy being the Mad Bitcoins guy Thomas Hunt) and he does like 5min videos each day of the bitcoin news. It is pretty good. The best exchanges are Coinbase and Gemini, with Coinbase being the most established and probably most hated. They both, but especially coinbase, would sell out users and have a coin where only they can verify the rules in a heart beat if they could. Thankfully they also like repeat business so they stay leashed. Also coinbase has possibly worse customer service than Comcast.

Hey do you know [why]( the bitcoin rules can't change? The answer may surprise you!
I would rather trust banks and centralized governments than some cryptocurrency where I am unable to verify the rules of the network. Advocating for the average Joe to be unable to run a node is advocating for the destruction of the network.

[this]( please.
Assuming a 1 TB data cap for Americans, and assuming you connect to something like 64 peers (as I am now), you literally can't get to double digit block sizes before you can't be a node. You'd have to limit to as few peers as you feel safe enough (at least 4 to 8) and only run your node on weekends or something.
Increasing the blocksize right now has very little benefit with a possibility of a huge cost in the future.

I don't want a block increase. 1MB blocks are [too big]( right now. If SegWit could be implemented with maybe 500kB blocks that might be ok.
We mean so little to you that you don't even consider us. It's ok. Well it really isn't but we are moving forward. SegWit will be activated in August.

@_date: 2017-07-08 04:12:36
First off please don't get defensive but I, as some rand dude/cat on the internet, am about to give some feedback that is critical of your article.


Well I am already suspicious. "Blockchain technology" is a buzz phrase most used by those who either do not understand Bitcoin or understand it but are trying to distance themselves from it as far as possible. It is also used by scammers. Having said this, the sentence is true.


Wait what? Segwit isn't a trump card lol. I suppose in all fairness it is true that segwit is political because some people such as big blockers and mining cartels lose some of their political clout if it is implemented. This does not make it a trump card though. Oh also a trump card can't declare things. Oh also segwit doesn't reject anything. Also core' implementation of it (i.e. BIP141) doesn't reject anything either. The only two things rejecting are core as a group to implement BIP148 into their clients and users who are enforcing BIP148. Although there are several core developers who personally support BIP148, core does not. There isn't even an option to signal for BIP148 much less enforce it in any of core's software.


I am not quite sure what to make of this. Something is off about that sentence though. Well I think it is fair to refer to the UASF in August as *the* UASF because of its popularity and relevance. *The* UASF is the event starting at 2017-08-01 0000Z UTC while *a* UASF is one particular mechanism of implementing a BIP. Also those enforcing BIP148 are certainly in favor of the thing they are enforcing. Hmm. Perhaps it is mindless redundancy that making the sentence catch.
By "literal" you mean "first" right? And by fork do you mean possible chainsplit? or do you mean fork? If you mean fork then you can remove the sentence because obviously a user activated soft fork is a fork. Or maybe you should start defining the words you are using.
I am going to stop proving line by line feedback and instead offer some general thoughts.
Write for your target audience. One group of readers may not know what a BIP, a UASF, or even a blockchain is. You don't need to define or explain everything but depending on your audience it might be useful to find a way to define the terms and phrases you use. Ironically a really dry textbook is hard for students to read and stay engaged with but is usually very accurate and precise. There is often a trade off between being 100% correct and 100% understandable. What you don't want to do is try to go for understandable without confusing people more.
Order and flow. Your writing has to be orderly especially if you want to talk about something as misunderstood as bitcoin is. You can take a historical method of explaining how we got to where we are all the while introducing terms and concepts. For example you can have a few sentences on how BIPs came about and then drift into a discussion about forks and how there used to be only just forks. Then soft forks became a thing, distinguishing hard forks. Then you can discuss how all forked used to be activated before [BIP9]( was created. and so on and so forth till you get to the present and you have a well informed reader. Then you can proceed into the future with your speculations, or better yet properly cited influential opinions where the reader can branch out and explore. This way you can be a curator for finding stuff. Or maybe not depending on who you want as an audience. Buzzfeed is happy not citing things.
Practice. If you want to be a better writer then you need both read and write a lot. Write and rewrite then rewrite it again. A really good writer can write things up in a decently short amount of time but the rest of us must put in a lot of time to keep doing iteration after iteration until it is acceptable.
The thought just occurred to me you had a bot write this in which case everything I just wrote is unhelpful to you. If this is the case then work on your bot because the piece you linked was garbage. Otherwise good luck and keep working on your writing.
EDIT: so I finished reading the thing and it is surprisingly decent. Whoever wrote or edited it needs to up their game though. Big time.

With any luck, within a few years or sooner the increasing power of ASICs will level off to allow the currently weaker competitors to eventually catch up. Then that one miner merely got his reward for advancing the tech so far with the added benefit of teaching the rest of us to not trust miners.

I am no fan of Jihan but it appears he was only giving his commentary and I am also a fan of the idea of PoS/PoW hybrid, even while fully aware it does not seem possible right now.

**~~Classic~~ ~~XT~~ ~~Unlimited~~ Bitcoin Cash**
Although in some ways I hope a certain bad tasting element does fork off and do their own thing, something tells me that any lack of success will be blamed on bitcoin, this sub, core, small blockers, and thus they will never leave us alone. The ~~trolling~~ dishonesty will continue in order to do anything possible to damage bitcoin so more ~~gullible prey~~ users with different values and beliefs bleed off into their anti-node coin.
If I could have the CEO's ear of every exchange I would say something like the following. Whatever you do, make sure you are not involved with trying to burn down the coin that allows me to run my node with the entire blockchain on my older computer in my bedroom. That's it. You don't have to value anything I do just let me have my coin that lets me verify everything and thus not have to trust others to make the magic money work. Do this and we are silent allies.

You take things into consideration that I don't bother to any longer. Core could take the hardest stance and btc headlines will continue to call it manufactured by core.
It's kinda like you are in a casual debate and the other person calls you a racist. Instead of the debate continuing, you assert you are not a racist and make arguments why you aren't. The person that called you a racist is the smart one, for he doesn't give a crap about your answer and the debate is over. He can do this as frequently as he wishes. There is no conversation. There is no debate. He simply owns you when he pleases. The only solution in that situation is complete disregard their assertions. That or not having a conversation since you are the only one trying to have it.
I don't care how easy or hard it is for others to point their fingers at core. I am not listening to them and they are no longer part of the conversation. As a group, core isn't perfect but they are the best bitcoin developers. If people are denying this they are either not truthful (to themselves) or not knowledgeable.

Actually many people simply see something a particular way and there is no amount or right combination of actions that said entity could or could not do to change their minds.

Way to shift the conversation. They aren't infallible people. They can make [mistakes]( as admitted by such one. And for the record it was a core dev that pushed me over the edge to enforcing BIP148. I have often defended core and will continue. I will not blindly accept their views or their code though. If it smells like a duck, looks like a duck, and tastes like a duck it is probably a duck. Holding core in good faith, their opposition of BIP148 smells and looks like they innocently do not understand the worsening miner problem and what damage has and will happen to bitcoin because of it.

Ten years from now bitcoin will be celebrating its 18th anniversary, not 28th. To answer your question though, only an all knowing god may know such things. It is all speculation so I will leave that to speculators. Or perhaps another way of saying this is there are many non falsifiable answers to this question and me trying to answer such a broad question is pointless.
In order to preserve decentralization through a greater variety of computers, people, and environments, the burden of running a node must not be too great and thus bitcoin should have a lighter footprint over a more heavier one. The idea of increasing the size the blockchain grows whenever it needs to scale clashes with bitcoin having a lighter rather than a heavier footprint.
So do I think bitcoin can survive 2MB blocks. Yes I do. Comparing one incremental change at a time, SegWit is vastly superior to increasing the blocksize to just 2MB for a great number of reasons. It is not even debatable in my mind. Thus SegWit will be activated first. After more development hours, time in general, and me educating myself and hearing arguments, the next incremental change (a tradeoff between decentralization and scaling) could be 2MB vs something we don't know or just 2MB vs nothing. But that's not on the table right now.

It is true that there is intense pressure put on a minority chain and thus an incentive to rejoin the chain.

If there was a sustained attack by 90% of the miners a PoW change would be in order.
Most are not against an increase in the block weight in theory but in practice they are for the near future. Maybe in late 2018 if there is a good coordination. That's probably to early though.

Segwit8MB requires a hard fork. A hard fork does not disable covert ASICBoost. Support of SegWit8MB does not disable his covert ASICBoost.

@_date: 2017-06-03 13:06:18


The argument isn't bitcoin can't handle 2MB blocks. The argument is bitcoin can't handle increasing the size the blockchain grows whenever it needs to scale.
I am not going to needlessly make permanent and irreversible changes to the size of the blockchain on a hunch. And for the record I lack any expectations of bandwith or memory increasing dramatically because it is irrelevant to me. I want bitcoin to be capable of running on a old computer, perhaps on tails, routing through tor in areas where traffic and bandwith is monitored.

Oh I don't think this is true. I am not saying they were happening but they certainly seem possible and there are some incentives.
If you had control of a good portion of the hashrate you could spam driving fees up with little, no, or negative costs (profits). Most spam would not get confirmed and thus cost nothing. The spam that is added to the blockchain could be mined by you so you might get the fees back. Additionally with driving all fees up you make more money total from all the competing fees. There could also be political reasons such as trying to prove such-and-such scaling solution ^^i.e. ^^non ^^ASICBoost ^^breaking ^^hard ^^fork ^^blocksize ^^increase is needed now.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:19:19
Well three days and no reply so here is my argument.
Segwit2x is probably a [stalling attempt by Jihan so the protocol does not change in any way]( other than 1)with hard forks and 2)with fees as high as possible.
There is compelling evidence much of the poison in the water of the scaling debate lay at the feet of Jihan. Anything that changes the header (such as a soft fork implementation of segwit) will break covert ASICBoost. This also explains why over 90% if not 95% of all clients are setup to automatically accept segwit when miners activate it yet more than 50% of the hashrate rejects segwit. This explains why he fosters and promotes hard forks since they don't effect his ability to covert ASICBoost. Lastly this explains stalling attempts such as segwit2x.
I am not exactly sure where to start sourcing stuff but [this]( might be a good summary of sources:
[This]( is a related decent video too.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:09:09
There is an interesting phenomena in play. The Queen of England can dissolve parliament anytime she wishes just as long as she does not dissolve parliament. The immeasurable power Jihan holds as essentially the sole manufacturer of mining equipment, his covert ASICBOOST, his blocking of protocol development over the last at least 1 year, etc is disturbing but he can't do much more than he already has without losing it all, even if he effectively controls 75% of the hashrate, which he might to be honest. The USAF succeeding is good but the USAF failing would be even better since it would force a POW change. I don't think Jihan will let the USAF fail though.

A part of me, a dark inconsiderate part, really wants them to do a 80% attack so we brick their hardware in an hour with an emergency pow change. But then I think of the few honest miners and the benefit provided by a high hashrate.

With a hard fork, the previously invalid is not valid so each and every unupgraded node does not play along. Think 21 million cap is increased to 22 million.
With a soft fork, the previously valid is now invalid so old nodes play with upgraded nodes. Think block size shrinks to 750kb.
There are currently two implementations of these forks. A user activated version and a miner activated version. Initially everything was user activated but some cleaver engineers came up with the idea of miners do the activating so users are not in a rush to upgrade. This is BIP 9 and called a Miner Activated Soft Fork.
Now there is several paragraphs missing here because I don't have time to type them up but the skinny is: MASF started getting used for everything. Turns out miners act in self interest and on the short timeframe of their equipment (a year or two) which turns out [miners holding the protocol ransom]( Further issues with a cheat called ASICBoost, an overt one never used and a [covert]( one almost certainly used (capability + incentive + undetectable = doing it in this game theory). Further issues with essentially only one manufacturer of the equipment used to mine bitcoin so each piece you buy the manufacture puts one to two more of his own to negate yours. There is also a lot of confusion by users and [their faulty perception]( of miners and their "vote". Some great percentage of nodes are quietly coded to awaiting segwit but miners fail to act. Essentially no one is against segwith other than political reasons which is several more paragraphs. Essentially some people lose political clout when segwit is activated because it is one thing everyone wants for tx mallebility.
The USAF, or user activated soft fork happening in August is essentially a boycott of any and all miners that want to continue to go against users. It is a USAF that forces miners to activate their MASF. If the USAF does not get enough hash power (that is 51%) there will be a chain split. As long as the USAF get some hashpower (average of 25% i think it was till November) there should not be a permanent chain split however since the USAF will [reorg]( the legacy chain into itself and since it is a soft fork, all the old nodes (all the great percentage of nodes are quietly coded to await segwit) will play along.

Segwit is the compromise. Nobody is forcing core to do anything.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:51:49
To be fair, I am not generally listening to anyone in the anti-nodes crowd (as I like to call them). I am what they might call a "small blocker" since I am vehemently opposed to increasing the blocksize higher than 1MB. I would like to point out my responses and rejection of 2MB anything isn't actually a problem with 2MB. I am already compromising with SegWit and would probably totally do it again in the future. The problem is when someone says anything along the lines of increasing the BLOCKSIZE all I hear in my head is:


Until they address my concerns or even the possibly they might exist, increasing the blocksize really does matter that much.
EDIT: Literally 5 seconds of scrolling after I posted this I encountered [this]( ~~anti-node snake~~ fellow redditor. He deliberately uses a + instead of a * when mentioning the technically garbage idea of hard forking to 8MB blocks. He doesn't have a clue what our concerns are or even care about them. He doesn't know the what the words he uses means or he does but is dileberatly misusing them. The UASF to enforce BIP148 is a soft fork. It has soft fork literally in its name. The choice to split the chain is up to the miners. He mentions Jihan in a manner as some politician you could just convince or bribe to get our way. As if the something other than nodes run software and miners get paid if they do what the nodes command. You you keep begging and considering what Jihan thinks. Meanwhile I am going to disable his covert ASICBoost, activate a development (almost) universally praised that he has kept from us because of his short sighted desire for higher fees. A hard fork of SegWit*2MB would not kill covert ASICBoost. Why didn't he use the adjective covert? Does he not know or want to be ambiguous? Of course he is against a UASF. What a surprise. I am extremely distrustful of these kind of posts. And those kind of posts is all I see about increasing the BLOCKSIZE.

Well first off, if *your* coins are on an exchange they aren't your coins. Read up on a thing called MtGox to learn more. In some cases it might be less risky to put your coins on an exchange but that is an entirely different [discussion](

You got what you asked for. You have been given some great distilled information about BIP148 in an EILI5 manner. If you are confused or concerned then you should fix that by reading up and asking specific questions if you have some. Saying you don't understand or asking me if you should sell your coins as fast as you can is a mark of a [concern troll]( If you want someone to ask and answer the questions for you until you understand then go to school. If you want someone to tell you if or when you should sell then go hire someone to give you investment advice.
I also don't follow "mining or how it works". I do know how mining works though and I follow security threats to bitcoin. This is why I will be enforcing BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:06:37
We will see what miners decide to do concerning BIP148. So far, if miners as a group wanted a PoW change I can't think of a better way of going about it than what they have been doing. Covert ASICBoost is completely unacceptable. Essentially one manufacturer of asics might be acceptable for a year or two but is unacceptable long term. Miners holding the protocol [ransom]( so it cannot stay anti-fragile is completely unacceptable. High fees are acceptable. Miners gumming up the network with spam to create high fees is unacceptable long term. At some point we may have to fire our employees and try something else. Lets wait till the dust settles in August though.

Hard drive space is one of the lesser costs that nodes face. In reality there are other [things]( that would kick nodes off the network before they couldn't store the blockchain.


1.Increasing the rate the blockchain grows increases the requirements to run a full node over time more than not increasing the rate.
2.[insert several exceptionally obvious statements here]
3.Therefore increasing the rate the blockchain grows shrinks the pool of available nodes with older and cheaper computers being some of the first to exit. This would be harmful to bitcoin.


I am sorry you feel this way. I will take note that I took the time to explain something but was unable to since it didn't stand up to your technical scrutiny. I won't make that mistake again.
