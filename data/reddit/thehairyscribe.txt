Only service I trust anymore. They are very underrated. VPN is badass as well.

I need to go deposit more fiat cashola.
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:04:28
I appreciate the input. I’m really looking into doing it for more than just btc.
@_date: 2019-11-27 11:19:16
I too purchased a ledger yesterday but also have a trezor T. They both have positive and negative aspects. Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.

How difficult is it and what is the cost of running a full node?
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:00:55
I wouldn’t mind if both occurred tho.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:47:15
I’ve bought at around 6k and 13k. So far I’m sitting about even and pretty comfy with the amount I have. I’d like a bit more but we will see.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:19:10
Not as of yet.

So cd rom media is a safe storage option for keys?
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:59:55
That explains it fine. It was just a curiosity. Thanks!

Go open an account at a local credit union.

Looks fairly decent to also mine monero. I’m pretty comfortable with the amount of btc I have. I’m going to diversify with that next. I was into lite coin and eth for a bit but I traded all that for btc months ago. Probably put a bit in monero just to spread it around. I’m not one of these guys who thinks that only btc is the ways of the world and that anything other than btc is sheer blasphemy. I have the time and space to get set up so I figure why the hell not? I should have a few years ago but was dealing with losing 2 family members who died within a week of one another and that came first. I don’t see either of them going anywhere anytime soon.

It is actual shit.

Credit union. Mine gives me zero issues.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:40:07
Best of luck, good sir. If I were in your shoes, I’d do the same thing. Come back in 2.5 years and let us know how you’re doing.
@_date: 2019-12-29 15:23:33
But you still have to wait for funds to clear.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:00:59
What’s the limit?

If I lived in a different congressional district I would definitely run. Worthless bitch in my state need to be voted out. Which she will be after her vote 2 days ago.

He should at least have the files just in case.

I have both. Gold, silver, btc, Monero.

Keep a copy of all the seeds that way if they lose it, you can take it back for yourself.

I know who killed Kennedy and the location of Jimmy Hoffa. Just because someone says something on the interwebs does not make it true. 
I could say I bought 500 BTC in 2012 whether I did or not. If the “tax collectors” want to look for it, let the little pansies get to looking. At least my money won’t be paying them to do so.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:33:01
I still think it was a setup. I’ve actually designed something that I want to show him someday. I can see the look on his face now. He will just smile and say “nice! How many can you make me?”
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:37:43
Confiscate gold?? Ahahahaha!! That’s about as hilarious as gun confiscation. Bring that shit on and find out what happens. Good luck finding any of it.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:06:29
Sweet! Thanks for all that. Will definitely check it out.
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:02:36
I highly doubt people will be as willing to give up their property a second time. They can pass whatever law they want or sign any executive order but good luck with actual pulling it off, with the gold or the guns. If a person hands over their guns or gold, they had no business having it in the first place.
@_date: 2019-12-04 04:47:39
Did they put up a different sub? Didn’t their other one get taken down?
@_date: 2019-12-29 20:35:24
Absolutely true. I was speaking to initial btc purchases. If you have funds in USD or your local currency, then you’re gtg.

I love Cody Wilson. The government is trying every way they can to keep him from succeeding. But the files are already out. The Jeanie is out of the bottle.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:44:39
This! But yes congrats indeed!

Snowden will be back in the US in 2020 and probably with a full pardon. Between Snowden and Assange, they have a hell of a lot of info on the right people.
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:38:25
I have a good portion of all of that.
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:41:21
Getting downvoted for telling the truth. Reminds me of me.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:38:16
I’ll give them the same answer I give to the asshats who want to take our guns. They can fuck right off!
@_date: 2019-12-10 11:50:28
Didn’t make enough on paper to even bother filing.
