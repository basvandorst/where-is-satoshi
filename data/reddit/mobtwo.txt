I understand your point but for someone who felt like a victim of high fees (mind you, I paid a total of around $50-$100) moving few transactions recently, it is painful to see this sort of things happen. It should not have happened to anyone in the first place. Bitcoin should have been cheap and fast to use, each transactions that cost over $10 is 1 transaction too many. It doesn't matter if the other 80 transactions don't have to pay those high fees.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:39:53
Well, I increased the fees 3 times and have reached $5 but still doesn't go through. That is when I said fuck it, I will pay $20 for my transaction to go through. This is also the moment I realize bitcoin cannot be used for normal transactions. This is where bitcoin cash works very well.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:56:03
You're smart if you had already jumped ship now... when the panic selling of BTC starts and not enough mining power to confirm those mempool transactions... that's when the price may crash hard because everyone wants to get out but can't.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:46:57
Years ago, there wasn't a bitcoin chain that retains Satoshi's principal for miners to switch to. =)
Let's see the facts. You can see these miners and their hashrates moving already, proving it right. You can view these information online and verify the fact that miners/hashrates are on the move, can't make this shit up. =)
Edit - Downvote all you want buddy. The facts can be seen by anyone going online to check the mining/difficulty/hashrates. Feel free to disagree with my opinion but don't blind yourself away from the facts.

Your reasoning work as well as asking to have bigger blocks regularly as having 1 super big block suddenly.
So in the end, it's still the same.

"Bitcoin simply won't work well as a payment mechanism for timely small value transfers." &lt;&lt; So far not true, I managed to send $500 of bitcoin cash on transaction fee of only 1 cent yesterday. The transaction was confirmed in less than 10 mins.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:06:17
I shouldn't advice you to do this but you can try getting torrent and downloading windows 10.

I am a bitcoin core owner who has been misled and lied upon by core team and now knowing the truth, doing my part to educate the others who had been lied and misled by the censorship driven bitcoin core team.
Does paying $20 transaction fee to send $50 sound right to you? That's bitcoin core right now.

Well, that's assuming the scammer hasn't spent it already.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:28:08
Yeah, I was like desperately trying to send the transactions and refreshing the blockchain.info page waiting for the confirmations, lol. After 2 days I kind of give up and increases the fee straight up, because I have to factor in my own time sitting there waiting for the confirmations before I use the same seed to get my bitcoin cash out from the same wallet. So if I have to waste an hour waiting, I would rather pay the fees and get it done and over with.
I can live with it but it was overall a bad experience.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:30:09

Fact checking means like if someone made a claim "high fees are good because users love them" and then we see a lower user adoption rate that contradicts that statement, then you know the claim was false. Fact checking is highly recommended whether the market is niche or not, explored or not.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:31:58

Personally, I don't really care who the person is when they said something. I will make sure to do some research on my own. Experts could be wrong... the crazy guy you met online could be right... but whatever claims people make, we could do our best to research online and see if those had been lies.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:11:43
Just to provide an example... they refused 8mb blocks for the scaling. Look what happens now? Stucked unconfirmed bitcoin transactions for days with expensive transaction fees.
Bitcoin Cash confirmed my transaction within 10 mins for only $0.01 transaction fee with the 8mb blocks. What we are seeing now is free markets talking and markets deciding which bitcoin should lead the way. I see the transfer of wealth from bitcoin core into bitcoin cash as one of bitcoin greatest moments.
I am excited about cryptos again!!!
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:30:44
Goldman Sachs says it will drop to $2500 and I won't be surprised with the chain death spiral happening now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:23:25
Well, I hope it works, at least works during next week or something because I need to do another transaction. At the moment, I don't even bother looking because of the flooded mempool... I expect to pay less than $1 for a transaction. It should have been dust but oh well, I will bite.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:52:52
You had to buy it I guess. It's better than a computer that was compromised and nothing you do on it is safe.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:32:09
Correct me if I am wrong, but there is no expiry date for transactions to be inside the mempool. Yes, I know about RBF which you can increase the fees to prioritize your transaction to be cleared. If everyone do that, won't the fees keep increasing if you think about it logically? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:14:18
That guy was accused of murder, took drugs, discussed about cooking drugs online, was wanted by authorities and fled the country... and you tell me he is reliable?

@_date: 2017-08-20 20:04:00
Well, that doesn't make me feel any better. It's like me asking why am I paying $5 fees for a transaction and you told me you paid only 20 cents as if my problem doesn't exist at all. If you want to make me feel better, I will get all the transactions id which I made over the last 3 days to you and you refund me all the fees above 20 cents, deal?
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:42:21

@_date: 2017-08-19 08:24:35
The hashrates are moving, the prices are moving. You can see those facts for yourself. And with the difficulty changes, more hashrates will move and bigger price movements will happen. I'm happy because I have moved yesterday... All the people trying to move now will be stucked in the heavily jammed mempool that requires high transaction fees and slow confirmation times to move. 
This situation is only going to get worst once more people see the truth.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:50:36
Well, if tomorrow the US government decides to buy 1 trillion CPU and has the majority hashrate or mining power, they would make bitcoin centralized or become AmericaCoin as well. I thought the whole point of BTC is that the majority of people would work in a certain way to prevent such monopoly because it is not in the attacker best interests to do such silly things. Theoratically they could but it is not feasible. I remember last time such concentrated power problem happened before in BTC history and those guys  decided to split up or something.
Quote: "The threat of a 51 percent attack became very real for many Bitcoin owners this week, when the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, GHash.IO, flirted with, and may have even surpassed, 51 percent."
During that time, value of BTC dropped so even if that 51% dude owns BTC, it would be worthless and therefore they are not incentivized to do that. From that reasoning, I feel maybe your worry of someone monopolize BTC may be unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:37:08

The owner was caught not because of bitcoin. He was caught likely due to the same way Ross Ulbricht was caught. People make mistakes and all the enforcement needs is just 1 mistake and that break may be all they need to catch the person.

The value of bitcoin is backed by users spread across the whole world. With government, you just need 1 bad guy to destroy the country. With bitcoins, you need many bad people to destroy it.

FreeWallet is a software wallet just like desktop wallet. The problem is that the developer creating the wallet is a scammer, and he changed the codes to send the coins to his own wallet no matter what the recipient wallet address is indicated by the user.

Bitcoin needs to scale and we all agree on that. Scaling reduces the transaction fee because right now the fee is too high. But different parties want to implement different type of scaling solution and they can't agree on a compromise. Around 1st August, we may know who wins. Between now and August, there are too much uncertainties and these affect prices.

@_date: 2017-06-13 01:53:09
This would be extremely unlikely to happen because there is a limit to how many transactions can happen at the same time. We can increase the limit for the blockchain but there will still be a limit and that limit is unlikely to allow 8 billion people usage. If that happens, transactions will not clear or they may clear but with a very high transaction fee, rendering it useless for most transactions.

I would disagree on the comparison. Put it this way, how hard is it for you currently making $3/hour to making $6/hour? Now think how difficult it would be for you currently making $3000/hour to $6000/hour? It is one thing to double your money when it is a small amount vs trying to do so on a massive scale, even if the growth percentage is the same.
Having said that, bitcoin is not a bubble. If the price drops, I will buy. =)

First off, you are not stupid. You are early in the game and is likely to profit given bitcoin's track record. And given bitcoin's track record, it is also highly volatile so all that you see now is normal. Normal in the sense it has happened many times before and each time the price goes on to new highs.
My advice - Don't panic. Don't sell. This is normal. Hold and you will make money. =)

I think they couldn't handle it. For security reasons, they kept a big percentage of btc in offline storage. When normal trading volume is expected, there is no problems. But when there is a surge in volume, they need to move the coins from cold storage to their hot storage (and the other way round) and it's not like you just do it as a person. When you're a business, there are processes to follow, otherwise it would be another mtgox.
So if the cold wallet has too much coins and needed to be moved, or the other way around, the boss or the people supposed to sign the transactions to move the coins is not around, they have to stop for abit.

I agree. It is a risk to take, same if I wasted my time and couldn't recover them.

lol, I think you mean Jihan, that miner dude... not Jihad. Unless you're talking about terrorist and ISIS, in which they are waging Jihad. Jihad means something like fighting in the name of religion.

Yes, continue your silly assumptions. You are like that clown person I used to know that always thinks his own beliefs are true without any evidence. Like I said, it makes you look stupid when you make baseless accusations like that. =)

Excellent advice.

ELI5 - Just hold your coins and wait for the storm to pass. Nobody will know what happen but one thing for sure, bitcoin will survive. It may split, but that's cool too because you have just "doubled" your coins.

I agree. And also there is another maxim of never invest in something you do not understand. I believe Warren Buffett said this and when the world's best investor said that, it is worth heeding.

Can someone explain why Bitmain's statement caused such a drop in prices?

With the current transaction fee, this is not something I would advise at the moment. Wait for 1st August for them to sort out their shit and hopefully by then, transaction fees will go back to the pennies level.

I will help you recover your bitcoin for 10% of the amount. If that is acceptable for you, message me.

Well, the way bitcoin value is rising so fast, next time instead of saying you owe me $20000 bucks, you have to say, "hey you owe me 0.00000001 bitcoin"

Yes, if you have 1.5 bitcoin now, after the split, you will have 1.5 bitcoin on BTC1 and 1.5 bitcoin on BTC2.
However, before the split, 1.5 bitcoin may be equal to $2500 usd. After the split, the 1.5 bitcoin on BTC1 may be equal to $2000 usd and 1.5 bitcoin on BTC2 may be equal to $300 usd.

I have waited over 3 weeks and haven't receive the btc I paid for. The coinbase support responded with a canned message and nothing else. This is so stupid. I am considering filing an official report to the authorities against them for stealing my money. I will give them some time to sort out their shit, otherwise I would consider it theft.
