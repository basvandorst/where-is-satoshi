I think Ethereum is emerging as a better and more complete development environment to write scalable decentralized applications, whereas Bitcoin will be stronger on currency apps and as a store of value, although Ethereum can also do the latter once its blockchain is live.

Let's not throw the baby with the bath water. What's needed is a better organization that can assume an effective leadership role. The software platform can help it, but not replace it.

Lots of energy in that video :)

The last thing Bitcoin needed was a continued frenzy into higher valuations. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:04:13
The last we need is hype. That's what crashed the Internet in 2000. Just remember, in you case you weren't there.
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:26:04
You don't think that bitcoin's price drop is because there aren't too many active users on it?

Not a mediator, but a judge. I said it before many months ago on my blog: I would like to cross examine both sides &amp; ask them questions. 
Each side says things that are left unchecked. And they talk to each other via Medium &amp; online while barely speaking to each other when they actually meet. 
Appoint 5 judges to cross examine everybody in public, and draw conclusions &amp; recommendations. Then we will see where we really are. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:20:23
and you don't think that the 5 Core Devs had absolute power? as a matter of fact, 2 of them sufficed to suggest a change.
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:56:39
I hope you're right, but what if you're not?
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:50:10
I never said that. The key point is that the core developers have failed to agree on an orderly evolution, and they didn't seek some mediation help. 
You need to ask yourself about the repercussions of the current dynamics. It's not good. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:31:56
It depends on who says they have gone rogue. If it's within their group, that's subjective. 
But if we follow your definition the XT group who says the other side has gone rogue is actually the one who has gone rogue because XT wasn't done by consensus.
That's why a better governance would have prevented this from happening.
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:34:52
Agreed with Muneeb, and I was writing a post on the governance issue: 
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:01:56
"if our development team goes rogue". that is the crux of the issue. 
- who decides they have gone rogue? That is a subjective statement.
A bit of governance acts as checks and balances to prevent that from happening.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:58:18
Agreed...but it has been heavily influenced by 5, now maybe by 2-3, perhaps more, depending on how it goes. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:51:07
Governance is a layer of sanity on top or adjacent to the current insanity. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:56:43
It's probably too late now. Consensus could have been reached in a more orderly fashion. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:55:57
It's like putting the inmates in charge of the asylium. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:04:30
True, but now it's outside of the realm of being a science or technical project. It has millions of users and stakeholders in the real world, therefore any "technical action" has business/economic repercussions. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:22:23
But having miners vote only is not a wide ranging consensus method.
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:03:06
You don't think the community couldn't find 2-3 decent people that are neutral and trusted by all to have acted as "judges" or arbitrators?  
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:13:07
You may have mixed up business and technical things. How could reasonable judgement imply an increase in attack vulnerability? The security is a technical aspect, and the governance is a sanity layer. They work together to ensure the original Bitcoin goals are preserved without personal agendas. 
And I have talked to people close to the situation, and yes, there is a risk that 2 chains could emerge, if one side doesn't concede to the other after a miners vote. It's not inconceivable that both sides will have Plans B on their minds.
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:47:16
That was the point. They have failed us on their conflict resolution skills. 5 other mediators could have put them in a room and drafted an acceptable BIP that didn't need a hard fork proposal. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:01:31
Exactly. There could have been some oversight on the Devs. If there are Core Devs, why aren't there non-technical Core Members to cut through the technical hair splittings, and see through any personal agendas. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 11:53:25
Well, the kids in charge proved they need some adult supervision. They threw their toys outside the den instead of talking to each other searching for a solution to a common goal.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:56:58
It's obvious the core devs have been bickering for a while.

1/ distributed ledgers do not offer users the ability to easily convert their tokens and messages into fungible units of value. 
- Not correct. You link tokens to assets; tokenized assets. 
2/ Nor do distributed ledgers escrow value between parties that don't trust each other.
- Not correct. I thought he was talking about private blockchains where all parties are permissioned and known?
@_date: 2015-10-11 04:55:58
What is your definition of economic freedom? 
@_date: 2015-10-11 05:09:01
No, OpenBazaar is not going to help you hide behind breaking the law. It is for frictionless ecommerce,  not lawless ecommerce. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:03:31
Noosterdam - can you please elaborate on your statement? 
@_date: 2015-10-11 13:25:53
If you want to break the law, OpenBazaar is not for you.  
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:32:50
It's a well written article, and makes the good point that permissioned DL's aren't the cure for everything, but I found the following parts at the end to be very debattable:
"But distributed ledgers do not offer users the ability to easily convert their tokens and messages into fungible units of value. Nor do distributed ledgers escrow value between parties that don't trust each other.
If a ledger is not a public resource, it will have the pressures incumbent to existing settlement systems plus the overhead of maintaining a shared database among competitors. What efficiency will remain thereafter remains dubious."
