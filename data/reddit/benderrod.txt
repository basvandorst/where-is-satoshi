the majority of my friends/associates are indifferent towards bitcoin, the ones that work in finance (and thus have a basic understanding of the characteristics of a currency) are uniformly pessimistic on it, and the ones that work in tech are 70/30 against it (with the 30% overwhelmingly being the "my app that lets you measure the energy output of farts is going to change the world!" type).
i assume as a zealot you will ignore the multitude of economists, technologists, business people and governments that are naysayers and focus only on those with views that match your own so i will not spend time digging up people with an opposing viewpoint -- just know that they exist, and you are not the first person to think they are a godlike visionary for holding a contrarian opinion.
edit: let me also clarify that i personally do not hold especially strong views on bitcoin one way or the other (i am not convinced but do not rule out the possibility that it may one day become "disruptive"). i am just annoyed my zealot/evangelist types.

you are of course correct, but at the same time there were plenty of people who were equally assured about other technology trends/fads that turned out to be flat out incorrect (the early betamax adopters probably fall into this category).
as many if not more well informed in the know people are derisive towards bitcoin as those that are for it (typically VCs who have reason to be overly optimistic on anything tech related are not the people to look to for objective analysis).

VCs overinvest into bubbles just like everyone else.

actually it was ben horowitz, not marc andreessen (who made mosaic), who made the comments re: bitcoin.
also not surprising given AH have invested in bitcoin related companies.. they are hardly going to give an objective analysis of a tech trend which they hope to profit on.
