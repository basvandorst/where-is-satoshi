My hobby is to collect Bitcoin as much as possible. For that I am trading and increasing my stack but many times I loose in trading don't know what is not working for me. I really have to focus on the best strategies of trading.

I really love his prediction. I keep on sharing this infographic everywhere whenever I get a chance to share. His predictions are up to the mark till now. Excited to watch how BTC would play out in coming months. What do you say?

How you are saying with so much surety, as what I know is we see bull market after halving as per previous records and halving is in 2020 so we may see good gains in 2021. Don't you think so?

Bitcoin is future as its a truly decentralised currency. I came to crypto market in 2016 and get to know about it and I really got attracted towards it as its the only currency that can change the whole financial market and will bring more transparency and trust. So I am accumulating more and more by building strategies manually so that I can make informed decisions.

After every halving first Btc go parabolic then again down. Same will repeat in this halving also. We will move slowly but surely.

You may be right but what I know is if we have a clear trading plan or you can say strategies then we can make some thoughtful predictions not blind predictions, maybe this guy has done [backtesting]( on historical data to make this kind of prediction? I agree with the fact that this market is highly manipulated and even charts fail, but for the long term, manipulation can't really affect the markets I guess.

The market is pretty stable at 10k and what I think is 10k is the new 6k and I don't see going Bitcoin under 9k dollars what do you say?

Time to buy it

Btc dominance should go to 75% I guess as I am watching social media feeds through a sentiment [analysis]( tool and the whole crypto market sentiment is of 73-75%. After reaching this no we can see some bull market in good altcoins and that would be a wonderful opportunity to accumulate more BTC. For long term I am holding BTC only.
@_date: 2019-08-28 06:27:12
Both are equally important Technicals and fundamentals. What do you say?
