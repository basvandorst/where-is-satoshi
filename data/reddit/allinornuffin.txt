If the BTC price dont budge and the B2X is worth 1200$ and you sell the B2X you will get 1200$ for free yes. Allthough not likely there is nothing that says this cant happen. If you think otherwise please elabourate

@_date: 2017-11-03 21:00:48

7k in few hours? Its been 4 hours and its gone from 6600 to 6480 :)

Yes. Thats what happened when I owned coin under the BCH fork. The BTC price remained and i sold the BCH (free coin) for 400$. This COULD happen this fork as well, or the BTC could fall it can even rise. The new coin is worth what others will pay for it and the same goes for BTC. There is no law making BTC fall equivalent to the new coins price

ok so its all about taking biggest risks? a big risk would be just withdrawing it in USD and burn it up, there would be a slight chance the ashes would be worth $1bill one day? ill go do that

if you bought recently you are not a late comer you are an early adopter. its impossible to predict the future price of bitcoin but with the massive attention bitcoin is having now and will continue to get I think we can expect at least 5x gains each year for 3-5 years to come. I wouldnt be shocked if your 1000 pounds is worth 100,000 by 2020

I do care about the ideology but in the end its if i lose my money or not that is the real concern

I was talking about the BCH fork. About the BTG fork, the price of BTG had little to do with the fall of BTC-value after the fork. Nobody could retrieve their BTG coins. I think it was more because people who sold altcoins to get their free BTG coin went back to the altcoins. You can also see the rise in BTC and fall in altcoins before the BTG fork happened

You cant afford a full coin with 10k on november 10th :$

In theory. People expected BTC to drop equivalent to the BCash price during the last fork but BTC remained stable for a while then increased in value

1 of each, the value will not spilt in half. The latter of your examples

thats what im leaning against. but im worried the confusion can cause a big drop and the chance of loss by hodling will be greater than the chance of gains of staying on the outside and go in again on the dip. thoughts?

If there was not commercial on it I would concider it. Not paying $30  for something that seems like a giveaway item for PR
