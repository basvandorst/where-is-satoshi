Mainly the stern interview 
Last week C.K. told Howard Stern that he lost "millions of dollars” over the series saying, “I got so excited about having the show appear from nothing…When I got to episode four, I was like, ‘Hey gang, I don’t have any money.’” 
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:01:02
Howard stern interview and the email he sent out 
@_date: 2016-04-17 07:57:19
source? he literally cancelled the show because of his debt

I'm new to the bitcoin scene, and boy is it awesome!
(My account is 2 months old, the first post I posted got ~100 downvotes and someone tipped me 0.1 bitcoins, that's how i got interested in bitcoins haha. You can't find the post anymore as a mod deleted it but it was in askreddit [here]( and i commented on the [top comment]( saying "*flips a table*". Weird, I know, but that's what got me into bitcoin, what got you into it?)
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:40:56
I, for one, am nowhere near that "one coin per subscriber". I am at around 1-2 millibits.

Go and reach out to the mods. If you can provide "real" proof, they can really help you out (more publicity)
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:28:58


in a good way?

if they meant you, I feel bad for you, i feel like it was my fault :(


BITCOIN IS FUCKING RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY. IF YOU SAY OTHERWISE, YOU ARE LYING.

Guys keep in mind, this is from a zero day account.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:03:04
One of the most important things you said was "redundancy". You should put it in more than 1 place.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:48:57
Sorry to hear your story, but MTGOX hasn't been paying out in a while. Try turning any dollars you have in MTGOX to Bitcoin, then pushing those in to another exchange, in which you will turn them back in to fiat, from which you will push in to your bank account. Wait for other people's opinions on my plan before executing it please.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:51:49
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:36:24

I'm 13. that answers your next question too. I tried blockchain.info, too complex. I just recently lost 0.1 bitcoin and now, i would like to use 2fa.
SIDENOTE: I didn't lose all of my bitcoin. I still have 
0.11664339 BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:00:56
Wonderful. Not related to bitcoin. It is related to reddit. go and go to or message the admins about it.

@_date: 2014-01-05 03:38:36
My recommendation: Most of your bitcoins should be on an offline/paper wallet. Leave a little bit of bitcoin in coinbase for quick transactions. 
Answer to your question: Blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:58:03
Email satoshi and ask him for help...

I think you should store it in some other places, ink fades and other things can happen to paper
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:02:07
You could tell someone you're **interested** in bitcoins, but don't own any.

I'm a junior, and i can only afford 0.1. How do you afford that much?
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:39:09
I'll give this to one of my friends too! I want as many people to know about bitcoin as possible

are you trying to get them to tip you
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:56:36

do you love me?
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:01:46
Possibly. It's also possible that someone's referral was mistyped, or you were hacked, and this was a "test"
@_date: 2014-04-24 01:23:41
The address has .5 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:49:56
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:47:37
trust me, if there is a 20% off on something by using something else, people will try to find out how to get it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 10:37:03
I don't know, wait for reddit to decide. 
Maybe you should tell us your real reddit account?
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:14:16

It's going to be my first purchase in bitcoin!

EDIT: this isn't exactly a place to buy direct steam games, but [humblebundle]( does have some bundles that you can buy with bitcoins, and their [store]( has games you can buy with bitcoins. I recommend checking here before buying your games anywhere else, as this place has great customer support and their bundles are awesome. on the 7th, check their [front page]( as they are rumored to have the Humble Indie Bundle X, which is gonna be pretty awesome.

Alright, Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:01:18
Oh. well in that case, time to go digging around on your hard drive for a bitcoin wallet, try logging into coinbase or blockchain.info to see if they are there. those are the most "official" ones

Yes, but it is created to get people INTO cryptocurrencies. Not to keep them engaged, That's where Bitcoin, (and arguably LiteCoin) comes in.

include a digital version. by the way, since email is NOT secure, you might want to encrypt the private key, and send them (using another email address) the key to decrypt the private key. ( or tell them the decryption key irl)
