Coinbase is the mainstream exchange, with weekly limits and ID verification. Reasonable fees to some but not all. Realize that tomorrow is a very important day for Bitcoin so understand what you are getting into, why and for How Long HODL my diiiik

They definitely can, which i think could very well be a reality. Big money pump this baby up until they can open up some short positions. Dump that shit after making money on this side, then their shorts shoot up, BTC plummets low enough that they can sell their shorts and re-enter to squeeze everyone else’s and get back in cheap! One thing i am more confident with is that the big money won’t leave this market for good.
That’s why this ride will be one of a lifetime.

However we have no idea how long this transition will take. Less than (just a guess) 3% of all retailers accept BTC?
