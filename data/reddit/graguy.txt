True. Liquidity and ease of movement is only thing I have heard of any value. Not sure that is enough over intermediate - long haul.

Blockchain yes. Bitcoin might be obsolete though.

I think lack of access will very quickly cause people to switch out a bitcoin just as easily as they switched in. Because there’s no other fundamental underlying value to bitcoin it will quickly go by the wasteside as usage declines. Make sense? Or ami wrong?

Good point. But once they ban it it will be done for good and cannot be resurrected as people of switched on to something else

1) shut down all exchanges where touches conversion to currency
2) prohibit any merchant from accepting it
3) establish that using it is criminal activity

"Regulation means stability. Some are afraid governments could ban cryptos, but then countries that dont will have all that wealth flow to them."
If the major countries shut it down and you can't get easy access, liquidity dries up and then the value continues to go down, people say it's not worth dealing with, switch to something else, it slowly dies on a vine... Value goes down down down... Is this wrong?

I don't see how it is secure at all.

Nice response. You must be in the minor on these threads , no?

Sorry, I don’t want to come off as short or fighting. I just don’t see any use case in which bitcoin is going to be allowed by the regulators so it’s future has destined to be worthless as well all other cryptocurrencies - except the ones created by the government itself.  if the price of bitcoin goes higher they will be even more of a spotlight and regulation. Buy gold mining companies - that is a gift of advice for you (opposite of a fight).

Except that gold has had value for 5000 years and all major central bank governments own tons of it. 
If the human race were to start over,
Gold would be money again. 
Bitcoin is weak.

ok, glad to hear you don't own it - pat yourself on the back.  As for all your other comments - agree with all of them.  We are on the same page.
