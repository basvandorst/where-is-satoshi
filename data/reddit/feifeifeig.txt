Hey guys  
 Today is the third day of my $100k experiment, now it is 0.01&amp; loss in 24 hours, nothing special so far.  
 First of all, I'd like to thank you all for supporting my post yesterday,I can't tell you how much appreciated it is! And thank you so much to those who brought up questions about my experiment, and I saw some very interesting ideas, it's getting fun, isn't it!  
 
Alright, I'm gonna answer some of those questions here: \)  
 
1.Why only BTC, ETH and EOS?  
 Some of you wanted to know why I chose BTC, ETH and EOS over other coins. Well, I bought 8 BTC, 30 ETH, and 1797 EOS for $99996,698, which is a very stable of investment strategy. Why? first, bitcoin is a very stable cryptocurrency obviously, it has not seen breathtaking surges or declines.Have a look of the pie chart above, BTC takes up the greatest percentage of 60.60&amp; in my investment. In my crypto investing experience, if bitcoins's severe drop from its highs, most altcoins are performing much worse, so no matter what happens next, BTC will goes up eventually. I'am not afraid of the bulls and bears as long as BTC occupies over 50&amp; of my holding.  
 
Secondly, EOS and ETH are the top 5 market cap cryptocurrency projects, they are relatively stable while can hedge each other, and the percentage of EOS and ETH around 20&amp; in my investment, the potential return on either are pretty good and also it won't be a complete loss to me at end of the day.  
 
2. Why don't you invest in native tokens of exchanges\(HT,BNB,OKB, etc.\)？  
 A friend of mine asked me the same question before I stared the experiment, this is what I told him:It absolutely worth to hold tokens for long\-term investment, but I want the huge profit that need to wait even longer.It‘s just like playing a game, I'm planning to win at the final stage.  
 
3.EOS? really?  
 lol I know a lot of you really questioned about it, let me explain it for you.In fact, I clearly know that my experiment is not a no\-risk investment due to EOS, but it's a decision I made between platform tokens and EOS, here are my concerns:  
 EOS:  
 1.EOS is not a cryptocurrency yet before, it is just a tradeable token before 2nd June.  
 
2.Aftet EOS mainnet officially launched, negative sentiment might occur in the market once EOS fails to meet market expectations, BM will not take any responsibilities for that if EOS got crashed.  
 
Tokens  
 Before Binance, huobi and OKEX became mainstream exchanges on September 4th, 2017, Yunbi was one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in China. However, Chinese government intended to shut down bitcoin exchanges and announced that exchanges will no longer be allowed to facilitate the buying of crypto coins using Chinese Yuan and the trading of coins. Yunbi, which announced in Chinese had to stop trading on September 20. This kind of regulatory risks are still existed, so I chose EOS. Don't get me wrong, you could definitely make amazing profits with platform tokens but you will assume more risk, right?  
 
Other questions you asked:  
 I'm a 37 yrs old Asian guy and had a few yrs oversea experience, this experiment is not about how much money do I have, I'm not showing off and not crazy, it is all about sharing, thanks you all again for liking my post, and apologies for my broken English.  
 The name of the portfolio app is CoinBox.  
 
Will keep you guys updated : \)

Hello everyone
I started my cryptocurrency life in 2017, I have seen some people made fortune out of it in the last year, also I have seen many people done leveraged trading and went broke eventually. It took me six months to make 20 million from 10 million before, I also had experience from  20 million to 1 million left once.
Here are some advises to beginners:
1. Risk control \(invest your money in different coins, don't do leveraged trading\)
2. You'd better not put all your money in this game, choose mainstream coin as start.
3. Long\-term investing \(seeking linear returns\)
4. Portfolio checking&amp;Market tracking \(not too often per day\)
The intention of this experiment is to help those crypto beginners who don't know how to survive with basic investment skills , my experiment is not complicated , it is all about mainstream cryptocurrency investment with very easy operations.
Everyone knows the common rule that we buy on red days, it was partly red , so I started it yesterday.
Bought 8 BTC for 60584 USDBought 20 ETH for 17248.5 USDBought 1797 EOS for 22164.198 USD
At a total cost of  $99996,698
I found that the market cap of BTC,EOS and ETH occupy 60&amp; of total market cap in the crypto market, and I believe in blockchain technology, so I'd like linear returns rather than some profit points.
Alright, I will keep you guys updated, wish me luck.
here is the update of my post: [

Cryptocurrency market falls $25 billion overnight as bitcoin drops 6&amp; in the 13rd day of my 100k experiment, and my holding was worth $84313.58 with 15.68&amp; historical loss,$15687 was gone over a couple of days.Now the value goes up again along with the market recovery. I know a lot of people struggle on this price drop, and we are in a bear situation for a long time, some people are giving up and thinking that crypto coins will go way way below which is ridiculous. Actually the history shows the same cycle of hype and then a return to normality many times before( in 2011, 2013, and 2017) there is no doubt that it's gonna happen again. So don't be panic,I think a very big rebound is incoming in July/August, just wait for it.  
If you already lost &amp; of your capital, my advise to you is that it is not a loss if you bought good crypto coins unless you already sold those coins last week. I think you can average down your prices by buying some more of them and hold for prices to go up again.I suggest newbies to buy only top performing cryptocurrencies and hold them for long-term to make a profit or sell at a profit.  
I bought 11320 nano at price $2.65 when the market was falling,I'm trying to have a diversified portfolio which includes variety of coin from large, medium and small cap coins, and I see great potential in nano for the future.  
To be honest, it hurts a little bit to see my money disappear, but I have good faith that this will bring me a lot of fortune in the future, I do have a lot of patience to earn big profit: )  
At the end, I wanted to know that why is there so much hate around EOS?I explained why I invested in eos in my last post, I don't want to get a few statements like “Eos is a shitcoin”this time, I appreciate some reasons to support your idea.  
And what did you buy during the crash？
