Jail time. Lawsuits (some tawdry). Bitter name-calling among leaders. Resignations.
No, those are not tidbits from a tell-all about a collapsed Wall Street bank.They are in fact unfavorable milestones in the short history of the Bitcoin Foundation, which was formed in 2012 to promote the digital currency for the benefit of consumers and merchants worldwide yet quickly devolved into a spectacle.
Now, under new leadership, the group aims to repair its reputation and return to its mission.

Nice read with some great insights. Seems to miss p2p investing though!

The borrower application is a 7 step process which involves, among other things, a live video session with a security officer, the uploading of proof of identity and income, as well as manual assessment by our credit scoring team. Then we run an algorithm over the borrower which calculates a default probability. 
If the borrower is deemed creditworthy, he or she may apply for a loan.
When a borrower is late we implement a series of automated steps to ensure repayment. These are:
Reminder emails -&gt; Phone Calls &amp; Text Messages -&gt; Letters threatening legal action -&gt; Debt collection agency &amp; release of personal information to the investors. In most cases, borrowers have forgotten their repayment dates, or are struggling with the bitcoin exchange process. It therefore makes sense to allow for a leniency period of a few days, as borrowers realise their repayment is due, and need time to exchange fiat to btc.
In cases where we believe that a borrower does not intend to repay, we do everything in our power to regain the funds. This includes Debt collection agencies and the release of personal information to the investors, so they may pursue legal action.   
Thus, the aggressiveness of our collection efforts correspond with the urgency of the loan. A borrower who is 3 days late for example, will receive frequent reminder emails. A borrower who is 90 days late, will receive almost daily emails, phone calls and text messages. Letters threatening legal action are sent to those who are +90 days late, in addition to the emails, phone calls and text messages.
If a borrower really has decided not to repay, we put all our time and effort into recuperating the loss. This may take some time to bare fruit however.

 Can you please explain what you mean?
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:58:48
That much I gathered, it's this part "Bitbond is not long for this world" that I would like you to clarify.

Hey, apologies for this. We seem to have had some trouble regarding comments in the last few days. This is most likely not specific to you (unless you were spamming). 
The problem should be fixed now. If you still cannot post comments, please get in touch with me via our support tickets.

I'm afraid I still don't understand your reasoning. If a lender chooses to bid $100 on a $ denominate loan, he will receive principal plus interest in return by the end of the loan term, regardless of what the price of bitcoin does. Even if it shoots up to $1million, our investor will receive (lets say) $120 back, a very attractive return. 
Most investors on our platform encounter bitcoin for the first time and really arent interested in playing any FX games. They just want to take advantage of an awesome technology which allows them to diversify their portfolio into international fixed income assets. They are (for the most part) not interested in using bitcoin as a store of value. 
Your statement that "bitcoin is lost each time" makes no sense, as no bitcoin is lost throughout the entire process. 
Your final point is also incorrect. Let's take an example to explain this. Imagine you had invested in a btc denominated loan in June 2015. Not only would you have received your principal plus interest back, but the effective value of your repayments would have increased as well. This is due to bitcoin's price increase from ~$260  to ~$670. Ie. the 0.1 btc you invested back then, is now worth a lot more than it was, giving investors additional returns.

Any comments, suggestions or recommendations to change and become more awesome would be hugely appreciated :)

IGOT's "team" contains a picture of Nhial Majok who works for TagPesa. Cross-check here: 
Conclude from that what you will

Bitlicence seems to be severely harming bitcoin companies in NY. In the UK, Cameron has been open about his reservation on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Berlin on the other hand has friendly regulation a vibrant bitcoin scene and has registered more VC investment in 2015 than London.

Excellent video explaining the nature of Segregated witness. One of the best on this topic!

 the Segregated Witness soft-fork represents the currently best available option for the scaling of bitcoin. SegWit’s malleability fixes as well as the linear scaling of sighash processes offer a significant improvement over the current version, and will further aid bitcoin’s adoption.

But the purchasing power of the two was identical at the time, so our investors got their principal plus interest. Everybody wins :)
