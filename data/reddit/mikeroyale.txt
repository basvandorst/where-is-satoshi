No limits on the Omni decentralized exchange!

Is slooooooooowwww.  OmniLayer decentralized trading is much faster and liquidity is building up.

Is all data stored on top of Bitcoin or does it also save data to another location?

Because BFX is a OMNI token,  is possible to use its decentralized exchange for trading.

OMNI Let's you trade Bitcoin with Tether,  Maidsafe,  Synereo, etc... All decentralized.  Try:  
Transaction fees are distributed among OMNI holders:
So owning OMNI makes you part owner of a exchange. Their platform works on top of Bitcoin and they are preparing to lunch Futures trading as well.

Fucking sloooowwww, also centralized arbitrage,  thanks but NO thanks.

Decentralized Trading. Omni already offers trading of assets that include tether (used by Polo, Bitfinex,  etc, in fiat pairs). Volumes are growing,  and futures trading with Leverage will soon be possible.  
Also bitsquare,  a bit too slow sometime but making progress.
There are others, like counterparty, Waves and bitdhsr,  but their lack of any kind of fiat support breaks the deal for me.  
Notice that with decentralized trading you are always in control of all your private keys,

Also consider the OMNI decentralized exchange. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:51:09
Same way of any  centralized exchange, just don't trade fucking dirty fiat.

If is a joke, F2Pool better prepares for the backlash!

Also BONDS, looks like this is the next step after they finish dumping: 
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:03:45
This is a scam, careful.

China miners outsmarted America.
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:14:35
no, because it will fork even with UASF. Chinese find a way to avoid.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:51:06
China wont accept UASF, you are losing you time with this.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:00:47
Wouldn't the high fees mean that Bitcoin is no longer permissionless? Only those with a lot of money will be able to access it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:48:18
Probably miners make more money from fees than higher price bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:28:22
take of the hat of OP to find a UASF hat! lol.
