R/btc was created long before the fork as an alternative to r/bitcoin because the moderators of r/bitcoin regarded any discussion of hard forking bitcoin to increase the block size to be "altcoin discussion" and banned people for it.
R/btc became the de facto bitcoin cash subreddit because of this.

Yep. I got a degree in cultural studies and it made me realize how far academia can have it's head up its own ass with regard to obfuscating simple concepts.
I think a lot of people in that world have bought into the fallacy that more complicated always equals smarter.
Found it particularly frustrating because a lot of the concepts they were getting at related to the exploitation of marginalized people but they taught them in a way that would be indecipherable to those same marginalized people they were supposedly trying to help.

According to the source itself it includes methane:
That said the US should certainly stop subsidizing the fuck out of meat and dairy production and people should move toward more environmental friendly diets. Perhaps if prices of vegetables and whatnot were dramatically cheaper than meat (which they would be without massive subsidies) people would be inclined to eat less meat to save money and hang onto their deflationary currency for the future gainz.

What about the old btc that everyone forked away from in 2010 because it had a number overflow bug?

Reduced motivation to spend should help with the problem of the overproduction of low quality disposable goods causing climate change. Nice.

Yeah but I agree with him. You can be against islands of garbage in the ocean and also be against tons of greenhouse gasses from factory farms. Not mutually exclusive.
Currency economics have sweeping implications across many spheres of life.

Not sure. I should have asked.

Don't waste your time with it if you don't like it! I'm an artist as well, so I like creating things and learning things too. I'm lucky enough to have found time for intellectual persuits and just fucking around with my friends sometimes.

Zero fees compared to tens of dollars in early 2018 is a pretty big difference.

You could just list prices in usd or a stablecoin until bitcoin market cap gets so big that these kind of fluctuations don't happen anymore.

It's uh 2005 so i think you meant invent bitcoin.

If you see no reason to ever convert layer two bitcoin back to layer one bitcoin than aren't you implying that layer one is essentially obsolete?
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:46:21
...or they associate bitcoin with enabling people to do good things even when some of the largest and most powerful government and finance actors are attempting to block you from doing good things.

What factors would differentiate users who would need to use the main chain from those who don't?

You also get poor through inflation if you're paid a fixed hourly wage.

@_date: 2019-04-08 18:49:37
Fiat currencies are inflationary dude.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:24:00
So theres no reason for the main chain to exist at all?

Lending shouldnt be what makes the economy tick.

This kind of maximalism where people on here feel the need to talk shit about a fork of bitcoin constantly comes from a place of fear. If you were all so confident that this was an inferior scam coin you would just ignore it like you do with bitcoin gold.

...so not usable as "peer to peer electronic cash" for almost everyone on earth. Got it.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:20:40
If you're going to leave your money entirely in LN for years and not bring it back to BTC why not just use an altcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:54:04
"Peer to peer electronic cash" It's in the title of the bitcoin whitepaper.

Which means the inevitable switch to green energy will destroy it eventually.

Never said they weren't. Divide and conquer is a common tactic for infiltrating and stifling movements that are threatening to existing powers.
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:03:55
The amount of time that this forum spends ragging on bitcoin cash shows the insecurity of the crowd here.

We may not switch to green energy because of this, but then we'd just be destroying ourselves which will also destroy the dollar.
I don't think politicians or corporate power is going to switch because they care about others or the environment. They'll be forced to do it eventually to protect themselves.
