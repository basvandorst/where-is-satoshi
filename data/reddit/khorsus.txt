This is very shallow thinking. Not everybody requires the same things to live happily. I don't like FB but I have an account, because I have to be in touch with as many people as I can, offline or online because I need to evaluate opportunities in life, and I believe all opportunities are brought by people. And if you think sharing facebook memes is dodging information, you are extremely wrong.
Reading a scientific paper won't get you out of poverty, strong connections will.

There are 4 different countries which are Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria. I just wanna know which country's healthcare system have you used? There is no Kurdistan as a country apparently.

I'm Sorry where is "Kurdistan"? According to google there are utopic maps of it, almost covering one third of Turkey but I'm pretty sure those maps are not official.

Makes no sense mate. Me and people like me who has no technical knowlege have no idea about those terms I mentioned. So without broad knowledge, you shouldn't support anything at all and let the people who dig into it do that. I am seeking information.

I will give those a try, thank you very much.

Why would I support anything at all and put my efforts into it? I am an investor in Bitcoin. I am not a programmer, nor a miner. I am trying to learn how these terms will influence Bitcoin from an investor's perspective.
Let's say you invest in gold. Do you care how do they produce gold? What is the temperature when they put it in a mold? For how long it needs to cool down? How do the polish it?
So If you have the information and able to tell me in a brief way, please do, I am here for this, not for the tech part of the drill.

So is this all related to SegWit, BIP148 and UASF thingies? And as far as I have read, something will happen in 1st of August. So is there light at the end of the tunnel after 1st of August?
