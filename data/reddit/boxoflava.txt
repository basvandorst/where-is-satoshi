Also on  we have TEST binary build to get this all going.

Ohhh so Bitcoin was 100% centralized then, during all this years?
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:12:14
Not at all. We do not need other implementations, if something bad is added we would simply rebuild without it.
Btw -

It is as decentralized as their PATENT enforcement in China.

I was wondering do you really have such silly idea, or did you mean something else.
That is now how open source works.
If someone malicious does something what I will think is bad, I can totally free to run my own or older version of bitcoin.
When BitcoinCore would add banned addresses like that, I would not use it and easily patch it.
Same, if miners will maliciously oppose a malleability fix, to keep their unfair (patented) advantage over rest of world, then we the users will drop it. (Some part of users will, some will not. I do not care too much which group is bigger, but the malicious miners group will die out imo)

we're supporting BIP148:
* as pointed out we need to discuss in community that we endorce it. Many are affraid to make first move. Solution is a letter to exchanges, shops, to have them confirm they will do support if others will too. [So we are writting one](
* also we provide Binary builds for BIP148 - fow a test and adding cool but not-vanilla patchset BitcoinKnots (and soon also vanilla).  - now one bitcoin Developer / maintainer confirmed the binary build results and signed that they match source code (this is NOT endorsement, it's just that the binary available there is matching certain source code, to clarify)

Lol, should we also vote on every line of code added? I bet that will work ;)
If you want then make own fork or other coin, that is how you can decentralize coin RULES.
Bitcoin is about decentralized execution of given protocol.

It will remove the ~ +20% advantage of certain miners over them, probably rising all prices for them (and lowering the extra profit from miners using asicboost)

For example Roger Ver, owner of that subreddit, and calling that post best post in long time, in top comment

What we just won, is not Segwit. It is an quite meaningless promise from miners that they will starting tomorrow vote for SegWit.
Bitcoin core nodes do NOT enforce holding miners to the promise that they will signal segwit from tomorrow on.
Only BIP148 forces them, so if we want them to keep promises we should run it.

Exactly this.
 tell your friends, switch your nodes (version 1.0)
(download checksums are signed by luke-jr and laanwj)
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:30:59


Also, I build and publish on  - so you can have independent team doing verification.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:54:17


Also from
 (I help run it)
and from  (no SSL, though they redirect to github.com for files)
and yes, check the Gitian signatures made by luke-jr, see links on bip148.org for it

Just keep calm and

You need other program: download from 
and from either  or 
(match that it's same file optionally)
and then you just run bitcoin-qt.exe as usual. 
Make sure to then stop program, and edit config bitcoin.conf (google it) and add 1 line of text:
so that it will use at most 1000 mb (around +5 GB are always added) of your disk space, otherwise you would need 160 GB for entire chain.
