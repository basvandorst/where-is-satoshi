nice story, glad it worked out quite ok!
You've been lucky, your paper could have been burned easily.
Also, it's probably not a good idea to store the trezor and the seed together. Because... you don't want them to be destroyed / stolen / lost together. The trezor itself doesn't need to be in a safe... it's easily replaced if destroyed or stolen. The seed however needs to be safe and secure. Please invest in a cryptosteel or similar. It will withstand a fire and other disasters.
Plus - memorize your seed. It's just 24 words, it can be done.

Rest assured. There are many, many early "whales" that spent big along the years. If I calculate correctly, I've spent $2.8millions (in todays BTC value) on stuff like porn and smokes. I've given away probably the same amount. Also, the 43 coins I lost made all your coins more valuable.
The same today - people re-discovering BTC and realise they're rich. Lot of them do cash out. More coins for you to buy.
But seriously. Hodl.

fake news. Actually, Latvia and Lithuania are quite crypto-friendly.

But it isn't, factually.

Even if this was true (and I think part of it is) - I would never ever feel comfortable calling something Bitcoin that is run, promoted and beaten around by people like the Bcash public figures. I'd rather not use Bitcoin at all than to be associated with Ver &amp; Co.
So. A hostile fork will never be able to claim the name. Even if they have a point in principle - it's just not possible. Instead, this energy should be put into changing bitcoin from within. But i guess some folks are just about to learn exactly this the very hard way.

Actually, they really call the wallets "Accounts" in their web wallet.
And I can confirm, trezor.io Web wallet is having problems since days. But different every day, so it seems they're working on it. Problems range from transactions not loading, javascript errors etc.

You're welcome.

Panic? Muahhaaha. This wasn't panic. You must be new to crypto.

I started seeing this when starring at the GDAX BCH order book.
Think it's something wrong over there.

It's the usual social dynamics. Those finally in and "accepted" try to hold that advantage over newcomers as long as they can. It happens in all social groups - even more so here on reddit.
The proposal is of no value, - how can i get karma if i can't post here? nothing else is of interest on this platform. Think about it. I have to go and make cute kittie memes to get karma... so I can come here and post serious stuff? No, i don't thinks so...
