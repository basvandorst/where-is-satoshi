Is it easy to to switch over from regular Coinbase? Does Coinbase pro have an iOS app?

u/cryptogrip is correct. Just remember to file some amount of crypto in your next IRS returns because Coinbase is or will be giving your info to the IRS. First they catch the big fish, then the medium, then the rest of us...

I bought 1.5LTC when it was around $120. Will I buy more? No.  Will I sell? Nope. It’s  just one more diversification in my crypto portfolio. Remember the first rule of buying crypto, only invest what you’re ok with losing. Keep your LTC, but from now on, buy other’s like BTC or maybe ETH. If you’re not in it for the long haul, get out.

It’s about time, the way they were doing it was kinda sleazy.

It a super safe on-ramp to BTC. But if the price of BTC is 7500, they will sell it to you at 7650. That’s the only hang up... You end up paying a tad more than market price.

Having had issues with the ~~KGB~~ IRS in the past, I’m going to report any transfers or sales I’ve made in crypto. If you’ve only invested and Hodled. You’re fine.

Yep. Ledger nano x. Kinda like a thumb drive. It uses Bluetooth or usb-c connector. It’s weird having  that much money on a damn piece of plastic but here we are...

He’s not lying. I don’t understand why people think he lies all the time. There’s a huge difference between being ignorant and lying. He’s ignorant. He doesn’t know that he doesn’t know. He’s not even aware that he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know.

I was wondering about Coinbase withdraws. Converted my Link to BTC 30 minutes ago and still haven’t received to my ledger.

If BTC goes to $100,000. Good luck cashing out. I’ll repeat countless others and maybe it will sink in. Not your keys, not your coin. Buy a ledger numb nutts. The BTC I own are in my fire resistant gun safe.
