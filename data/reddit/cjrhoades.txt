It always seems to say that but I've never once had a trade not go through when I wanted it to.

Read the disclaimer in the upper left corner. Those are old transactions that were pushed out of the mempool on that server earlier and are coming back now that some higher fee transactions have cleared. Look back at Dec 20th (click 30d) on those charts and you'll see tons of low fee transactions getting shoved out of the mempool.

I agree. A 2MB blocksize with segwit and lightning would solve both our short and long term problems. Most don't want a fork though and I fear we'd just end up with another bcash on our hands.

If you had BTC on Coinbase before the fork, you have an equal amount of BCH as well but with no access to it until Coinbase implements it.

Yeah I just found out about it a couple months ago when I was watching[ savagegeese's review on the Alfa Giulia QV.]( He talked a bit about how it was one of the last non-Ferrari vehicles they helped engineer before they split off from FCA.

All but the exchange may not decide to ever give you access to it.
