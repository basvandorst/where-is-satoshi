In the order process it said it was a BTC address, was almost certain

R.I.P. To those 0.17 coins , add more to the lost BTC list... I DUN GOOFED IT :(

Just looked at a picture i took of the order when it went through on their website &amp; underneath the QR code and the BTC address they gave me it says "Payments must be in BTC. We cannot accept payment in BCH. If you send BCH to a BTC wallet the coins may be lost" . So your saying unless Bitmain started accepting BTC for this order i've probably been scummed (or scummed myself) ...

I didn't have an account created so my order isn't there , shiiiiittty i guess i sent BTC to a BCH address well thats the first L of 2018
