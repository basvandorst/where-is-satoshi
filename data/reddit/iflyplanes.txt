Daily volume doesn't represent new capital entering the market. Trading accounts for the majority of volume. Because these organizations will not ever be repurchasing the coins at a later time the dollars need to be replaced by new capital entering the market.

It feels different for me. The infrastructure now is so much more robust. Mt gox was the only game in town anyone cared about in regards to defining the price and it was constantly crashing. Anytime the price would move at all it would crash and everyone would panic and hit the sell button.
Additionally the number of people able to buy and sell was much lower. Coinbase and similar services didn't really exist. To actually get dollars into or out of gox was a pain in the ass. Now it's easy. I knew only one person with coins at the time. Now I know many. This is important because now we have many people owning smaller amounts...back then it was fewer people with many. This run up feels "healthier" and more controlled.

be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

I have a question about the Lightning Network.
Are payment channels required to be opened for every address you use? It seems to me that unless you're doing a lot of address re-use (which is not recommended for privacy reasons), then it won't help much (if at all). In order to make a single transaction to a new address you would now need to create 2 on-chain transactions instead of 1. One to open the channel and then one to close it.
For most "retail" type of transactions the merchant creates a new address for each consumer. For one-time payments to that address using the LN doesn't make any sense. Same with how you would deposit funds into an exchange.

I could write quite a bit discussing many of the points you brought up here because in a lot of ways it cuts to the heart of what Bitcoin is really all about. I don't want to do that so I'll stick to the super-relevant stuff.
1) Look at the situation here, Bitcoin didn't fit the regulation, the regulators changed the regulations to suit Bitcoin. That is a huge difference. Bitcoin by it's very nature requires the "system" to work in reverse and to comply to Bitcoin's nature as it can't be forced to suit the regulator's desires.
2) Bitcoin by it's very nature subverts the existing system. An alternative currency which is decentralized and cannot be inflated to steal from the many and give to the few is a revolution in itself. 
 
3) Unless regulators manage to completely change how Bitcoin works, than it fitting into the existing system is not a bad thing. You may not agree, but I believe the only way to change the existing system and give power back to the people is slowly. It may take a longer time than you'd like, but I do believe Bitcoin could be the revolution you are hoping for regardless of whether it is embraced by the current power structures. The reason why is because they can embrace it, but when it comes down to it what's important is that they can't control it.
@_date: 2014-06-29 13:18:27
Think about it for a second. That bill legalizing bitcoin wasn't for you, it was for banks, or other financial institutions who really do have to follow the laws on the books or face potential consequences.
Clearing up outdated regulation like that and getting it off the books is a very good thing.
EDIT: Expanding on this thought. 
Imagine I'm an existing financial company that's been around a long time in California and I just happen to deal in remittances, or some other business that is threatened significantly by bitcoin. Up the road I start seeing signs for this Bitcoin startup that could potentially eat into my business and he's doing it for way less money. I start getting nervous.
I give a call immediately to my friend I've been working with for 20 years... this guy also just happens to be the local financial regulator. I tell him this definitely violates law X which limits the usage of any other currency besides the US Dollar and I don't like it. The regulator doesn't like it either so he files an injunction with the state court stating this business is violating said law and needs an immediate decision to force the company to stop business. The court complies and the startup now faces a long expensive trial to be able to open their doors again, or simply shut down.
That is what why the bill legalizing Bitcoin in California was important. Not so you can buy some Alpaca socks.

As a software developer this is a terrible principle to follow.
Anyone who has been in this business for any length of time has watched projects either completely fail or not reach their potential because the developers don't view their software the same way their customers/users do.
I've worked with many developers I very much respect for their technical skill, but if left on their own would tank a project. It's very difficult for some developers to get outside their own mindset and how it relates to the code and see the forest for the trees.

What I am saying is that quote "The ones that do the real work are the ones you should listen to" is a terrible principle to follow. There are always caveats to a statements like that. How big is the development team? What are the skillsets of that team? Who created the team and what kind of people were placed on it? What is the goal of that team? Web development? Machine learning?

What Nick is doing here is trying to tell people what Bitcoin should be to them. He's using his influence to try and convince the community of how they should view Bitcoin. It's not working.
Bitcoin has technical limits and unfortunately political limits as well. The technical limits will be worked through and facilitate Bitcoin being whatever it is the community wants it to be.

I simply disagree. Core needs to communicate the features of their implementation. They also need to listen to other stakeholders in Bitcoin to evaluate and prioritise future features. This is why they do things such as the Hong Kong agreement.

I've been to New York City a couple times. Not sure if you have. One of the things that blew me away about that city was the financial district. It's an amazing sight. The massive buildings, the massive wealth. An incredible amount of money has gone into that place which supports many people who are by and large the wealthiest people in the world. Yet nothing is made there. There are no factories. Very little is done there that you could definitively say is "real value for the economy". Yet there it is. The greatest concentration of wealth in the world... right there where nothing is actually created other than "financial products" which amount to pushing paper around.
I believe that crypto is the answer for that. It is the equivalent of the factory automation for the financial industry. That has value, and that's why people like me have invested in it.

We are both making predictions. I have made the prediction that a 2mb + segwit chain will be longest and you're saying a UASF chain will be longest. If we're both being honest neither of us know which will actually be longest when the time comes.
To your point regarding developer count I have a particular interest. I am a software developer myself and have leveraged those skills and experience into now owning a development company working in large-scale manufacturing. It is very likely our software helped make products that are in your house right now.
That being said I have seen this line from over and over again... the "developer-knows-best" card being played... and to be fair it has worked thus far. The line is that this current dev team is the "only reliable team" who can work on this project. It is a risky play to make. The reality is your skills, or my skills, or my employee's skills are not one-of-a-kind. We are simply people with a set of skills that can be replaced. 
Be careful when ignoring your industry/customers/stakeholders (including miners) screaming at you for scaling (maybe not on your terms). If you ignore your customers and expect them to just accept a decrease in functionality and an increase in fees without consequences then I think you may find yourself on the outside eventually. Your leverage only reaches so far and I hope you recognise that. All too many times I've watched (and replaced) developers who get too comfortable and feel like they can leverage their "expertise" and thus ignore the needs of their customers. This never works.
Progress will be made eventually and the idea Bitcoin as a protocol will be forced to continue on with 3 developers if the Silbert compromise is reached is so utterly ridiculous that I find it hard to believe that you actually believe it. Good developers will continue to be interested even if you are long gone.

A sybil attack is a person, or group of people who form a massive amount of nodes and then use that leverage to do harm. 
In this case the attackers are creating nodes which do not accept non-segwit blocks as a means to try and force the miners to adopt segwit.

Peter Todd has been after Gavin's commit access for a while. This was just an opportunity for him.

"normal GitHub users submitting pull-reqs to Bitcoin Core can't delete
other users' comments on their own pull-reqs...
IMO that's an abuse of the pull-req process, and in turn, Gavin
Andresens's commit access rights for the Bitcoin Core repo.
I think this should weigh in favor of Gavin Andresen not having commit
privileges for the Bitcoin Core repository."

Where I speak of "stakeholders" I speak of everyone who has an interest in Bitcoin.... not speaking in just the "hodler" terms.
Sounds like the miners found a bug with Bitcoin Core and are exploiting it to their interest. I believe that is within their right. However, I also believe that miners would be open to discussions on how to patch that bug while also securing their long-term investments in the ecosystem.
Perhaps the Blockstream/Core group could get together with the miners and discuss this. There are lots of issues at play and I'm sure a mutual agreement could occur. Perhaps the miners could be afraid 2nd layer payments would take away their future revenues as it would divert payment fees from themselves to the owners of those 2nd layer providers.
I'm sure a negotiation could result in a positive longterm outlook for Bitcoin overall... including the miner's major investment in the network.
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:38:41
Segwit does a lot more than just add some extra capacity. Perhaps the miners are concerned about those other consequences?

One of the biggest innovations with Bitcoin as a protocol is that it uses individual incentives to motivate actions that also encourage the greater good for the ecosystem.
If this has fallen out of balance it is the job of Core to re-balance the system and work with the miners to come up with a solution that works for everyone.

The most common way to receive Bitcoins is to exchange local fiat currency for them. As far earning them directly you may need to get slightly more creative. This is a subreddit focused on Jobs which receive payment in bitcoin: 
I see bitcoin as the democratization of money. I don't know that Bitcoin can change anything overnight. But I do believe that many aspects of society can be improved through the use of Bitcoin. I also believe that there are entire industries which exist for the sole purpose of facilitating transactions or placing themselves in-between those who do work and the goods and services those people need. Bitcoin will hopefully assist in making sure that people who perform functions for society are more fairly rewarded.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:17:55
I also agree. China's capital controls address their concerns far beyond Bitcoin, but I think we are just saying the same thing in different ways.
Each nation will have its own reason to be wary of Bitcoin because generally in the past currencies have been tied to sovereign entities and therefore Bitcoin represents loss of some of that power. China has manipulated their currency/economy/workforce for its own perceived benefit and Bitcoin has the potential to tear down some of their carefully crafted walls.
America will likely face something similar in the future as well as Dollars likely lose reserve status. Thus Bitcoin might be attacked because it plays a part in that, but ultimately what the policy makers care about is losing reserve status, not as much about Bitcoin itself.
Edit: Word.

I would imagine the price will be only somewhat affected. These days it's not especially crazy for over $10 million to be traded in a day just on GOX and the time it takes for people to get their funds back into the market will be spread out. It's good news for everyone though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:56:18


Wouldn't the April "bubble" violate this? It's been "pricked" and "re-inflated". I think the "prick" being referred to here is really a sense of fear and uncertainty in the market and thus it becomes reflected in prices and selling action. There has been plenty of time at this point for uncertainty to take hold after that "burst" and yet here we are "re-inflating". 
I'm not saying Bitcoin can't go lower, but I am saying your little model here doesn't apply.

Appropriate username. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:57:55
You're absolutely correct.
It is a bit disheartening from a "globalistic" perspective that Bitcoin is still just money, and money can be bought by those who "have". In itself it can't fix the "have" and "have not" distribution of wealth problem we have, and I agree that problem is very real.
However if we lived in a world where real production and real "work" generated real wealth we would be moving very far towards social equality. Today we live in a world where currency manipulation and strategic political lobbying has the ability to generate wealth solely because the process of generating wealth is controlled by people, and people can be influenced.
I really hope for a day where I can tell somebody I will pay you xxx bitcoin for something I need done. They then have generated wealth for themselves through their work. Then some asshat with influence has no way to generate his own wealth other than receive that wealth for work. Not because he had influence and power to control how the currency is distributed, but because somebody else gave him that wealth for a reason.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:24:50
In my mind these events are not "attacks". Warning citizens about the volatility and potential loss associated with investing in Bitcoin is not an attack. The French guidance pretty much said what we would have said to anyone in this subreddit in regards to the risks.
As far as Norway goes, I don't think this is necessarily bad either. Because nations have to classify Bitcoin as something, but don't really have the laws in place to support it, any way they immediately classify it will likely be imperfect. I would expect in time that nations form laws around crypto-currencies.
China's news today was clearly an attack on the idea of the free transfer of capital into Bitcoin. They have begun doing what they can to halt the growth of the currency. This is clearly the largest direct action against Bitcoin so far and shows that China is planning to have a very strict stance towards crypto-currencies. It is a game-changing event.

I got involved in bitcoins prior to the 2011 bubble. If you had told me back then that I would still be talking about bitcoins in 2013 I would have been ecstatic. 
These people are just waking up to bitcoin and it is weird, different, complicated etc... CNN expected for the bubble to burst and this to go away and the tone of this article is still one of "we have to still talk about this, but one day we won't anymore". I'm confident they are going to be learning about and writing a lot more stories about it in the future. By then they will wish they had been involved earlier because of how wonderful of a concept it is.
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:40:00
I understand your point.
Because Bitcoin is so new the average person can not simply work and live on Bitcoin, maybe someday but not today. Thus you could easily look at it and say "what does it fix then? How does it help when a rich person can just buy all the wealth. What did the little guy gain"?
I think the answer to that works backwards. Right now as a society we depend on political bodies (countries) to distribute the measure of wealth in the form of currency. Those people in power, and those with influence thus have the ability to tilt that distribution of wealth in their favor using laws. 
This group of companies get these sorts of special rules, those groups over there are in charge of this. It can be manipulated to assist those with the means to influence those in power.
Bitcoin can not be manipulated and nobody is "special". One special group of people can't all  of the sudden turn 1 Bitcoin into 10 because they are called a "Bank" etc... It turns the distribution of wealth and the power of that wealth over to the people. It doesn't matter if you have .00005 bitcoins or 100,000. You can't change how the rules work to suit you, and I think that is a very big deal.

This is as big part of why this drop is as severe and as quick as it is. Most people who already had accounts prior to the sell off had little or no liquid US Dollars available to purchase coins.

A bubble is an asset which grows at a rate faster than what most people believe it to be worth. Homes, tech stocks, rare earth stocks etc... people could put value on those things and say "this house just ins't worth 750k" because they know what a house should cost.
Bitcoin is different because the people screaming "bubble!" usually don't know anything about bitcoin. I think that the value growth for bitcoin needs to be tied to something real, like adoption. It is something that has utility now and will have untold utility in the future and that has value. That will fuel its growth along with speculators, but speculators can bring the price higher than the "true" value, which can cause the price to spike. They will also get out faster causing it to fall. The rest of us will wait.
I guess to wrap up my point, the bitcoin bubble will be a bubble until either 1) it loses value, or 2) "most" people start believe it is worth the value it is given. To say it is a bubble almost guarantees that you don't know anything about bitcoin, because while you can argue bitcoin won't be successful, you can't really argue that if it is successful it is currently undervalued.

My first piece of advice would be to understand the cautionary statements in both my post and in the other comments. Never put into Bitcoin more than you are willing to lose. If you don't have much disposable income I would be careful here. Decide what you could lose and not be emotionally or financially set back. Once you do that decide if Bitcoin is what you would like to buy.
That being said if you are interested enough in bitcoin that you are reading this subreddit and believe in the concept then start thinking about getting a wallet and getting a small amount to get started. It doesn't have to be much money to get involved.
[ (
I have personally used [ in the past when I have purchased some. Perhaps that would work for you as well. There are many ways to go about it.
I'll just repeat, while being a part of Bitcoin is fun, be aware that money is involved and be careful. Think about how you would FEEL if Bitcoin went down in value. If you never invest more than you would feel bad about losing or would change your quality of life, you should be okay.
