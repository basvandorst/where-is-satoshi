This is misleading. The fact that humans have accelerated global warming to the current rate is almost universally accepted by scientist. There is almost zero doubt that humans have precipitated the current rise in global temperatures.

This comment is inane. The free market does not give everyone power to choose for themselves. Entities with historical wealth will always have more power of choice than entities without. And how is democracy any more violent than any other system?

I'm sure this guy is a climate scientist with at least a masters in a STEM field and decades of research on the subject. Let's just wait for his evidence.

Yes, but we’re talking about how Bitcoin (and most other cryptocurrencies) is better to use for transactions than gold. Bitcoin is much more easily divisible and is much more counterfeit proof.

Gold’s value is way, way, way above its actual real world uses. Gold doesn’t derive more than a marginal amount of value from its metallurgical properties.
Bitcoin also allows for transactions to take place outside of government backed currency. That’s an inherent value.

No one’s stopping you from making serious posts and comments and having a serious discussion. Is it that hard to just scroll past a meme?

Every day that bitcoin is still valued in the four figure range is still a good time to buy. Buying at 8k or 4k or 9k or whatever is relatively unimportant if you think bitcoin will accelerate to 50-100x that value, and completely unimportant if you believe that BTC will one day grow beyond a unique financial instrument into a truly dominant global currency.

Socialism is when the government does stuff. The more stuff the government does, the socialister it is.

Do you have any proof, as in evidence or analysis, that backs up that statement?
Given that Bitcoin has been on a generally upward trajectory since its inception, if you lump sum at any point you are likely to be better off than a DCA strategy. 
Anecdotally, If I employed DCA from the day I first bought BTC until now I would have far, far less BTC than I do (got in at ~$650). 
And again, like I said, there has never been a study that has conclusively determined that DCA is a better way to invest.
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:11:07
If I’m completely wrong, then please find me a study that shows how DCA is a superior investing strategy.

That's nearly two million dollars of volume on a two week old platform. I'm not a Bakkt user and don't presently plan on being one, but I don't see how that's laughable.

We have to be careful, if he dies BTC will rapidly drop to 0.
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:46:52
There haven’t been any studies that have demonstrated that DCA is a better strategy for investing than lump sum. It’s just a psychological thing to make compulsive spenders feel better.
@_date: 2019-10-27 02:04:58
I can agree with that. I guess I don’t have a literal stake in this since I haven’t bought BTC in years. With how volatile BTC has been over the last two years I can see the appeal of DCA.

It's not even been falling fast enough to consider an upswing a dead cat bounce.
