Stock market, money market, any market has it's ups and downs. When something sky rockets - it will fall aswell, and then in some time it will sky rocket again.
This is bitcoin i love it and i get the idea.
But i'm in the markets so long that u just start to see one thing - rule of sell high-buy low always wins. U just have to wait for it.
Use wisdom, not emotion.
Good luck gettting rich, guys, we have some time, but soon there will be correction before going up even further.
Correction is a must, that's the market and now it's overbought.
The bigger the jump the bigger the correction.
After the corrections there's gonna be a lot bigger jump, u just have to see the right time to buy it.
Appreciate your attention, bye.
