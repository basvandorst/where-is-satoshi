Asked a painter to redo the picture. First he made the draw by pencil, second add the black painting. Many point allow you to see the 2 picture doesn't match, but liked the result anyway.

I live in france and can confirm, my country is soooo retard. Everywhere, no one know about bitcoin. Their is only 2 bitcoin atm in the same place at paris. And that's it... so sad to be part of the most out dated country. Even in mexico bitcoin is accepted in nearly 30k store...

 Nothing new with the actual state of bitcoin, their was never real anonymity. We can only speak about pseudo-anonymity but no fungability at all.
