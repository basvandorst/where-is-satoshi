I've been diagnosed with PTSD, and regular talk-therapy, as well as Prolonged Exposure therapy has been effective for me, but I am very close with other people who haven't been able to benefit from the current established treatments. I really appreciate this, and I'm sure they do too.

Y'all ever read  ?
What an embarrassing display for both economists and related journalists. I've never learned of  "experts" be this wrong outside the field of physics before.

Once my identity gets verified on Gemini then moving all my BTC and ETH there. I may have to stick my LTC in a hardware wallet for now.
We might not know if any foul play in involved in Coinbase's dealings today, but this if far too bad of publicity for anything I'm willing to keep my money in.

you don't honestly believe that sending $30 equivalent of Bitcoin requires $28 worth of mining fees, do you?
also, they obviously have a segwit compatible wallet.

Anyone else completely unable to buy anything using Coinbase right now for no apparent reason?
God I cannot wait for my fucking Gemini account to get verified.
Edit: Yep, this was corrected a few minutes later.

I'm going to be so annoyed if news outlets start reporting on this as "the bubble popping"

This is interesting to watch. I was honestly confident that sellers would be completely exhausted between noon yesterday and 6AM this morning when I went to sleep, especially with the low-cost buy pressure. 
I was definitely expecting us to have broken $15k by now, 8 hours later.
Whatever. I bought more last night around $13k, but I need to relax and stop trying to understand this.

Unfortunately not. All the coin options are being displayed as unavailable for me, no matter price input.

Also I'd like to note that if this trend continues, it will prove beyond a doubt that BCH is terrible for the market as a whole. Even with all of BTC's transaction issues recently, it consistently pulls other cryptos up when its value rises. All I'm seeing today is proof that BCH leeches off not just Bitcoin, but all the other best coins.

If you have .1 BTC sent to an address of my choice I'll change the Blockchain account I don't use to an email/password of your choice. Then you could change whatever info you wanted.
