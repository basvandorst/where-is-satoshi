Hi everyone. I just wanted to update you all (A bit late I know) that the website is working, and that we also take them in-store now.
Also we have experimented with taking them in the store now. So we at least have a way to do it. One problem has been the time to authorize. It seems to be taking about 5 to 10 min, which is kinda a long time to wait around.
I think for established customers we will just let them leave, and if theres a problem send an email.
Here is out bitcoin landing page:

If only I kept the 200 of so bitcoins I got in 2010/2011; when they were $2 a bitcoin! But I saw dollar signs in my eyes when they went to $8 then again when they went to $16, then got hacked!
We don't use an offline wallet address now, but we use bitpay to accept them and blockchain.info to store them. To my understating blockchain is the most secure online storage possible.

A few months ago our shopping cart (3dcart) started to support BitPay. Before that I just kinda rigged something up which calculated how much bitcoins to tell the customer to send to my wallet. Then I would check to make sure we got the transfer before we shipped out the products. 
Now with bitpay its all done automatically, and is more secure because each transaction has its own wallet address.
