after you depositing, bank has 1000$ as fractional reserve and can lend out 9000$ only owning the original 1000$ (only a fraction ) 
what the hell are you calculating .if they would only lend out 90cents on the dollar that would mean banks have more money in their hands but that is not the case with fractional banking

banks lending out only 90% what they have would be right thing to do but this is not the case, lol i dont get it how your calculations are so bad that you dont understand it.
my englis is bit bad to explain this correctly but i try. banks can lend what ever the amount they want, they only need 10% as reserve.
so if you deposit 1k$ bank can offer someone 10k$ loan, and that 10k$ loan is backed by 1k$ (a fraction ) 
i get how some americans will get confused by percentages etc.. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:05:43
no its not the same.
in first example your whole theory is built on that people will not use single dollar in cash money and only deposit the money, and that is not the case in real world.
user deposits 1000$ and bank loaning out 90% from that amount is totally different (900$)than bank using users deposit of 1000$ as fraction and can instantly lend out 9000$more. 
both systems use 1000$ but from your theory only 900$can be made,
thous ´from mine 1000$ you can make additional 9000$ . percentage may be the same but math is not. 
if bitcoin drops from 20000$ to 10000$ then losing 50% but
jumping from 10000$ to 20000$ is not 50% gain . its 100% .
see the difference, numbers are same but not the math.

so the real losers are people who sold coins for tether.

@_date: 2018-01-05 23:41:00
very good idea. now everyone sees what it is used for. especially good for when you lose it, now people who will find it, think twice before searching for its owner lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:27:59

When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain.

maybe in usa , but in other world, cash is king. 
wow people are so in love with banks they dont even see options of using cash and standing against banks,
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:15:16
what ad finitum calculation? you are calculating that every single penny will be deposited right back in bank.
i dont see how this can be true. someone needs a loan, and then instead using it, deposits ALL of it, back into the account? whats the point of loaning it then ?
if banks have my option or yours, bet my money they do like i describe ;)

homes should be cheaper.
when we had slavery (im not from states) slave could earn enough to build house in 5 years . 
now we are free and it takes 30 years to pay the house loan.
so, are we not slaves now ?
