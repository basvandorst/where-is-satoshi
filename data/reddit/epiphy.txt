Believe it or not I actually tried to order a license plate here in California with a series of 1's and I's, and it told me I couldn't do that.

As a thought experiment, imagine for a moment that the US government was using bitcoin instead of the dollar. Bitcoin WOULD be more liquid than cash, because people could still print their own cash, or email it, or text it, or sign up for bank cards with fraud protection, etc. Banks could still do everything they are doing now, including loans, just replace the dollar signs with B's. The only difference is the end users get more flexibility. Of course, there's a lot bitcoin needs to do before that kind of wide spread use, but you get the idea.
Once we have this flexibility, nobody would switch back to the dollar. It would be akin to the government making a law today that online banking is illegal. Online banking didn't exist 30 years ago, yet people would revolt for going backwards into the stone age if they tried to get rid of it.
As a general rule, if it's harder to stop using it than to start, then you are heading the right direction. We aren't there for everyone yet, but I can see a day when my kids will say "Wait, you're telling me you had to write checks and wait 3 days for someone to approve the transfer? Why couldn't you just email it to them?"
My point is, it's not mainstream yet, but it's the right direction to be heading. I would even take a fed coin over the dollar, if it meant I could see the ledger and email cash to people.
