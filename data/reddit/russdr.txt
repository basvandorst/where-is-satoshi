You're absolutely right. 
 I'm not suggesting that was my answer to the problem, I just couldn't think of any other ways that bitcoin could survive in economies with AML regulations.

I'm almost certain most people in this subreddit don't feel that way anymore. As soon as a comment even slightly implies Overstock vs. Amazon, there is a comment about Amazon's crushing sales figures.

I love the bits describing bitcoins potential impact globally along with the discussion of the 1st world's perception of bitcoins volatility.
It's those aspects that I wish were the points that are continuously brought up in mainstream media interviews and reporting, not the fear mongering garbage slung around about how bitcoin is dead every time an institution fails.  It's always the same points over and over, yet bitcoin survives.

A bit generalized, don't you think?
The truth isn't always immediate. We rely on some folks to give us honest news, but as you can see in every thread about this Nakamoto unmasking thus far, is that people are taking it with a grain of salt.  They're taking personal responsibility to go above and beyond and find out the truth.  
There are people that will read the story, stop there and formulate an opinion based on just that. I assure you, it's more than just Americans. The same goes for those who choose to dig further.

More like...  Thanks for your house.  While we're at it,  we'll take your driving privilege too. You can't have that back until you pay your late fees, fines and surcharges!
It's amazing how much the US government can fuck with your life if you don't pay them money.  
The fucked up part about all of these local, state and government agencies is no matter how fucked up their internal systems are and how slow they are to help you, no matter how much they fuck you over, that bill to collect your money always comes right on fucking time. And dammit if they don't nab you with a late fee and a bench warrant if you're one day late too. 
What do they chalk it up to? Their "automated systems".  Funny how those automated systems are so conveniently working in their favor.

That is a terrific response! 
I started reading your comment and thought it was another response skirting the issue.  I came out of it with another viewpoint entirely. It's a viewpoint I can't always see due to today's societial norms being continuously shoved in my face.  Sometimes things are screwed up for so long that you forget how they are supposed to be.
Unfortunately, some countries around the world do not share the same rights, let alone those in regards to privacy.

I've had BTC transfer instantaneously from Coinbase, I've had it take a couple minutes and I've had it take a couple hours. One thing that was always consistent was that it always got to where it was supposed to go.

I'm not sure if you realize this, but your continued commenting about reposting has not dissuaded anyone. In fact, it's probably going to get worse as Bitcoin gets more popular. Save your breath and frustration and actually add to the conversation.
  The proliferation of bitcoin is done through the spread of information which includes reposts and it takes you longer to write a complaining post than it does to just keep scrolling by.  Do the Bitcoin subreddit community a service and just stop.  You're doing more harm than good by cluttering up productive and educational activity with your whining.

The "high risk" account flagging is done by automation.  E-Mail customer  support.

Your credit card? I believe they charge you immediately...  And you enter that charge into coinbase after you click verify.
 I apologize if I'm incorrect, it's been a while since I've had to verify a card.
