exactly, confidence in bitcoin comes from people seeing that it is still not dead. This then gives them the confidence to invest.

ill buy some at 5.5k next year.

lets say that Bitcoin is CIA for a minute. Its well and truely done its job in introducing the world to the idea of digital programable money. Whilst funding tons of projects and development.. Genius.

when augmented reality, virtual reality meets crypto currency that will basically create the matrix where we are all walking around getting paid to take part and live in a simulated digital world. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 11:29:07
yeah in a year or so crypto will be dead and quiet and i MAY then invest in something. But only when im buying stuff for virtually nothing. i dont like to gamble.

every day that goes by is another day of bitcoin running away from you. Whats happening now is very Bullish for Bitcoin, it is after all NOT dead. Every day that Bitcoin is not dead is another reason for big money to start taking bitcoin more and more seriously. We are in a giant bear trap. I read a guy yesterday who had to sell his Nano at a massive loss because he needs the money. This is what is happening now, only the strong and patient will survive.

once all the emotions and house money is rinsed from 2017 bubble will bitcoin move. Only shakeouts and fake outs for the next 12 months. The 2020 halving will be a massive disappointment. It will pump and dump miserably. Sometime after that we will start to see green shoots again.

this is when we send an alt coin in instead.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:31:33

Tell her that new kitchen gunna cost her half a million dollars if she spends that bitcoin in it.

i didnt put any time frame on anything all i said was its going to grind sideways for 6 months and if anything drift lower. I also said we wont see 10k again for a long long time. I stand by this and time will tell but me being me knows im right, sorry. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:30:33
only buy with money that you will never need and as long as you have a stream of fiat to keep buying with. Its not going to go shooting up anytime soon other than on dead cat bounces, true bull markets are years in the making. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:47:01
6 months of grinding sideways if you ask me, it will rise slowly and be a complete nightmare to trade it or get a position unless your buying in and holding with long term and firm belief bias. By the time its at 8 or 9 k it will have been so long and painful that it still wont look attractive because it can and most probably will have flash crashes erasing any gains. Nobody will want the headache of trading bitcoin for years, it wont rise until 95 percent of market participants are either broke, dead or completely exhausted.

Its not going to hit 10k for a long long time, it was a bubble mate behaving like a typical bubble. Everyone is still hyped and over confident about a recovery, it will grind away slowly, being stable for ages probably drifting down. Green shoots might appear eventually but before another bubble is born it will be choppy as hell and a nightmare to trade. weak hands have nothing to do with it, i have enough crypto and fiat to last me a lifetime.

november december 2017 was about 3 years in the making. It happens so fast nobody but those with firm exit strategy has an idea what to do. Every time its bubbled iv made way more than i bargained for and then sat there in disbelief and watched it fall again.  Bottom is nowhere near yet will take a long long time for everyone to throw the towel in. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:50:19
thats the problem, whales and early adopters don't view the current market as cheap at all. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:45:01
goes and buys shares in Sony
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:48:52
buy 25 percent now. 25 percent in two days, 25 percent more in a week. the rest in 2 weeks. Then keep buying.

This is hilarious, OP thinks bitcoin crashed because coke dealer dave needs his 1000 dollars to buy more coke. hilarious.

i was ripped off by bitpay when i used them, first and last time. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:16:14
It was obviously going to pump, from 3k to 4k thats a easy 1k pump for whales with a 30 percent profit. This game is manipulated for those to make money. I smelt the risk reward ratio was high and so loaded up, the questions is when to sell. Is it a trap like i just explained or do we have momentum now. Nobody knows. I see it going to 5k and sitting there for most of 2019 though personally.

Anyone predicting prices with less than 5 years experience in crypto has no clue. Charlie lee is the only person worth listening too, he was able to identify the top, warned people not to buy and said litecoin would go back to 20 dollars. Is he a genius? a prophet? no he just has more experience of how crypto behaves than most. Just too add to this iv been in crypto since 2013 and was able to identify the top. It was easy really since it was gapping up 1k in 24 hours, which is a classic blow off top, seen time and time again in any bubble. Crypto only bubbles but thats because 10 years in its still new and yet so powerful because it will completely change the way we live. I have to remind myself that back in 2003 i wanted to invest in Apple because i understood the appeal of Mp3 and loved the iMac where previously i hated computers. The problem was i was 22 years old and didn't believe in myself enough. Once the iPhone was announced i knew it was going to be something special but by then i figured id missed the boat since by that time the iPod had gone semi mainstream in my eyes and i figured everyone would know the iPhone would be huge success. How wrong i was, it was still the beginning for Apple stock. I believe we are at a similar stage now with crypto ie the cat is out of the bag, but it is still very very early days. Experience is EVERYTHING and eventually experience will pay off. You have to believe in yourself, not give up and have patience. Save your money and buy when you can not believe how much crypto you can buy for your money. They will be giving it away for the first half of next year.

2017 i turned 2 grand into over 2million. Had 150 bitcoins 100k in bitconnect, money all over the place. sold some at the very top. Got washed out in the alt coin massacre and now im wanting to buy back in but it will hurt me more financially than make anything better i feel. my gut tells me spring/summer 2019 will be the time to buy. NANO at one dollar looks tasty though. If alts go back up ill be laughing so i just got to hold but at the moment there isn't much worth investing in. its all junk right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:10:02
The justification is its easy to manipulate, i put my money into EOS and managed to accumulate bitcoin as well. I made about 12k and  wanted to sell into cash over 4k but got myself all caught up in the EOS situation. Mad at myself because i could have fllipped it into stratis or Bcash and been up enough to be happy going to tether. Now im stuck because what ever i do it going to be wrong. I need EOS to pump over 7k Sats so i can make another move.

There is too much un certainty right now. As much as everyone is hating on it bitcoin SV might be a better option going into next year. When it comes down to it, the whole space is in deep shite right now. Forks are the worst thing that could possibly happen and we have the worst case scenario playing out now with SV. I wouldn't like to bet against clavin or craig wright to be honest. Im not too keen on CW but then when it comes down to it Roger Ver is living in a dream world. The government will win because as the saying goes i fought the law and the law won. I believe SV will come out on top next year when it proves itself but its going from the ground up and its going to take so much time and basically many people are going to get completely destroyed in this fire. sit on sidelines mate, we are going back to the start before we go anywhere.
