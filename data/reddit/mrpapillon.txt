You try to base on who you decide to listen because you are probably not a programmer nor a bitcoin expert. A bitcoin expert and programmer would have no fear listening to the technical propositions of anyone, including Hitler, Staline or Mark Karpeles.
Also an engineer knows that one idea that didn't work in the past, can start working in a different context.

I am French and I downvote you.

Someone told me that he thinks that the WWW will virtually disappear and be replaced by social networking, as a web of people instead of a web of computers or websites. So that when you do a search, you don't search a list of pages, but you travel on links between people to search content.
I think the Internet as we know actually merges different concepts: the technology that allows data to travel through computers, and the virtual space and system where data is shared.
So I guess it is a very interesting approach not to take the Internet as a model, and do research on every opportunity to go as far as we can. Bitcoin is an experiment, but maybe better things are still hidden whatever the ideology that lies behind Bitcoin.

You use a lot of emotion in your post but a lack of rational arguments. Also you seem filled with some kind of hatred, I don't know why, but I won't probably change you anyway. You are also associating me to some other people and I don't know why. I had few coins on MtGox at the time, and I removed them as soon as I noticed valid doubts on Reddit and that I shaped the MtGox technical situation. So I don't understand why you extrapolated in this way and I don't see what I could have said in my previous posts that could have led you to this. Your reaction is extreme, or at least non common on Reddit I guess, so I will add a remark. Obviously, you are showing that you were not a victim of Karpeles, but still you are insulting them with a lot of hate as if it was something directly implying you. My bet is that you are angry about something, that you use the scenario of bitcoin to create a situation that would represent that thing you are angry about and that you use it unconsciously as a way to fight it or to raise your ego above it as a kind of solution. It can also be a frustration from the same scenario happening in another situation and that you don't want it to happen again. Or many other common nevrosis issues like that, I am not a psy so I am certainly wrong, but you have the idea. 
 I am a software engineer, not a bitcoin expert though, not even an amateur since I did not take a lot of time to try to understand the algorithms involved. I started being interested in bitcoin when it was at 75$, so way later than you but I see that I can still give more arguments, so your metric seems not to be as useful as you would expect. 
I know that sometimes emotion and passion can drive things, but I stand to the fact that the rational thinking was what has driven mankind to the industrial age. Even after the failure of Karpeles, most engineers know that there are always things to learn from a post-mortem lecture from the guys involved in. And MtGox was big, had probably tons of things that happened that may have been novel. This is mankind, sometimes people fight, but sometimes people work and try to share to learn and advance. Karpeles could have stayed in the void because of his current situation, but he still continues to post and to share and that is something of value from him.
Also some irony: you know that bitcoin is about removing central control and moving to a distribution model. Because of technical pros but also because of the philosophy. You show a will of immediate censorship and you show the dev mailing list as the place were things happen. I would remember you that the core devs of bitcoins will become a central control authority if you put too much value on them. The more value they have, and the more they will direct the destiny of bitcoin. The more they will direct the destiny of bitcoin and the more they will be subject to pressure and lobbying, whether they remain honest or not. I hope you will agree on that point. I am mostly a spectator of bitcoin, I don't want to get involve a lot, but I can see it harming the original concept.

In 2002, the russian Grigori Perelman solved the century-old Poincaré conjecture. 
He rejected the Fields medal with a million cash prize. 
When asked why he refused from the prize of one million dollars, Perelman responded: "I've learned to compute hollowness. Me and my colleagues are studying the mechanisms that fill social and economic hollowness. Hollowness is everywhere, it can be computed, and this opens large opportunities. I know how to control the Universe. Why would I run after a million, tell me?"
@_date: 2015-01-29 08:09:07
Totally agree. But I never put much hope when mass has to decide or create conceptual ideas. Bitcoin was created by one atomic virtual human and the mass is trying to make it grow by stretching in every direction regardless of the inherent symbolic value of the involved tools.
@_date: 2015-01-29 07:13:53
฿ is still based on the Dollar. The Dollar is mostly an american symbol while Bitcoin aims to become universal. ฿ is still fun and can be viewed as satirical yes.
I get it that most people on Reddit are americans, but remember that the rest of the world might not see ฿ as something positive. Even less when bitcoin's creator has not been proved to be related to US soil. I am myself french and even if I quite like the ฿ logo, I indirectly don't like it as I won't like any concept stealing.
Americans like to jump fast on opportunities, so they are jumping on the symbol thing and doing according to their own culture and references. But please remember that americans are  only 4% of the world, and that the rest is not on Reddit.
And if you check the story of the $, you will see that it is based on interesting symbol evolution. Bitcoin's logo shouldn't be based on some "yeah that looks cool", we need something more deep that actually means something as well as being cool looking.

Not statistically though. Statistically we win more than any other european country. You could also probably include the US in the package.

Not if he was in France:  (sorry for french, but that's my source).
If he was in France, the US could have asked french justice to get him convicted in France, but we don't extradite our citizens, at least not to the US.

You sure of that? I hope you are not counting the WW2 in it? 385 soviet divisions against 211 Wehrmarcht on the East front while only 25-40 allied divisions in France including the UK. Stalin was begging for years for you to join and help him, you wanted to, but Churchill said "no", so you didn't come. You only came at the end and did movies about it. 
Also the Free French forces helped in Africa, there were 40 divisions of it at the end of the war. Roosevelt tried everything he could to dismantle these Free French forces because he didn't want De Gaulle as a leader. But it got stronger and stronger and won its legitimacy.
Also don't forget that we helped you to gain your independence and that your Civil War was a poor attempt at copy-pasting Napoleon's strategies and tactics.

In french, every noun has a gender. For example a circle is male and a sphere is female. We also have a neutral gender that is kind of weird because it is the same as the male gender. So the neutral gender is implicit. The neutral gender is very common and is used everywhere when talking about persons. Our system is a bit weird, so weird that it is very complicated to have any gender debate on it. 
The gender system in english seems quite simple, but I see that it looks like lacking of a proper widespread neutral gender, even implicit. So now I fear of it becoming more and more a target to gender debates. 
On a personal note, I would have preferred strong, powerful and smart pamphlets for gender equality instead of the constant guerilla we have currently. These small battles, without strong idea leading, make the cause more of an annoyance than anything.

How is that a good point? You don't have gender neutral 'his' in english? If some find it so terrible, just invent some abstract thing that will replace the 'his' by 'it' and we're done.
A bitcoin paper should have nothing to do with gender debates.

This does not seem much counter productive, it looks like it works quite effectively. Sure people complain and make alt subs, but is still working and BitcoinCore is still in the forefront. Probably that in a few months, everything will get back to normal, with people having a bit of paranoia remaining.
I am against any censorship, but it sadly looks like a success to me.

In France, when the Internet was rising, a secret paper was passed to the public France Telecom company to increase the cost of usage of 56K to counter it. We had a national wide network before the Internet in France, it was called "Minitel" (and you had to pay to access for every page on it), and the will was to increase the chance of Minitel to beat the Internet in France (the foolish attempt is laughable now, and was certainly laughable at that time if we were aknowledged of that at that time).

I don't think there are marketing issues. I think that probably we are entering a new age of marketing where openly bulshitting is not the hype anymore. It may be better to have open company ego with clear insights of what is done, I bet that is what we have here.
The best companies of the world nowadays have been very aggressive in their approach, I feel that the old pattern of displaying complete application of a how-to-do marketing solution may not appeal for people requiring a service to be done and be done fast and transparently, instead of a old good friendly opaque company.

Bitcoin needs some kind of "banking" companies that provide security storage for private keys. I guess this is it. This is not "centralization", this is services built on top of a decentralized network.
