Yes, holding makes the coin more valuable, which brings more liquidity (the same coins available for sell can capture more wealth), which allows for more wealth to be transferred or stored and with a lower spread, etc.
Please call it "saving" or "holding", not "hoarding", which is a pejorative term used by the establishment to discourage saving with sound money.

So where's the article?

It's common knowledge. Read the FAQ for basic things like this.

Is this supposed to replace today's web (doesn't sound possible), or is it more for very lightweight text-only websites only (useful against censorship)? I'm struggling with the concept.
Maybe tomorrow's web will be heavy sites using traditional servers + Namecoin, and lightweight, controversial sites using ZeroNet?

You are crazy.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:55:40
What do you think about the fact that right now, for every bitcoin user, there are like 3 or 4 buttcoiners spreading negativity and derailing all the discussions all day long? Are you ok with that? Why do you think every time someone brings up the topic, it's upvoted to the front page? Why does it seem like the only ones in this sub who are ok with the situation, are the mods and the buttcoiners?
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:32:07
Because I have eyes and know how to read.

It's pretty crazy that the maximum amount you can carry ($10,000 in this case) is the same for everyone, no matter how much wealth you can generate and save. If you managed to save $10,000 or less (because of low income or because you aren't great at saving), they let you cross the border. If you managed to save $20,000 (because you earn more or because you are a better saver) and try to cross the border, you are automatically tagged as "money launderer" (even if you have proof that you earned the money legally), your money is stolen by the government, and you are sent to rot in jail.

Actually, Satoshi predicted ASICs.


It's not a "layer of security", I don't know why you keep calling it that. You can't grab the PoW blockchain, attach it to anything, and magically make it more secure.


In a system like the one you are imagining, but without the PoW, the other participants would simply invalidate the hacked node and revoke its trust.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:43:50
If trust is required, the voting power and fees will be distributed based on politics, and not on hashing power. Imagine if banks used your system, and one of the banks decided to buy a lot more hashing power than the others. Would they be ok with that bank reaping almost all the fees? Of course not. Since it's trust based, they could simply revoke his trust and leave him out. So why would he ever bother buying any amount of hashing power? There is no incentive to do it, he will get all the fees his political power allows him, and not a penny less than that. And why would the other banks want to continue participating in such a network? The mining part makes no sense for them.

Nah, corrupted files can happen randomly. Even cosmic rays could cause that. The machine tries to autocorrect the altered bits using certain mechanisms, but some times it's not possible. It can also be just a bug in the software.

What's wrong about 21 inc? Why not share what you know, that we don't?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:01:56
What if someone hacks one of your "trusted" participants? What if he goes rogue? What if he uses more hashing power than the others?
Stop trying to "blockchain all the things!", your system doesn't make any sense.

This shit again? This is the altcoin that:
- Is a clone of Ripple, rebranded so that his creator could dump his coins *again*
- Was shutdown centrally by its devs (no need to ask for consensus, lol, which was the proof that it was 100% centralized) to fix a bug
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:28:54


Not that it matters or that I should tell you, but I have written brain-wallet miners.


I'm sorry if you don't like Ripple and felt offended. But even without you, there are other mods who have shilled for it, like ThePiachu.


No, I'm pretty sure of what I'm talking about, and I'm not the only one who tried to explain this to you. A hash-tree or a distributed database is not the same as a PoW blockchain. And a PoW blockchain only makes sense in an open, trustless system.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:26:34
This is no different than any other program, I don't know how to help you. Did you try deleting the file? Create a new wallet and when asked whether you want to import the seed, import it.
If this doesn't work, try with a different software. There are many wallets that use the same type of seed, the standard is called BIP39. If you have an Android phone you can use Mycelium.

Ok, but I really think he was a mod, are you sure he never was? I remember someone asking "But why do we trust this guy? What did he ever do, other than saying 'to the moon!'"?
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:57:29
The whole point of Bitcoin is open and trustless distributed consensus. For a closed system with trusted participants just use a regular database; not only do you not need a PoW blockchain, it would be bad to use one.
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:29:38


She's in jail with people convicted for violent crimes, and her bail was denied.
Oh but it's ok because she "broke the law". Right?


Well, here the limit was 10k USD. Bam! You made a mistake and I send you to jail. Oh and the money is mine now.

The power. Trolls are running rampant in this sub, and we can't stop them even as a majority, because all the power is centralized in Theymos, who apparently has gone the route of mods like the ones in Money can buy anything.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:16:18
The chicken and egg problem.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:24:17
When the price goes up it's the only time when the trolls go away. We have no other way to keep them away because there are no real mods here. The mods are trolls too. Some of them are even moderators of @_date: 2015-04-09 19:47:51
I didn't use any alts, besides reddit probably limits it by IP. If it didn't, it would be easy to manipulate all the votes with a program.
And you can win the 20m bits anyway, you don't need votes. The 10m bits is a separate competition, because it requires "that has nothing to do with the questions asked".

Actually it isn't.
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:38:04
It doesn't use PoW. In fact, Ripple existed before Bitcoin. Now they are just trying to ride the buzzwords wave, like many other coins.

There are no servers, because it's not a server-client architecture. It's a peer-to-peer network, a decentralized system. So the difficulty is calculated in multiple computers all over the world, anonymously. Each participant can leave or join the network at any moment, without asking for permission.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:50:57
So the original Stellar was a clone, but now the company decided that it was bad for their image, so they rewrote it? Why would anyone use such a marketing-driven coin? Why not use a coin with actual technical merit instead?
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:13:45
lol imagine that. When Bitcoin becomes more valuable, and Satoshi becomes the richest person ever, he will be able to put honest and capable people in charge of countries.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:42:55
Ever heard of "bans"? It's a tool mods have to deal with trolls, and it works just fine in every other sub. Unfortunately, Theymos unilaterally decided this sub will not ban any trolls. In fact, some of the mods are also mods of so that should give you an idea of the situation we are into.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:34:58
I think he was a mod. Maybe he stepped down after seeing how corrupt the other mods are?

How does that make her a "money launderer", who deserves to have her legally earned money stolen and be sent 14 years to jail? Besides, the same would have happened with $20,000. The limit is just an arbitrary number.
Let's hope you know all the laws, stay up to date and never make any mistakes.

Baby steps. I'm not sure we would be better off with no Trezor. The industry is growing and getting experience. Eventually it will be good enough.

I think he's legit. He seems to be like his father, but with marketing that might actually work. That has bothered some hardcore libertarians, who don't understand that you can't win the elections being 100% honest and blunt. I think once in power he might show himself a little more libertarian, at least in his actions.

Oracle isn't making banks inefficient. Governments are.
Bitcoin is fast and efficient when compared to today's banks, because it's decentralized and doesn't care about governments. It's just bits on the internet.
Oracle (or any other traditional database), without the regulations, can be much much faster and efficient than Bitcoin. But I don't see regulations being improved or going away any time soon.
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:51:20
Except in your closed system there is no hashing power to begin with, so it's very easy to attack. Or you expect them to create a mining industry out of nowhere, with no incentives to do so?
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:23:44
Whether it uses reward + fees or just fees, it doesn't change anything. What matters is whether it uses PoW or not, and PoW doens't make sense in a closed, trust-based system. You should make an effort and try to understand what people here are explaining to you, instead of trying to go on with your argument at all cost. It's starting to look like you have a mission to defend Ripple.
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:55:36


You are derailing the discussion here. We were talking about something else entirely.

What normal people see: In 2013 there was a huge spike, and now it went back to something stable, but still with huge gains.
What negative people see: That huge spike was the normal state (even though at the time they didn't want to say that either, because everything has to be negative. "This is just a temporary spike"), and everything after that is a "collapse".
