I actually don't know and don't have a miner but mining calculators say that the 1500$ antminer s9 makes you 700$ a month.

Because produkt development is more profit then Bitcoin mining but I would think they have a server rack or two running for testing, stress testing ext so I pretty sure they get a good profit.

Put your eyes on the middle part for a bit and you won't be tricked anymore it's a gradient on both sides in the middle. if you see it you can't unsee it.

Not the best the yellow line could be better and the red line is a bit to positive just tune it down a bit

This is a slim amount of miners and maybe big facilities that have to pay a lot in electrical bills but for most I think miners pay the electric bill with there own pocket money to keep the BTC.

Yeah but if your investing for profit this is a pretty dumb way to view it imo. If your holding BTC to use it then that's the right way to view it.

Well depends on what prices your going from if you put in 100$ and it went down 90% you would have 10% left off that money. But yes you always have 100% to loose if your counting directly from your accounts amount.

It's like saying you can't pay for guns and drugs using cash. Also cash isn't easy to trace either.
When you buy drugs using BTC or other it's often shipped from an address to another isn't that easier to trace then cash dealing person to person?
/ Just my opinion you should not see BTC or crypto as a higher risk off increased in procent off crime then other currency

I actually like the idea off this crypto currency mining instead off ads I did this a long time ago with BTC. 
If you target gamers or computer nerds you will definitely get more revenue as well. And it's better then spamming ads.
But it will mostly work for websites with users that stay for a while and it would be bad to open multiple pages with mining.
