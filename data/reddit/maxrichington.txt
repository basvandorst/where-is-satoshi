I think the point he's making is that domestic violence isn't a gender specific issue. By calling domestic violence a "women's issue", it perpetuates the idea that men are abusers and women are victims.
In the case of prostate cancer, women don't have a prostate so they can't get prostate cancer. The comparison is unfair.
Speaking of cancer, the popular perception of women as victims extends into cancer research and funding. More men get prostate cancer than women get breast cancer. Yet funding is more than double for breast cancer and for every prostate cancer drug on the market there are 7 for breast cancer.

I was using post-modern pluralism and cultural relativism as a way to encourage it. The idea is that with a post-modern pluralistic perspective, we have to look at other cultures and accept barbaric acts because "that's their truth". "Oh, you guys cut off women's clits. That's cool. Who am I to judge. It's all relative, after all".
I was taking that relativistic perspective and using that to justify Mark committing suicide. Basically, using relativism, which purports to be a perspective based in sensitivity to do the most insensitive and barbaric act myself, encourage a person to off himself. The overall statement of my joke, then, is the contradiction in the post-modern view.
TL;DR That was the joke.

We will never be able to solve international problems with systems that were built to serve nations. The world financial crisis is a symptom of the failure of our outdated system, and a warning that something needs to change. We need an international financial network. Bitcoin is that network.
Just like the internet was a ramshackle piece of shit when it first came out, Bitcoin isn't perfect either. But in a decade, and with some brilliant ideas and lot of hard work Bitcoin will be shaped into a user friendly system that will function as we need it to. Why? Because our need for an international financial network is way too great to wait till something perfect comes along. We'll make it work.

If you plan to buy more BTC, get a cheap laptop and a cheap printer. Never connect the laptop to the internet, and print off a wallet using Bitaddress.org saved from a USB onto the new laptop. Then send your coins to that paper wallet address and put the wallet in a safe or safety deposit box. All this will cost you a little over $200, at the most, and it will mean you won't lose your next million to goxxing. Sorry for your lose. I hope it never happens to you again.

I was on the fence, and now I'm leaning toward Satoshi being Satoshi. He released Bitcoin, not expecting it to grow in popularity, but also desiring the accolades. The internal conflict of wanting to be famous, but also being scared of the Government caused him to make mistakes. He used his real name, then wanted to retract, but it was too late. This is all the behavior of a conflicted individual.
He's an eccentric genius. It takes a person who thinks differently to come up with different ideas. However, his greatest strength, thinking differently is his greatest weakness, resulting in paranoid delusions and compulsive lying.
People aren't simple and always rational. They have a variety of desires and motivations, most of which are conflicting. Dorian Satoshi is no different. He says one thing and does another. Believes one thing and acts in conflict with his beliefs. He's an imperfect human, with imperfect motivations and actions.

C'mon. The report is quite balanced, actually. They recognize the underlying technology, but are cautious about supporting the current volatility. That's a fair concern.
Will volatility go down to levels that can support Bitcoin as a viable replacement currency? Maybe. Probably. But, we're not sure about that. Bitcoin is an experiment, and there is no telling what effect it will have as it spreads.
Exuberance and blind positivity isn't healthy. Every technology has positives and negatives. We can't ignore that. Bitcoin, like every new tool will solve some problems and create some new ones as well. Let's keep rational about it.

Young people resist anything that old people like. What kid wants to go on Facebook when Mom is on it? Dogecoin is the Snapchat of digital currency. The fact that old people don't understand Dogecoin, only makes it more appealing to young people.

That moment will be when an app is created that will let grandma use Bitcoin, and it will be very hard to make a mistake where she loses BTC using said app.
My guess is that the app that causes the shift will be something that interfaces with websites and platforms. So, if I load facebook, my BTC balance will be accessible at any time through simple commands like "send 1BTC to John Doe". It updates an app on my phone with an authentication msg, I sign that msg, and the BTC is sent to John Doe.
Another use case would be purchasing on my phone. I want to purchase something on a site, I click buy, my app gets an authentication msg as a heads up, i open the app, sign the msg, click include shipping info and the BTC is sent and an email is simultaneously sent that includes my BTC send address and my physical address. Boom. 3 days later I get my item.

I agree. I've made mistakes with email a lot before, because there's no consequences. So far I haven't made a single mistake with Bitcoin, but that's only because I double check every single transaction, and I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I've done something wrong. The consequences are frightening. We need to be at a place where that fear almost entirely disappears, so you can act lazy while making transactions and not worry about losing money.

If anyone is going to buy and forget about it, they need to spend a night learning about paper wallets. It's not that hard to understand. If someone else has the keys to your coins, you can pretty much expect they will take them.

When you tap buy bitcoins, you will get the option to scan an address or create a new paper wallet. I assume you chose that option.
Also, it can take some time. I've had BTC show up in 20 minutes, and also waited overnight. It's more than likely fine. Just wait. If it's not there after 24h, contact Bitcoiniacs with the ph number on the printout. Their customer service is top notch.

Yes, right now Mtgox is like a walled garden. No fiat can get in or out, and no Bitcoin can get in or out. However, within that Gox-garden, people can trade Bitcoin for fiat. They are trading into fiat with the expectation that if Gox dies, it will be easier to sue. Fiat is acurrency and Bitcoin is not, after all. Others are trading into Bitcoin on the off chance that Mtgox reopens and they will have bought really really cheap Bitcoins.

Wrong question. Bitcoin isn't easier than fiat in some ways, and it is in others. That doesn't matter, because in time it will be easier in every single way.
The questions that really matter right now are centered on the future. What is it about this technology that sparked the massive investment that is pouring into the space? Why are investors so excited about Bitcoin? What potential do they see, and what are they expecting Bitcoin will grow into?
Bitcoin has a long way to go in terms of usability. However, the potential of the system, once the usability problems are solved, is massive. It has the potential to significantly improve our world in ways people can't even imagine. It's a new paradigm for value exchange.

It's like being in an abusive relationship. The abuser acts like a psychopath, and the abused assumes the psychopathic behavior is an anomaly and things will go back to normal soon. The abused wants to give the abuser the benefit of the doubt and doesn't give up on the abuser. Every now and then the abuser does something that seems kind of not psychopathic, so the abused continues hoping.
Then one day, hopefully, the abused says "No more", and gives up hope and leaves. It's time to leave, folks. Stop making excuses for him and assuming the insanity and abuse is going to somehow disappear soon. He acts like a psychopath because he is one.

Mtgox should have made a lot of money. They were the most popular exchange for some time. However, behind the scenes any number of things could have happened to cause their insolvency. It's highly unlikely that Mtgox had Bitcoin in Silk Road. What's more likely is that they lost private keys, they were hacked or they spent the money. We may not know what's going on inside Mtgox for some time and at this point no one knows whether they are or aren't solvent. One thing is for certain, though. Never trust someone who drinks an iced coffee in the winter.

The genius of Satoshi is that he's competent in so many areas. He knows design, unlike most of the creators of other coins who've created dogshit symbols for their coins.
It doesn't matter what symbol is in Unicode now or not. What matters is what symbol looks better, is more iconic and stands on it's own. Ƀ is an asymmetrical design. It feels like a design compromise. The fact that the Thai Baht uses ฿ is not a bad thing. It means it has stood the test of time in the same way that $ has.
100 years from now it won't matter about Unicode. It won't matter about anything but what symbol looks better and reads well. Ƀ looks ugly. ฿ looks timeless and iconic. Satoshi is a genius. He chose the symbol for a reason.

If Mtgox is dealing with the transaction malleability issue, then there's a good chance they will resume business after they fix it. However, it is also a possibility that Mtgox is using the transaction malleability issue as a diversion. They might have problems with solvency, that is they might have lost user's money and can't pay it back. If that's the case, they will go out of business, unless they can re-coup the money they lost. That's another assumption that some people are making. Maybe Mtgox lost user's money and are driving the price of Bitcoins on their own exchange down in order to buy their coins and sell them on other exchanges where the price is higher. This is called arbitrage, and they might be using that as a way to try and solve their insolvency problem, if in fact that is a problem that they have. Notice, that none of this is for sure. We don't know, and we don't know because they have bad public relations. They aren't being clear about what is actually going on.

Alex's webpage doesn't really explain Coinvalidation at all, but it sounds like it's a solution for wallet providers to easily know who's using their service (KYC). It sounds like the coins themselves aren't tracked, just the wallets.
So, if wallet tracking is what this is, then who tracks all this KYC data? Alex's company? How is that data handled? That information is really the crux of this whole thing. If Alex is in bed with the NSA, then Bitcoin becomes a nightmarish tool of the state.
As long as KYC policies are all handled on a business by business basis, there is less chance the NSA will be able to keep track of all the information. However, if it's all in one place, it'll be easy. This is what concerns me.
Update your website, Alex. It really doesn't explain this well enough to put any of us at ease. It's all a kind of, "Coinvalidation is great. Trust me". Well, I don't trust you. I shouldn't have to, and no-one else should either. This is highly risky territory you're entering, so more transparency would be ideal.

1. Localbitcoins.com is a great way to get coins if you live in a place without an ATM. Meet in person, at Starbucks or something. Grab a desert coffee and exchange some BTC. Good times.
2. Get a blockchain.info account. Learn the difference between web storage and offline "watch only" storage.
3. Turn on 2FA (2 factor authentication) on every single account that you can. With 2FA on, someone would need to steal your password and your phone to get your coins.
4. Learn about paper wallets. It's a good way to store coins offline. Keep the majority of your coins in cold storage, but don't lose your private keys or your coins will be "temporarily unavailable", aka gone forever.
5. Watch all the videos by James D'Angelo in his Bitcoin Blackboard series.
6. Don't day trade BTC for fiat. A lot of people learn this the hard way. It's incredibly hard to profit from it. If you want to grow your BTC holdings, trading alt coins for BTC is a much safer bet. By safer, I mean you'll probably lose money for months, then slowly learn how to make money.

Bitcoin is a new technology with unknown uses and no-one knows for sure what the units in the ledger are worth. Not only has the value not been established, the range of value hasn't been established. A Bitcoin unit could be worth 1 cent or 1 billion dollars. No one knows. Volatility will continue until the major uses for Bitcoin are established, and the fate of the units of the ledger as valuable assets is decided.

For most people, Bitcoin doesn't seem special. The question is, why? Unfortunately, the answer is not easy to understand. I like this "Bitcoin: International Currency" tagline, because it is a simple and easy to understand way in. Then they'll be open to the more complex answer.
Overwhelming the new users is the main problem. If a person asks a question and you start using words and concepts they don't currently know, it's highly likely they will just ignore it. They'll think, "My life works fine now. This new thing doesn't fit. I don't need it". But, "International Currency" sounds like something people can use. It sounds connected to the physical world. It sounds like the next logical step. It fits into people's current model of the world.

Right. Sorry, I should have expressed that better.

I see where he's coming from. Bitcoin is a transaction system and when there are thousands of alt coins and the system has reached it's potential, there will be no intrinsic value in the units of account. The "high" value at present day is entirely speculative. This is accurate, as far as I can see.
However, we will still need to agree on some kind of value when Bitcoin is widespread. Bitcoin must equal something in order to exchange it for goods and services. It can't be valueless, otherwise it will be useless. I could exchange 2 Bitcoins for 1 and they would both be equal. That would be absurd. Therefore, Bitcoin must have some value. What that value ultimately ends up being is anyone's guess, though.
Since we are valuing currencies in goods and services, the relative value of the coin doesn't matter. 1 Bitcoin could be worth 5 million ipads or it could be worth .01 ipads. In the end you just have to get your hands on enough Bitcoin to buy the ipad, or dogecoin, or max coin or whatever.
So, does Bitcoin ultimately go up in value or down? My guess is short term it goes up a hell of a lot as Bitcoin spreads over the next decade. Then when the system is stable I think the value will stabalize. I see no reason why it would fall in value. Can anyone argue why it would fall? It seems like Buffet thinks it will, although he doesn't give a reason why. Any guesses?
Oh one more thing, the reason I think Bitcoin won't fall in value after reaching it's potential is that speculative assets can hold value. Gold is an example. It's just a gaudy, heavy element. I wouldn't want Gold if it wasn't worth something. The only reason I'd hold gold is because I think it will hold or appreciate in value. It's almost entirely speculative.

When I got into Bitcoin back in May, I assumed that mining was a waste of time with my PC. I understood it from a theoretical perspective, but never got the chance to actually do it.
However, when Doge was introduced, I saw it as my shot at making some money from mining. I downloaded the Dogecoin QT, joined a pool and started "digging". After a day of mining I had 30k Doge, but more importantly I finally developed a thorough knowledge of mining.
I think a lot of people will use Doge as an intro coin, learning the ins and outs of digital currency. At this stage of the game we need that. Anything that can help make it easier to get into Bitcoin is a huge positive.

1 BTC = $50,000 - After 3 - 5 months with very little movement, the price starts rising slowly as new investors start buying in. Because of the mass exposure that Bitcoin now has, the rising price causes a flood of new speculation.
By late summer, Bitcoin hits $10,000. Mania sweeps the world, and at this point very few people don't know what Bitcoin is. When the price of a Bitcoin hits $50,000 in early September, the sentiment shifts. A combination of mass hysteria and a country banning Bitcoin causes fear to take over. The correction is biggest in BTC history.
However, in the wake of the 2014 crash, things go a bit differently than before. There is no more talk about BTC as a ponzi scheme or a fad. Speculation may have attracted people to the game, but the potential of the network is keeping them.
Western Union is facing bankruptcy. Millions of businesses accept payment for products and services in BTC. The idea of "not cashing out" is being taken seriously by a lot of people. Most significantly, the countries that were the first to ban Bitcoin are backtracking as they feel the effects of capital flight.
Just as the Internet democratized information 2 decades ago, the Bitnet is now democratizing financial services. Banks fight to remain relevant, but by the end of 2014, for a lot of people the writing is on the wall. JP Morgan looks an awful lot like Blockbuster Video in 2005.
By the end of 2014, with the exponential growth of adoption as well as the incredible innovation of new technologies using the Blockchain, finally the promise of an "Internet of things" is possible. The emerging idea of a "monetization of ideas" is starting to spread. People can start being rewarded for big and small contributions of any kind, and in any domain. The promise of bringing power to the people seems much less idealistic in 2014, and we have the Bitcoin Network and Satoshi Nakamoto to thank for that.

You're right that people are afraid of the unknown, and that fear is fueling the misinformation about Bitcoin. What can we do about it?
The best way to sell something new is to talk about the benefits. Focus on the value. What is it actually going to give people that they want and need? If you can find a creative, concise and engaging way to describe the value of Bitcoin, you can fight the misinformation.
There is no media department for Bitcoin, because Bitcoin isn't a company. You and I are that media department. It's up to us to set the record straight and inform people about the massive value of this amazing technology. Start with value, and one by one we can convince people to give Bitcoin a chance. It's not like it's going to be a hard job, by the way. Once someone gets in, it becomes glaringly obvious how awesome this technology is.

A lot of people aren't willing to learn how to navigate a complex new system with an unknown and risky future...unless you put a dog on it.

Yeah, I didn't think that one through. Fair enough.

If the currency is the first app for the network, isn't it weird that we call the network after the app. It'd be like calling the iPhone the AngrybirdsPhone.

Cool. I thought of it last night. By having a separate name for the network and the currency we can eliminate some confusion.
