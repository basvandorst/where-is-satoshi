You will end up never making money if you are impatient, 2 years is nothing, do you really believe in another 5 years we won't be 100x from where we are now?  The biggest mistake I ever made was not in Bitcoin but in Apple, I sold apple in 2000ish after a poor quarter and a loss of 20%, what an idiot.

bitcoin will hit a million but not for a decade or more

Who would have thought that leaving my coins in mt gox would be such a fantastic investment! Value deposited into MtGox $100, value received from Mt Gox $140, that is like an 9% return a year! Woot!!

if tether collapses it will be an extreme positive for bitcoin in my view. tethers are essentially a dollar iou that would no longer get you a dollar, so you would trade them all into bitcoin until USDT is worthless. 
This trend will pump btc and remove the float crypto owners put in fiat.

Every 4 years these types of posts go down by a factor of 10, in 4 years it will be 1,486 bitcoin were moved! In 8 years it will be 148.6 bitcoin were moved! In 12 years it will be 14.8 bitcoin were moved! in 16 years 1.4 bitcoin were moved!
Bottom line is you better keep and hold at least 1.4 bitcoin for 16 years and you can own an island!

He made his mark being a Bull through entire 2016 17 run. He wants true capitulation and apathy before full recovery and it is based really on ugly old goats hyper wave. Nobody should care, everyone gets the privilege of guessing.

Capiche??? Try this on for logic, did BTC successfully add Segwit???? Change is completely possible with 100% adoption, has happened literally 100s of times and will happen 1000 more, Capiche???

same way we came up with weighted blocks... just do it

Declaring that we must raise the block size now is equally as stupid as saying that we should never raise the block size. 
The block size should go up, in regular, planned intervals. What that size and interval is doesn't matter as much as being methodical and transparent. 
This idea that Bitcoin should never raise the block size is as fantastical an example of magic thinking as Craig Wright insisting he is satoshi.

I love this concept. There are a few other indicators that you can include in your analysis that I think are leading indicators. 
1) number of items on Craigslist NYC that include the word bitcoin, currently only 73 listings. Include smaller markets as well. "Bitcoin miner" only has 4. 
2) 60 day % increase in local bitcoin volume in 5-10 various countries. This is a must have.
3) number of "blockchain" jobs posted on Monster, indeed, and a few other sites
