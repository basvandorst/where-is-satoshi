If any of you have any questions, we're here to answer!
Right now there are 500 BTC available in USA!
(canada seller moved to US bank branch! Now 500 BTC available for purchase at BMO Harris USA!)
Buyer demand is high in US but we need more US sellers!
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:09:13
Instant, no registration required. Not to say there is any problem with localbitcoins.com, they are also a fine service!
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:12:37
Listing your coins for sale at BuyBitcoin.US is the quickest way to convert btc to fiat, and still receive the Mt. Gox rate.
You get paid via cash deposit from buyers who have access to a local branch of your bank.
Its like localbitcoins meets bitinstant! Give us a try
@_date: 2013-08-03 09:21:11
Money order with them seems to be the truly easiest way. You have to wait for dwolla the first time 30 days to use your money after deposit.
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:04:37
FinCEN could at least try to seem like a government organization looking out for the greater good of the people. But theyre more or less blatantly telling us FinCEN is owned and run by the banks and they make the rules. Corruption at its finest. 
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:40:55
Just walk in at any place with cash. No account needed.
Give us a shot if you are looking to buy via cash deposit at Gox rates +1%. Buybitcoin.us :)

@_date: 2013-09-14 20:16:23
Our service at  allows you to instantly buy BTC anonymously from various sellers using cash deposit at a local bank. We currently have sell orders from JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America.
No limits, no registration, cold hard cash. :) Give us a look!
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:01:19
Wow, thought this wasnt predicted to hit until October.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:52:05
You can pay under Gox prices via cash deposit (any Chase, Bank of America or Wells Fargo) at  instantly!
It's kind of the opposite of what you said. Instead, we hold the BTC in escrow. You deposit the cash* directly to the seller's bank account, then send the receipt to us. We confirm the receipt and verify with the seller for larger deposits, then send you the BTC the seller already put in escrow for their sell order.
@_date: 2013-07-29 09:50:00
Nope, just email us if your bank is not listed and we'll list it for you!
We are open to sellers around the world. We are actually getting a malaysian seller on there soon.
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:37:45
Look at your post hsitory buddy:
Buy bitcoin at any major bank like Wells Fargo, BofA, Chase with a cash deposit.
Bitcoin in your wallet within a few hours.
Here is an 8000 thread discussing the service:
Literally the only thing you've been saying.
ACH is not accepted. Quit spreading FUD.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:45:52
BuyBitcoin.US allows you to buy (and sell) BTC instantly via cash deposit. No need to wait for Coinbase.
Although Coinbase's rates are likely to be slightly lower. Our rates float around Gox typically, but are up to our sellers. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 20:21:46
Love to hear this! :D
@_date: 2013-08-10 00:35:46
We had a customer of ours get their BTC stolen from easycoin.net.
Avoid at all costs.
@_date: 2013-07-28 12:35:33
Thanks erik, we appreciate your feedback!
@_date: 2013-08-12 12:37:01
Jesus christ, do you people read anything?
ACH TRANSFERS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
SEPA IS NOT ACH. SEPA IS NOT REVERSIBLE.
CASH DEPOSIT, SEPA ONLY.
@_date: 2013-07-28 12:35:00
Very nice idea! 
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:43:55
Thanks Kindways!
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:57:53
Sellers sell at any price they want. They can modify the price of their sell order at any time using a modification PIN. 
Im not sure what you mean by us purchasing bitcoin though. We only connect buyers and sellers, its like localbitcoins meets bitinstant!
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:58:40
Any more details? Transactions do take time to confirm, so depending on what source you're looking at, a transaction may not show up until after a few confirmations. Blockchain.info will always have current up to date info on your transaction though and is closest to its true representation on the network.
Coinbase is instant and automated. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 20:18:39
Try 
Cash deposit at many various banks :)
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:07:08
Fur sure.
Sell on 
Sell around $140, then use the $$ to buy the coins back on Coinbase for $125 and keep flipping it 12% profit each time :)
With Coinbases limits you can only do 10 BTC of arbitrage a day though so $112 profit/day :(
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:55:23
Exactly how unrealistic is it? Or maybe a better question is, whats the best way to apply the data?
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:38:15
If you can somehow advertise your sell order somewhere (forum, website) you can mark up your BTC as high as $148. Otherwise, just having the lowest sell price will get your order filled quickest.
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:45:59
We are adding options and/or required maximum transaction amounts and are also consulting a lawyer. 
We plan to stay within the bounds of the law and remain a longterm player in the market.
We will also enable money orders soon. Thanks for the feedback everyone. We really try to engage and take up ideas from the community.
@_date: 2013-09-16 14:32:17
We're here to make it easy!
Buy Bitcoin instantly from any JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo or Bank of America!
@_date: 2013-07-28 12:38:47
If I am reading correctly, they have only 1 branch?
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:10:15
The harder government agencies attempt to regulate the BTC, the more visible their fear of it becomes of it, and the more valuable the currency becomes.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:33:56
The volume on BitQuick.co is around 50 BTC per day right now. You could likely flip 5-10 BTC a day if you used Bank of America, Chase or Wells Fargo to sell.
@_date: 2013-09-17 00:38:33
BuyBitcoin.US became BitQuick.co about a month ago so I officially represent BitQuick :)
Official Reddit account here. I suppose we should probably start posting from our username BitQuickco, eh?
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:34:57
If you must use Dwolla, try CoinMKT.com, a new exchange.
Our service,  allows you to buy bitcoin instantly via cash deposit at 1000's of banks across the US
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:35:27
We have people using our website to essentially withdraw their BTC from Mt. Gox and receive cash bank deposit for their BTC at the Mt. Gox rate and above.
Withdrawals are finally showing up from Mt. Gox ( and have been indicated to take up to 3 MONTHS

From fellow Bitcoin startup to another, I wish you the best of luck but this is a seriously dangerous business venture. Dealing with reversible funds is dangerous.
Check out this list of hardness of transaction reversal:

I'm a sellout because I use FIAT to buy Bitcoin..?
@_date: 2013-09-15 11:35:18
Our service at  enables you to buy bitcoin for cash deposit from 1000's of banks!
@_date: 2013-09-14 20:19:13
Were you at a branch of your own bank, or the other bank you were trying to deposit into?
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:45:17
Thats why you sell your btc for cash at buybitcoin.us ;)
Then you can sell at gox price without waiting for gox withdrawals.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:35:57
We currently have a seller that has an order for about 4-5 BTC and he just refills that daily. He likes to play it safe, and it could be a great option for you.
@_date: 2013-07-28 12:30:41
They are legitimate (bitcoin-brokers). Cant say about the other one.
Also consider checking us out. Essentially the same service, but easier, and quicker.
@_date: 2013-08-10 01:32:08
We do. Check us out at  or buybitcoin.us (we are rebranding)

1. Select an order from the current order book, enter your email and Bitcoin address and submit.

3. Email the receipt to orders
Your Bitcoin are typically sent within an hour of your receipt being received.
Please post with any questions!
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:10:46
Why does anonymity matter? Why would you advise someone stay away for that reason only? Might as well tell them to stay away from LocalBitcoins.com, Mt. Gox, BTC-e, BitStamp, Coinbase, CampBX, etc.
@_date: 2013-08-27 09:10:15
We already are.
Here is an order for 5 BTC for sale via SEPA transfer for only 85 EUR/BTC 
@_date: 2013-09-15 11:53:31
How did you miss the part where our website doesn't allow bank transfers?
 Bank transfer is not cash deposit.
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:42:23
Much appreciated silverwater.
@_date: 2013-09-14 11:33:15
Thanks for recommending us :)
I was about to suggest our service to the OP.
Our service is simple, anonymous and instant and I believe it is just the thing youre looking for! You can buy bitcoins from all over the united states! If you are near a Bank of America, Chase or Wells Fargo you can buy bitcoin now.
BuyBitcoin.US became BitQuick.co by the way.
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:49:52
Just go to 
Buy and sell Bitcoins anonymously via cash deposit. It's free to sell.
@_date: 2013-07-25 10:05:05
It's for simplicity. If you want to do a cash deposit, other people have to have your bank account and routing number. Anyone can see these numbers on personal checks you hand out. Also, during those FIAT banking hours, you essentially have the FASTEST method of obtaining BTC on the market right now starting from cash in your wallet, to BTC in your e-wallet.
The forum thread(s) has(have) now been launched as well: 
LocalBitcoins isn't as simple. Requires user login, time, etc.
There are trusted community members that know the administrator of the website that can and have personally vouched for our legitimacy.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:27:02
There's around 10 sellers. That 50 BTC/day number is increasing pretty quickly so we'll just have to see how things play out. We are continually investing and upgrading :)
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:39:24
And because Goxs market share isnt 80% anymore. Coinbase price is inbetween bitstamp and mtgox typically leaning towards mtgox.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:31:04
Sell your BTC on BuyBitcoin.US at above Mt. Gox rate for bank deposit, then buy at the CampBX rate!
