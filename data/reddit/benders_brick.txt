Hang on a second. Which drugs are you talking about?
I see you've already had at least 5 people vote "Yay drugs!" but surely you think some drugs are not healthy?
@_date: 2012-05-10 09:27:43
I don't understand, sorry
@_date: 2012-05-10 09:50:27
okay thanks. I understand, but after seeing the effects of Heroin and Meth on many a close individual, you can decriminalise all drugs except for those  two in my opinion.
Edit: nah, what am I saying. I'm baked and can't explain myself properly in few words right now :)
I agree with what you're saying, ignore what I said above. I was thinking of the dealers not the users

Dude, you didn't have to do that but I'm blown away at your generosity. Thanks man, you've made me feel better about myself in a week where I've felt like an asshole.
No shit dude, this week has been hell mentally for me, and the downvotes on my repsonses reflect that. 
Thanks man

If you'd look further back than the last 10 years, the answer would be foreign and local currencies.
Those pesky criminals have been around a little longer the LR and WM. :)

If anyone needs me I'll be on wikipedia trying to find out what these pesky criminals were using before bitcoin.

More people would use heroin if it were legal. Just because a few people here and Ron Paul say they wouldn't, you're not accounting for the fact that the world has alot of moronic idiots who would.

Very amateur attempt by the AFP and Customs. There is no evidence in any way that the AFP successfully infiltrated  a "secure" section of the Tor network and therefore are only using broad information to try to scare the public.
They also fail to mention that The Farmer's Market was around before Tor and they also used unsafe practices while distributing their products.
.....but you can't mention that in the news can you? That wouldn't scare people enough.
Still waiting for the global authorities to actually do what they say they think they can do, I'm really over the empty threats and scare tactics.

I agree, I had a similar short rant ready to go.
@_date: 2012-05-10 09:54:04
yeah, I was thinking about dealing not using, see my other replies

I only just discovered this function, it's pretty cool. Nice work to whoever coded and implemented it.
Question: When it's out of Beta will it be a link at the bottom of each person's post like the "give gold" and other links are?
@_date: 2012-12-09 04:11:15
It's appreciated, don't you think otherwise!

Dilbert readers would be mostly connected with the tech industry, if not directly involved so if that's what OP means then I am inclined to reference him as being one that likes to lie with the more homosexual leaning members of society.

I'm not talking about a quick buck, some of these were months at a time.
Last time I cashed in it moved up from six to where it is today

So it seems that the original person who thinks they've 'exposed a scam' can't even check the local prison records to find out the truth.
What a fucking douche, my advice is to stay off the drugs. It will hopefully prevent them from making up more fanciful longwinded baseless stories that are easily proven wrong.
Christ, it took less than 2 minutes to find that information. WTF!?!

Sorry, I got up to this part and had to stop...


...then you said this...


Okay listen, I was drunk when I wrote that so excuse the aggressiveness but I was replying to the fact that your post seemed to indicate that the timing belt is old and nearly needs changing again because it's been 22,000kms since it was last changed. 
@_date: 2013-01-12 00:40:58
It makes me want to invest again but every time I have in the past, the price has dropped and stayed there for weeks/months before I eventually pulled out and watched it rise again. Grrr
@_date: 2013-01-20 07:16:07
You assume....that's the problem.
Out of all the parts in the engine bay that get replaced in a typical service, the timing belt/chain is one of the last things you change because it lasts the longest.
So either, I'm wrong in my interpretation of your post.... or you are trying to discuss a topic you obviously don't know anything about.
I freakin' hate it when people try to debate a subject they dont know about
