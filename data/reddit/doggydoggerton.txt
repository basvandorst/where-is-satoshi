censorship resistant? I don't understand if people can decide to split it, then people can decide censorship. I think the split deviates from the core components, and if one can be altered, more could as well. Maybe since its still in its early adoption stage all these benefits could easily be adjusted by advances in technology. If you think about what our tech could be in thirty years its easy to see how a plus can become a minus.

Governments and banks may not be able to control bitcoin, but they could certainly limit access, add regulation for exchanges, add as much hurdles and barriers to entry they'd like. The best part of bitcoin from a states perspective is probably the cashless aspect. A government can monitor how people acquire bitcoins, track transactions through a few different ways. They may not have "proof" of who moved what where but a simple court ruling or piece of legislation could change all of that.

I don't get how a central authority can't manipulate it? Didn't some people come up with the idea to split them?

well what is your personal favorite?

If it happens once, it just proves it can happen. Even if you can't split it, you can fraction off bitcoins an infinite amount of times.

Even if everyone decides on never splitting it that still doesn't cancel out the ability to inflate it. What actually prevents it being limited in its division, and how would it stay that way. the more adoption from people would increase the value per coin, so the minimum transaction would deter use unless there is a ceiling on a value of bitcoin.

I get that you don't have to print it compared to a more tangible form of currency. But aside from having no "cash" type options. But if bitcoin can "split", then there isn't finite amount of them.

tool for political change? If you mean breaking away from banks, how would the large scale miners (most likely financed by banks) change anything. I really don't understand the security aspect either, unless you have them offline. But since all bitcoins are accounted for its easy to track.

But all of this were it lies now. Like for example divisibility? What stops bitcoin from becoming more and more divisible? What if someone advances tech enough to allow for more decimal points. If bitcoin does split, what body decided on it. Today it sounds like a good option, but so many things either within bitcoin itself, or the things that allow people to access/utilize bitcoin.
