Dude we had Wil Smith, blade, rap music, etc etc 20 fucking years ago. The equality had already arrived. We were getting along the best of all us history. But the left like feminists couldn't except that they did it and had to keep pushing for more and more. They don't want equality they want power over white people which is why it's OK to be racist to a white person but no to a colored person. The left are racists.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:53:12

The comments in here are why people call this sub the r/politics of crypto. And yes I know by saying that I will be banned even though I've been a bitcoin holder since 2013. Thought crimes are forbidden here. Trump is the best president since JFK. The media is our enemy, the deep state is our enemy, the military industrial complex is our enemy, the globalist corporations are our enemy.

The right think everyone should be treated equally. The left think different races and different sexes should be treated at different levels of Equality. It's the entire reason we are in the mess we we are. Identity politics is why the left have gone mad and the right and center have peaced out.
Why does black lives matter not talk about black on black crime? Black people need to stop killing each other.

Black people have more rights in America than white people right now. They get affirmative action jobs, they can be racist and sexist, they can kill each other then cry BLM. There is a reason people are lying and saying they are a minority when filling out college applications. Maybe black people need to stop playing victim and make something of their lives. There are tons of successful black people out there. It's easy to cry racism and not try to change your life. Funny how Asian immigrants did just fine in the same country with the same adversity as black people. The left are more racist than the right with their racism of low expectations. 
Climate change is another boogieman that will make people pay higher taxes and vote for more government. It's the invisible enemy. Climate always changes and always will. Humans have little impact. They never say much about dumping waste into rivers or fracking because that is something they can actually change so they are hush about it.
Show me where t_d always Obama to be called a monkey. That is a straight up fucking lie and against their rules. Keep bitching and whining tho and enjoy Trump winning a landslide victory in 2020. Also keep posting conspiracy theories in r/politics about Russian colllllllusion.

The past 40 years has been presidents sending our jobs and manufacturing overseas. You think it's going to be a 1 year no pain project to try to get them back? I'm ok with some short term pain for long term gain. And I don't give a flying fuck about locker room talk. You virtue signalers have all said bad shit in private and you are liars if you say you haven't. JFK was a womanizer too imagine what he said behind closed doors. The right were fine during Obama's years. The left turned insane as soon as Trump was elected. Everyone is a racist bigot mysoginist nazi. The left are trying to kill free speech. The left want 1984. The left want open borders and think flooding the country with unskilled labour will someone raise wages. The right are the counter culture and its why they are winning elections all around the world. The left got equality but it wasn't enough. People are sick of the racism and hatred towards white people especially white men. And don't take this as me saying the republicans are good because they are just as shitty as the democrats. The citizens who are right are not all Republican fans just like a shit ton on the left are not Democrat fans.
Also Trump took over basically at the end of a bull run and is sustaining it longer then anyone thought he would. Remember when the left said the markets would crash as soon as he took over. Keep moving the goal posts.
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:54:55
Kill all white people is an allowed phrase on social media. I've lost out on jobs because I am white and a diversity hire is needed to fill the quota. I am called a racist white male constantly in a 70% white country just for existing. The anti white rhetoric is just getting started.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:11:29

No I am blaming Keiser for hyping it up like it was going to rival bitcoin and then bailing on the project like 1 fucking week after. He cashed out and said fuck it. He's a dick. I know I made the choice to hold, but he's still a dick.

@_date: 2018-02-05 20:33:29
We are between denial and panic.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:15:01
Because we haven't reached the bottom.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:15:12
Id say troll too If he didn't have 7 years old account.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:34:48
Perhaps Satoshi was CIA and we are all being played.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:13:03
Plus he says he has excel sheets with the passwords for the wallets!
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:29:39
Look Max you need to relax. I still made 24 grand in one day off your shit coin it's all good.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:51:32

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:49:19
Wouldn't that increase the price?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:55:26
Except it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:17:52
Is take 25% and put it into something that can't to to $0. Take 25% spend on family and yourself. Hold 50%. Personally I'd retire somewhere tropical right now like Costa Rica if I had that many coins lol.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:03:28
He seemed to be really going for it. I bought the hype what can I say. It was different times back then too there were no icos it was all basically clone coins. I lost like 4btc ish.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:46:37
Probably because he burned a ton of people with his shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:02:15
I kept half and sold half. I made 4btc in one night mining maxcoin so that's really not too bad is it? I never paid for any.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:27:52
Fake false flag, USA govt specialty.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:14:46
They don't have 32 million in bitcoin on a hard drive at their home with and excel spreadsheet that has the passwords on it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:35:35
Yup take the high road.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:45:43
Explain the guy that appears as an army dude and then as a father.

@_date: 2018-04-01 07:44:48
Because the elite are pushing marxism on us to destroy society.
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:33:46
The globalists agenda is to push cultural marxism on all of us. The more they can separate us into individual groups the more we will fight and not pay attention to the shit they are doing.

Once it hits 20k it will moon shot to 100k within a few months.
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:47:05
Shit doesn't always happen overnight. Like your bags you are holding sometimes shit takes time.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:17:29

Orange Man Bad!

Oh no only Hitler would have ties to one of the biggest industries on the planet!
Climate science is the farthest thing from hard science out there. First it was global cooling, then it was global warming, now it's climate change. The ocean was supposed to rise and sink cities already. The ice caps were supposed to have melted already. I'm not denying climate change but it's not settled science.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:55:50
It's all conspiracy theory without proof.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:32:38
Has to go fast to hit 250k
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:55:45
Let that sink innnnn. So sick of hearing this phrase. It's always idiots that are talking down to everyone else.
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:47:45
They refuse to listen to anything that might cause them to question their world views.
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:44:25
Yes but nobody in the spotlight was saying it.
Considering the entire world seems to be pushing the devasting act of equality of outcome over equality of opportunity, his voice is super important right now.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:52:34
So are you a fool if you paid $100 for a bitcoin and sold it for $20 000?
