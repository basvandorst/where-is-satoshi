Bitpay will receive those funds and they will have to be tracked down and refunded manually, you will not be out anything. Your tx must not be even reaching the network, bitpay has never waited for a confirmation for me. I have made three BTC buys from steam, all instant (3-15sec).

Its as safe as it was before. Its much more likely that you used a weak password (no offense) then your encoded private keys get guessed. Keep the encoded private keys private and you will be ok.

Based on their reputation of their completely free product so far, and how I have seen them handle bugs and other issues, am totally buying in. They are a teir higher then everyone else when it comes to new ideas. (None of this applies to the iPhone app, which has broke several times, but its programed by a different group I guess) I would not consider this an investment as much as a thank you for making something that works so good. The bonus is that it would come with some stock what? Honestly I would rather just buy bitcoin, we don't really need any other crypoto assets (yet).

Yeah, there is actually. On that *very* same image you linked, to the right it tells you *very* clearly that your instant buy limit is $1,000.  Your first order of $120 would clear that limit threshold very easily. Your second order of $1200 exceeds that limit, by $200 if my math is correct.

From a quick annalysis of time line I see on 12/3 the possibility of two orderes being placed, one online and one with the phone rep. What kind of difficulties were you having with the online order form? The phone employee is paid on commission so he will lie to get you to buy from him so he can get his commission, regardless of any additional expense to you or his company. He is willing to charge you twice and let his company send out a charge and a phone that will never be used so he can make another $5. 'Murrica.

And also one of the reasons why I don't use that system. A long time ago I had a $150 gift card that over two year was ate up by random fees. I made a fuss and they gave it all back to me. Shortly after laws passed that prevented expiration of gift card dollars or monthly fees, or something to that effect.  I won't shop at those palaces unless I am desperate for their warez or they upgrade. Retailers don't have to do away with the legacy system, they can offer two methods of gift cards at once. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:27:54
it would be cool if the phones camera could just scan the front of the card and the code on the back. That square is useful but I forget it alot, accessories suck. Phones of the future might have card readers built in.

They are on reddit. The good thing is you have a TX ID number, right? You can give that to them to lookup to prove you made the payment. When they find it they will fix it, they are good about that.
Do me a favor and relook to make sure that your payment was not 'canceled', by that I mean your tx was on a split chain that died and is no longer in the blockchain history. That has happened to me. Sent BTC to fold, two hours later, boom, tx disappeared.

It depends who manages the gift cards for each store. If cards are only issued digitally (not physically made) then the process would be as easy as changing a centralized internal ledger.

$10 to get a card, payable only in BTC. No annual fee, No conversion fee from Shift or Coinbase (but Coinbase *may* implement one in the future) Default daily limit is $1,000, but it is adjustable, I have not tried adjusting the limit up, just down. If you have bitcoin in Coinbase already you can move it instantly into your Shift account (no waiting for confirmations or paying TX fees, all on Coinbase's private ledger). If you deposit btc to your shift card I am sure it makes you wait for a few confirmations. 
This card is a real VISA. Raised numbers, magnetic strip, The VISA symbol, the hologram on the back, and three banks have put their stamp on it. Use it anywhere VISA is accepted. Bitcoin can now be used to buy groceries, gas, and food. With this paradigm of Shift, *we can spend bitcoin anywhere.*

Paper is a very corruptible metric, that is why our founding fathers wrote in our Constitution that ONLY Gold and Silver be used as currency, because they were aware that banking fraudsters were printing mass cash. Over time we have decided that carrying, storing, and spending metals is not convent at all. 
*Sure, we can substitute a paper promissory note in for this gold. That will make it easier to carry and store! Later we can erase the promise part.*

The transaction is only complete when there are no more take backsies. Credit Cards therefor take months to complete a single transaction. Bitcoin wins. 
If you consider when the money is spendable, then credit card readers settle with the business they are in once a day, in a single transaction. Bitcoin is spendable in ten minutes. Bitcoin wins.  
Both systems have instant announcement. Tie here.

Do not reverse the second transaction with the phone company. It is fraudulent, and by letting the phone company reverse the charges there will be no repercussions and you will be stuck with the overdraft charge. If you tell your bank it is a completely fraudulent charge and you want to press charges against whomever is charging your account then you will not be responsible for the overdrafting and the bank will take the reversal much much more seriously. ALSO if a rouge employee is doing this, intentionally or on accident, it needs to be brought to the attention of management immediately.

On your phone, goto texting and type the private key in a text chat box, highlight it and copy it. Launch Mycelium, go to settings, scroll down to expert mode and enable it. go back to Mycelium main screen, scroll to the far left screen by swiping right, at the top of the screen click the 'add key' icon, then select from clipboard. boom now you are in control of two private keys. It should show two receiving addresses with key symbols next to them. Now click on your current wallet address (the one you want to keep using after this), swipe left to main Mycelium screen, click on receive, click on copy to clipboard. Move back to the Mycelium main screen. Swipe right, and select the new imported key again, swipe left (to main screen) and click send BTC. You are now trying to send the small amount of BTC you thought you lost. It should be asking you where you want to send it, click paste from clipboard. Your pasting your main wallets address. Then fill out how much you want to send, probably everything. Click send :)  You can then swipe right, reselect your main wallet address, then swipe left back to the main screen and it should show you that its already receiving funds, takes about 15 min for them to be spendable.  I like Mycelium alot.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:42:36

I don't mind sharing, it gives me joy to hope that my story can prevent someone else from getting scammed. I had several ads up, at different financial levels for different types of people. I had a single smaller sale of $10 about a week prior and everything went fine. Then someone contacted me for a three digit purchase. Seemed normal. They said they made the deposit, but I didn't see it online yet . They sent a pic of *the* deposit slip, with the amount, but then on the deposit slip it said available bal = 0. This had me a little weirded out, but he had the right slip, and I wanted to maintain quick release times for legitimate buyers, and I had just left my house and was not going home for a while so I released. Then an hour later I got another ping for a sale, then same thing happened with the same guy. I thought the money from the first will come in, its just a little slow updating. So the same thing happened the second time, mostly because I was on my phone, I hate using it, and I wanted to be an awesome seller, but mostly I am an idiot. I didn't get a dollar, I reported him, and from now on Ill just spend BTC as money because it is money, returning it back to FIAT is just dumb if you believe in the moon. I believe the underlying use of Bitcoins is to better enable tracking of criminal activity, and that will not be apparent for possibly a human generation.

Many people move coins 1 block apart. You have to wait 15 min for each confirmation. You couldn't move them 2 seconds apart. Be accurate or you will be ignored and ridiculed.

Those are all web wallets. If you keep coins on web wallets you probably deserve to loose them. Web wallets are not part of the blockchain, those sites are using internal ledgers to keep track of users BTC. Those are not at all part of the global public ledger network.

Software has so many layers now, I don't think we get the real file size in our OS anymore, there is code we cant see on everything. Same applies to hardware. Someone can design a mobile phone that uses a Texas Instruments chip DRV5236, then NSA can contact TI to redesigned the chip to enable a backdoor with a gag order. The manufacturer of the product will swear with their life that their phone is clean and to their knowledge it is. Software wouldn't ever pick that up.

Im an nicely calling you an idiot. You obviously have not been around much. If 5% is to much for a website to take on a sale, what happens when your friend sells his hotel for 120% more then what he wanted, in all BTC, then the price of BTC drops to under $200 a coin? Then keeps going down? Past $100 a coin? Down to $10 a coin and still dropping? If you are assuming the value of BTC will not fluctuate by 5% you are insane or a newb. BTC will NOT remain at it current value forever. It WILL rise or fall dramatically. To the moon, or we all eat bits. I would suggest sticking with selling for BTC only (I am in no way a financial adviser), and contact a real estate agent and see what kind of % they want, tell them your selling for BTC only. It is important for the future of BTC that your ONLY accept BTC.

The curve that all of BTCs security is based on will be plotted, rendering all wallets not secure. Click on a public key and boom you have a private key. This happens in 20x1. And with such collapse it slingshots the USD to the world trading standard. Be weary of the basket of pretty apples.

I understand you concerns. My grampa is the same way. Fortune favors those that take chances, and change is difficult. From a technically financial aspect, bitcoin is very new and just starting off. Checking back in a few years when bitcoins are 5k-10k might make you more comfortable. But if you get them now, they could be worth that much then.

pumping millions into BTC would make the attack ridiculously more expensive, and if people know the source of the attack their would likely be a retaliation.

You have to understand there exists a situation where as Bitcoin gains traction one person with alot of money values them much higher then everyone else and says 'I don't care give me all of them' then the price rockets, then it has to come back down to everyone elses level. thats what its doing now, when it hits the bottom, and someone with alot of money is secure in its footing, they will do another round buy and the price will rocket again. The questions are how low does it go, when does it get there, how long does it stay there, then how high will it go?

I understand that you have been looking at it as when you buy software you completely own all aspects of it. What about paying to lease software? If you violate the lease, they can turn off your use of said software. When you 'buy' some supercars you have to apply to lease them, and sign a contract saying you wont deface the car or brand. Break the lease, and they take it back.

Dude. They just added that! There was an update to change the fees, then there was another update... and bits was there! But in the 'whats new' on google play they don't mention the new update with bits. I hope that is all that has changed! They still list all the changes from the previous update, as V2.1.0

Paypay was jumping on the backbone of an already existing and functioning financial system that everyone in America used daily. Their software is so basic, the amount of money they make from the amount of code they have written is absurd.

The biggest difference with bitcoin and other assets is uniqueness. Right now the early adopters have Bitcoin faucets running into the exchanges. One day those coins will be dried and depleted, and the faucets will be shut off. By then mining rewards will be miniscule (when measured in today's standards of BTC mining rewards). This is when the value of this asset will be realized.

Its all speculation. Its biased on the fact that they are an established company, their are limits to the types and risks associated with advancing a business, and taking not real money (yet) is a huge leap into a black void. In order to secure the validity of future business (keeping rent paid, electricity, employees, ect) I believe there is no gamble being taken on behalf of the company. Any individual can make that decision with their own finances, but a companies assets are different. I could very easily be wrong, but this makes sense to me.

Signing up for paypal and linking it to your bank account is a complex task that takes several days. Thats alot of time to wait to make your first purchase. I have signed up and do use paypal quite a bit, 8 times in the last two weeks, and it is easy.

We understand that you may not have been expecting this chargeback. If this chargeback has made your PayPal account balance negative, please log in to your PayPal account and add money to your PayPal balance.

What if one day its revealed that the FBI made Bitcoin and they can watch every ip that a transaction originates from (even through tor, which the navy made to watch underground traffic). Then the FBI can turn off/empty wallets at any time. You have to know that Intel could look at bitcoin and make more ASCIs then anyone else in the world and monopolize on mining. They could then make their own rules, like required tax on every single transaction, just like mining fees just bigger. The FBI can watch terrorist wallets by IP, and turn off any wallets that have private keys on a cell phone that travels within a specified geological area, ie if you take you phone to a known terrorist hideout you wallet gets wiped. 
Or if someone that works at Intel in the crypto department that made the SHA256k (that is supposedly not cracked like SHA256h) decides to go public with an [illegal number...](

As the question proposes 'if you could wager 1M', suggesting that amount lost will not affect your day to day life. Why you would want to do it is the same reason your browse this sub,  you are intrested in bitcoin, and belive in the system. You probably have some, but at your social status any buys or sells will never affect market price.
So when the next group buys in with 1M, the market value of btc will increase bryond 1M, because all the daytraders that get carried up with the investor will carry financial momentum.

Out of curiosity, if you don't mind me asking, what are you going to do with the coins?
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:03:37
You can generate an address, move coins to it, then give them the private keys. You can do this talking on the phone or through SMS, I would talk to them to set up some code so if your transmission was intercepted no one could use the key. Like half the private key over the phone voice and the other half over text. This is really the best way, they will not be able to use them right away but will be in possession of the private keys of whatever you send them. The only way this does not work is if they do not trust you, as you are the one making and sending the private keys, you could save a copy ( and should just in case your friend 'loses' his)

Ponzi scheems demand the original group to bail out. Bitcoin keeps people in forever. Even if you got a few coins now, and they shot up to $20,000, would you sell them all, or keep one for the future $1,000,000 mark?

The enemy of my enemy is my friend. How U doin? lolz
If you appreciate constructive criticism you might understand the only way I know how to talk. The kids need more story. Hello, I am Xander, I was born at 10:30am in General Lee's Hospital on a bight sunny day. Right after I was born such and such happened, and that changed the world because so and so. Here are pics of me and props to make it look like me, a baby, is doing real adult things. Here are my friends from my last birthday party. Here are videos of me falling trying to learn how to walk. The single picture up right now is just not enough. 
I just realized you probably have to have totally fake names, and maybe locations, you don't want a creeper tracking these kids for years. But then if the kids are fake, everything's not real, why donate. Maybe a blurb like on dragnet 'the names and places have been changed but the events (or people) were real'.
You could do it like the kids in Africa do it, if you donate x amount a month like 30 cents a day they will send you personalized progress reports. its cool getting stuff, it gives physical validation to sending hard earned money into a virtual abyss. It ensures repeated donations, else people only donate once, get a one time (maybe) feel good feeling, and have no desire to repeat that donation. 
I really hope it all goes to the kids.

it would be cool if changetip used google authenticate, so when you wanted to send a changetip you had to include that time stamps pin.

You have not done your research before you got in. Bitcoin is so early a stable price is impossible. Its probably not the time yet for you, the price is only going to drop, you should probably get out now and sell all your coins before they are only worth $30. You can buy more then anyway.

But then if you are one digit off, you loose everything. Bitcoin public addresses are so specific, if you guess one you might as well be guessing the public address.
you could hash the 'block number +line number' into a color code, that way at a glance if numbers look right AND the color is right, you feel more comfortable. Also seven digits isnt that hard to remember, but if you mess up ONE DIGIT your f*****, no returns.

O man dont use coinbase as a wallet man. they are not a wallet service, you do not have control of your private keys. moving coins internally to coinbase is easy because those transaction never hit the blockchain. so you have no access to a public ledger to verify those transactions (unless you can log into coinbase). Get a wallet where you can control your keys on your smartphone, I use mycelium. 
tldr coinbase is not a wallet, move your coins

Its not security. Its presence. You are a teenage girl, if you want it or not you are going to be noticed by everyone. Be the future, the meetup leader will let you do whatever you want if your confident. Everyone else at these meetups is new to BTC also, no one has played with it for more then five years.

Using intrinsic value to describe  Bitcoin is a bit intentionally trolling. 
Bitcoin is the worlds only asset with a public ledger, instantly verifiable, boarderless, nationless, dust can be transferred securely across the globe, and a fortune that could support a family for generations can be properly secured in a space smaller then a fingernail. No other intrinsically valuable asset can do that, there isn't one that can match what BTC can do.

In different parts of the world different amounts of money are needed to live. Housing costs vary, food costs vary, travel and medical costs vary. Some people have only had 100$ to the family's name for generations and are happy and content.  Other people spend 20$ a meal and call that cheap ass bare minimum.

I am really looking forward to a bitcoin mercenary, cleaning up the world for BTC donations. Know where a terrorist hideout is?

Incorrect conclusion. Miners receive block rewards. These are coins not yet in circulation. There are only 13 million coins in use right now, and 8 million more that will be rewarded in the next 120 years. On top of that miners receive transaction fees, that users voluntary pay to encourage processing of their transaction. Small transactions require fees, large ones do not, so tx fees aren't even required. You erroneously picked 10%, when in reality 0.1% could be to high of a guess.

I disagree, that is like saying people are only disagreeing to create disagreement, and once that condition has been satisfied they no longer disagree. If I understand your thoughts right you think that there is no bandwagon effect for anti-bitcoin people? I think people that do not fully understand Bitcoin hate it, because humans generally hate what we do not understand.

You wanted you account closed. They say they do not delete accounts. They are not responding to your question. Closing an account and deleting it are different.

~~So you are saying every time we create a new HD wallet it is not creating a new seed? ~~ I now see thats what mycelium says. It should make a new seed for each new account. But then restoring will be easier this way I guess. 
And I can see how if you copied an address you would want to look at the first and last few digits, some other program working in the backround might drop a new address in there. there is no real fear of them coping that address, as its a public address anyway.

or sign up for circle or coinbase - i like them better but its more work up front (connecting bank accounts)

Competing with yourself before anyone else can by generating a flag bearer that haters of the USA can latch onto is a smart move. That way the USA controls a much larger portion of the world economics then expected. BTC offers full transparency of all accounts and transactions in real time (virtually). Right now they are just watching, but when social patterns are observed, repeated, and recorded, types of control will emerge. Also consider mining, we have all these small companies making asics, what if (I think they already have) Intel tried to make a miner? Not a retail public one but a supercomputer miner. It would be ridiculous, game over.

**The intrinsic value of BTC is its storage, transportation, transfer, and verification costs.** Gentlemen, this is. Bitcoin has intrinsic value over other assets of store because of the ease of verification, the speed and tangibility of the distance it's ownership can be transferred, the security of transporting it to its intended destination, and the costs associated with storing and securing mass or minute amounts of value. No other asset come into existence on this globe has that is even close to matching Bitcoin's intrinsic value. This is Gentlemen.

Yes it can be adjusted it is just set right now. The world economy could be supported with a single satoshi.
If there is a need for them, additional decimal places can be added with concensus of the network. This is why some refer to "infinite" divisibility, because we can select the level that we need as time goes on.
The current level selected in the code (by Satoshi) is 8 decimal places (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC) hence the nickname for the smallest unit currently possible for bitcoin today.
As a thought exercise, if a consensus of the network (miners, but also clients and server applications for compatibility reasons) decides to update to a version of the protocol that includes 16 decimal places inspired by your post, we could end up with a new base unit (1 satoshi = 100,000,000 gracchi) as well as nanobitcoins (nBTC), picobitcoins (pBTC), and even femtobitcoins (fBTC, 10 gracchi)
I have trouble imagining the need for such a thing, unless destroying bitcoin becomes a prevalent method of use. If it is needed the potential is there and will never dilute your held bitcoins, which actually makes it a problem some would love to see the need to solve.

I think the group that created Bitcoin already had a over a trillion dollars available. They can pour money into their coin that no one else will put into a new coin. At the same time they hold the bulk of the coins. There is to much thought, time, and money in BTC that no one will let it die for another coin. To make another coin more successful, you have to entice people to use it over an already existing BTC. Drawing the smartest people away from BTC and to another coin is going to be a challenge.  Like the internet or email, we can make BTC better right now, but everyone is using the functional first version and its internationally recognized and valued.

It think it will be relieved all bitcoin transactions even balance inquiries with public addresses will be or is being recorded. Then the ip can be attached to a device, like a cell phone, and combined with other phone usage statistics like GPS location.  Users can then be monitored effortlessly, pinpointed, isolated, and possibly one day their device might be "turned off".

You are assuming all currently mined coins are actively participating in the market. The current value of BTC could be based on only 25% of the mined coins, the active ones. BTC still needs more demand before its full potential can be realized. I believe it is vastly undervalued, soon a Satoshi will be worth more then a penny.

Currently BTC is traded mostly for its investment allure. It has not come close to what would be considered an IPO. Its testing price must be manipulated for debugging purposes by the whales if they want to play a larger part in a bigger end game. The system has been built so well from the start, I beleive it is from the US Goverment, hence they have unlimited funds and coin to throw at keeping the price whereever they want. It can't go to the moon overnight without distructivly disrupting the world economy, and there has to be new and dangerous fears the whole craw up.

How do you feel about miners that never part with Bitcoin earned as block rewards, effectively removing them from the active coin pool?

Could you elaborate on why you would not use them for business? Virtual all of my paypal transactions are to people who set up shops at home or have small family owned businesses. Having paypal is also a social requirement on ebay, you can sell without paypal but buyers silently demand it. 
For donations I would have to go Bitcoin all the way. If you have palpal and haters they can donate 1 penny and you pay more to receive that penny. They can donate a dollar and then do a chargeback, then your out more money again. [The list goes on.]( You have to wait forever before those funds are spendable. With Bitcoin you see the donation coming right away, and can use it in ~15 min. Where you can use those  bitcoin is limited, atm.

Use Mycelium or Electrum if you plan on spending them anytime soon, make paper wallets if you want to save long term. Warning, if your paper wallet fades to unreadable, you lose everything on them. Making two of the same one is not a bad idea, just maintain physical security.

100k is allright. How much of his portfolio is that? Coinbase.com has been reliable for me, I hear people using circle.com and liking it too.

It should still be able to view a public address and see if there are unspent inputs and how many, and sum them up. Further more it should be able to scan a public address just to review its history. If these actions take rescanning the blockchain, the app could give the user that these actions will take a few moments, and it could save the public address with your private keys for faster reference next time.

Do it now! Open Mycelium, scroll left to ACCOUNTS(on android) , at the top click on KEY+ , then click ADD HD ACCOUNT, pick a cool name, the new account should be selected by default (if not click on it once to highlight it), scroll right once to BALANCE, click RECEIVE, click COPY TO CLIPBOARD. Go back one screen with your phones back button. click on ACCOUNTS, select your OLD wallet, go back to BALANCE and then SEND your entire old balance to the CLIPBOARD address (your new HD wallet) and SEND!
edit: then go back to accounts and select your new wallet to be the active one, and wait for one confirmation before you can re-spend it(approx ten min). You should get notification of receiving funds on the new account instantly (~4sec then one refresh)

You mean like a public address QR code? I don't get what your are suggesting, paper wallets have a QR code that shows the balance and the program you scan it with (mycelium) auto converts it with the exchange your want to use even.

Transistors currently rely on electrons, with a binary state. Quantum computing will enable 6 computable states. With 2 characters in binary there are four possible solutions. With quantum computing, in two characters you can have 36 possible solutions. Zoom out from two characters to a processor. Computing will change drastically someday. (not like it hasent already for the older generations).

I am not saying it does not happen. I agree that if an account is top level verified (2 or 3 now) then there should be an option to click to disable auto cancels.

That means that there will only be 21 million Bitcoins, and each bitcoin may be broken to smaller parts. Precision is exact regardless of the denomination of BTC. If BTC survives long enough (we all know it wont, but fingers crossed),  a unit smaller then a Satoshi may be derived. These units will also be precision integers.

The CIA or FBI created it, its never going down from the (real) feds. The Federal Reserve (a private company) and banking industry is going to spend billions to disrupt service bitcoin service in the next ten years. What you don't know is the real terrorist is the federal reserve. They killed JFK because he wanted the government to print and control the paper money, instead of the non-audited federal reserve company. Who would willingly let their bajillion dollar company disintegrate to nothing? So they kill to ensure their financial future. One man in the way is nothing to criminals.

It will be ~$0.05 or ~$0.06 USD to send, for them to convert back it depends on the receivers exchange/bank.

Shoot, if I can  go past 1200dpi I might go look for a new printer lol! I currently print on thicker construction paper, and after folding I laminate.

Miners get paid a combination of mining fees from current transactions and a block reward. The block reward amount gets cut in half every four years. There will still be a block reward given to the miner that finds blocks up in till the year 2140, after that the miners will only be collecting mining fees from current transactions. Thats over 100 years away. Bitcoin has not even started yet.

I agree now. Now I suggest using a gambling site and wagering a portion of your BTC just to change the value to further add ambiguity. You might come out with -25%, but consider that the cost to mix. Wager like 10% over three sites.

or offer a 10-50% discount. This is the reality of the BTC investor, the current price is very irreverent if you believe in the technology. There will only be 21 Million Bitcoins, ever. To own a whole Bitcoin would be a fortune for your family for generations. Only reason to be so fixed to sell for BTC at the exact current market value is you only value it exact at what someone else values it at, at that exact moment in time too because the value does change constantly. IMHO Bitcoin has not had an IOP yet, getting in is now is so cheap ATM.

I think you would have to set it for the limit of your one time purchase. (Or five dollars more, just to be safe about price conversion bullshit). After your one time purchase you go into your coinbase account and remove the privileges for egifter entirely. The page you are looking at is provided by coinbase thu a portal for the site you are using, egifter. Permission must be provided even for a one time purchase.

DUDE. I did this too! IT DID NOT GO OVER WELL. I wrote on it 'do not throw away' so I am hoping they don't throw it out. They are the kind of people that cannot afford emotionally to save. They want every dollar for gas and another smoke or drink at the bar. The real gift your giving them is teaching them how to save. You can't just drop it in the tip jar and walk out, you have to give a full 1/2 hour explanation about it when they are not busy. If you catch their attention you can talk to the owner, Ill bet they are paying 2-3% for credit and debit cards. If they integrate bitcoin with Bitpay, they can get money directly in their digital ACH checking or savings account at 0% fees in 24 hours

It is necessary at this stage of development of bitcoins life. $1,000,000+ of coins are mined every day. The market has to absorb that. The next halving will be interesting.

The money does not matter if you really care about getting your bitcoins. I can see you sill hold tight value to your fiat currency, and without the allure of selling BTC for fiat you have no interest in acquiring BTC. I understand mining for money, and think the community needs people that do that. After all, being diverse with your assets is a more secure way to save. Bitcoin can still be unhashed and rendered worthless.

There is no central authority to define a standard. But all exchanges are +- a few % of each other due to automatic  bots working to make their owners money. So regardless of who you pull the price from, everyone else will be around that too.

so you do know that makes it super expensive to buy pizza? 
was a $20 purchase for 10,000 BTC = $0.002 per BTC
Bitcoin is now at ~$237/btc 
so now a $20 pizza package should = 0.08342974 BTC
The old pizza package went for 10,000BTC * $237 todays price = $2,370,000 todays value of those coins.
If you sell two pizzas for $2 million than I don't know what Im talking about. Are you trying to attract cusomers with pizza thats almsot free to them? Just pricing wrong? They should be priced at like 0.00002000 BTC for the pizza package. Yes, thats not even a penny your making if you want to honor your origioal intent.
Begin to set the standard, 0.00000100 = $1.00 USD

old method: It shows public keys
new method: HR wallets, new key is generated for every transaction, all coins of a single wallet are summed together for a total balance, when you spend coins are auto joined as necessary and change is put back in your HR wallet with a new key.

You should double check the small print. IIRR (If I Remember Right) on Coinbase only the USD deposits are insured.
However I still trust them fully and completely with my ~~hundred dollars worth~~ 0.068 BTC of life savings. 
If you die, will someone you know and trust with all your money be able to find and then recover a hardware wallet? Coinbase has a process in place in case of death to deliver your coins to your next of kin. 
I really like  due to no electronics failing long term. I think the trezor would be a better product if you could spend bitcoin in the wild. Yes that would make it a full wallet, thats fine, and they might be doing this one first to build confidence in the company. I think requiring a computer to do any/every tx is a bit absurd when you are not in an office environment all day. If I can't get coffee *and* trust it with a million dollars worth, I don't want it. Coinbase offers basic wallet services and the vault. They need to pay me for advertising, I am one of the few that obviously have not had a problem with them, been a customer for years. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:07:50
The forever lasting rarity of Bitcoin gives it its unique perceived value. There will only be 21 Million of them, ever. And that won't happen until 2140 or so. With the USD, no one know how many there are exactly, more and more are made every year.

You can't value the coins being produced at 73 because the market values them more then that. That's like valuing them at 1,200 because that's where they once were. On the way down to 73 either a big investor, a new market, or the reward halving could change our direction.

On the app? cause the app on iphone and android is buggy, I think its made by a third party. Try updating it. 
Also Coinbase if you see this, your integration with gyft isnt working. When in gyft we click on pay with coinbase it says invalid url, then prompts to open in the app, we do and it just opens the app and thats it.

Bingo. You would have to wait, if you set up your vault to be a 48 hr vault. I was under the impression that you could set that to any time period you wanted to, an hour to a year, but I could be wrong. And of course you have to set it up before you put the coin in it. I really like the idea of multiple emails from different domains, and if I could use more then two (ie4of5) I would like that too. What kind of price would make you sell immediately?

that is the daily limit the app is allowed to take from coinbase for anything overall total. if you think you will spend $100 in a day then set it to $200. imho 2k is alot unless you are making a big purchase or you are a big coiner.

Have you tried to use Coinbase or are you just regurgitating FUD? They are great. Once you are verified, their instant buy is faster then the block chain confirmation times. So you have access to your coins on coinbase faster then anyone else on the market. (as far as I know) The canceled orders only happens when the price is fluctuating ~$100/~two hrs
The only issue I have with them atm is on the mobile android app, the Coinbase default launch screen does not show current value, so I would have to click on buy BTC to see the buy price. but then I realized I could buy a BTC and leave in in the Coinbase wallet so the default load screen shows my 1.0 balance and the current equivalent value in dollars.

I have had a few problems with Gyft. I use Mycelium and Breadwallet for wallets. 
1 No returns on unused gift cards or unused portions of gift cards. I like to get a gift card big enough to cover the whole bill, and I don't want to manage change like $1.20 here and $4.20 there and $18.30 over there.
2 Some gift cards do not have a scannable bar code. I just went to Burger King, and Gyft gave me a certificate number. The first time at BK I didn't even know it worked, I though the cert# was like a recipt number and I would get a barcode later. I had to pay for my food with dirty money. I later realized that that was the gift card# but there was no barcode to scan. When I went back there was a big ordeal about me handing my phone to the girl to copy the  Why is there no bar code? Does BK not have scanners?
3 The app used to take forever to load the list of retailers they have gyft cards for but it seems to be loading fine now. As in much much faster, so fast it seems to finally be saved. Thats cool. And the little discount they offer is cool too.

You money would be better spent promoting it also, not just dumping funds into coins overnight. It does help the price, but not as much as you might imagine. Most of the people benefiting financially will be day trading bots, not initial investors. 
$15 million liquidated over all the current coins over time will raise the price from $396.83/a coin to $397.95/a coin. 
$[396.83 a coin]( * [13,379,400 current coins]( = $5,309,347,302 global net value. Add in $15,000,000 and you get $5,324,347,302, divide again by 13,379,400 coins and you get a price of $397.95 per coin. 
Putting that much money in at once will create wild oscillations to the price, you will probably bring up the price a couple hundred dollars for your last coins before it comes down just as fast, causing you a loss for many of the coins. 
If you are interested in paying me a million for a year of 'where to throw money at' advice, that is something I can do for your entertainment.

I completely agree with this, just like music label only funneling down a small portion of the revenue to the artist. 


This is often how the pros play. It is a great way of looking at any sales job.
Much of the pre-boxed software for sale on the market is garbage, and once you open it your stuck. By using software before you decide to pay for it, you can see if the software fits your specific application in a manner that you see fit. Sometimes we encounter a situation where we do not want to take the time messing around with 15 different programs to find the one that is right for us. It's worth it to get the Brand Name version because you feel comfortable with the Name Brand, it's been around for a while, they take care of their customers, and release new versions periodically. Two examples could be Microsoft and QuickBooks. When you start a business you need a reliable platform to secure and access your basic data. Then you need reliable Point Of Sale software. You can't take chances if they did taxes right or wrong, and just switch to a competitor's POS software if you find a flaw in QuickBooks. You need something concrete from day 1, and paying for a reliable name is sometimes worth it. IMHO Steam is worth it, more so then Microsoft, and equally as much as a POS (like Quicken).

You are making it harded then it really is. Breadwallet only has one 'account'. (I don't like this and wish I could create more.) All of your unspent inputs for all of your known addressed are totaled and displayed as your balance. The HD wallet system that breadwallet uses is so advanced you do not have to pay attention to your private keys anymore, breadwallet does it for you. Just remember to make a backup of your wallets seed asap.

This is not true. Coinbase and SHIFT have off chain mechanisms that they utilize. When you use Coinbase you don't have or own the private keys to your coin so you don't actually 'own' any coin, you are owed coin. When you spend with SHIFT you change a private centralized ledger, the tx is not on the blockchain, you have not lost any coin you own or USD. SHIFT is basically making it much easier to clear debt. If feels good to get back what is owed to you!

Older versions of mycelium would let you do this. The new version apparently does not, it scans the QR code and sends all funds from it to a new HD address you control, that way if you import it then lose your phone you can still recover all funds with your recovery seed. 
I would like to use this too, I am not worried about privacy or anyone hacking my private key. There are addresses that have spent bitcoin 24,000 times, and they have not been cracked yet. They have 12,337 more bitcoin then I will ever have, so they are a much bigger target.

All that is off the Blockchain. While you are there you are using a sidechain. A private ledger. They control that ledger and that is why all the coinbase to coinbase tx are fee free. If Coinbase disappears overnight you will lose everything because you do not own your private keys nor do you have a backup of your private keys nor the 12 or 18 word seed.

I had problems with their service too. To deposit BTC you have to send it to their Duabi vault. To get physical gold it has to be mailed from their New York vault. You would think transfering it would be just a click but: "The Duabi vault does not allow transfers at this time." 
I would not use them at this time.

@_date: 2017-03-11 18:18:02
I would completely trust them with any amount less then a months rent. Coinbase has been the BEST bitcoin website that I have found so far. No spam, no crap. They do want a shit ton of verification, but I am totally cool with that and I know it reduces their cost of fraud, which reduces operating costs which might lower prices. Not really but I can hope.

I guess I could write down the U/P, and the pin, but I don't want to log in every time I want to buy a coffee or use small change. My fiat wallet does not require a pin, and it would be annoying if it did. I just really want my Mycelium back.

Download bitcoinpaperwallet from bitcoinpaperwallet.org
Get mycelium or breadwallet on your phone (they are both great)
Unplug internet on your computer, launch bitcoinpaperwallet, and input your private key, it will give you a qr code of your private key.
Use phone app to 'import private key', it will go into camera mode, and point it at the qr code. this will move all the btc off the paper wallet onto your phone.
Either app should allow you to set up a send before you get a confirmation from the paper wallet. You can launch coinbase from your desktop, goto whatever they have for adding funds/btc, and when you get a qr code you can use your phone to send.
Turn off your computer before you plug the internet back in.

Well, TBH, Coinbase probably has a security policy to not disclose why, otherwise you could tell other people, and then they could attempt to game the system. Dude let me tell you how much I hate banks and bouncing account balances. I hate it so much I could write a page about how BOA fucked me with 8-10 overdrafts when it should of only been one. So mad. Dont to much worry about not getting a response from CB, its behind you now. Just be careful to not overdraw ever again, of the banks could come for your children.

There are many different variations of the word 'secure'. If you make a paper backup of your seed, you are secure from losing your phone or getting it destroyed by water, fire or crushing. If you put a password on it and have a paper backup, you are secure from theft. If Apple wants to, they could push an over the air update that forwards wallet data to them and they could drain all the accounts. Any google wallet app *could* do that too, but that is why everything that goes into either app market is reviewed over and over. This event has not yet happened in the bitcoin world, that I am aware of. To be secure from that, don't keep all your coins on your phone. If the creator goes bankrupt bust, I would assume the app would continue to function without any more updates, except maybe a constant warning to move your coins to another more updated wallet. After using the app for a year+, I see great functionality, simplicity for the user, and absolutely no malicious intent by the creators.

I was under the impression that anarchy was a society with out any rules or order. Following that train of thought, using a currency is following the economic rules of order. 
However it appears that Wikipedia tells me that anarchy is "a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions."  
This leads me to a thought process that results in me seeing anarchy not as violent as movies have portrayed, but as a society of people that can respect each other because it is the right thing to do - not because its the law.

They are only as safe as the device they are connected on. Most people turn off power completely, unplug from internet, then boot to a known safe OS, run the VanityGen, record keys, then power off before rebooting with internet. 
You will absolutely *virtually never* generate the same address. 
They  generate random address and look at the first characters of the address and if they do not match the string you pre-input with variances you describe allowing then it throws it out and makes a new one and looks for the string again until it finds a match and spits it out. It gives you approx time to 50% chance of finding the string, same time again to 75% chance, same time again to 87.5% ect. The easier the string is the faster it will find a match.

If bits were on parity with the usd then that would out us at 1oz gold=2.763mBTC = 0.002763BTC or 2,763 BITS = $2,763 USD per oz gold. I do see gold going up, and these are all realistic numbers.

Are you using cell phone apps? Or tablet apps? Most cell phone wallet apps will generate a new address every time you need to make a new tx.

Absolutely not at all. You might want to look how Bitcoin works first. The paypal user can regain access to his/her account. The bitcoin user is sol. 


Again, do some more research how Bitcoin works. In the future if the private key is used on funds that have been declared a loss there is no way for the government to claim or own them. No way at all.

It was practical for me two years ago.
I see two and three as one in the same. I spend bitcoin, and in the end them merchant receives fiat. It does not matter so much if its my service or his service that does the exchange.

Write to the developers of said apps and request that they allow you to pull new pubic addressees from a text file for each tx. That way they are not responsible for private key generation, and building a list like that is easy-peasy. vanitygen64 can do it, you could get (short) vanity addresses for each tx.

Nope. 
No way to avoid the scam. you could have the recipient message you on paypal with the address that they want to receive funds at and how much they are going to receive, and if they typed it perfect when you send it there is a pre-recipt from them with the address and the amount. The blockchain is immutable, so there will be no discrepancy on if they received the funds or not. 
If paypal cares about that or not is a whole 'nother story.

I love coinbase and I think they are safe. The possibility exists where their servers go down, or get shut down, or get hacked, there are a number of possibilities that result in you not being able to access your BTC. But that could happen to Mycelium too, Breadwallet is more standalone. And I think any app wallet could be frozen by your carrier one day, a forced update could forward your private keys to them, or your 12 word seed showing all your history on that branch.

You are correct that paying the terrorists does achieve what you want, and they need that reputation. I did not mean that the ransomware was a double scam.
So you have paid the terrorists twice? If you really care about your industry and have any ethics at all you would not help people fund terrorism. **You are financially supporting groups like ISIS.**

use mycelium on your phone or breadwallet on you phone. Be SURE AS  FUCK to backup your wallet, you do this by going to settings and clicking backup, then you write down on paper 12 random words shown to you. Keep these physically safe at home, as they are access to all your coins if you lose your phone. The 12 words and your phone are the ONLY access points to your coins. On your phone enable a 4 digit pin in the app you downloaded, then enable your phones passcode/fingerprint locking mechanism.

Yes, I am. I like the idea of needing three email address and passwords over different domains to approve removal of my coin in an honest way. If they get 'hacked', depending on the type of hack it just might save some coin. They are an exchange first and formost, they function as a wallet and I have had no issues sending BTC using their wallet service. Once it was delayed ~one hour but that could of been BTC just blocking slow. The best feature they offer is the SHIFT VISA card. All my bitcoin, to any vendor that accepts VISA. The VISA is my primary funding source for paypal, so anywhere that takes paypal or visa now is a place that I can spend my bitcoin.

I haven't found a solid goto video yet for this very unique group. 
I am confident that if I can get them to understand the blockchain, their followers will do what followers do best and follow.

I have lost BTC to a scammer (twice on LBTC) and once to a lost private key with no backup. I put my cell phone in the toaster for just a minute to dry it off after opening it because it got wet.

Ok the second half of structuring (I assumed you knew this) was that multiple deposits or withdraws can add up to over 10k. So lets say in one day you go to the bank four times and put in 9k each time. They are all separate trips, maybe different tellers at the counter, and each one is under 10k. Well at the end of the day you put in 36k without filling out the appropriate paperwork. Thats well over the 10K limit. Now imagine those were over a week. Same thing, at the end of the week its still over 10K. Now imagine that over a month. If you made a 9K deposit each week for a month would you fill out the forms? I sure as shit would, there is not point in trying to avoid something so well monitored by big brother.

Product costs X. Buyer and seller both deposit 1.5X into a smart contract. Buyer pays X for item, those bits directly get add into the smart contract. When the buyer receives the item and is happy with its condition, they release the contract and they and the seller gets their 1.5 coins back and the buyer gets theirs. 
In the event the buyer is not happy with the outcome of the purchase, and they want to complain the seller can make it right or say piss off and then they lose out on the product and 1.5X 
If either of them wants to screw the other party they can, but it will cost them 1.5X and piss someone else off.

withdrawing or depositing cash in multiple amounts under 10k to avoid reporting is structuring. 
His bank should be notified of his business type and what to expect from him. If he has a personal account and is making business deposits... also alot of personal banks don't let you have more then $100,000.00 stored in them, as that is the maximum insured by the FDIC.

The seller also puts up 1.0 - 1.5 - 2.0 - 2.5X and the payment for the transaction is held until the smart contract is released. They have an incentive greater then the products value to make the customer happy. The customer also has an incentive greater then the products value to work with the seller to resolve any issues before the contract can be released.

Ok, Ill agree that the cost of mining sets the low point for the price of bitcoin. If its cheaper to buy bitcoin on the market rather then mine them people will do so, leveling out the bottom line cost. But the cost of mining has no effect on the high end. The pricing on the high end is all speculation until usefulness.

American politicians wanted the technologies testen in other countires first incase of some large hack/catastrophe bringing down the economy. Americas financial system worked so changeing a working system to a new unpolished system is a very dangerous move. Having another country work out the bugs is the safest way to do real world troubleshooting before launching the technology at home. 
The same principal is used for cell phone app updates. After in house testing they go to not super popular regions, update everyone online there, and monitor for random unforeseen problems before pushing the update to the rest of the market.

Use mycelium or bread wallet to send a paperwallet's funds to your coinbase receiving address, coinbase does not have the capability to input and spend from a private address as far as I know.

you are also assuming the coins are divided evenly among all the people, and that no companies or governments hold any coins. Factor these in and they are even more rare.

The backup is what enables you to reactivate it on another device, be it password or digital token. 
I think it is a great idea to have to work with support to recove an account. Then because it requires humans to interact with to recover your account, how would you feel if there was a fee involved with recovering an account?

We can chose to use a side chain unaffected by their decisions. If people follow dont follow the Execs chain the value of their coins will be greatly diminished compared to the Execs chain.  People are more greedy for their own finances then the greater good, so I think everyone is going to follow the money. We are all rats chasing cheese, very few of us can stick our head out of the well made maze to see the rat race from above.

What about doing it only if BTC price falls? Then people who have BTC can get a better deal on the products (and thus be more inclined to buy more) while the retailer takes a gamble that the BTC price will rise again before they need the money. If BTC price goes up, the price of the product can be reconfigured. This could also reset every month to keep it semi current.

I sold for +10% and think thats fair for in person cash in hand deals. Don't do more then 2k per person per month and no more then 10k per month total.

This is interesting. I have always thought thought that intrinsic value was physical usability, like with gold you can make things and oil makes gas.

Credit Cards and are not needed, and certinaly not paypal. Paypal is great for online but I have only seen twice in my life brick and mortar stores that take Paypal.

Why didn't you do it when they were under $100? Are you going to ask again when they are $20,000? Can you deal with it if they crash and are worthless? *Don't invest what you cant afford to lose, and then go all in.*

Often times the display shows old data. On the app to refresh price you used to have to change the scale of the graph, or jump out to account view then back to charts (which is now dashboard). the new app is broken, I have found two things wrong with it, one of them affects functionality so I have to use the website again. 
On PC I assume it's just F5 to refresh.

I strongly suggest using bitstamp over LBC. Nothing is wrong with LBC, its just so much more work. Once you are verified on an exchange its just so much easier.
His feedback suggests he is a reputable bitcoin seller, but how clean is his bathroom? You cant judge how someone is going to handle your personal identity and related information by judging them on how well they can sell bitcoin. It gives him something else to sell when the bitcoins are gone. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:43:26
Store your coins in your own wallet, not LBC's wallet. If you have a cell phone get Mycelium or Breadwallet, and whichever you get BE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR WALLET. This is done by writing down 12 origional words that are given to you so if you lose or break your phone, you can restore you wallet. Keep these safe as they act as keys TO ALL YOUR BTC on your phone. 
I have used LBC in the past and I think they have made an awesome service. Be sure to read absolutely everything, and only release BTC when you are 100% sure you have the funds. There are tons of scams on LBC, including people making deposits then getting their btc then getting the deposits refunded. 
Have you played on Leet.gg yet?  *edit: they are reshaping. in the past you play cs and earn BTC for each kill*

What clients let you spend like that? mycelium used to, if you imported a known private key. now it only has the option of "cold storage", which scans a qr code of a paper wallet then sends all those funds to your HD wallet. That way if you lose your phone (and you backed up) you still have all the cold storage funds you scanned. But they arent considered cold from the point you first scanned them.

you will probably not be able to make a backup either
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:38:15
Well they are not being held hostage or there would be a release bounty, and if you did make a backup of your seed you wouldn't be in this mess. I lost .56+ BTC because I didn't make a backup, and two days ago my backup notebook got destroyed, so now I say make two backups even. You could try emailing them again, being super polite and patient gets you further then being an ass. 
I got an invite email I had to open from my phone only, it installed this crashlytics program that monitors whatever, then that uploaded compressed data to ios then I got another email I had to open from my phone only and it installed a custom version of mycelium that allowed me to read my 12 word seed (which I did right away) and then send all my coins to another wallet. When I try to spend from cold storage from the new app it says no this app is in testing and not safe. Same if your try to show your qr code to read or copy your private key to clipboard, it says no no go testing app. Your coins should be safe until recovered, you could email them again. gl

Disable background data for that app, and your phone will run faster if you do that to alot of your personally installed apps. Note some apps require background services to function properly, like streaming music when your screen is off.

I think if you submit your information rapidly after sending BTC the timestamp would show you submitted it and claimed it at the same time, before anyone else. You also could do step two first and instead of the transaction ID you could use the sending wallets public address

You are not supposed to cut power while the HD actuator arm is in motion. Any program or application accessing the HD will move the arm. You might have caused physical damage to your drive by not waiting for it to park. 
If you have bitcoins on it or other vital information you could possible recover those. There are expensive data recovery services, or you could chance buying the same make and model drive and swapping plates, then immediately backing everything up to another physical drive. Once you open them they will not last long and completely fail, so be sure to back it up right away.

I hate to be that guy, but when I went to go check out, It took my to a bitpay QR code, and I was really hoping to goto the coinbase website so I could just click and use coinbase's web interface.

A merchant account means that when someone sends you bitcoin to buy something (like your time because your working) the bitcoin goes to a wallet controlled by Coinbase or Bitpay and when they see an incoming transaction they send your bank account the cash money in USD via ACH transfer within 24 hrs, with zero percent chance of a charge-back. No work on your part to get USD.

This is where I think Fold is a genius. I was explaining how to get Starbucks to my friend, and was teaching them about bitcoin at the same time.

The 1 BTC offer does not extend to other charities, just seans outpost.


If sean cares about the homeless, he will see an opportunity to record what he already does to earn another whole full and complete bitcoin for the homeless community. (current market value ~$247) It should not be hard for sean to get one of his friends to video tape it, or a local supporter, or a local nay-sayer. It only has to be done once for the 1 BTC bounty, and that $200+ goes a long way when helping people in need.

Drastically. Authy requires you to still use your username and password. Then read and transcribe a 6-8 digit number from one device to another. Celf, you just have to try it, to test you can use it to login to their website. I use Authy where its available becuse it is one extra layer of protection, but I have friends heavy into BTC and they say instantly thumbs down to Authy. I think they have had a problem in the past where someone could just click to skip it or something, and for some people lack of security perfection is forever unforgivable.

They are an exchange and wallet. They do a great job on both, but the distaste for BOA is stronger then my brand loyalty for Coinbase.

When copying pasting, did you glance at the first few and last few characters of the address to ensure that they were correct? Then in your Coinbase account history does it show that you sent funds to that address? 
In my Coinbase whenever I send funds it always says 'pending' in Coinbase even when I have already received and confirmed. I have more then month old outgoing transactions that haven't been Coinbase confirmed but are blockchain solid. This should not affect the other site receiving funds. 
It is possible that Coinbase had a delay sending. So much of a delay that the timer for the other site expired. If this were the case, the sites bitcoin qr code manager should be able to sort that out. They either received the funds on the expired QR and are holding them or they sent them right back to the receiving address (possible but unlikely) and they got sent to a big Coinbase outgoing account. So no matter what their is going to be chasing on your behalf.

I just set it up. I like it alot, especially how you can spend as soon as you get notifications of incoming funds, you don't have to wait for a confirmation. That's super cool. Might be risky, like if the first incoming transaction was voided for whatever reason. 
The only thing I don't like about bread wallet is if I goto import private key, and scan a public address, the app goes directly to the 'pay this address' screen with the scanned address as the receiver (getting paid from my phones wallet). This is not what I wanted to do whatsoever, I was hoping to check the balance of said public address. Also when actually importing a private key we are not really importing the key to our wallet as much as wiping all the funds from the paper address moving them to to our phones wallet. This is also not really what I wanted to do, but I can see how it would fit the use case for a group of people using one time paper wallets. I would also like to spend from two-of-three paper private keys.

I got a refund right away but it was supposed to be a full refund of an unused card. Instead I got back ~75% of how much bitcoin I just spent ~15 min earlier. 
I understand the refunded amount in bitcoins measured in dollars is smaller then the balance was on the card, due to the 20% off when originally buying the card. The refund should reflect the exact amount spent.

1. Less people selling. As the mining reward halfs and halfs again the miners will have less to sell. As time goes on to approach this, other large holders invested to sell will have sold off more of their coins resulting in less to sell. Both of these take time. The other option for less sellers is a bulk of sellers just deciding to hodl and not sell. They take a year or two off and they will come back with a fresh head and high prices. 
2. People buying in. Either from a media zeitgeist where the public buys in panic, or a few individual wealthy people. More people just start collection coins. 
3. A nation goes all in (or even 1/4 in). The national currency is just as accepted as bitcoin in this nation, and the rest of the world instantly notices. 
4. Russia and the Middle east trade grain/btc/oil without the USD standard. 
5. Gold tanks when a superconductor is released (soon) that is more efficient in every way then gold on a PCB. Even poor countries can begin manufacturing without heavy metals. It is discovered via wiki leaks that no gold exists in Fort Knox, its now a computer database. Those who hold value in gold will flock to other assets.
I think all of these will take it above and beyond its last high point. Time will gain momentum, and momentum is a difficult thing to stop.

You can buy bitcoin instantly with Coinbase, once you verify you account/identity, and post a credit card as backup. The signup is just like the paypal, two charges/credits to your account under a dollar and you report both amounts to verify ownership of the account. If you use my referral link and get $100 worth I get $75. Ill sent you $25 of that, so you spent $75 for $100 of bitcoin. Its a great deal. As others have said, its not the best place for storing coins long term, as you dont have control of your private keys. Mycelium or Breadwallet are great mobile wallets, or if your storing bitcoins long term I suggest you use  , download and restart with a usb or DVD bootable linux and internet unplugged. Or roll dice and do the math for your own keys.

Mycelium iOS Wallet Status Update
What has happened
On March 31 we released version 1.1 of Mycelium wallet for iOS. It had many useful improvements, including support for system passcode and Touch ID.
Within the first day a few customers complained that they can not perform payments. Re-installing the wallet and restoring it from backup helped resolve the issue. On the second day we received a few more complaints, some of them stating that a backup was never made, so they cannot simply re-install the wallet.
To limit potential losses, we immediately pulled the app from the App Store to prevent remaining users from automatically updating until we investigate and resolve the problem.
Immediate analysis showed that only a few of our users has experienced this problem. Additional testing did not show if there is a bug in the application that could have lead to the lock out of funds. We also could not reproduce the issue where updating from v1.0 to v1.1 makes payments impossible on any of our own systems.
We began collecting reports from customers with various details of their iPhone setup, and reached out to several customers to perform additional diagnostics on their devices. While investigating the issue, we learned that several other iOS developers reported a similar intermittent issue with a security component known as "Keychain": the operating system simply locks the application out of the secret data being stored by it. We could not yet find a concrete explanation on how that's possible and what is the best workaround for it (e.g.
The investigation is ongoing, but in the meanwhile we have implemented mitigation methods to reduce the impact of the issue. We are still testing it and very soon will resubmit the app to the App Store.
Next steps
    If you have a previous verson (1.0) installed, please make sure you have made a back up. It can be done in Settings tab -&gt; Export Wallet Master Key. You will be shown a list of words: write them down and re-enter to make sure you did not make a mistake.
    If you have the latest version (1.1) installed and it works fine for you, still make sure you have a backup as described above.
    If you cannot send money and you have made a backup, please make sure your back up is still accessible. When the update comes out, you will be able to simply re-install the app, enter your backup words, and use it normally.
    If you have not made a backup, but have not deposited any funds into your wallet, you may simply re-install and create a new wallet when the update comes out (do not send any coins to your wallet in the meantime).
    If you cannot send money and you have not saved the backup, we will have a manual diagnostic process to help you. Please contact us (see the details below). Do not delete the Mycelium Wallet and do not deposit more bitcoins into it
The updated app will take several days or even a week to appear after the problem is identified and solved due to the App Store validation process.
If you have made a backup and you need to access your funds sooner, you may use the Android Mycelium Wallet and restore your backup there.
Manual diagnostic process
We ask every customer who can't access their coins and who has not made a backup to contact us by email at ios The process is tedious, so if you have a backup, please wait for the update to come out, or use the Android Mycelium Wallet to access the funds from your backup.
If you do not have the backup, please send us an email with the following information:
    Your device identifier (UDID, see below on how to find it).
    Your contact email.
Note 1: Do not delete the existing installation of your wallet! If you do, you will irrevocably lose all the information that may help with recovering your funds.
Note 2: We do not want, nor need your personal identifying information. If you have privacy concerns, please use a temporary email address and Tor if needed. Just make sure the email address you provide will work for a few days so we can contact you back.
Note 3: Your device identifier is only necessary for us to be able to make a diagnostic build of the app for your device. Apple's app signing process requires that. Since 2013, no application (including Mycelium) has access to that identifier, so it's not possible to use it to track any of your activity on your iPhone. It's only good for installing builds during development outside the AppStore. See below for more information. If you are still concerned about privacy implications, you may wait for an AppStore-based build to come out and use that for diagnostic process.
We will send you back a diagnostic build of Mycelium Wallet and further instructions.
Thankfully not many people are affected, and we will work as fast as we can, but this could still take a few days to resolve. We will try to be very careful in order to successfully recover your funds. We hope you understand.
How to find your device identifier (UDID)
    Connect your iPhone to a Mac or PC with iTunes.
    Select your iPhone in iTunes. You may need to unlock it first (enter passcode or TouchID).
    Open the Summary tab for that iPhone (the very first one).
    Click the label "Serial Number: X7TG14Y1ESK7" until it starts showing "UDID: d87437b0310078e50ced34739b3b54f89b69ac07" (your numbers will be different). The label does not look like a button, but it's clickable.
    Right-click the UDID and copy it.
    Include that UDID in the email to us.
For more information about UDID, please see:

never have been able to verify ID with the app, because I already am verified I am not sure if the app does this now.

I think on coffee.foldapp.com if your are logged in with valid credentials you get the card before the first confirmation, just on on your announcement of tx. If you are using foldapp anon then it will prob need a confirm, to prevent theft without an identity attached.

Otherwise this is the usa interfering with law abiding citizens of other nations being because the USA wants to be Team 'Murrica World Police.

Yep, and presumably it is the 'only' copy of the key, if it's gone so are allllll the coins on it. Without backup there is no recovery option, it would be like cracking an account that's not yours. But if you made a copy then that is just like a copy of a key for a house or car. You can use either one at any time with no configuration change. But you would need to protect both copies to protect your account.

you could sent to your bank account. you could convert to an alt coin. its really alot of work but lucrative.

$270 Billion. What? That is more reasonable then I expected. I do expect the most difficulty is going to be around the exchanges going belly up or getting hacked during all this. Also, lots of other 'chaos and drama' during the rough rise. 
edit: I just looked up how many coins we have now is its closer to 15.597Million. soooo $15,000/a coin * 15,597,000 = $233,955,000,000 or $233 Billion.

Have you looked into paper wallets?  They are a more then great offline solution. I think everyone needs a different solution, and you need to use all the options yourself to see how they work for you. For example the treznor requires a computer with an available USB port and internet to do ANY transaction (I think). Mycelium has the option for a pin code, and if you enable your phones pin that is two levels of passwords required for spending. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 01:08:38

No worries, it's important to state your views and I appreciate you stating them. I think Coinbase should be on reddit for two reasons, sales and support. I think both of those should be kept virtually completely separate, except for the notion that some companies can turn every other support ticket into a new sale.

we dont want idiots setting their own fees, because then they complain that they spend $20 to send $2, or that their payment for food at the resturaunt after they ate is never confirming.

I don't really understand how you think that bitcoin is slower. Have you ever received money with credit/debit? It takes half a year to guarantee the money is yours, that whole time you live in the terror of a possible charge back. Are you talking about block confirmation times? You don't need to wait for a block to confirm to guarantee the success of a transaction. I understand BTC is not for you right now.
