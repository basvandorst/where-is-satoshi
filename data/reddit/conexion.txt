This is true, but if I'm going to get information on something like Bitcoin, it is probably best to listen to the people who are the most knowledgeable about the subject. If those people are on Twitter, I'll read it on Twitter.

Not OP - And that's when you cash out, right?

Is that like with the Pharaohs... You get buried with your private key?
Edit: I guess eventually we'd all bring the bitcoin and have a secondary necrocryptocurrency.

That seems like a feature, not a bug

I agree to a point - Admittedly I do imagine they're putting business concerns ahead of these gripes, as they are a business.

If you're always buying more, aren't you always buying the dip? :thinking:

That's fair, thanks for the reply. Currently have 1 LTC and change, but will consider getting more.

What about a $3 wrench from Harbor Freight?

 I moved a good chunk of my crypto to ETH before this dip as I'm more familiar with it and felt things were about to get more volatile with BTC and BCH. I'm not as familiar with Litecoin and plan to do more research. What indiciates that it might be on its way to $3000? (Beyond crypto as a whole going up?)

I put the random petty cash from my secondary savings account (few hundred) in not long ago and have hit +20%. I feel cool regardless of what anyone else says!

I'll watch it if it means Bitcoin hitting 100k!
