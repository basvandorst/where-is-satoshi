From a strictly utilitarian point of view, that is true. However, I would argue that most of BTC's present value comes from the fact that it exists. It represents a monetary value that is being placed on freedom from corruption. We speculate that global corruption is costing us a lot more than the current market cap of BTC, and that's why we buy in hopes of going to the moon.
You're not wrong for being upset, because we'll never make it to the moon without concrete utilitarian value, but right now we have to be okay with that future value being pure speculation, unless you're actively working on development, get with the rest of us who don't see utilitarian value emerging for another 5-10 years. Once it does, however, it will be exponential.

At the very least, a miner should wait for emerging technologies to hit the market. That is, better (more energy efficient) computing.

Bitcoin's privacy is effectively optional. Bitcoin is not inherently private, nor do I think it should be private by default (like some altcoins), but if you take the proper measures, you can obfuscate your identity to a point that it would be impossible to link you to any payments in question beyond a reasonable doubt.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:13:17
Let me explain to you why I believe this is good. Stripe probably got burned by accepting bitcoin. During the massive sell off, some of their BTC holding customers probably liquidated their position during the selloff through the website. Imagine that their entire store inventory was inadvertently at a huge discount for about a month. They might have lost profits. One way or the other, they are discouraged enough to discontinue it's use. I say this is good for Bitcoin because, because in my books, it proves its volatility. You can't be asleep at the wheel when dealing with BTC.
Take a look at Microsoft, they made the smart move and declined BTC during the bull-run. It's a little too late for Stripe, so they are spreading reactionary FUD.

Good interview. I paid close attention to the part where he said Bitcoin made a mistake in limiting supply. I think the speaker could not take into account fungibility. A bitcoin is as disivible as the protocol allows, at the moment the smallest piece is one satoshi, but in the future even a satoshi could be broken down. So, really there is no limit to the supply of **pieces**, which is a lot different from unlimited units.

I'm reading "The Real Crash: America's Coming Bankruptcy" by Peter D. Schiff right now, and although there is a a chapter where he advises readers to avoid bitcoin, it's a book with solid theory. He wrote it in 2012 so he is probably beating himself up for not buying bitcoin.

Currently, the 12-word recovery seed phrase for one of my wallets doesn't work on my Coldcard (HW wallet) as the checksum is invalid, apparently. I've read that this is a common problem, and that I could try using one of the next 16 words in the BIP-39 word list, so I tried that, and it worked on the 15th next word. I still have a lot of tinkering to do... but yea that kind of bothered me. I'm no wiz kid, but I can work my way through a lot of problems given my background, some research, and diligence. I think my patience with this stuff is really rare, and I could see another person having a complete breakdown, quick, if enough money was on the line. Bitcoin is not ready for use as a currency; it's not even reliable as a store of value yet, using my anecdote as evidence, and that's not even taking into account price fluctuation.

Well, the thing is, they didn't make money. They didn't make anything, from a purely semantic perspective. Good traders create some wealth (assuming that's what you mean) by taking a risk. You can either work or risk for wealth, but achieving greatness requires a balance of the two. If you trade on exchanges, you better be working very hard, too, because trading currencies is a very risky endeavour.

LN is not in the picture because I imagine there will be a separate protocol to help Starbucks batch bitcoin transactions. It's not rocket surgery. Imagine this: Starbucks releases a new app that allows users to deposit bitcoin. Users use app to pay for coffee. A separate protocol checks the app and batches all the bitcoin transactions at the end of each business day. They would probably batch by region or something, but you get the picture. They are already proficient with batching Visas and other cc's at this scale..

Visa transactions are a lot like unconfirmed bitcoin transactions. Both parties are agreeing that the funds are there, and they have been sent, but there is no majority consensus, it's just two parties agreeing indefinitely, which is why you can dispute transactions days or months later.
I guess it just depends on what you considered "cleared." Like with bitcoin, some people consider it cleared one block later, some want to see the transaction on multiple blocks. This is really semantics
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:26:18
You have to wait for the next block to get mined with your transaction in it.

Crazy that it gets bought up day after day, to me, and here recently (as well as a couple of periods of history) it has had no impact on the value of one bitcoin. So even if the price stays the same, the market cap goes up! When the price stays stable the coin gets stronger.

They're both comparing it to tech stocks. Great video, and they're not wrong, but the big difference with bitcoin is that you don't have to worry about timing the market, or selling, or being a 'trader.' Just HODL it until you can buy the things you want with it. Yea, I'll probably be in my 40s or 50s, but I think I have enough bitcoin to buy whatever I want in the future, and I collect more every week.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:04:22
They're probably going to change it to where when you send money to the exchange, you get USDC in return. So you're not really *putting* money on the exchange, you're buying USDC.

Fortunately the Lightning Network will serve to obfuscate any evidence of capital gains. That's what's taxable, not the transaction, per se, but the realization of a capital gain, and a lot of the time that's a transaction. If the IRS seriously wants to start tracking crypto-gains and/or losses, they're gonna need to balloon in size of their task force and funding. Trust me, a tax rework will happen before that happens. Will it dissuade us from using it as a currency until then? Yes, but true hodlers know we are still deep in the accumulation phase.

I would say there are a lot of banks still "living the past," so to speak, just as any part of a whole economic sector. If you take that into account, no, we can't just say fuck banks. For that matter, I think a lot of these old-timey institutions are poised to be some of the first adopters.

There will be some noobies that get upset they can't own at least 1 bitcoin, and they will buy an alt.

"Intrinsic value" is a misnomer. Value is an idea lent to objects. For an object to hold its value, the idea of value must be agreed upon. The word "intrinsic" implies that it is so naturally, but this is an incorrect assumption for money. At the heart of money, there is an idea of value agreed upon at the societal level. First, a money's value must be created metaphysically, and secondly that value must be agreed upon. You cannot take the money itself and assume value from it (aside from fuel for a fire in the case of paper currency, etc.). For example, a dollar bill may have the number 1 printed on it, but tell me, one what? See how that is not intrinsic in any sense of the word.

I'm anticipating a run on Bitcoin. Instead of a 'run on the banks' where no one can get their cash out, it will be a run on where no one can turn their cash into bitcoin. Bitcoin will have liquidity issues. People that want it simply won't be able to find it. BTMs and exchanges will dry up overnight, and people will be stuck with their fiat. Bitcoin's price will go up faster than most us believe is possible. And yes, shitcoins will take off too, unfortunately.

Okay, I will try. I believe lost coins re-entering circulation would make price discovery very difficult. As it is, lost coins are effectively baked into the price. I think it should stay that way. Also, I'm no software engineer, but scheduling coins to re-enter circulation through miners after, say, 100 years, sounds tricky to implement. Wallets would need countdown timers that stay in sync with the blockchain. Like I said I'm not software engineer, but that could bloat the code and make it too costly to operate a node, hurting decentralization.

I first bought in Jan 2018 shortly after the spike to $20k, when it was around $12k.

I started dollar cost averaging and my average buy-in price got to around $5,000 per bitcoin. My average buy in price will keep going up as the market price increases, obviously, because that's how DCA works, but I am comfortable with my investment strategy and that's what's important to me.

If you want to use bitcoin, you must 1) adhere to the Bitcoin protocol, and 2) following your nation's laws. The first rule is a must, the second is only optional. Bitcoin is above governance. I'm not worried in the slightest.

The only reason financial professionals can make a career out of trading stocks and shit is because of all the people trying to escape fiat inflation by buying assets. With Bitcoin, people will be able to hold their wealth in money again and put most of those chumps out of a job.

You're essentially suggesting to the leaders of capitalism to adopt socialism. I like it, but it will likely be fruitless.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:01:13
Oh yea I see what you are saying. The 'centralized' exchange model is so pervasive it's hard to imagine a 'decentralized' model going mainstream, but I see now how it's so easy to create an exchange of that nature around cryptocurrency. Well, easy to conceptualize. We will need code masters for its creation.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:29:46
You DCA to reduce your risk of losses from volatility. A "small amount" is subjective, but really it is any fixed amount you choose to buy on a fixed schedule, regardless of price, and the short answer to your last question is no.

I guess it could be, but the incentive structure of the Bitcoin protocol seems socialistic in the spirit of "owning the means of production."

Batching, my dude.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:51:42
Not in his words--but I think one reason is for the rate of inflation to match the rate of adoption. Once most people use Bitcoin, most of the coins will already be in circulation. There's also incentive for early adopters, which is a key for adoption.

The only problem with the methodology of "buying the dip" is that the dip can only be identified retroactively. You can't spot of a future dip or even a present dip. You can only see one days or weeks later. Good idea, impossible to execute without luck.

It's a pretty sloppy analogy, because Bitcoin is a content-type while the cell phone is an apparatus (for the propagation of phone calls, a content-type). It would be more fitting if there were only ever going to be 21 million phone calls, and you could buy up the calls themselves.

No, but Cashapp's market price is about 2% higher or lower than the average exchange price, depending on whether you are buying or selling. Hidden fees are still fees, but if don't count that there are none. Cashapp will also pay your transaction fee if you choose to withdraw, which is very courteous of them imho.

Technically true, as the money has already been *made*.

I'm talking about the same people OP is talking about. "Financial professionals." I'm just saying that with bitcoin, less people will be worried about escaping monetary inflation thereby getting forced into buying things like stocks or bonds that financial professionals push. Sure the market will still exist, but the only people who will be participating in it are people who willingly want to play that game, not investors who merely wish to escape inflation and/or get a meager return on their savings.

The only problem is that the bigger and faster the blockchain is, the more centralized it becomes. I believe the Bitcoin blockchain will implement consensus-driven updates when technological advances become available to the general population. Until we reach that point, offchain solutions will keep getting stronger and stronger.
Aside from that,

Let me show you some real detective work... the letter b in "bitcoin" stays the same size, in ratio, as the letter n. The b should be smaller in size of ratio, as it is more distant from the n in this perspective. I smell a professional karma farmer...
Edit: notice how the OP conveniently glosses over the physical location of the subject in title...
Edit2: he's given a city and province in a comment reply, so he's trying hard. Hmm... maybe he really does own a parkour gym, but most people have never heard of such, conveniently enough.
Edit3: notice his exact comment that sussinctly offers the location. See the upvotes. Who would upvote that? Physical residents of Grande Prairie, Alberta who are viewing the same post, at the same time? Or is it more likely that other accounts, also owned by the OP have been used for upvotes to increase his visibility and maximize karma?
Edit4: on inspection of the OP's post history, I noticed he's pushed a shitcoin.

Slow your roll there buddy. It is personal preference. Say for a moment that you are a whale that bought hundreds of coin a few years back. You can now either sell it for fiat (bleckk) or spend it.

The truth is, bitcoin *does* have intrinsic value, but I'm starting to understand that intrinsic value is perspective. Truth is perspective too. Everything is meaningless without life. We give things value with our lives. So it depends on how you wanna live? You wanna let the banks do whatever the fuck they do in their gigantic buildings and yacht owning board of directors, or u wanna put ur foot down while you have a chance and make your stance?
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:46:29

Sorry to fork off this conversation, but I think it's important to recognize the Bitcoin network as a payment settlement protocol. It's obvious to me that, by design, it is meant to have second-layer protocols (like the LN) built on top of it. The LN won't be the only second layer protocol! I think there will be many others, like whatever Bakkt is working on, or whatever banking institutions choose to implement whenever mass adoption becomes more obvious. In that regard, the LN was never meant to fix a scalability issue. What it makes possible are fast, cheap, and (semi) trustless third layer payment protocols.
Problems can arise when people attempt to alter Bitcoin's use-case. It's not fast, and it's not cheap, but some people just can't accept that, so they can fork off lol.

See Spain's "Running of the Bulls." In economics a bull run is when the price starts to increase SO rapidly that it prompts uneducated investors to buy just to be on the safe side, when, ironically, the best spot to be is on the sidelines, watching the runnerz safely from spectators' view :)

Congratulations, nice interview. Overstock CEO says "Kim Jong Un sending money could be a security issue." I would say think of it like this: It's what he may be or may not be buying with it that is a security issue. Everyone should be free to send money. If the gov't has a problem with him buying rockets, well, they should stop the rockets from getting to him, not stop the money from being sent by him. Fortunately with technology like bitcoin, it's near impossible to stop money from being sent anyways

You're assuming that governments won't pump and dump their own currencies to maximize their Bitcoin holdings.

That's what BTC is all about... assigning a numerical value to other types of value. For that to work, the number itself has to have no value. The USD is a numerical value pegged to oil, but younger generation don't want oil. We don't want oil.

There's a problem with this model. Let me tell you a personal anecdote just as an example. I live in one of the most uneducated parts of the US. There are many tradesmen, retirees, and various blue collar workers who would love the option of having a cheap flip-phone that you can just pick up and dial a number, but nothing is cheap. The cheapest plans, even for a flip phone, are in the range of $40/ mo. I pay $90/mo for the best tech available. Something is off here. It works for ME because I can afford $90/mo, and I actually WANT the tech, but I don't see why we can't let these old-timers have flip-phones for like $20 a year or something. Corporations just wanna hoard the money, like you said. That type of conduct is what inspired Bitcoin's creation, and it'll eventually lead to devaluation of the USD if the markets don't correct themselves.

You can always take that unhealthy obsession and turn it into a healthy obsession by setting up your own node, helping other people set up nodes, mailing your friends and family small amounts in the form of paper wallets, learning the tech, setting up a LN node, the list goes on.
From an investment perspective, doing those things is a hedge against risk. You can't lose it if you use it. From a social perspective, you will learn a lot about yourself and others if you follow your heart and share your obsession. Just be careful not to annoy people, or worse, paint a target on your back. If you spread the good news about BTC, people are gonna ask how much you hodl... proceed with caution!

Fiat money used to be by the government, for the people. Now in this era of 'peace' and nonviolence, the new age way to wage war is financially. There's no telling who is on who's side, no coat of arms. It's rich and poor. Big money cartels try to expand their empires, waging financial war against each other, and we (common folk) are caught in the cross fire.

We are still in the phase where people are using money to buy BTC. Once BTC becomes the new money, and people start working for it and trading every day goods with it, we may have the benefit of being early adopters. If you own 0.1 BTC you already own more BTC than like 99.99% of the population. Once demand kicks in the for 99.99 percenters, price will skyrocket, and the early adopter's buying power will be increased astronomically. This is the "to the moon" meme, and it must be studied alongside the "hodling" meme to have a full understanding.

One option I would consider would be cashing out half of it to buy a Bitcoin server (host a full node) and credit the remaining funds to electricity and internet costs (hosting a node is cheap, so this will go a long way). Host your own node. It's the best way to ensure this thing grows, if you really want it to.

Bitcoin is not a commodity. It is essentially an idea that you can chose to believe in with your money. This is what makes democracy (edit2: it also has resemblances of a meritocracy). We all vote with our perceived value (and merit) of(in) the system, and, the "entities" of which you speak are more liken to heavy-weight voters(people with lots of merit). They are holders of a "meta" commodity, if you will. A "meme."

Bitcoin IS that. It's taking the global economy and putting it at your fingertips. You can literally hold onto this thing, you just have to use your imagination.
Every transaction that has ever occurred is being simultaneously recorded and published, and you can view it. These statistics are indeed not backed by a company, rather, they're backed by the principles of mathematics.

You can keep channels open indefinitely, as long as there is consensus between all participants. So, from what I understand, in theory, I could pay my rent for 12 months, with 12 recurring payments inside of a channel that would only broadcast the final balance once. So one fee, 12 transactions.
People will be incentivized to implement smart channel cases in order to minimize fees. Contract scenarios will be written into code. Some of the code hasn't even been written or effectively implemented yet. We still have a long ways to go, but I see a future where we will have specialized channel architecture for things like mortgages, car notes, franchise operations, and the likes. Very stoned right now ��

If the cables are there, you can't block the traffic. You can make it *hard*, but you can't block it without destroying the infrastructure itself.
You can block IP addresses, you can block ports, and you can monitor traffic, but you can't stop the traffic itself. Unless you control 51% of the total hashing power in the Bitcoin network, but even if you did, you would be overriding the traffic, not really blocking it.

What you don't understand is that just because governments can make their own currency doesn't mean we will use it. Bitcoin will absolutely be obsolete over time. It doesn't mean it won't have a good run. The USD has thrived for a century or so... maybe we can make Bitcoin last even longer.

This is an important question that doesn't get asked often. This was one of my first questions before taking the plunge. What's to stop miners from becoming the new bankers?
First of all, miners are essentially robots, not people. So unless robots become power hungry, we're in the clear. Second of all, the block reward halves every 4 years. Thirdly, as new technology emerges, more people will gain access to the mining industry. Fourthly, the power that miners have is paid for in literal power. Oil, water, wind, solar energy powers these computer chips. Without literal power, miners have no power at all.

What he meant is that diversification is for those who choose not to educate themselves. Diversification is a hedge against the risk of being a simpleton.

No, no, no. "Buying the dips" is effectively gambling too, because it's impossible to determine a dip until it's in the past, so there's really no way to buy a dip unless you have a time machine. Okay, if you "buy a dip" you're betting that bitcoin will 1) go back up and 2) not go down more. I think that's important to understand if you have a gambling problem. It's obvious, like "BUY LOW SELL HIGH," no shit... but the execution of such an order is mostly luck. The amount of luck involved goes down with time, so just buy and hodl.

I won't say stop daytrading, even tho I think it's very close to gambling, but if you do daytrade, a smart thing to do would be to trade with only half of your holdings. That way if the market heads the other direction, you have one foot in the door. You can't lose this way, and you can still have some fun on the exchanges.

Don't ignore the trading volume. As a day trader, you're essentially taking on the duty of correcting the market price. If you smart you can make a profit. If you lucky you can make a profit. If you smart and lucky you can make a consistent profit. This is why bots rule the crypto market. They level 9000 bosses and we level 60 Paladins/Deathknights. Good luck taking one down solo.
Correcting the market price also means occasionally correcting on your own mistakes, and these are the hardest mistakes to recognize. You the Paladin or the Deathknight?

I can say with near absolute certainty that crypto currencies are the future friend. I'm not worried about my own investments per se as I am the implications of them. If bitcoin moons, it could mean the fall of the USD. Generations of fathers have worked hard and provided for families with the USD. It's not going down without a fight, and we could do good in preparing to be the underdogs.


What does that mean? Happy positive, profit positive, electron positron? You know what I'm saying? It seems to me that positive in this sense = market influence. Do you see now why I would be paranoid? Market influence is going to be taken from and given to people at near random. Some of it, if not half of it, will be undue. The responsibility rests on ours shoulders to be ready for any case scenario.

It seems more likely, to me, that the USD is the one-world currency that is completely controlled by satan and the anti-Christ, and that Bitcoin is going to usher Heaven on Earth. Revelations describes the Messiah's return as being "like a thief in the night." Could be Satoshi. Afterall, he will be the richest man to ever live if he claims his keys after BTC hits $1 million.

The stock market crashes because people put their money into what they believe are risk averse assets, when they are really putting their money into bad stocks that are propped up by con artists to thousands of times their true value. Truth is, precent growth/fall of price has little to do with whether or not an asset is "risky." An asset can yield a positive return for 10-years straight and still be inherently risky. Ultimately, risk is left to the individual to evaluate, and in my humble opinion, bitcoin is one of the least risky assets I own. I will be loading up if BTC crashes alongside stocks, but doubt that will happen.
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:28:50
Yes, and it makes sense. "Mining" will effectively cease once we hit 21 million. To me, the small details in his choice of language signal his unparalleled vision.

I encourage my friends to take out extra $$$ to budget for bitcoin, in hopes of using gains to pay off the principal amount. The USD is a joke to the millenials and the upper generations just don't get it.
Look at it this way: With costs of college so OUTRAGEOUS, a student can choose to take on 10% more debt, and invest it in bitcoin for a chance to pay off the whole thing WAY sooner. It'd be stupid not to take that gamble.

FOMO is the natural progression to truly understanding bitcoin, It is usually the end result, and can easily spoil a man who is not financially educated.

if you think of bitcoin as a fungus, you can imagine that the mushrooms have all either been harvested (cashed out) or have done their reproductive job (dropping spores, making new hodlers) and are now rotting back into the soil. So now that you see the mushrooms have disappeared, your gut instinct is to assume its dead, but the mycelium (network) is still there, alive and well, and it has actually genetically hardened.
If you look closely enough, you can see mycelial knots (new mushrooms) starting to form

I think anonymity could help speed up adoption, but I'm just not sure if that's best for everyone in the long run. This is a topic that gets brought up a lot, and I'm not really sure where I stand with it, so if you have a talking point for why we need anonymity I'm all ears.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:49:31
Right? Big corporations pay "ethical hackers" to test their software. People are doing it for free in this ecosystem lol

l0l, yess. You know I could never really come up with a valid argument for people calling bitcoin a pyramid scheme. Whatever helps you understand it, ya know?

This is not an industry, or a business. Bitcoin is a protocol

Maybe he had talked too much about his bitcoin in the past, and was covering his tracks.

Because when middlemen are allowed to nickel and dime the entire fiat userbase, they become obnoxiously wealthy

1. LN can provide anonymity.
2. We need transparency to rein in gov'ts and corporations.

It's been zero this whole time. Once you realize that infinity is the same thing as zero this whole thing makes sense.

When u buy stocks ur investing in *people*. Other *people* generate the value you're assuming. Or maybe they won't. People are a liability. Stocks are a liability.

You may get someone really interested in this fascinating technology, or make lost, forever unrecoverable bitcoin.

It doesn't remove emotion from the equation for me. It makes me happy when prices fall, because I can buy in cheaper. It makes me happy when prices rise, because the value of my holdings go up. Hah

If you reckon that money is the blood that flows thru the veins of the economies, "blood" will certainly be "spilled."
