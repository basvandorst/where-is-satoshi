MasterCard might not allow it simply out of protest or legal concern of Bitcoin, but apart from that the transactions wouldn't appear any different to them than any other debit card transaction. Xapo takes care of selling the Bitcoin for USD on Bitstamp, and gives MasterCard the USD.

The fees are optional for most transfers, and are negligible for the rest. And calling the Bitcoin a middle man is a bit silly. That's like calling a taxi a middle man if you take a taxi to meet someone to buy their used car. 


Technically true, although the fiction of fractional reserves increasing the money supply is much more obviously fictional with Bitcoin. You can go to a website that tells you exactly how many bitcoins have been mined, and fractional reserve banking won't increase that.

I don't understand your point. Bitcoin transactions have to "clear" first as well. A single bitcoin transaction confirmation is not "cash," it's more like a check. With each additional confirmation on the network, the recipient has more confidence that their new bitcoin is "cash" (meaning they will be able to spend it in the future). The difference that OP is pointing out is that getting sufficient confirmations to have overwhelming confidence on the Bitcoin network takes way less time than this check clearing.

Stripe (for major credit cards) charges 2.9% + $0.30 per charge (Stripe's beta Bitcoin pricing is undisclosed): 
BitPay charges $30 a month per domain, for zero transaction costs: 
Coinbase charges a 1% fee to exchange bitcoins into standard currency, only after $1million in sales: 
It seems hard to find a definite source for major credit card transaction costs, but most sources claim 2-4% + some membership fee based on the number of monthly transactions.
Granted, cost analysis is more complex than this because most payment processors provide individual deals for large customers.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous. You can track every transaction between wallets, but you can't figure which human controls a wallet without using external information (like monitoring their Internet, or using personal information from some merchant, or torturing someone until they tell you).
Chaumian ecash actually is 100% anonymous. Once cash is issued, people make transactions completely off-network with blind signatures. Obviously, it's still possible to get external information, e.g. by torturing someone until they reveal what transactions they made, but the technology itself is anonymous.

That's true, it might end up looking very similar. The difference, though, is that private property as an institution will likely produce more efficient policies (about vaccination, but also other things) than government regulation of public (and private) property.
In this specific case of vaccination, I agree that the efficient outcome is probably a near-total ban of unvaccinated people on other people's property, or if the anti-vaccers are sufficiently numerous, a segregation between the pro-vaccers and the anti-vaccers.

It's complex, but not really more complex than the question of how governments deal with highly contagious diseases.

We all have a vague idea, of course, and we hear occasional details in the news (like with Ebola), but that's about it.

The problem is that unvaccinated individuals each contribute a very tiny decrease in herd immunity. In most cases it is not feasible to determine which unvaccinated individual "caused" someone else to get sick.

And, like that analogy, ideas like Pigovian taxation or Coasian bargaining are relevant and worth talking about.

It's merely a semantic argument. Both sides have reasonable claims. A "fiat" is just a formal decree, so bitcoin certainly can be considered "fiat money" under this definition, since the algorithms and protocols comprising the network are definitely formally decreed.
However, the idiom "fiat currency" has come to refer specifically to formal decrees *by a government*, since historically governments have been the primary groups to make formal decrees to establish a form of money. As such, "fiat currency" has become associated with dubious government financial actions, like the massive injections into the money supply, that are impossible with bitcoin.

If you're asking why I believe it, then the principle answer is the overwhelming abundance of empirical evidence of the success of competitive markets and the failure of the alternatives. If you're asking what mechanisms cause competitive markets to be more economically efficient, there's a lot of economics behind that one. There are basic (albeit oversimplified) rules of thumb, like the fundamental theorems of welfare economics. However, my views are based mostly on observed evidence. I'm not saying that markets *never* fail or that governments *never* fix market failures. I'm saying that we have good grounds to believe that, on average, markets will perform better than non-markets.

I get it completely. Like I said, I understand how the sorting algorithm works, including the fact that it gives more weight to earlier votes. And, like I've said twice (this will be the third time), the claim that this specific voting algorithm leads to objectively low quality content like memes and image macros is the fundamental misunderstanding that so many people have. There simply is no objective measure of quality, and the point of reddit is to aggregate the subjective measures of quality from the entire community. It's excruciatingly simple, but so many people simply don't get it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:53:17


Yes, obviously. Which means that memes are the sort of content the community wants to see. The point of a subreddit is to expose the content that the community wants to see.

The problem with what you're saying is that it's refuted empirically on a daily basis. People are constantly selling Bitcoins, mostly trades at exchanges but also for traditional goods and services. Also, lots of educated rational actors (like yourself, I presume) are not converting all of their disposable income to Bitcoin, which is what we would expect if there was a guarantee that Bitcoin will always appreciate.

The transaction fees are worth paying because of the convenience and ubiquity of credit cards. Accepting credit cards makes buying *and* selling easier.

Yes. I don't think anyone is disagreeing with that. The point is, when you exchange a Bitcoin on Mt. Gox for USD 120, you don't have 120 liquid USD. You exchanged it for something, sure, but that something is substantially different (and, clearly according to the market, substantially less valuable) than 120 physical dollar bills.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:32:36

So, in other words, it *would* just be a Bitcoin address or QR code, except that the service would provide  a convenient and recognizable embeddable widget to facilitate the transaction.

There is no collective "getting caught up in a frenzy." Even if speculators go crazy tomorrow and shoot the price up by a factor of ten, you're still free to do whatever you want, and unless you also join in on the speculation and buy (or perhaps if you have debt in Bitcoin, but that's probably rare) you should be fine.

On the contrary, you don't understand on a fundamental level how reddit works. The point of up votes and down votes is to determine what the community likes in aggregate, not what *you* like, and not some objective measure of quality. Everyone who complains about memes and image macros fails to understand this incredibly simple concept. They think that there is some objective measure of quality, and that memes and image macros are objectively of low quality. But reddit, unlike traditional content aggregation like newspapers, is based on the aggregate preferences of all community members, rather than a single editor or small group of editors. If you don't like memes and image macros, that doesn't mean that reddit is wrong, it just means that your subjective idea of quality is different than the community's.

This is a fallacious argument, despite being nearly ubiquitous in discussions of Bitcoin.

Just because *your* goal for Bitcoin is for it to become a mainstream replacement for everyday currencies doesn't mean that it's the *only* goal.
