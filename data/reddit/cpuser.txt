Awesome story. 
Yesterday evening I tried to explain to my non-tech wife what a bitcoin is and how people use specialised mining rigs to "create" new bitcoins. It is hard to explain such a thing as a crypto currency, wallets, keys, security.
A lot of friends still don't have the slightest idea of what a bitcoin is and have no interest in it because of the steep learning curve needed to keep your coins in a safe place.
I really like it and more businesses here in the Netherlands are starting to accept bitcoins so I really hope it's here to stay.

LOL you just tipped half of my total bitcoin fortune (0,01BTC).
Starting to figure out how this BTC sorcery works.

It takes about 2-3, at least it was for me.
