While minimizing the trusted computing base is laudable, both Bitcoin and Blockstack are drops in the bucket compared to the OS and firmware you're using to run them.
Also, the logic that interprets Blockstack-originated nulldata transactions and builds up the name database fits into less than 3,000 lines of Python.


If step-count is a concern, then why hasn't Core released a 1-step script to automatically download and verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin binaries?


If there is no meaningful difference in security compared to PGP WOT, then why force the user to figure out how to use PGP and pick the right PGP key fingerprint?  If given a choice, how does the user differentiate between PGP fingerprints?  If the answer is "learn though a web of trust," then the follow-on question is which is easier to memorize and propagate to one's trusted peers:  the right semantically-meaningful name (i.e. `bitcoincore.id`), or the right key fingerprint?

You're right that names don't prove authenticity, but that's not what we're using names for in the first place.  Names are used for *memorability*, which semantic meaningfulness enhances.


We're working under the assumption that the user does *not* know how to use PGP effectively.  But for the sake of argument, let's assume that the user is able to discover both the correct PGP key fingerprint out-of-band, as well as the name that resolves to it in Blockstack.  What Blockstack offers is a way to translate the easy-to-remember name into the hard-to-remember PGP fingerprint, which in turn yields a way to automatically verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin binary (i.e. use the name to look up the key fingerprint, get the key and verify it against the fingerprint, and then verify the signature on the binary).  The security of the name/fingerprint binding is underpinned by the difficulty of getting the user to accept an adversary-controlled blockchain fork as the best valid chain.
From the user's perspective, a one-step command like `blockstack-file get bitcoincore.id bitcoin-0.13.0.tar.gz /path/to/my/downloads/directory` is a lot harder to screw up and a lot less convoluted than trying to use GnuPG to set up a keyring, import the key, verify the binary, and then stay on the look-out for key revocations.  We believe that this is a net gain from a security perspective, since the UX studies on PGP ([1], [2], [3]) have repeatedly shown that non-technical users can't reliably manage keys.
I'm not trying to convince you that Blockstack is a security panacea (it's not); I'm trying to argue that providing a way to securely name keys is useful because it makes verification easier for users.

Forcing users to select one opaque hex string out of a set isn't useful either.  Which of the following is the correct Bitcoin key?
`A869 159C A9E5 4FE9 A2E0  BB6A CB4A 7146 0C3F 3849`
`914F 2105 F7EE E393 7F52  5EFF AF78 A136 BA22 C345`
`9D57 E251 6E60 A8D7 955B  509A 4B28 9279 9855 2163`
`4522 7FDC 0074 C9CF 2C61  6940 7666 F85F AF95 5AA2`
`876A B05B 96F9 1740 2A6F  76EF 53ED 2ECA DB85 8875`
The answer is none of them.  But how would the user have concluded this, without either (1) trusting a web site and the CAs that vouch for its certificate, or (2) actively curating a PGP WOT and keyring?
If the assumption is that most users don't use PGP correctly, then you're basically forcing users to go with (1), so there's little real security gained by distributing the key fingerprint online.
On the other hand, if users know that the current signing key is paired with the name `bitcoincore.id` (or whatever), they can at least propagate the name out-of-band through non-Internet channels (like conversations with other non-PGP users).
As points out, the "semantic integrity" of the system (i.e. how you would know whether or not `bitcoincore.id` is really controlled by the core developers) comes from binding proofs-of-authenticity to the name.  For example, a signed video recording of the devs at a well-attended conference stating that the name is `bitcoincore.id` would be a good start.


This would work too.  Except, Bitcoin doesn't do this today, which is why this topic came up.

**Neither names nor PGP key fingerprints are proofs of their authenticity**.  The **only** way to convince someone that a key is actually the Bitcoin key is to provide sufficient evidence that it came from the Bitcoin developers.  The goal of a practical, secure naming system is to make it easy to discover this evidence (which is what Blockstack aims to do).
I am not suggesting that the Bitcoin Core devs drop everything and replace their existing PGP WOT system with Blockstack.  I think the point was making was that Blockstack can help non-PGP users verify binaries while providing similar security guarantees.  That's not saying that PGP or deterministic builds or signed commits are useless; it's saying that there's space to make them more approachable.
points out that Blockstack has a lightweight protocol that spares users the effort of fetching the entire blockchain.  While it is true that the security reduces to relying on SPV headers and obtaining a particular cryptographic hash, we have taken steps to make this as painless as possible:
* If you altered your name record *after* the record you want to verify was created, then you already have a usable hash.
* If you have a friend who did so, then they only need to give you the block height and block offset which contains their transaction (at most 8 digits total--as easy to memorize as a phone number).  The client determines this automatically.
* If you can trust a quorum of servers, you can obtain their latest hashes via the usual DNS+TLS route.
As documented in the link, the recommended mode of light client operation for those fortunate enough to have a spare computer is to run a Bitcoin node and a Blockstack server locally and have it synchronize its signed hashes and signed SPV headers to a cloud storage provider (where you put this spare computer's public key on your other computers as a one-off installation step).  Assuming network partitions are short-lived, this gives you the same security as running a full node and Blockstack locally on each other computer while amortizing the cost of maintaining the chain state across the set of devices that rely on it.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure I'm boring you at this point, so I'll bow out now.

Blockstack can do this.  It lets you pair a human-readable name to an address.  It runs on top of Bitcoin and is fully decentralized.  It's been running in production for 2+ years.
