If you can do some programming Textmagic has an API [with wrappers for a number of languages](  This covers the SMS part, and you would just need to grab the bitcoin price from another API.
Textmagic is a paid service, so you would pay a small fee per text. Think about $0.04 per text within the US.

On that topic the problem which I can't provide the answer to, is that I don't need to send myself back through time, only run a script to send some light down a fibre optic cable in a previous time.  It would require the smallest wormhole, but probably requires a massive ammount of energy. It's frustrating because the task itself can be acheived in a few lines of code :p
