Desantis, who is claiming all these wild things was the founder of a company called 21e6 and has been publicly obsessing over e8 theory on twitter for a few months. It's a pretty wild coincidence, but absolutely could be just that.

How hard would it be for someone to make a block with two additional zeros? Is this something that happens frequently? 
The block before and after also have the two additional zeroes as well and have been excluded from the hype.

The most interesting thing about all of this is that Andrew Desantis is one of the founders of earn.com - which was previously named 21.co - which before THAT was named... **21e6** 
Pair that with the fact that Desantis has been openly speaking about e8 - a simplified theory of everything revolving around an 8 dimensional superstructure - Something I believe is taken semi-seriously as an alternative to string theory. 
So the guy who started 21e6.com got super into a physics theory called e8 while building a quantum computer over the last few years. 
His partner is the first person to have noticed the 21e8 block and tweet about it. 
Not saying the correlation is exceptionally meaningful, but the coincidences here are semi interesting.

Grab Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopolous - It's a very in depth book about the history, genesis and technical ins and outs of BTC/crytpocurrency. I knew nothing about BTC but the basic concept before I picked it up and got a really good base of info to work from. 
There's a lot you can do in this space without knowing code. Connect with people, offer time to projects you are interested in and don't be afraid to say "I don't know". 
This is one of the most accepting spaces for people who WANT to learn and grow. The lines are drawn quickly though, as most people only WANT to learn how to get rich.
