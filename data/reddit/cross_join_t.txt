Why is Bcash advertising itself as Bitcoin? We know that is fundamentally not the case because otherwise you wouldn't have both on your exchange.
So I want you guys to actually do either one of two things.
1) Remove bch from your exchange as they are openly fraudulent in trying to steal marketshare through name confusion and outright lying.
2) Or, since you obviously care about your money, remove bitcoin.com and block explorer on your webpage and educate those who visit.
Otherwise, in the future, you'll be digging yourselves a hole in being dishonest and fraudulent as complacent in misinforming your customers."

So what next? We go buy into bytecoin with no proven history and a even worse white paper that time travels?
Monero? Etherium? Litecoin?

**This should be higher up.**
I cannot trust any program that imports my private keys, it fundamentally weakens my own security on the core chain. 
I guess if I had to dump a fork, I would immediately transfer my funds from my bitcoin wallet to another one at the same time to avoid what ever forker taking them...It would be kind of annoying given the transaction fees but the dumped fork can pay for it, I wouldnt really mind.
Bcash for example is like  but it reeks of shitware.

Multibit recently froze my fucking wallet even when the correct password was put in.
It is a bug and a bitch to fix, save your wallet words!! (THey are used to create addresses, so if your wallet is fucked, you can always generate the private/public keys.
