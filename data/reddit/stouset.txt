Still more transactions per second than the entire Bitcoin network.

The *overwhelming* minority make money from day trading. The rest lose money. Even when they “make” money, they’re usually losing money compared to a buy-and-hold strategy. Even when they are doing better than a buy-and-hold strategy, they’re almost inevitably performing worse on risk-adjusted returns — meaning the second the market turns for the worse, they lose their shirt. 
Anyone can “make money” day trading in a market that goes up by 2,000% in a year. It’s virtually impossible not to no matter how poor your trading strategy is. And such situations are prime breeding grounds for fools.
Thinking *you’re* the special snowflake 5%er who’s going to beat the market with your $5,000 life savings because you read cryptocurrency subreddits while dicking around at your day job (e.g., most of this subreddit) is foolish, full stop.

Day traders are fools regardless.

Are you really expecting sound understanding of personal finance from members a cryptocurrency subreddit?

Literally all of you are just making up numbers. There is no analysis, no justification. Just magical beliefs that BTC will be $3,300, or $10,000, or $11.
I have no words. 
Edit: If any of you had the slightest ability to predict a market with this much volatility, you would be millionaires many times over, making 5-10% gains every few *days*. Instead you're making random trades in a bull market and attributing any gains to your brilliance (when most of you are doing *worse* than the market with your trades). 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:13:37
Pretty much.
Combine this with a raging bull market during which it's virtually impossible to lose money, and the positive reinforcement of every idiotic behavior imaginable produces exactly what we're seeing here. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:37:24
Not if you limit yourself to echo chambers like this subreddit.
And if someone, somewhere is doing that analysis to extract value, then either you have to do it better than them, or the opportunity is no longer effective.

What part of predicting future movements of a market one has already failed to predict makes you think OP has any idea of what they are doing?

Lack of learning from those mistakes.

It's like nobody here understand why or how markets actually work, and have only cargo culted the concepts of day trading without even realizing there's anything else.

We've just somehow managed to get them all in one subreddit, which is impressive.

I'm not angry in the least. I'm absolutely in awe of not just people's lack of financial sense in this sub, but also their incredible capacity for actively resisting anything resembling financial sense.
Making trades based off gut feelings is gambling, plain and simple. The fact that Bitcoin has gone up a thousandfold in five years has allowed virtually anyone with any gambling strategy, no matter how absurd, to make profits — it is genuinely difficult to lose money in a bull market (not that many here haven't done their best to try), and this has been the mother of all bull markets. Those who've played the price prediction game have almost inevitably made less money than a simple buy and hold strategy (such as dollar-cost averaging).
The bull market *will* come to an end some day. And all of these people will lose their shirt when they find out the hard way that they have no financial or investment sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:36:45
They're not estimates. They're fucking made up bullshit.
Let's be honest here. OP didn't do analysis, crunch numbers, or make predictions about future market events that would result in a price change. OP likely doesn't even understand how any of these things might affect the price anyway.
OP came up with a number that "felt right", and posted it. I'd bet OP made trades based on that gut feeling too. OP has the financial sense of a grapefruit.

The heat on shuttle reentry is, as mentioned, from atmospheric compression. Friction plays an *extremely* minor role. This is why the heat shield is on the bottom side of the shuttle, and not the sides.
This compression also doesn't really last long enough to do much total heating. For instance, meteorites are actually cool to the touch if picked up immediately following reentry. A thin outside layer becomes scorched, but nothing deeper than a few mm (IIRC) gets wa at all.

Fundamentally, no remote wallets really support 2FA either. The *web interface* might require it, but if an attacker gets access to the wallet files directly, that isn't going to mean much. 
If someone gets access to your local box, you're boned anyway. When you log onto you online wallet of choice, you establish a cookie-bases session. The attacker can simply send that cookie to himself, and use it as if he/she were you.
There are further mitigations for this, but in general this is a complicated topic where you have to consider lots of attack vectors and take a bunch of overlapping half-measures. Anything you do server-side can be worked around by a sufficiently-motivated attacker with access to your customer's boxes. And these sites are high-profile targets with *lots* of sufficiently-motivated attackers.
The local attack approach *is* simpler, though. It's really hard to evaluate the comparative risk between either choice. My original point was to counter the notion that online wallets are some sort of panacea. They aren't. And personally, I would wager that moderately-competent person (who is unlikely to contract malware or conducts transactions from a dedicated, bitcoin-only machine, and backs up their wallet religiously) is probably safer storing their wallet locally. OTOH a minimally-competent person is probably fucked regardless, which is one of my primary concerns with cryptocurrencies in general.
Cash is conceptually pretty simple and has a well-known, limited threat model. Cryptocurrencies combine the crazy threat models of the internet with the overwhelming complexity of cryptography.

As somebody who *actually* works in these types of businesses as a security engineer, you have entirely too much faith in their competence.
Security and reliability are hard, and there are an order of magnitude more engineers who *think* they know what they're doing than there are who actually do. And thinking you know when you actually don't is insanely dangerous. Those who are competent are frequently hampered by decisions by the people running the business that aren't in the users' best interest. If they think they can make an extra buck by skimping on top-tier engineers, a backup strategy, and/or security measures, they will. 
Yeah, the blockchain.info guys "should" know how to get this stuff right. And maybe they do. But odds are they don't, and there's not much of a way as an outsider to know the difference.   
Trust only yourself. You have the most to lose by your wallets being lost and/or stolen. They don't.
