Then that will mean my returns on my 60gh miner are almost going to be nothing in a few months. It will just about make it's money back before it's too late. Lets hope it's not the same with these. Now if only I could pay on credit card that would make life easy ;) Good luck with your mining.

Thanks I'll take a look at that. I can get a miner interest free then for 18 months ;) 
My other plan was to put it into poker (888) and then withdraw it on a debit account ;)

Have you got a link about the chip testing?

Mining is not making a good return right now. I have lost money when compared to just buying BTC for the same price.

One more quick question. Are you ordering the miners overseas, for example I want to order to the UK I just wondered what shipping you paid and if you had to pay the added USA tax that it shows on checkout.

I wish I could do the opposite and change bitcoins for GBP in any small shop. That would make my life easy.

It is at an amazingly high price right now. I was thinking it might be a bit late in the day, I think I will definitely reduce the amount I do put in to maybe closer to $3000.

There is no way you will get your device before the protection runs out. So does this mean you will cancel your order? You only get 45 days.

Obviously there is a danger that this won't work out. But the risk vs returns is a game you play with any investment. I would be able to recover if I lost it all but it's a dangerous game and if the price fell there may be some element of panic selling. To counter that a lot of people might buy if the market crashed.

I did it from my credit card not my account. The order was processed on the 7th of Jan. 
Edit: talking to some of the fraud specialists at work and they seem to think that claiming through my credit card up to 12 months should be enough protection.

Great, nice to see they are honouring refunds then. CAn I ask why you cancelled?
