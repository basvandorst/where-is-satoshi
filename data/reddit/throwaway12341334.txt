well if you want those services, you have to pay.

Yes. I saw a one that had a URL to a website I thought was religious.
I visited the website and ironically it was a satire book about religion. I even bought the book and it was actually quite funny. Even more funny was the comments on amazon, some religious nuts bought the book and didn't know it was making a mockery of their religion LOL.

freemium business model
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:48:09
yeah but everyone knows that public sector workers get sweet benefits. Private sector is mostly eliminating those benefits.

which bank offers bitcoin escrow services?
@_date: 2014-05-08 04:32:09
very good point.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:52:28
Wouldn't that just force the person into the underground economy?
@_date: 2014-04-27 07:54:02
Has anyone actually been prosecuted for it though? and actually went to jail for it?
@_date: 2014-05-01 06:38:48
a 3rd party service could be created to issue credit based around bitcoin. Obviously it has some challenges for the potential developers of such a service but it could be done.
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:48:41
If you read the patent, it talks about alternative currencies like WOW gold and second life dollars. If I'm not mistaken, aren't those forms of money still property of Blizzard and the second life company? You aren't allowed to buy/sell for real world money since they aren't your property. There is a reason ebay no longer allows these types of transactions. If WU plans to do this type of exchange, I can see them getting a lot of flack for it. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:35:03
Yup and it is nothing innovative. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:48:47
The only thing that does is raise the prices for everyone...by whatever the average bank charge charge is. I shop at places that only take cash and the prices are indeed cheaper.
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:43:16


It does if the crypto is centralized.


Of course they are at fault, it is their product after all and they need to make sure their product is not being used for malicious purposes. Most likely, they would be required to make it such that they aren't facilitating such transactions. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:40:56


True, people are generally very risk averse. 


Not exactly. Often times there is also a lot of propaganda going around and lots of reassurance from the government that, "everything is okay." That causes people to ignore warning signs. It is only the skeptics who get out in time.
I know in Argentina when inflation ran out of control, the government implemented many currency restrictions. It was so bad that bitcoin over there was selling at a 25% premium and even then no one was willing to even accept the Argentine pesos because of the currency controls. It is in situations like that where bitcoin will reign supreme, at least with bitcoin you have the potential to at least maintain the value or increase it. With the Argentine peso, you will lose 40% in one year.
[here is a video on it](
oh and BTW, the inflation over there is still out of control so for 2014, they'll be getting another 20-30% hit.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:56:09
What happens if they think you own 50 million in bitcoin but you lost the keys or they were mistaken (ie. they weren't your bitcoins)? You're pretty much screwed I guess?
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:41:57


you can use escrow services, by the way.
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:59:00


All forms of money are experiments. When something better comes a long, the old money eventually phases out as being used as money and the new money is used. This has occurred dozens of times throughout history. Eventually fiat will be phased out and replaced. Same story for cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:02:56
You can buy them but you need time machine first!
@_date: 2014-05-01 06:32:22
6% fee? I guess they are going after specific people.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:32:28
No, actually, I went to the website to see what it was all about. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:14:23
The point I'm making is that if companies spend money on advertising then they are throwing it away. I know they think it will attract customers but for me, it is annoying and therefore I would avoid such companies that engage in advertising.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:44:37
You should start. I was the same way as you but then I realized you could save a boat load of money when you pay cash. The trick is to always ask the merchant if there is a discount for paying cash. Some places will give you like 5-10% discount. From what I hear, it is because they pocket the cash and don't report it in their accounting books (to avoid paying tax). 
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:55:45


Uhh, no they can't because of money laundering and, "know your customer" laws. That's why bitcoin is superior. It doesn't matter what the law is, you can do as you please with bitcoin and the feds can't do anything about it.
What do you think would happen if a dark website like silk road started accepting amazon coins? Amazon would probably get slapped big time by the DEA/feds.
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:10:04
Yeah, so it is kinda deceptive but then again everyone is getting equally screwed so I guess it is fair.
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:53:28


They should be. That way they can move over to bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:47:48
At best, it will be a centralized crypto like facebook credits or ebay bucks. They probably won't go as far as actually making mining functionality and the such. They'll just control the block chain and let the amount of the coins float with how many people want to buy them. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:39:14


and how does that affect bitcoin? nada. There is a reason companies spend millions on annoying ads. Most people are pissed by it but some will be interested in the offers and buy the products. Same story for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:38:12


Just because they paid for it doesn't mean it isn't annoying.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:39:14
I see lol. I've torn lots of bills in my days, they aren't exactly durable...
@_date: 2014-04-30 05:38:21
hahaha, true, true.
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:30:45
Well at 100k/coin and 21 million coins that comes out to 2.1 trillion. Now lets factor in all the coins that have been lost permanently due to human errors and also that we will only have about 16 million coins mined in 2 years time. That comes out to less than 1.6 trillion market cap and the market cap is less when you factor in the lost coins.  
Sure, it is a stretch but it is possible. For it to go to that amount, it will have to be very popular and widely used around the world.
@_date: 2014-05-08 04:31:19
I guess that could work. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 07:46:37


some kind of mutilation?

If he can get other nutjobs to catch on to bitcoin then it is all good. Nutjobs tend to be rather vocal about issues they are passionate about.
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:52:38
People see this is as bad news. I see it as a positive for bitcoin. I welcome all undesirable businesses to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-01 06:50:31


The customers still end up paying for it, the merchants just mark their prices up 3% for everyone who shops there. Where I shop, the prices are even lower than WalMart and Target because they only accept cash and they pass those savings to customers. Remember, there's no such thing as a free lunch: you're paying for all those protections.


If you want those services, then you can use escrow and pay for it.


It is good news. Just think of all the people who will start reading up on bitcoin simply because they notice all these headlines about bitcoin. Most will not be interested but some will and those people are the ones who end up growing the utilization of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:58:59
It will be no different than a gift card.

Absolutely. Any software not open source should be assumed to be insecure.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:34:29
Another tip is you can go on craigslist and find some generic item that is popular, like an xbox one or something. When you post in the ad list two prices: one in fiat and the other in bitcoin. Make the bitcoin price 25% cheaper than fiat price. You'll get a decent amount of emails asking what bitcoin is etc. and some idiots trying to buy it at the bitcoin price with fiat. I have a generic response email stating that I prefer bitcoin because I've had troubles in the past with people giving me fake cash etc.
and who knows how many people are just browsing and notice the ad.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:29:51
Only if you film it and call yourself a porno actor.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:51:58
Honestly, it is amazon, a greedy corporation. Of course it is going to be some sort of retarded gift card coin.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:48:06
Don't listen to those idiots. If 100 people see your message and 99 reject it but one person actually learns about bitcoin then it is a success. 
Honestly, just think about how everyone of us learned about bitcoin in the first place. I learned about it because someone mentioned it to me in a comment. So I looked it up and was instantly intrigued by it. Read everything about it learned as much as I could. I liked it so much that I bought ~1000 bitcoins for $9 each.

bitcoin offers those in the form of 3rd party services. That's the brilliance of bitcoin: you can build whatever 3rd party application around it as you want. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 07:48:43


You know what I think is intrusive and rude? Bill boards, commercials on TV, commercials on radio, and the annoying ads on websites.
