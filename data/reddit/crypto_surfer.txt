Solution: Just need to update the Bitpay App on the phone and it supports the new Payment URI format.
It's surprising that Bitpay didn't bother to mention this information on their article or provide an update option within the app stating that a new feature is available or reply to the Support Ticket.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:39:04
Why do you think the fee is so high?
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 124,300 satoshis.
The average BTC price at the moment = 16900 USD
This would mean, the average transaction fee = 21 USD
Yes, if you are sending small amounts in BTC, this fee is still high however for larger amounts, the fee is reasonable.
This is a known problem and nothing new.

Would be interesting to see some more specific stats around this to understand how many people did it take to generate an X number of crypto currency. The numbers in the article are not specific.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:02:01
Yes, that is what happens when a large part of the community is focusing only on the Price aspect and not how we can make Bitcoin Better. The reality is that the Transaction Fee is very high in Bitcoin Network for real world usage, the transactions are slow as a result.
So, the community must invest more time to solve these problems and come to a consensus rather than debating prices all the time.

If you are completely new to Mining then I would suggest you to go ahead with Cloud Mining.
Note: Cloud mining will charge you an extra maintenance fee (because they are running the hardware for you). But then it will save you the time and effort of maintaining it. Cloud mining is still profitable (even at current Bitcoin Difficulty).
Regarding profitability calculations, you can use the following online calculator:
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:59:41
That's a wrong assumption then. Because that's exactly my question too. Why is Bitpay giving that error when I am selecting a Bitcoin wallet and trying to make Bitcoin transaction? It has nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash. Also, note Bitcoin Cash Payment URIs begin with "bitcoincash:" string and not "bitcoin:". Two different things. Look at the Bitcoin Payment URI I have mentioned.
Just an FYI, I am not new to Bitcoin or Bitpay wallets. I have been into this stuff since 2011 and understand the protocol too. It's a flaw with the recent changes they have made and I contacted their support as well.
Anyway, I thought there were people who had a better idea than me here.

If you are using Bitcoin Core Client, then you can go to Help -&gt; Debug Console in Bitcoin Core Client. Then type in the command: listaddressgroupings and it will give you a list of all the addresses in your Bitcoin wallet which were involved in transactions since the time you created it.
And you can use blockchain.info to look up each address and gain a better understanding of the transactions made.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:03:16
Here are the answers to your questions in sequence based on my opinion:
1. According to me, any time is a good time to invest in Bitcoin because it's still in very early stages.
2. You can store your bitcoins either in a wallet where you control the private keys or you can store them in an exchanger. In your case, you would most likely need to first purchase some coins using your money. So, you need to sign up on a reputed Bitcoin Exchanger, verify your account, deposit the money in it and then buy the coins. Once you have bought the coins, you can choose to transfer the coins to a wallet on your Computer or Smartphone or keep the coins on the Exchanger itself (although I would advise to transfer the coins to your own wallet).
3. Yes, Bitcoin is indeed the best option when it comes to Crypto Currency. Please note that there are more than a 1000 cryptocurrencies out there. Some of them might even appear to have a rise of more than 50% in price. But that doesn't mean they are more reliable. I would suggest that if you are investing money, then do so into reliable crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:58:45
You should pay twice the fee for such an Evil Transaction ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:24:06
Good suggestion. Since, one of the most common replies I receive from people who are new to Bitcoin is: "It's too expensive. I can't afford to buy 1 Bitcoin".
People usually think in whole numbers unless you are a born Mathematician who thinks in decimal places :D
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:58:47
It is all wishful thinking.
While I can't say what would happen in the short term, I do know that in the long term, BTC price will at least be 10 times of what it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:45:38
Yes, that's a good method. You can confirm on another device. It can be another laptop or a mobile device. If the Browser on another machine is not infected, then you can compare the addresses.

It says in the article "“This tells one simple story; the main risk for Bitcoin comes from external factors such as regulatory intervention and security breaches which might hit the credibility of the entire protocol and its effective usefulness as a method of payment/store of value,” Bianchi explained to me."
Really?? When was Bitcoin hacked? I cannot recollect Bitcoin being hacked? The hacks are not exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin Protocol.
If a Bitcoin Exchanger or a Cloud Mining service gets hacked, that does not mean a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol was exploited.
Mainstream media really needs to talk to some people who actually understand Bitcoin and Cyber Security.

The first two attributes you mentioned above automatically override the last one.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:00:29
You will get free coins corresponding to the new currency (in this case, b2x). As long as following conditions are satisfied:
1. If your coins are on an Exchanger and this Exchanger supports the new currency.
2. If you own the private keys corresponding to those coins. It's always advisable to store your coins in your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:05:58
Agreed, if you are into Bitcoin for the long term, would be advisable to store coins in a wallet where you hold the private keys. Also, with this, you get easy access to any free coins which are generated as a result of the hard forks.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:02:22
It's not about the number of Wallets. It's about how secure each wallet is and how securely you have made the backups of the wallet and the keys.

Yes, just need one more opportunity just like every other time haha
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:47:28
I'll put it this way. Had someone asked you the same question back when BTC was at price: 4.5K, what would have you said?
In short, there's no specific answer to this. If you truly believe in the concept and power of Bitcoin, you would know that it is still in it's very early stages and gradually gaining mainstream adoption. If I were you, I would take the profits I made earlier and invest them back into Bitcoin.
However, this is your money and you should decide for yourself how, where and when to invest it.

Yes, you can buy small amounts of BTC as well. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. However, one thing you need to keep in mind is the extra fee charged by the gateway through which you are purchasing BTC. For instance, if you are using a Bank or a Debit/Credit Card, there will be an extra fee deducted for purchasing Bitcoins. So, eventually the amount of coins you buy would be less than what you expected.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:13:07
Was this screenshot cropped before being posted here or this is the original screenshot you have?
Moreover, it is easy to identify the Exchanger or mining pool.
Each Exchanger or mining pool would require you to sign up using an email address. So, I would suggest you to go through email history looking for Exchangers or Bitcoin related sites you signed up with.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:06
Buy through a reputed exchanger in India such as Zebpay.
Note: Indian Exchangers are trading Bitcoin at a value much higher than the value of BTC at International exchangers.
Regarding storing Bitcoin. The method does not depend on the country you reside in.
The golden rule is, always store the coins in a wallet for which you own the private keys.

Of course, yes you can claim your forked coins even after you move your BTC to a new wallet. In fact, that is the right way to do it in order to prevent any replay attacks.
Note: You claim your forked coins from the old wallet and not from the new wallet.
The way you claim your forked coins is to re-use the private keys exported from the original wallet. Then a new fork-compatible wallet will use those private keys and check your balance on the blockchain at the time of the fork to know how many coins need to be granted to you. And you will be granted those many coins.

You call 300 TH/s as a small miner? :D That's a lot of speed. Is it 300 TH/s with cloud mining services or you own the ASIC hardware yourself? Also, with that kinda mining speed back in 2013, it's a very high mining speed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:42:43
Transaction Fee for a given transaction depends on the Size of the Transaction. Fees is calculated as X number of Satoshis/byte.
So, the bigger the size of the transaction, higher will be the fee.
Another factor which plays a role in the transaction fee is how soon you want your transaction to be confirmed. For instance, if you want your transaction to be confirmed within the next 2 blocks itself, then you would need to pay a higher fee as compared to a transaction which can get confirmed within next 5 blocks.
There is actually a way to calculate the transaction fee.
fee = (num_of_inputs * 148 + num_of_outputs * 34 + 10) * price_per_byte
num_of_inputs = Number of Inputs of the transaction.
num_of_outputs = Number of Outputs of the transaction.
Note: Some wallets today are already capable to dynamically adjust the transaction fee.
For those wallets which do not have this functionality, you can use websites such as,  for this purpose.

If you are not convinced in the Technology of Bitcoin, then why are you asking everyone here for advise about re-investing in a technology in which you don't believe in?
Sounds like you just want to make a quick buck without even understanding what you are investing in.
If you are so certain that this Technology is similar to other bubbles observed in the past, then feel free to think so. But then, why ask others what you should do?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:15:28
Few options that come to my mind:
1. Please post your transaction ID here if it is possible.
2. You could take the help of some miner who can help confirm the transaction.
3. There are actually some online services which help to confirm unconfirmed transactions, especially those which were sent with a low fee.
