guys, this is how the fee market is supposed to work. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:59:09
yes but more inputs means a larger transaction size in bytes. fees are based on the size of the transaction. so the amount saved would be minimal 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:03:29
serious question, if you were in Bitpay's shoes, what would you do?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:20
if i ran my own node how could i upload my btc to LN? and i'm assuming that it requires an on chain transaction to get it on there?
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:38:06
the banks and payment processors are REQUIRED to know who you are
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:09:44
I hope so too,...can I send a future transaction from the 2020 address that will send it to someone else in say 2021?
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:23:59
Just curious, why zipped?
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:01:27
Great! If someone gets it working I'll pitch in
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:25:50
This is great news. Is there anyway to use Airbitz locally on my phone without making an account with them? I use Mycelium now and like that I have 100% control over my wallet/funds.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:03:03
Cool! I'll check it out when I get home
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:36:04
Same here...emailed support and it showed up the next day...when's the app coming out?
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:42:34
Awesome! I was weirded out when the first step after downloading the app was "sign up"
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:59:50
If this guy comes up with a working script I'll pitch in for that20 but not sure if I trust him haha

Coinbase merchant app supports this. The user can pick from 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or a custom %. No option for a flat Bitcoin amount, though.
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:40:31
That's why I want to do one at a time...I can't imagine losing everything in one shot...
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:46:36
so cool!

Thanks, I've sent coins to test wallets, and back to coinbase no problem. 
Is there a way to verify that the private key that bitaddress.org generates matches the public key? Like, what if I send coins to the public address and then go to move them later and it isn't a match?
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:32:00
I love it but not the winner 100 bits @_date: 2014-12-18 17:19:57
I can direct transfer no prob
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:27:31
$7.00 u/changetip exactly what i was looking for thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:34:17
If I was Bitpay I would enable as many coins as I could for payment; if your business was processing payments, why turn away business? 
Sure, make Bitcoin the default option, but couldn't there be a "pay with different coin" option right below it. The effects would be twofold...more customers and less congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain. A win win.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:14:56
Very rarely when I buy on coinbase, it sometimes says they don't have enough, and to try again later. Do you think the same could happen when selling, as if too many ppl are selling at that moment will they cut it off?
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:47:21
Where are they located? I just bought 50 yards for my garden...would love to pay in bitcoin next fall
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:55:42
Thanks everybody for your help. I'm going to make multiple wallets with smaller amounts in each one.
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:37:44
Wow this is fucking cool thanks! I'll be back at 6pm
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:33:23

Or maybe I don't even need to spend $300? I haven't computer shopped in a while there are some really cheap Core2 Duos...
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:08:50
just tipped the first article on your site. really cool that it shows how much the article has been tipped. perhaps put the button next to the facebook/twitter buttons...then people can say "hey, this articles been tweeted 5 times, liked 10 times, and tipped 600 bits. Even tho its not a lot $ wise, 600 sounds like a lot and might get people interested in seeing what it is. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:28:38
let me try that again $7.00 @_date: 2016-03-05 16:33:33

no man everyone still uses newgrounds duh
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:36:11
but isn't bitcoin defined by the miners? whichever fork has the majority hash power is bitcoin; the other is the altcoin
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:24:47

How do you know he didn't sell it already?
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:22:50

best one in the thread
@_date: 2015-04-06 01:20:59
I put it up. A few months ago near the jukebox. Glad someone finally got it!
@_date: 2015-04-06 01:21:33
Great idea!
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:46:10
Cool, thanks! Wish I could buy the beer at mews with the tip! Soon...
@_date: 2015-11-12 21:17:18
Wow, I don't have a link but I think I side with the bitcoiner. It appears he was selling Bitcoins for a cash deposit in his BOA account. Probably LocalBitcoins. 
Cash was deposited, bitcoin went to the buyer. Here's the problem.
The LBC buyer "sold a truck" to some other guy, and instructed him to deposit the $ into the bitcoiners account. There is no truck. Scammer just got his bitcoin bought by a guy who thought he was buying a truck. Genius.
Feel sorry for the guy on the show.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:19:14
I sorted it out and they promised to credit my account the difference by end of day...
What would happen if someone didn't catch something like this...something wouldn't balance out at the end of the month for the bank...do you think they would be able to figure it out?
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:08:27
Definitely 
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:24:01
That's kinda what I thought...
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:52:49
i think they frown upon that
