**Bitcoin Messiah Patrick Byrne’s Medical Leave Could Rattle Blockchain’s Future**
Overstock.com CEO and chairman Patrick Byrne has taken an indefinite medical leave of absence from the company, a decision will be felt most among the worldwide community working to advance bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain.
Byrne has a long history of medical problems after a long bout with cancer nearly 30 years ago. Due to the cancer and related heart problems, Byrne says, he has undergone more than 106 surgeries over the last three decades. And in the last year, he has battled a recurrence of Hepatitis C, which he first contracted on a visit to China in the early ’80s. “I’ve been really gutting it out over the past few months,” he says.
His decision to take a leave of absence from Overstock—a cut-rate online retailer based in Salt Lake City, Utah—will be felt most among the worldwide community working to advance bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain, the vast digital ledger that underpins the digital currency. Guided by Byrne, Overstock was the first major retailer to accept payments in bitcoin, and perhaps more importantly, he led the creation of an Overstock subsidiary called TØ.com, which uses the blockchain and related technologies to build services that can track the exchange of financial securities.
In discussing his leave, Byrne expresses little worry over the health of Overstock, but shows considerable remorse because he is unable to continue his work with the blockchain, referring to its rise as an “extinction event” for the financial industry.
Running atop a network of independent machines spread across the globe, the blockchain was originally built to oversee the exchange of money, using cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions. But it can also track the exchange of anything else that carries value—including stocks, bonds, futures, and other financial securities—and thanks to those same cryptographic algorithms, it can do so without the oversight of any one central institution. Much as the blockchain can drive a money system outside the control of any one government, it can also juggle stock outside the control of any one bank.
“It provides a database that can be shared by multiple entities who have different economic or political agendas and therefore don’t necessary trust each other,” says Gideon Greenspan, the CEO and founder of Coin Sciences, another company that’s exploring blockchain applications that extend beyond bitcoin. “There’s no central gatekeeper checking all transactions that come in, saying what’s valid and what’s not.”
In many ways, Byrne has aimed to remake Wall Street.
Byrne and Overstock started work on their blockchain system almost two years ago, and this past December, after months of back and forth, the SEC approved the company’s plan to offer public shares via the blockchain. The idea is that the company can issue shares without the help of Wall Street. Byrne envisions other companies IPO-ing through the same system—going public in a more democratic way. But this system can handle other assets, too. Overstock has already issued private bonds on the system, and TØ has built a separate service that oversees stock loans.
Many others are exploring similar technology—even some within Wall Street establishment. Nasdaq OMX, the company behind the Nasdaq public exchange, is building a system that uses the blockchain to oversee the market for stock in companies that are still private. And a wide range of big-name banks and tech companies have put their weight behind an open-source project called the Open Ledger Project, or Hyperledger, which aims to build new software that operates much like the blockchain. But Byrne has long been out in front of this online revolution. In many ways, his efforts have aimed to remake Wall Street, and now, the big Wall Street names are trying to remake themselves before they get left behind.
Byrne has a long history of pushing for reform on Wall Street. Overstock was among the first companies that went public under what’s called a Dutch Auction, which lets the market set the price for an IPO, not some big Wall Street bank. In working to offer stock over the blockchain, the company is taking this idea even further.
His leave of absence casts some doubt over Overstock’s blockchain ambitions. But Byrne says he will recommend that general counsel Mitch Edwards, who had been closely involved with the development of TØ, now serve as the company’s interim CEO. Byrne feels a certain sadness that he will not be part of effort for the foreseeable future, but he’s adamant that Overstock’s effort will continue apace. “I’ve worked really hard,” he says, “to get this revolution going in the right direction.”

Realize that cryptocurrency transactions are "push" transactions, not "pull" transactions, as credit card transactions are. The retailer does not "pull" whatever amount he desires from your wallet. You have to "push" the amount out, so the scenario you describe cannot happen, except if you make a mistake. It's like a cash transaction. If you are prone to making mistakes, deal only with reputable retailers that will work with you to resolve problems.

Is it true that, currently, trades among cryptocurrencies (crypto-for-crypto, e.g. BTC &lt;=&gt; ETH) do not trigger a taxable event, due to the "1031 Exchange law"?
[Notice 2014-21]( issued by the IRS discussed the handling of exchanges of "virtual currency" with "other property", but treated all virtual currencies as a unit, leading me to conclude that exchanges of one cryptocurrency for another do not trigger a taxable event:




However, I have seen tax advisors here on reddit state matter-of-factly that such transfers do trigger a taxable event, so I'm confused.
Now, I learn that such transfers are exempted by a law I've never heard of: the 1031 Exchange law.
What's the right answer? Do exchanges among cryptocurrencies in 2017 trigger taxable events?

CAUTION: TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS
Scenario  is that neither of you understand how BTC is transmitted. If your friend sent you **two** codes, I fear that one of them is his *private* key, and one is a public address derived from that key. Think of the public key as the slot in the top of a piggy bank that allows someone to insert funds into the piggy bank. The private key is like the key that allows the owner to remove funds from the piggy bank. The private key must be kept **PRIVATE**! Anyone that knows it can drain the account!
Scenario  (not likely) is that your "friend" is sending you an address in hopes that *you* will send *him* funds.
You need to supply your friend with the public key to your account so that he can send funds to it.

Correction: The blockchain is not the database; the database exists elsewhere, presumably in a publicly accessible location. The blockchain contains a virtually unhackable signature that is publicly available, that proves that the publicly accessible database content is genuine.

It is not known the exact date of Jesus' birth, but it can be deduced that it would have been in the fall/winter. Early Christians were under persecution, and chose the pagan winter solstice holiday of Saturnalia to celebrate, because they could celebrate openly at that time.

Use bitcoin as your savings **and** spending vehicles.
This comes up a lot. "Why would anyone spend bitcoin, if it will be worth more next month?" The same argument can be used against fiat: "Why would any merchant accept fiat, if it will be worth less next month?"
You spend BTC because you want to buy something. The merchant accepts fiat because he wants to sell something.
If appreciation of BTC encourages you to save, i.e. to defer gratification, that's a good thing. But you still want to buy things, both the necessities and the not-so-necessary (do you really *need* a wall-size TV?) Buy them with BTC.

A bitcoin transaction can have some data, I believe it's 40 bytes, that can be anything. This allows you to place a **signature** (which is merely a cryptographic hash of whatever data, of any size, you wish) on the blockchain. This constitutes **proof** that you "own" that data. It is not the data itself, but rather a signature that proves that you are the rightful owner.

Two of the shortcomings you identify (  are problems at the fiat/bitcoin interface. These are not the fault of Bitcoin, and will cease to be a problem in a Bitcoin economy. Meanwhile, they are no more of a problem than they are in a fiat-based economy.
 If you don't want to secure the bitcoin yourself, there are plenty of third-party solutions, but then -- once again -- you are in the same situation you are in with fiat. But at least with Bitcoin, you have the option.
 The two options you suggest -- cash and CC -- each have serious disadvantages. Cash can't be transmitted across borders worldwide in an instant. Credit cards expose your identity to massive hacks (Target, Home Depot, and most recently UPS).
 Although it is true that, like cash, bitcoin is a bearer instrument that makes transactions irreversible, that fact has both advantages and disadvantages. Bitcoin puts the responsibility back in my lap, which gives me control.
 Choose a wallet without fees. Right now, a Bitcoin transaction should cost less than 5 cents.
 Your only valid point. Hopefully the Bitcoin ecosystem can overcome this, in a similar way to what happened with the internet.

Anyone can create an alt-fiat currency... did you consider that? Why don't alt-fiat currencies destroy the established fiat currencies? It's the phenomenon dubbed the "network effect". Once a leader establishes itself, it is very difficult for it to be overtaken. This is why HTTP is the protocol of the internet, even though there are superior protocols. This is why the Intel microprocessor is the leader, even though the Motorola architecture is superior. This is why altcoins such as Litecoin and Dogecoin are sinking.

In the first paragraph, I'm pointing out that just as there are currently "haves" and "have-nots", there will be the same in a bitcoin economy. Some will be wealthy because they are in the right place at the right time: I consider that I have an above-average intelligence (a "gift" I didn't earn, just like the riches some people are born into), and some will be because hard work and wise decisions earn them their wealth. So, a bitcoin economy will have disparities, just as our present economy does. The advantage with bitcoin is that it affords efficient and nearly frictionless funds transfers, even across international borders, and it is an excellent store of wealth that is immune to forgery and inflation.
I believe that I have a responsibility to use whatever wealth I obtain, whether it be by being born into wealth or intelligence, or through diligent effort, for God's glory, which means for the benefit of mankind as He desires.

Unless you're really paranoid about banks, just put your private key in a safe-deposit box.

If you don't leave a way for others to access your private key in the event of your demise, the bitcoins are lost forever.
This is something that too many people overlook. There are **two ways** to lose your bitcoins: theft and simple loss. Everyone worries about theft and few worry about loss.

The author says:


There is no tendency for most people to buy or sell at the wrong time... there can't be, and here is why: in every transaction, there is a buyer and a seller. One of them is making what will turn out to be a "smart" transaction, and the other a "not-so-smart" transaction. So the tendency, on average, is null.
Beyond this, "buy/sell low/high" is incorrect. You really want to buy when the commodity is *about to* rise in value, and sell when it is *about to* fall. When it has just risen/fallen 20%, is that a sign that it is overbought/oversold and will now fall/rise, or is it an indication that the commodity will continue its ascent/decline? One agent in a transaction will make what will *turn out* to be a wise decision, and one a foolish one.

No, the rights are *truly* inalienable. But just because someone has these rights, that does not mean that someone else can't (wrongfully) violate them.
This is the reason humans naturally form governments -- and even gangs, for that matter. But there are governments/gangs that secure these rights, and governments/gangs that violate them. We need to strengthen the former and conquer the latter.

I don't see this idea as something for a cell phone to handle, but rather for a processor like Coinbase or Bitpay. It sounds like great idea, but I see one issue: the hash-of-hash must resolve to the same result to which the blockchain will finally resolve. I don't see any way to guarantee that.

No, mining would suddenly become unprofitable for *everyone*. No one who is mining for financial reasons would continue (unless to prevent of the loss of future revenue if bitcoin crashes). Moreover, I think there are limits to the size of the allowed change, so it may take even longer for the difficulty to equilibriate.
Believe me, I am heavily invested in bitcoin, developing a hardware wallet, and want to see it succeed for ideological reasons. I am not trying to spread FUD -- I am truly concerned that the next halving could be a big problem and want to see something done to avoid it.

Mining injects about $15,000 worth of new coin into the economy every 10 minutes; sounds like a lot, but it's pretty small when compared to the economy's current size. When the rate of injection suddenly halves, I doubt that it will cause a large shortage in supply of bitcoins for sale, so market price should remain fairly stable. I don't think the price will spike (double!) in order to maintain miner support, so miners will drop out. If the number of miners drops significantly, it will significantly impact the new block creation rate and the difficulty adjustment rate.

Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come. It, or its successor altcoin, is going to change the world of money.
That being said, Bitcoin has its drawbacks, which may cause some altcoin to succeed it some day. There is the 51% attack problem; there is the 60-minute verification time; there is the size of the blockchain; there is the large amount of capital &amp; energy spent (notice I didn't say wasted) on mining; there is the fact that huge amounts of bitcoin are in the hands of a small number of early adopters.
If you are asking whether Bitcoin is a good investment, know that it remains an extremely risky-yet-promising option. Don't invest what you can't lose.

Merchant adoption only puts pressure on the bitcoin price if it causes people to purchase with bitcoin they already possess, as opposed to going out and getting more bitcoin. I think it's not accurate to say that merchant adoption depressed the price, but rather simply that owners of bitcoin unloaded it. They could have just as easily sold the bitcoin at an exchange and depressed the price.

kleer001, you are not considering the sheer impossibility of those molecules falling together, even once. Consider the fact that there are "only" 10^80 particles in the entire known universe. Quantum mechanics tells us that a second can "only" be chopped into 10^44 pieces, known as "Planck times", and there are "only" 3 * 10^19 seconds in a trillion years. so in a trillion years, no more than 3 * 10^(80+44+19) events can occur, "brute-forcing" 10^143 = 2^475 trials, which can find 475 bits of information. A single protein contains thousands of bits of information, and 300 proteins are needed for simplest life.
This is exactly my point. You do not apply the same analysis to origin-of-life probabilities that you do to Bitcoin cryptographic probabilities.

Bitcoin has several advantages:
* It permits direct transfers of funds from one person to another, with no middleman (bank). This eliminates the need to trust this third party, and eliminates the fees that they charge.
* It cannot be forged/counterfeited! This is not true of any fiat currency, or even gold.
* It cannot be inflated at the whim of any government or bank. Inflation occurs when the quantity of a currency is increased, either by simply printing more (or doing the equivalent electronically), or through a process called fractional reserve banking. Find out more about this [here](
* Transactions cannot be reversed -- they are final. Once a merchant receives bitcoin funds, they cannot be taken back without his permission.
* It has the essential qualities that a currency must possess, some to an extent never before seen. It is divisible to any extent, it is completely fungible (every bitcoin in indistinguishable from every other in value), it is portable as no non-cryptocurrency is, since it can be sent anywhere as easily as an email or text message (imagine the problems sending $10 million in gold to Zimbabwe).
* It obviates many of the needs for banks, since you can safely keep your money yourself (once you follow some important security guidelines).
* It does not require identification of agents in a transaction, thus eliminating the major cause of identity theft.

People today just don't have a grasp of how unlikely low-probability things are, and I think it is because the public has been told something far more unlikely occurred — life arising spontaneously from non-life — by the scientific community, for 150 years.
A bitcoin private key contains 256 bits of information, which means that it is "computationally infeasible" to discover it by "brute force", i.e., random guesses. Yet, the simplest proto-life we can possibly imagine requires at least 300 proteins, each of which requires several hundred amino acids, each of which requires four bits to specify. This is tens of thousands of bits of information, yet we are casually told that it came together by chance. Never could have happened!
Here's a more common example: if you thoroughly shuffle a deck of cards, how many times do you think that your specific permutation of cards ever existed in the past, with all the times that cards have been shuffled in casinos, at Friday-night poker games and in computer card games? The answer is: NEVER! The number of permutations of a deck of cards is (52 * 51 * 50 * 49...), which is 52 "factorial", or 52! for short. This number is (8.0 * 10^67 ), or (2^225 ). This represents 225 bits of information.
If you gave a *TRILLION* people (more than have ever lived) a *TRILLION* computers each, and had those trillion trillion computers shuffle cards a *TRILLION* times a second (every picosecond) for a *TRILLION* years, you would make 30 million trillion trillion trillion trillion (3 * 10^55 ) brute force attempts. Your chances of hitting a specific permutation would still be one in a *TRILLION* !
That's with 225 bits of information. A Bitcoin private key has 256 bits.
TL;DR: Life did not spontaneously arise from non-life; no deck of cards that ever existed or will exist matches the randomly-shuffled deck in your hand; and a Bitcoin private key cannot be discovered by brute force.

All that is true, but no one seems to be concerned that *all* of our online activities are subject to these threats. We speak as though there is no cost for CC transaction fraud, but *someone* pays for it, and it's not the CC companies. They simply pass the cost to the merchant, who passes it to you, the customer.
In fact, it would be good if everyone saw the real cost of CC fraud, just as it would be good if everyone paid his payroll deduction, so that the impact would be felt. My son left his CC in his unlocked locker at the gym and had it stolen. Thieves succeeded in stealing several hundred dollars in goods, and the CC company covered the loss. No pain.

The bitcoin is simply your knowledge of a secret number (your private key). The value exists because everyone in the bitcoin economy agrees that this knowledge has value. Because it is validated by cryptographic methods and the blockchain, this system has proved to be virtually un-hackable (un-forgeable).
"So," you ask, "why does it have value?"
It has value simply because it is rare, and something that no one can create at will. Think about it: what if gold was as common as water; would it have great value? The answer is no! If water becomes as rare as gold, I would gladly trade any gold I possess for a drink of water. Water is far more useful (valuable), even life-sustaining, than gold. But because I can simply turn on the tap and get as much as I need, water is not valued.

Let me ask you, then... according to your sources, how much information must there be in the first living cell's DNA, in order to contain the genes that specify the proteins necessary to perform metabolism, cell division, transcription, etc.? The sources I have read report that no cell has been capable of living with less than 600 genes (determined by "zapping" genes until the cell dies), and scientists theorize that a living, metabolizing, reproducing cell requires an absolute minimum of 300 genes. Do you agree, or do you have evidence to the contrary?
For example, the ribosome, the nanomachine that that reads an mRNA "paper tape" and constructs a protein according to its recipe, and is thus absolutely critical to maintenance of life, requires some 50 proteins to construct.
If a cell truly requires 300 genes minimum, this represents many tens of thousands of bits of information. It can be easily shown that even a *single* gene requires over 500 bits of information, and could not possibly, ever, in any realistic amount of time, have occurred by chance. That's just *one* gene.

What I'm saying is this: governments *always* form. They are absolutely necessary. Let me give an example.
If you were going "out west" in the "wild west" days, you would join up with a wagon train (a form of government). You would agree to come to the aid of others in exchange for their pledge to come to yours. Now, you don't need the wagon train to give you the right to safe passage, but you do need it to give you the actual safe passage itself. That's what governments do, and that's why they *always* form. They are absolutely necessary.
I too am an American citizen, and I too am very concerned about the direction in which our country is headed. But I readily acknowledge that I am deeply indebted to the vision of our founding fathers and the blood spilled on battlefields to secure what I have been given.

No, I don't think you are analyzing this correctly. Let's say you manufacture a widget, and it costs you $90 to produce, and you are able to sell it for $100, or $10 profit per widget. Then suddenly one day (and you know the day is coming), no one is willing to pay more than $50, half as much, for each widget. Would you manufacture half as many? No, because it still costs you $90 to manufacture. You would stop making them entirely until the market adjusts and makes it profitable once again.
Now, in the Bitcoin case, the buyers would adjust (the difficulty would drop), and eventually the purchase price would rise (actually the manufacturing cost would drop). But the immediate effect is that **every** profit-motivated miner would stop mining, because it costs more than it brings in. No one, except ideologues running small-time operations in their basements, would mine for a period. And the fact that most are not mining will exacerbate the problem: time to find new blocks will increase, and consequently the time between difficulty adjustments will also increase.

Mr. Harrigan,
Thanks for your informative article published at coindesk.com.
I wonder if you would like to comment on a cryptocoin network topology that I find very interesting. I wrote a [white paper]( on it about a year ago, dubbing it Zapcoin, and have since refined it somewhat.
Essentially, this network would assign a duotrigesimal (base-32) address to every node. A 2/4/6/7-digit address would serve a 1K/1M/1G/32G address space, respectively. If every node were linked to every other node whose address was identical in every digit except one, there would have to be 62/124/186/217 links from each node to other nodes. This is a large number of links, but it means that, even in an address space of 32Gnodes, every node is no more than 7 hops from any other node, with abundant redundancy.
I think that an alt-cryptocurrency could be built on this concept, and each node could keep a real-time copy of the Ledger (a table of all nodes and their current balances, as opposed to a Journal, a table of all transactions, as Bitcoin's Blockchain is) that is brought to full consensus every few seconds, so double-spending could not occur.
Your article introduced me to the concept of a "Small-World Network", and I think my suggested topology creates the smallest-world network possible. The [Wikipedia article]( on the small-world network suggests that these networks tend to have "hubs", but my suggested network has no hubs -- all nodes have the same max number of links to other nodes.

I don't understand. The central question is, if the price of BTC drops by 50%, who loses? And if the price of BTC doubles, who wins?
It looks to me as if I am basically getting out of bitcoin if I send them $100 worth of BTC and they credit me with $100. It seems as though bitcoin becomes irrelevant to me, since Bitreserve holds "my" bitcoin and insulates me from the risk.
Also, no one has mentioned the risk of holding fiat, which is in my mind significant.

If you're thinking parents have kids for financial gain, forget it. It's estimated each child costs his parents around $80,000. Most parents have kids for a different reason... let's call it love. Or perhaps a desire to have a positive impact on the next generation.
A parent that is missing that love ingredient can totally destroy that young life, without ever laying a hand on him. With love, the parent can mold him into a strong, compassionate, influential member of society.

Couple of points:
# Currency inflation, by definition, does not change total purchasing power; it just takes more money to buy the same goods, but there is just that much more money in the system. The problem is, the government is printing the new money, so it gets added purchasing power at your expense (almost as if you had been taxed). Pure inflation simply means that goods cost X% more than they did, and you get X% more money in your paycheck. The wealth transfer occurs because it is the government that gets all the added money.
# What you are describing with Bitcoin is *de*flation. More and more users are trying to obtain a stake in an economy that has a fixed amount of currency, so the value of each unit must increase to accomodate the increased demand, which raises the market capitalization appropriately.

I would like to see some thought given to the repercussions of the next reward halving event. Even though the halving from 50 to 25 bitcoins went without even a hiccup, I'm concerned that miners' profit margins before the halving in 2016 will be so slim (say 5%) that many miners will pause operations after the halving rather than operate at a loss (5% profit would turn into HEAVY loss of perhaps 45% [edited], the amount dependent on the how heavily electricity, cooling and maintenance factors into operating cost). If a large number of miners pause operation (say 95%), then the hash rate would plummet (down 20X), causing new block generation time to skyrocket (again, 20X to 3 hours 20 minutes) and consequently the time to the next difficulty rate adjustment to soar (20X to 40 weeks). To make things worse, there is a limit (I don't recall the value) to the factor by which the difficulty rate can change in a single period, so it could take several adustments before the new block generation time returns to ten minutes. I know that critics say that miners will take this into account and adjust accordingly, but no one ever says what they can do to adjust. It will be profitable right up to the halving and then suddenly be very unprofitable, so that only ideologues (and a few with free electricity) will continue mining at the huge loss.
If you disagee, please don't just downvote... explain why this would not occur.
The solution would be to adjust the reward value more frequently and in smaller amounts so that miners would smoothly adjust.
Please, I am heavily committed to Bitcoin's success and I would like to see this issue addressed.
EDIT: If it is not clear how this could happen, consider the following scenario:
Before the next halving, we might expect that the typical miner is reaping a 5% profit. That means that for every $100 he spends on operating cost, he receives $105 in rewards, for a $5 profit. Immediately after the halving, he will still need to spend the same $100, but will suddenly receive only $52.50 in rewards (remember, the difficulty is not yet adjusted), for a net **loss** of $47.50, or an ROI of -47.5%. Who will continue to mine at a loss like that? And who would stop mining earlier, when a profit can still be realized?

I remember the first time I transferred a significant quantity of bitcoin. Even though I had already researched the cryptographic underpinnings and understood the math, I was very afraid that something would go wrong. I had the same feelings the first time I donated blood, or jumped out of a plane (it was my first-ever plane ride!). Bitcoin is *not* 100% safe from hackers and scammers. But neither are you safe from identity theft. You should never execute credit/debit card purchases online, have an online bank account or trading account, or a thousand other things you routinely do online. You shouldn't even *own* a credit card. Don't you know that identity theft occurs every day, and that much that is stolen cannot be recovered or reimbursed? Even reputable identity protection outfits start their ads with the disclaimer that *nothing can prevent all identity theft!* I'll bet that doesn't prevent you from engaging in these risky activities.
And why is that? It's because, if you want to do more than hole up in your house, you're going to have to take risks (even "holing up" has its risks). I could (should?) be dead by now, with some of the risks I've taken. And, yes, I've lost money to criminals on occasion.
My point: We often prefer the devil we know to the devil we don't know, and complain about the risks of a nascent technology, while swallowing whole the risks we take every day. While much remains to be done to make Bitcoin safer, it's getting to where it's almost as safe as the financial vehicles/instruments we use every day.

No, not 2X of its *current* value, but 2X of its value *just before the halving*. If it were to rise, say, today, it would strongly encourage new miners, due to the fantastic profit. But the difficulty would simply rise to compensate until, once again, it is only marginally profitable to mine. See the problem? The value would have to rise exactly at the halving event, or the difficulty will rise to meet it. Otherwise *every miner* will experience negative ROI immediately after the halving event. Only a few miners who are willing to lose money by mining will continue -- the rest will pause until the difficulty drops, which will cause the solution time, and hence the time to difficulty adjustment, to go way up.

The first ATM in Brazil that performs operations with bitcoins will debut at Campus Party this year.
 The machine will be installed in the startup event Bitcoin Market, one of the Startup &amp; Featured Makers, part of the Campus Party will give the opportunity to young and innovative 300 companies exhibiting and selling products and services , exchange knowledge and attract investors.
"We know the bitcoin virtual currency is a complex and few people understand how it works. And that ends up driving people away. We want to take this machine to show how this money can be used in the real world," said Rodrigo Batista, CEO of Bitcoin Market.
Second Baptist, the machine will only make the conversion from Real to bitcoin. The user must insert the money in the ATM, advertise your bitcoin code (QR Code) reader and to complete the transaction for your virtual wallet.
For each transaction, a fee of 2.5% will be charged and there will be a limit of 100 dollars per transaction (or $50).
According to Batista, the version of ATM will be used is manufactured by Lamassu and there are only 14 more similar models around the world.
"We know the manufacturer during a bitcoin conference in San Jose last year. At the time it was just a prototype, but we kept in touch and they developed a specific model for Brazil. In December it was finished and import the model that will be used at Campus Party," said Batista.
The machine will be displayed throughout the event in the free access of Campus Party and after that must be installed in a commercial center of São Paulo in place yet to be determined.
Campus Party 2014 will take place from 27 January to 2 February, at the convention center at Parque Anhembi, in São Paulo. The INFO will be present and will also feature a booth Infolab on site.

It's the same idea. If your interest is in *using* bitcoin, not *speculating* in it, then this allows you to fix your price (reduce/eliminate risk) in exchange for sacrificing speculative opportunity (reduce/eliminate gain). This is what merchants and investors want.

Bear in mind that losses occur with any currency/commodity. There are surely billions of dollars' worth of dollars, gold, silver, and other currencies that are lost forever. Because bitcoin has a ceiling on the amount created, this loss reduces the amount that actually exists. But as 'eldido' pointed out, that simply increases the value of the bitcoins that others hold. Bitcoins are incredibly divisible (even if each bitcoin were worth a million dollars, a Satoshi would be worth a mere penny), and the protocol could adjust if that were ever not sufficient (I hope that occurs!).

A critic of my scenario replied last time I posted that this will not be a problem, because miners who use "expensive" electricity will simply sell their rigs to miners using "near-free" electricity.
But I contend that this shake-out of expensive electricity users will already have occurred by 2016, and only near-free users will remain. Even the near-free users will be barely eking out a small profit, due to the difficulty adjustments. ALL the miners will be paying very little for their electricity, but still they will be operating on very narrow margins.

If you are a profit-driven miner, what would you do to manage the situation? It makes no sense to drop out early, since there is profit right up until the halving event. After the halving, your expenses are the same but your income is half. If your expenses were 95% of your income before the halving, they become 190% after. There is no way to manage it that I can see.

No matter how you figure the cost of electricity, by 2016 only the most efficient miners will remain, and even they will be operating on narrow profit margins (because the difficulty continues to adjust). Suddenly, at the halving, their ROI goes from +5% to -45% (see the discussion above). They can cut their losses by pausing mining until the difficulty readjusts, but the sudden drop in hashing power will cause a concomitant rise in difficulty adjustment time.

Some comments:
* This guy doesn't understand the difference between owning a large percentage of all the bitcoins and owning a large percentage of the mining computing power. The fact that one individual owns a lot of bitcoins gives him the power to manipulate the market, which is dangerous, but he can't divert the blockchain.
* The author doesn't seem to understand the *need* for proof-of-work or the problem it solves, comparing a simple shared database with the costly and slow blockchain concept.
No system will eliminate evil. The internet, for example, is a wonderful innovation that we now need for everyday activities, and it prevents many old forms of crime, but it introduces a whole new set of crimes (e.g., identity theft) that were once non-issues. The same will be true for Bitcoin: it will solve many, many ills and create some new ones. But as with the internet, the day will come when we can't imagine a world without it.

Another effect that may be even more significant than the costs is the opportunity it provides for regulators to selectively target individual licensees. As we know all too well from the NSA and IRS scandals, Big Brother can have political agendas, and it is exceedingly difficult to monitor, detect and prevent abuses.

I frequently hear it said that merchant adoption depresses the price because merchants turn around and convert the coins to fiat. But I don't see that, unless one assumes that the buyer is using his coin without replenishing it. I doubt that people that are buying with bitcoin are basically "selling out"; they are simply utilizing the bitcoin econo-system. I would assume that they are constantly purchasing bitcoin to use at sites such as Overstock. In fact, this commerce is exactly what we need to establish the bitcoin economy. When bitcoins are actually used, the buyer and seller always have extra "bit-cash" on hand to facilitate purchases.

The problem that Satoshi was addressing by setting up a mining algorithm with exponentially decreasing inflation was: "who gets to own the bitcoin?" He could have owned it all at the outset and sold it off to newcomers (this is what pre-mined altcoins do), but then it truly would have qualified as a Ponzi scheme. Miners get a stake in Bitcoin and at the same time perform a necessary service.

Although I do not in any way think that bitcoin is either a Ponzi or pyramid scheme (and I am heavily committed to bitcoin's success), I don't think that one can tell if bitcoin was instituted to be a scam without "getting into the head" of the author. If his intent was to reap profits off of later adopters (as is the case of some altcoins), it could have been intended as a scam, but I am sure that Satoshi fully intended to invent a new kind of currency that did what other digital currencies tried and failed to do -- be a trustless form of money that did not depend on a central authority for its operation. Its stupendous growth in value is simply due to the necessary expansion as it seeks to satisfy the needs of its users (with plenty of speculation to boot), and it will grow plenty more before it reaches maturity.

This video ignores the fact that government (at least, a representative form of government) is in fact the people it governs. When it exacts a tax, that tax us used, ostensibly, for the benefit of the people at large. It doesn't (primarily) tax by force; it is given the right to tax, and the right to use force to enforce, by the people themselves. Those people can also revoke that right from the government.
Of course, of course, of course, the system is not perfect... far from it. After all, it is administered by people like you and me, who naturally tend to look out for our own interests over the interests of others. So, it requires constant vigilance to keep it on the right course.
All I'm saying is that government is the remedy societies *always* fall back to for administering on behalf of the common good. There is no other option. But a good democratic government requires an educated and involved politic to stay on the right course.

I still think that bitcoin mining is inflationary. Consider what would happen if anyone who wanted to could "create" some bitcoin by giving the USD equivalent of bitcoin's current price to, say, his favorite charity. It would cost the creator money, so he would not stand to gain, but it would still increase the amount of bitcoin in circulation and therefore depress the value of a single bitcoin. That's essentially what happens to miners. They buy electricity and "waste" it, and that allows them to obtain an equivalent amount of bitcoins.

It's only assuming that bitcoin value has reached steady-state. You're right -- if bitcoin is strongly increasing, it may not have reached the point where new mining players are discouraged from entering the fray.
But consider the fact that, unless mining ROI is 50% or greater just before the halving event, it will be negative after the event. The price of a bitcoin would have to *double* to compensate for the halving of the reward.

National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) warns the general public that virtual currencies, such as the so-called. Bitcoin are not national currencies, and therefore do not fall under national regulations. European legislation, including the Slovak law does not define and activities related to the virtual currency. Such activities are not regulated and supervised by the National Bank of Slovakia or the European Central Bank. While NBS notes that except for the issue of euro banknotes and coins by the National Bank of Slovakia under the rules applicable in the euro no person, and no individual in the Slovak Republic shall not issue any notes or any other coins, the unlawful manufacture money and putting them into circulation is a crime.
In this context, public NBS also points out that virtual currency have not a physical counterpart in the form of legal tender and participation in such a scheme virtual currency at your own risk stakeholders. Exchanges or purchases of virtual currencies represent their own business risk investors and investors' money are nothing protected. For the payment of any refunds for losses caused by these exchanges or purchases there is no legal entitlement.

Thanks for supporting this discussion.


True, but what can they do? perhaps some players will not purchase mining equipment right before the halving, but everyone will continue to use equipment they own right up to the event. In any case, mining will be marginally profitable before the halving, and profits will be swamped by costs after the halving. The only way I see that a disruptive event can be avoided is if profit is &gt;50% before the halving; it will then be &gt;0% after it.


I'm not so much concerned about the effect on the exchange rate; I think the problem will be a disruption in the equilibrium between difficulty and hash rate. if the hash rate takes an abrupt and severe dive because profit-motivated players go offline (perhaps to altcoins) until the difficulty readjusts, the block creation time (10 minutes), and the difficulty adjustment time (2 weeks) could soar.


True, but there are 104 difficulty adjustments between halving events. That's a lot smoother. I'd like to see something like that rate of adjustment in the reward value.

And I'm not even discussing how the chemicals assembled, but rather the mountainous amount of information that had to assemble by brute-force trial and error, measured in tens of thousands of bits. A Bitcoin private key is a paltry 256 bits. I'm afraid that you are victim of the very misunderstanding that I am addressing here.

I think you're right: someone is steadying the market. That's a good thing, and I think that the operator, who must hold a lot of bitcoin, sees that it will benefit him (and us all) if the volatility is reduced. But that is a dangerous thing to do -- if he sets a price that is too low, he will sell all his bitcoin attempting to artificially supply resistance. If he sets a price that is too high, he will be forced to buy bitcoin in an attempt to artificially supply support.
In the end, the market will have its way and determine the price, but it's nice to have a big fish supplying liquidity.
Thanks, big fish!

No, you're not taking into account that **everyone** loses money right after the halving event, not just half of the people. Unless some miners continue to mine at a loss for ideological reasons (and a few will), everyone would stop mining.

You don't understand. The website would mention nothing of ECDSA, public/private keys, the blockchain, or math. It would simply **shout** that it's giving away huge sums of money to anyone who can identify the order of the cards in a deck of cards. Everyone is familiar with a deck of cards, and few understand the staggering odds against a particular sequence of cards occurring.
Do you realize that, every time you randomly shuffle a deck of cards, you produce a sequence that has ***never*** before existed, and that you could safely bet your life on that fact?
The buzz would occur on facebook, twitter, etc., and some would think they can get rich quick by simply making tons of guesses, eventually hitting paydirt. Of course, experts would appear to explain to these people that their efforts are futile.
In the process, Bitcoin would gain a modicum of trust and understanding from the masses.

Did you know that the average number of (harmful) mutations per individual per generation is now estimated at 100? This situation is called by geneticists "error catastrophe". There is no way for 100 harmful mutations to be eliminated, when the next generation after that will have 100 more. Sorry, but if your hope is in this world, it is falling apart and so are you and the generations to follow. My hope is elsewhere.
Example: allergies are caused by hypersensitivity to substances that are not an actual threat: dust, grass, pollen, shellfish, penicillin, sun, animal hair, corn, fruit, themselves (autoimmune), etc., etc. These represent cases where the immune system is falling out of tune and reacting to everyday elements of the environment.

If the GBTC price is trending towards parity with the underlying bitcoin price (and it is, and it should), then it would behoove year-long holders to exercise their one-time option to sell before the price falls further. They can turn around and re-buy new GBTC shares, or buy raw bitcoin.

This is no different than the situation with cash. Every day, coins are dropped into the sea, and bills burn up or are otherwise forever lost. The same is true for bitcoins. The fact that *some* are lost does not mean that eventually *all* will be lost. The amount lost, measured in bitcoins, will exponentially decrease and remain a fraction of the total in actual existence.
Unlike, cash, though, no more will be minted (beyond 21 million). All that means is that those in existence will gain value so that the total in existence continues to maintain parity with the value they represent.

For the umpteenth time, here is someone who is going to solve the world's problems with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going to solve the problem of wealth inequality -- exactly how? Some early adopters are already bitcoin billionaires, while most of the world, 99.99%, have no bitcoin at all.
Bitcoin is not a panacea. It is a new and very useful protcol. Like the television, PC, internet, cell phone and youtube, it will solve some big problems and create others. For example, the internet solved many information dispersal problems, and gave us some new problems, like identity theft. Someday we'll all wonder how we ever lived without bitcoin. But the fundamental problem is not to be solved by technology. The problem is in the hearts of humankind: greed, corruption, avarice; what God calls sin. These things mankind cannot fully overcome on its own, but we all must continue to battle against it, starting with the sin in each of our own hearts.

Bitcoin has both an inflationary and a deflationary pressure on it. The inflationary pressure is the generation of 25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes (approximately). The deflationary pressure is caused by new participants in the Bitcoin economy, who need to buy from a fixed amount of bitcoin (except for the aforementioned mining reward). Currently, these two pressures are about equal, resulting in a fairly stable price. Apparently, new participants are buying about $1,700,000 worth of bitcoin per day, the amount being injected into the system by mining rewards.

This is one thing I don't understand. Above, idlestabilizer says


But why shouldn't I? A hash is only 32 bytes, and would not cause hardly any bloating of a block. I understand and agree with your comments about the sufficiency of a hash to verify the veracity of the data it represents. So why are we all concerned about people inserting big chunks of data in a transaction? Are they only inserting a single hash in an occasional block?

You're right, in that the difficulty adjustment process will eventually bring the system back to equilibrium. I'm concerned with the blocks between the halving event and the next difficulty adjustment. During this time, **every** miner will be operating at a loss, if they were operating at less than 50% profit before. I would estimate that miners reap a profit of, say, 5% at equilibrium (in other words, when profit is less than 5%, more miners are dropping out than starting up; at profit &gt; 5%, more miners are starting up than dropping out).
And, keep in mind that when the block creation time increases, so does the difficulty adjustment time.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:20:01

Sorry OP, but I see so many posters thinking that Bitcoin will solve the problem of the evil in man's heart. And the evil always exists in *someone else*: the bankers, the government officials, the corporate officers. There is never a problem in the heart of the bitcoiner. If bitcoiners had their way, corruption would cease.
This is just not true. Witness all the scams and hackers that Bitcoin has attracted. Bitcoin is a wonderful, revolutionary idea, and I hope it solves many problems in countries both poor and rich, and among dissidents, as it limits the overreach of government and banks. But just as the internet has revolutionized our lives and it is hard to imagine life without it, it also introduced new ways to steal identities and victimize the elderly, weak and ignorant.
Now, to your idea. Do you expect that cancer will be defeated in someone's garage? Maybe some dorm room student will have an idea that we don't expect, but in the meantime, people that dedicate their lives to cancer research need living wages and funds for the work. And they need to know that, even if another team eventually solves the problem, their family will still be fed.
I am sure there is some non-zero level of corruption in the cancer research community. But where can you point to, that has zero corruption?
We need government (but less of it), we need businesses, and we need organizations that conduct medical research (and get paid for their work).
Many researchers are people that have been personally impacted by the loss of a loved one to cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease, etc., and their passion is to cure that disease. Oh... and yes, there are fraudsters.

Let me just comment on one:
[4] Bitcoin is deflationary, and that's bad. Who would want to spend a bitcoin that will be worth twice as much tomorrow? Answer: someone who wants to buy something. Why would a merchant want to accept payment in dollars that will be worth half as much tomorrow? Why would I want to be paid in worthless fiat?
... okay, two.
[1] Finality and irreversibility if bitcoin transactions is a *feature*, not a *fault*. If you want your transactions to be reversible, make some arrangements on the side. In fact, bitcoin facilitates this (contracts).
I can't help myself. Three.
[5] The fact that central banks can't manipulate bitcoin is one of the most wonderful things about it (and probably a central bank is behind this troll's post). Manipulation of the money supply is the cause of every currency's demise, as monetary manipulators take the easy, nearsighted solution to a country's fiscal woes. Weimar Republic. Zimbabwe.

Consider the fact that the hardware will be useful to both the would-be seller and the would-be buyer to the same degree. No matter who owns the hardware, it will be run right up to the halving event, and then set aside until the difficulty adjusts. It's that interim period between the halving and the first difficulty adjustment that would be extra long and extra painful. I hope you're right that the hashrate will drop by no more than 50%. In that case, block generation would take 20 minutes and the difficulty adjustment would occur in 4 weeks. Seems unfortunate to leave the possibility of such an abrupt disruption up in the air, when there is no downside to having more frequent adjustments, other than the hard fork it would require. We should have the required coding ready, because some other problem could necessitate a hard fork anyhow.
[EDIT] Sorry, I just noticed that you said the buyer would be an individual who gets free electricity.
There's "expensive" electricity (urban NYC), and "cheaper" electricity (Iceland). Huge hashing farms are already sprouting in the "cheaper" locales, so I think it's safe to assume that in 2016 most hashing will be occurring in "cheaper" locales, so that the difficulty will already account for that. "Free" electricity only exists in student dorm rooms, and students that try to hash from their dorm rooms get a visit from the local SWAT team for suspected drug activity.

No, no, no. You are conflating the fact that early adopters can see large gains with a scheme wherein early adopters are awarded with the initiation dues of later adopters. The former is a situation in which *all* adopters gain, albeit that the early adopters see larger gains; the latter is a total loser for whomever adopts just before the house of cards collapses.

Even though Bitcoin could survive an internet failure via something like meshnet, the current blockchain would become useless. Consider the scenario in which miners still exist, but the hashing power suddenly drops to 1/1000 of its former strength. Suddenly it takes 7 days to solve for a block and up to 38 years (depending on how long it's been since the last adjustment) to adjust difficulty!

The "attack vector" that concerns me is not an attack at all; it's the next halving. Mining was profitable enough just before the last halving that mining was still profitable after it. If we are at an equilibrium point at the next halving (as we seem to be now), *all* miners will be losing money after the halving. Yes, the difficulty will drop to compensate, but not until a period is endured in which reward times drastically increase (could be 20X or more). This means that the time to adjustment, which is nominally 2 weeks, will also increase by the same amount, extending the pain. This is not good for a protocol that wants to be a stable, reliable currency.

It's not as bad as you portray. Orphan blocks can occur at any time, not just when a hard fork is attempted. It would be very unlikely for the orphan block to chain for even two times. But, if you have a very high-value transaction, it is recommended that you wait for six blocks before considering it final. That has always been the case.
After the hard fork, one or the other, the old or the new, will develop the longer chain, and will become the defacto standard. At each block, there can be a fork, as long as a significant number of miners are mining on both versions of the code. Eventually, one or the other group of miners will give up, because they won't be making money.

You are looking at transaction times from the perspective of the buyer. The CC companies give every advantage to the buyer so that he will insist that the merchant accept it. I don't know if this is still true, but at one time, merchants were not allowed to give discounts for cash if they accept CC's.
But it is quite a different story for the merchant. He doesn't see transactions clear for days. And they are susceptible to chargebacks for months.
With bitcoin, the transaction is FINAL in less than an hour. The merchant can immediately use those funds.

Is it the losses of funds and failures at various exchanges? If you look at the way Mt. Gox was run, it was destined to fail. Even today, in the "mature" credit card system, we have mammoth losses due to hacks at Target, Home Depot, etc., etc. Bitcoin's problems in the infrastructure (note that it's not in the protocol) are growing pains, made worse by the meteoric rise in popularity in 2013.

They don't need a transaction for each contract: they need a single transaction in each block, to allow them to verify chunks of contracts on an average 10-minute window. In fact, using Merkle Trees, everyone anywhere that wants to verify anything can be easily merged into a single hash that is included in a single transaction on each block. Anything more (any more transactions per block) is just wasteful.

I don't think that's the case. If all miners continued mining at a loss, the difficulty would drop by 50% at the next adjustment in (2 * 2 weeks), because the block creation time would have doubled.

No, pools would operate in the same way that they currently do. Think of it this way: a 1000x pool is identical with an individual miner with 1000x hashing power. Either one of them will simply find a solution in 1/1000 the time that a miner with 1x hashing power will. The 1000x setups will win 1000/1001 of the time; the individual with 1x hashing power will win 1/1001 of the time. Everything would be just as it should be.

That depends on how many miners are ideologues or willing to suffer a short-term loss for the good of the community. If everyone was only concerned about immediate ROI, everyone would quit, because everyone would be losing money until the next difficulty adjustment.
And don't think that if 50% of the miners quit, it makes it profitable for the other 50%; it doesn't. They will need to work just as hard, but the rewards would take twice as long to achieve, and that reward would be half as large. ...Wait a minute... does that mean that the profit would be (50%)^2 ?

First, the caption on the Risk-Reward Profile graphic reads,


Doesn't look like that's true, since Bitcoin only beat US Equities 3 out of 5 years. Minor error.
But more importantly, I don't understand the Correlation metric. It seems that, for purposes of balancing a portfolio, the *lower* the correlation is to other asset classes,  the better. I would assume that low correlation (actually, *reverse* correlation) would be a negative number. The lowest correlation was US Bonds to S&amp;P 500 (-0.69). The highest correlation was US Real Estate to S&amp;P 500 (+0.87). Yet both are colored red. Why? The correlations of Bitcoin to the six other asset classes were mostly negative (4 of 6), which is good, but I would think that even more negative correlations would be best. So why is "mediocre" correlation colored green?

I've been sounding the alarm that a serious jam could occur at the halving, as much (if not all) of the mining hardware suddenly becomes unprofitable. We need to implement a gradual reduction in the block reward. It would be simple to recalculate the reward on every new block, so the transition is smooth as silk.
Also, regardless of what actually happens, all the angst this event causes makes Bitcoin unfit for use as a currency.
On a more general note: would it not be possible to design a digital currency so that it awards a block to the miner who reports the lowest hash after 10 minutes, without regard for a difficulty level? This would permit a new block to be calculated at a fixed rate and eliminate all these problems with Poisson-distributed block generations. It would also solve a whole range of potential problems. For example, think of what problems it would cause if a major miner mined half the day because his rigs are solar-powered.

Because a restricted blocksize makes the fees unreasonably high, which makes the crypto unusable as a unit of exchange. Anyone who cares to use that crypto as a currency then abandons to a usable crypto. Those that abandon sell their old crypto, depressing that crypto's price.
Why would anyone hang on to a crypto that is only usable as a store of value when another is just as usable as a store of value, but additionally can be used as a unit of exchange?
Eventually the single-use crypto even loses its utility as a store of value as well, and dies.

I've heard people claim as much, but I don't follow the argument. There's nothing requiring that $1M be added to the market cap today (it just is), and nothing requiring some level of increase next year.
But the increase in market cap is entirely independent of whether or not miners sell their rewards. If they don't, then they are *effectively* buying them themselves.
Also, off-market transactions are similarly irrelevant. If the off-market transactions occur at a lower dollar price, the sellers are fools, because they can get a better deal on the open market. If they occur at a higher price, the buyers are fools.

I haven't been able to see how it is so useful, even if the Bitcoin blockchain is used to provide a powerful cryptographic consensus. Basically, a cryptographic hash of a set of data can be inserted into the blockchain and serve as an immutable "timestamp" on that data. But timestamp services have been available for a long time. So what's the big deal, other than the fact that no trust is required in the timestamp service?

Another interesting analogy...
The Muslim Qur'an was published by a central authority ("Uthman's Codex", compiled by the third Imam/Caliph Uthman, who destroyed the documentation upon which he based his compilation), whereas the Bible comes to us via 5,000 manuscripts in Greek alone (about 25,000 manuscripts when other languages, such as Coptic, Aramaic and Syriac are included), not any central authority. Those many manuscripts constitute a highly immutable distributed record, similar in many respects to the blockchain.
The Muslim claim that the Bible has been corrupted is hard to justify in light of the existence of this "blockchain".

It's the word **shouldn't** that would bother a market participant. They want as much certainty as possible.
Miners are not a monolithic group that acts as a unit. Miners might like to see the price rise before the halving (I'd like to see it rise *right now*) so that they will continue to see a profit after the halving, but market pressures will prevail then, just as they do now. If a miner starts hoarding coins to effect a price rise, other miners, as well as the general population, will step in and sell theirs to take advantage of the opportunity, thus stabilizing the price at then-current levels. It won't be until the actual halving occurs that there will be existential forces acting to raise the price, but then it's too late; profit-motivated miners will drop out until the difficulty drops, rather than operate at a loss. The difficulty won't drop for 2016 blocks, which would normally be 14 days; but because many miners drop out, the block solving time soars, causing chaos on the Bitcoin network.

China to allow more flexible currency to boost growth
The yuan in Shanghai is currently allowed to diverge up to 2 per cent on either side of a daily reference rate set by the People's Bank of China.

by Fion Li
China will allow the yuan to trade in a wider range against the US dollar, the State Council said, in a move that will devalue the currency and help bolster export growth.
Flexibility will be increased to support trade, the cabinet said in a statement on Friday that didn't indicate any timing or scope for the potential adjustment. The yuan in Shanghai is currently allowed to diverge up to 2 per cent on either side of a daily reference rate set by the People's Bank of China.
The band was last expanded in March 2014 from 1 per cent, and before that doubled from 0.5 per cent in April 2012. It was 0.3 per cent before an adjustment in May 2007. The yuan traded in Hong Kong fell the most in almost three weeks on Friday.
"The State Council is implying that the People's Bank of China should widen the trading band," said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "The authorities may allow the yuan to weaken to boost China's exports, if the PBOC reduces its intervention in the existing band."
The International Monetary fund's mission to China said in a statement in May that, although the yuan is no longer undervalued, it needs to be more flexible. China should limit intervention to avoiding disorderly market conditions or excessive volatility, the mission said.
Of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg in June, 14 forecast the trading band will be widened in 2015, up from eight out of 22 in a January poll. In a separate survey in the June 18-24 period, 11 of 16 economists predicted the IMF will add the yuan to its Special Drawing Rights this year.
China will improve the exchange rate's mechanism and expand the scale of yuan trade settlement, the State Council said Friday. The country will study starting more hedging tools for companies to deal with currency risks, it said.
"It doesn't mean yuan-band widening is happening soon, but that the PBOC can make a move since the State Council has cleared it," said Li Liuyang, a Shanghai-based strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "Yuan depreciation is positive for domestic demand as well as exports."
The State Council announcement comes as a private gauge of Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly fell to the lowest in 15 months, reinforcing the need for further policy support in an economy that had seen signs of stabilisation recently. Regional stocks fell.
The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index from Caixin Media and Markit Economics was at 48.2 for July, down from 49.4 the previous month and worse than all 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, where the median estimate was for an increase to 49.7. Numbers below 50 indicate contraction.
The release weakens the outlook for the world's second-largest economy, putting pressure on authorities to do more to meet Premier Li Keqiang's 2015 growth target of about 7 per cent. A slump in property investment and the recent stocks rout underscore the risks that remain even after policy makers stepped up support in recent months.
"The industrial sector has seen no sign of stabilisation yet," said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing, adding that most of the growth stabilisation last quarter come from the services sector. "The government should further step up the policy supports, including further boosting infrastructure investment and expediting the debt swap program."
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.7 per cent after the PMI report, heading for the lowest close since July 13. Australian shares reversed gains to trade lower. Chinese stocks dropped in Hong Kong, with the benchmark index falling for a sixth week. The Australian dollar dropped to a six-year low and the New Zealand dollar also retreated.
The decline in the manufacturing gauge contrasts with better-than-expected economic growth last quarter. China's gross domestic product rose 7 per cent in the three months through June from a year earlier, unchanged from the first quarter and beating economists' estimates for 6.8 per cent. Industrial output in June rose 6.8 per cent, while fixed-asset investment increased 11.4 per cent in the first half.
A surge in stock prices that helped boost financial services in the second quarter may have also masked weakness in the real economy, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Tom Orlik and Fielding Chen said in a report on Friday. The PMI slump strengthens the case for further stimulus, they said. The equity boom turned into a rout in recent weeks.
"A lot of entrepreneurs probably have invested in the stock market and now they have seen a significant loss," Liu Li-Gang, chief Greater China economist at ANZ Banking Group in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. "As a result business confidence has lowered. In the past, sentiment tends to have a lot of impact on this survey."
The Caixin gauge, previously known as the HSBC PMI, may diverge further with the official PMI in the second half of the year as the government's support measures will first help bigger companies and state-owned enterprises, said Everbright's Xu.
Much like last year, a sluggish start spurred more stimulus as the government orchestrated a debt swap for provinces and the central bank accelerated monetary easing. The PBOC cut the benchmark one-year lending rate to a record low of 4.85 per cent in June.
"The overall economy won't be that bad," said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong. "Meanwhile, it shows that China's economic recovery is still mainly helped by government-backed spending, and the private sector activities remain sluggish."

I grew up in one of the most liberal cities in the nation, Madison WI, and got my BSEE at the U of Wisconsin, so, yes, I know something about evolutionary theory.


I should clarify that evolution, defined as slow change over time, I acknowledge, and every example you are going to give me is of that kind of evolution. What I don't accept is common-descent evolution (from goo to you by way of the zoo). Did you know that geneticists generally hold that humans pass on about 100 mutations per generation? Almost every mutation, if not *every* mutation, is either neutral or harmful.
Give me an example of a beneficial mutation, and I will show you that it is beneficial because it *damages* some function of the organism and makes it more fit in a specific habitat. But mutations that damage the genome, even if they offer some situational benefit, can not be responsible for upward evolution from microbes to mammals to microbiologists.


Of course. Did you know that tricycles, motorcycles and automobiles all are made out of the same materials? And that all of their nuts and bolts have right-hand threads? Is that because they have common (or at least collaborating) designers, or because the automobile evolved from the tricycle?

No, last time the halving was barely noticeable. But that is because, I think, mining profits were high enough that mining remained profitable even after the halving. Note that there were some astronomical increases in Bitcoin price, and the difficulty was increasing at every adjustment. Now, the Bitcoin price has (kind of) stabilized, and the difficulty is sometimes adjusted upward, sometimes downward. Also, the hash rate has flattened. This indicates that there are no net entrants into the total mining pool. That means that the profit is low enough that it is no longer profitable to enter the pool, and as many drop out as enter. This means that a halving of the reward will make it unprofitable for *everyone* (unless they already own the capital equipment and electricity and cooling are essentially free).

When you "find" money in the house you own, it's not (or shouldn't be) the same as finding money on the street. Money hidden in your home becomes yours when you acquire (by purchase, inheritance or whatever) the home. Thus, it is part of the value of the home and should not need to be reported.
Money found on the street should ethically be subject to due diligence to attempt to locate the true owner, and if that fails, would be subject to reporting to the IRS as income.

I have long been concerned that the concept of a "halving" every four years causes uncertainty that is anathema to the financial market. Here is yet another example of someone raising a concern over the effects of the next halving event.
What will the halving event do to the price? Will it advantage one set of users and disadvantage another? Will the miner's profit at the halving be marginal (less than, say, 10%), such that after the halving, profit-motivated miners will shut down until the difficulty adjusts, but the time to adjustment of difficulty will soar because so few miners are operating? Markets don't like uncertainty.
Once again, let me suggest that the block reward should be adjusted more smoothly so that the effects of the change in reward are distributed over time, rather than occurring in one (possibly disastrous) event every four years. Properly done, this would have no effect on the 21 million number of total bitcoins eventually created, or the overall rate of creation.

I think there is a plethora of features that make bitcoin superior to gold. Let's name a bunch here...
Here is a summary (the first four are from Taariq Lewis' article)
* **Trivial to validate authenticity:** How do you know your investment gold is authentic? Most of us can inspect our gold with our eyes with small purchases and have a degree of faith the package was not tampered from refinery to gold dealer. However, at large scales, its very hard for gold investors to verify the authenticity of all their gold. Stored gold is always at risk and the authenticity checks are either hard or costly. Bitcoin’s authenticity is easily verified as bitcoin technology has built in authentication and verification. It’s impossible to forge or counterfeit a bitcoin.
* **Faster transportation and transmission:** As a gold dealer, we’ve found it very expensive to deliver gold and silver globally. In one case study, we were asked to deliver 400 ounces of customer silver and gold from the United States to Singapore. However, transmitting 2,133 bitcoins ((400 Ounces * $1,200) / $225 per BTC)) from San Francisco to Singapore to purchase gold took only 10 minutes. We think not many sophisticated gold investors are aware of this feature of bitcoin relative to gold.
* **More control of storage at large amounts:** As a gold dealer, we deal with large holdings of gold and silver. Storage of these holdings become increasingly difficult and costly at larger values as they require more resources to secure and manage. Interestingly, at larger amounts, bitcoin software requires the same security as at smaller amounts.
* **Investment security requiring less intermediaries:** Physical gold and silver in sizeable holdings require more individuals and organizations to deliver security and storage. Although these costs are quite low after years of specialization, bitcoin provides asset security with less need for intermediaries.
* **Known quantity:** The total number of bitcoins that can be mined has been preset at 21 million, whereas the amount of gold that can be mined is a more complicated question. 
* **Paper wallets:** Bitcoin is a better alternative than gold because owning real, physical gold is expensive to store and transport, while spending and storing bitcoin is effectively costless.
* **Divisibility:** They can be divided down to fractions such as one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. The smallest useful unit of gold is a gram for around $45-60 dollars. You can’t make gold change for less than that. If a Satoshi were worth a penny, a bitcoin would be worth $1 million, and the bitcoin ecosystem would be worth $14 trillion.
* **M of N Storage:** Protects against multiple threats without increasing risk of loss.
* **Never Been Counterfeitted:** And probably never will be.
* **Weightless:** A Satoshi weighs 0 grams; bitcoin worth $1 million weighs 0 grams.
* **Intrinsically Supports Contracts I:** Ownership can be programmatically and conditionally transferred.
* **Intrinsically Supports Contracts II:** Authority to spend can be distributed among multiple co-owners, in a variety of ways.

Bitcoin is designed to prevent accidental interaction by the same amazing cryptographic techniques that prevent malicious attack. You can't get bitcoin until some valid address on the blockchain sends you some.

Even if the calculations were identical and the private key (which you choose) is identical, the two networks still would not get mixed. If coins are sent from bitcoin, they won't be recognized on the other network (the sending addresses would not match) and vice-versa.
You just can't jump into the network, either accidentally or maliciously. You have to be sent bitcoin from a valid address on the network (as indicated in the blockchain).

I think that the difference between the first halving and the next is that we have reached an equilibrium point, so that miners are just marginally making a profit. That's why the hash rate has leveled off. There is not a monetary incentive for miners to expand or new miners to join. At he first halving, mining was still highly profitable, and remained so after the halving.
I know that the difficulty will eventually adjust and make everything OK. My concern is with the time from the halving event until the next difficulty adjustment, ostensibly two weeks later. I fear that the difficulty could take a half year to adjust (because the time between blocks soars), greatly exacerbating the problem.
But why put up with this huge impact every four years, when the reward can smoothly drop and avoid it?

No, think about it. It doesn't matter how many others drop out, the difficulty remains the same until the next adjustment, and it takes the same total hashes to find the solution. It just takes longer with fewer; the profitability remains constant (low).
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:44:40
Not so. The spread was due to the fact that you couldn't withdraw $$ from an account. This forced you to buy bitcoins to get at your funds, which artificially inflated bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:07:42
OK, tell me how you, as a miner solely motivated by profit, will plan for this event. Remember that if you are doing things at a short-term loss to prop up the protocol (as 45sbvad suggests above), there will be other miners who will be eating your lunch by mining full-steam up to the halving and then shutting down.


How would a smoothly and exponentially reducing reward, that changes almost imperceptibly every block, introduce uncertainty?
If the reward was modified on each new block, each block's reward would be 0.9999966993045875 of the previous block's reward, so if the previous block reward was 25 bitcoin, the next block would be 24.99991748 bitcoin. Or, the reward could be adjusted every 2 weeks, when the difficulty is adjusted.

I have posted many times before that the "halving event" is an unnecessary unknown that we are imposing on a currency that we would like to see become a major means of commerce. The fact that OP asks this question just makes my point once again.
**Markets don't like uncertainty!**
If a simple modification to the reward algorithm was made (requiring a hard fork however), smoothing out the change in the reward, such uncertainties would be totally eliminated.
I think that the next "halving event" could cause a major disruption, since marginally positive mining profitability will instantaneously turn into a nearly 50% loss, causing all miners that are mining solely for profit to go offline until the difficulty adjusts, leaving only the diehard idealists online. Yes, the difficulty will eventually adjust, but since so few miners remain, the time to solve the next block could jump from 10 minutes to several hours. That in turn will cause the time to the next difficulty adjustment to soar from 2 weeks to as much as half a year or more. The markets won't like that.

1. Bitcoin mining is a for-profit proposition, and the "difficulty" adjusts to ensure that there is a profit motive to mine. Nevertheless, anyone can mine that wants to, so that keeps the profit very low. Also, there are conditions that favor certain miners (places with cheap electricity and cooling like Iceland, and super-powerful chips called ASICs only available to certain firms), and so it is not profitable for the "hobbyist".
2. Bitcoin certainly makes some illegal (and BAD) activities easier. Currently, there is a virus called Cryptolocker that encrypts your files and demands a bitcoin ransom. Such a thing would not be possible with Visa or MasterCard. But any revolutionary idea comes with problems. For the internet, it is identity theft and child pornography, among others. For email, it is spam and viruses. But no one labels these ideas as bad because of the new problems they introduce. We just have to learn how to deal with them.
3. Hard to list them all! Foremost in my mind is the fact that financial transactions can be performed between complete strangers, without divulging personal information or trusting the other party or a third party (Visa/Mastercard/bank). Hacks on merchants (Target, Home Depot) would not be possible if the merchant had no personal information.
Second, bitcoin transactions are called "push", because the customer initiates the transaction, not the merchant. Credit card transactions are "pull", wherein the merchant is given your credit card, and "pulls" the money from your account. The only thing stopping the merchant from "pulling" any more money is your vigilant checking of your billing statement and the CC company's fraud abatement efforts. But nothing stops the merchant from recording your name and CC number to sell to criminals.
Third, transactions are final and cannot be reversed by the sender or a third party such as a bank or any government.
Fourth, any amount of funds can be sent anywhere in the world, even across borders, almost instantly, and almost for free ($1 million worth could be sent for ten cents).
There are many other advantages, but you'll have to do more research to list them all!
4. Bitcoin is a new idea, and no one can say if some killer problem will be found (but as time passes, that possibility diminishes). Don't bet you entire life on its success. Nevertheless, if it fails, you'll only lose 100% of your investment. If it succeeds, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT (I am not a financial adviser).
5. Don't know what that means.
6. Anyone can track Bitcoin's financial transactions--anyone running a Bitcoin node has every transaction that ever occurred on his computer. But those transactions are not directly tied to a personal identity (that's why Cryptolocker uses bitcoin, successfully so far). Nevertheless, techniques exist for correlating transactions to individual behavior, so the connection can be made unless the person is VERY careful (that's why Silk Road went down). Many young people are unaware that their social interactions on the internet provide enough metadata for Google to have a complete profile of virtually everyone's behavior (and the NSA has been shown to have taps into Google's data).
7. Most us bitcoiners would like to see Bitcoin handled the way the internet was: almost no governmental regulation. That would create fertile ground for innovation. But some look for *more* regulation, thus opening bitcoin up to use by established Wall Street financial institutions.
I wish you success on your paper!

Your question shows that you don't grasp the tectonic shift in thinking that is Bitcoin (and I don't mean that as a put-down).
Amazingly, Bitcoin's blockchain makes it unnecessary to trust anyone; no one can cheat Bitcoin, as long as the integrity of the blockchain can be maintained (the largest array of raw computing power the world has ever seen is currently busy maintaining that integrity). The blockchain is present in the same, exact, unforgeable form on everyone and anyone's computer that wants to track it. No one can modify an entry (i.e., spend the bitcoin in that account) unless he possesses the "private key" to that entry. The same cryptographic technology that protects military, corporate and financial secrets, also protects Bitcoin (so if anyone "cracks" that cryptography, there would be more lucrative targets to attack than Bitcoin!). No one can double-spend the bitcoin in an account. No one can reverse an executed transaction.
Because of these facts, you can send $0.000001 or $1,000,000.00 to a complete stranger in another country, almost instantaneously, without the help (or hindrance) of any governmental or financial (bank) entity.
Chew on that for a while.

The breakthrough enabled by the blockchain, the revolutionary concept behind Bitcoin, is basically this: it allows timestamping of anything that can be reduced to a hash, with NO trust involved in a third party. Timestamps have been available for a long time, but have always involved some form of a trusted authority. Now, at almost no cost, anyone can timestamp a signature (hash) without trusting anyone.
The possibilities are endless. Besides the currency bitcoin (which is a necessary component of a secure blockchain), any sort of document can be timestamped, including entries in a public ledger, registration of property, control of intellectual property or artistic creations, voting records, etc., etc.
Why is this important? After all, we have many trusted authorities, not the least of which are governments and central banks.
Many would prefer not to put all their trust in governments, domestic or foreign. Many governments have not been living up to the responsibilities with which they have been entrusted. And few believe that the central banks should be attempting to manipulate the world's economies. It won't end well.

I wish people didn't look at this like some kind of event to celebrate. If mining profits are marginally positive immediately before the halving, they will turn into almost 50% losses immediately after. Yes, the difficulty will adjust, but the immediate effect will be to make mining SERIOUSLY unprofitable for EVERY miner. Unless they mine out of the goodness of their hearts and not for profit, they would all stop mining. This would cause the time to difficulty adjustment to soar from 2 weeks to -- who knows?
Why didn't this occur at the first halving? Apparently because mining was sufficiently profitable so that it remained at least marginally profitable after the halving as well. We can hope for a significant bitcoin price increase just before the halving, but I fear that there is a glut of miners waiting to go online if the price rockets, so the profits will remain marginal.
This could all be solved if the block reward algorithm were changed so that it smoothly and exponentially dropped, say, by a very small amount on every block. Of course, this would require a hard fork.
Financial markets don't like uncertainty or abrupt changes. Bitcoin would be better off if this "halving event" did not occur.

Don't know why you're asking this question; sounds like you're thinking that a "block halving" means a halving of the block's size.
It's a halving in the reward received for solving the block, from the current 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. No correlation to block size or capacity.
@_date: 2015-03-10 12:40:17
**The fact that you are asking this question demonstrates that halving events cause uncertainty, and markets don't like uncertainty.**
Even though the first-ever halving went without a glitch, I am concerned that the next one will occur when the mining industry is stabilized and miners are operating at marginal profit. The sudden halving, even though known in advance, will instantaneously turn a marginally profitable (~3%?) enterprise into a tremendously unprofitable (~-45%?) one. Many, maybe even most, miners could go offline until the difficulty adjusts, to save electricity costs. This could cause the time to find solutions to rise many-fold, which would cause the time between difficulty adjustments to rise accordingly, exacerbating the problem.
Why not adjust the reward smoothly and exponentially downward, so that there is never a time when a dramatic event occurs and creates uncertainty?

You are not being fair. I know you're exaggerating about the security precautions you take with your bitcoin, but the fact is, most people are at risk of identity theft and loss of all their fiat at any time, it's just that no hacker has yet set his sights on their funds. If an attacker were to use the sophisticated technology you are trying to block (not be near a window??) to go after your bank account etc., you would lose them.
You are right in one way, though. Users of bitcoin must acquaint themselves with some new habits to prevent theft or loss. For example, bitcoin uses a checksum to to virtually guarantee that a typo will not send funds to an invalid address, but don't get too comfortable: you can easily send bitcoin to an old address to which you no longer possess the private key, losing it forever. It's kind of like the protections that prevent me from locking my keys in my car, but I still have to develop the habit of *never* setting my keys down on the seat.

There are several ways in which the payout could be "smoothed":
* It would be simple math to recalculate the payout on every block: P' = P / 2^(1/210000)
* Such fine granularity is not necessary, though. The payout could also be adjusted at every difficulty adjustment (2 weeks): P' = P / 2^(0.0096)
If the change started 2 years before the halving was supposed to occur (but it's too late for that), the same number of total coins would be created. If the change were implemented at the time halving is scheduled to occur, several million more coins would be created (bad, bad idea). However, the equations above could be tweaked ever so slightly so that the change could be implemented at halving time but no more or less total coins would be created.

This is a good opportunity to remind people that there are **two** things that you have to protect against: **theft** and **loss**, and they work against each other; that is, strong protection against theft exposes you to increased risk of loss, and vice versa, unless specific measures are taken. To protect against theft, you want very few copies of your private key, and to protect against loss, you want many. Be sure to consider both possibilities.
In particular, make sure you protect against loss if you suffer a medical event such as a concussion that causes amnesia (or, as in your case, simply forgetting), and make sure that loved ones can access your stash if you meet an untimely end.

Forbes: Ukrainians refuse to banks in favor of Bitcoin
  Powered by
Due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, according to experts, the inhabitants of the country en masse refuse to banking services and trying to save their money in real estate and Cryptocurrency.
Forbes said about this professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Andrei Kirilenko: "The competition has reached the point that Cryptocurrency competitors are not just the banks, but the central bank."
According to him the shadow banking customers choose, because banks, speaking financial intermediaries provide very expensive services and collect information about people who are interested in the banks, but not customers.
However, the most popular way to save money is still buying property, especially when it comes to apartments in Kiev or Odessa. It is likely that the poorer sections of the population who can not afford to buy property will actively invest in bitcoin or other Cryptocurrency. According ForkLog, interest Bitcoins in Ukraine for the last 6 months increased by 30%, and the country has several fairly large farms for mining Bitcoins. One of these farms is Bitcoin in the combat zone in the east.

There is no negative correlation between the price of bitcoin and the "blockchain boom". The price of bitcoin hit its low way back on Jan 13 '15 of $152.4 USD (Bitstamp) and has more or less steadily risen since then. The "blockchain boom" has been since that time, so the price of bitcoin has actually risen since then.
Besides, there is plenty of room for both phenomena; the banks can go ahead and implement a blockchain solution to lower their costs (BTW, good luck doing it on a centralized, permissioned ledger, which is nothing more than a conventional database), while bitcoin the currency grows from a paltry $4 billion market cap as it is used to hedge against banking malfeasance.

Yes, but the shares are not offered at the fixed price of ~0.1 bitcoin. You can bid any amount to buy.
For example, if I want to buy the gold ETF GLD, the price will remain fixed no matter how much I buy, because it is backed by gold, and arbitrage will keep the price from deviating. The only way the price would move is if I actually move the price of gold.
But with this new "ETF" GBTC, the amount is strictly limited to the bitcoins that the current holders are willing to sell. If I offer a very high bid, there will be no arbitrage to keep the price tied to the bitcoin price (or actually, a tenth thereof).

Romans 9 is talking about God's choosing the Jews as His chosen people, not about our lack of free will. It is true that the Bible talks about predestination (Eph 1:4-5), but it also implies our free will (why would Jesus call for people to repent if we were totally predestined to either do so or not?)
People here may see it as a contradiction for the Bible to affirm predestination and at the same time grant us free will, but strange things happen at infinity (God is infinite).
People here, myself included, have a great appreciation for mathematics. But consider some of the strange things that are characteristic of infinity: Infinity plus one is also infinity (what? a value is equal to that same value plus one? Contradiction!). Also, there are at least two distinct kinds of infinite, the countably infinite (such as the set of integers), and the uncountably infinite (such as the set of real numbers). Weird.

Yes, they know, but what can they do to avert the problems? The simple fact remains that the reward will be twice as large on block 420,000 as it is on block 420,001. The profit-driven will mine right up to the reward halving and then shut down (to save on electricity costs) until the difficulty adjusts accordingly. But because so many stop mining, the normal 2-week interval to the next difficulty adjustment will swell to perhaps, who knows, six months?

The ledger would be copied from one of the peers, where the peer would be identified in a manner similar to Bitcoin's.


Don't know yet; I'm working on a solution. That's also an issue if the network gets hit by a major disaster (intentional or otherwise); The Ledger does not get destroyed on participating nodes, but how do they find each other?
I think it should be possible to build into the network a method of verifiably determining the the size, either in number of participating nodes, or in total Zapcoin represented, so that a new entrant would choose the node with the larger value (similar to Bitcoin's 51% issue)

I'm an EE and I have some comments.
I have been thinking of doing something similar, but I have some suggestions to pare the unit down.
First, put two USB ports on it:
* a Type-B (acts as a device and receives power) socket to connect it to a USB port on a PC/MAC. In this way, it can be powered solely from the host computer.
* a Type-A (acts as a host and provides power) socket that can be plugged into a printer, thumb drive or keyboard.
This obviates the need for a screen, since the second USB port can be used for backing-up/reloading wallet keys. The printer can print a paper backup similar to Armory's, and the thumb drive can be used for digital backup.
I think a PIC32 micro-controller ($5) could provide the horsepower. Thus, all that is needed is the MCU, two USB sockets and a few glue parts. A second MCU may be needed unless I can find an MCU that has two USB On-The-Go peripherals. A [Crypto-Auth]( device ($0.63) could be added to enhance security.
The PC would not be capable of ever seeing the wallet private keys. As a rudimentary implementation, the unit could look like a flash drive to the PC. A "Watching-Only" copy of Armory could write files to the device for signing, and the signed file could magically appear in response. A more sophisticated implementation could integrate directly with Armory.

You can PROVE that your result was fair by generating the result before taking bets, then generating a crypto hash on the result plus a nonce, and providing it to the participants. They then place their bets, knowing that the result has already been generated, but can't decode the result from the hash. After betting is complete, you provide the result, which the players can verify was generated before betting by checking the hash.

A "node" is a computer on the network, keeping current with the Ledger. Spawning zillions of nodes could be a problem, but remember that rogue nodes are ejected from the network on every round.

The nonce doesn't have to be random; it just has to be unique (and thus untried). Randomness is just a good way to ensure uniqueness.

I imagine that "playing telephone" refers to retranslating translations of the Scriptures multiple times over the centuries. This is simply not true. When a new version of the Bible is made, the authors go back to the ancient manuscripts (over 5000 in Greek alone; 25000 in multiple languages). Nothing else in antiquity can match the number of manuscripts of the Bible, by an order of magnitude. These manuscripts go back to within 25 years of the original document; one was recently found during archaeological digs in Egypt. So "playing telephone" is not a criticism you can level at Biblical scholarship.

Before I say more, I need to remind you that I have given my life over to God through Jesus; and God, Who knows much better than I do what is good for me, has set down His statutes in His "owner's manual", the Bible. My job is to learn those statutes and implement them, for my own good as well as the good of all.
Now, if I ever come to the realization that there is no god, no superior being who has better understanding and wisdom than I do, I will endeavor to do whatever I can to live and make myself happy. I will try my best to use my powers of reason to those ends. I will try to learn from the mistakes and experiences of others (as well as my own).
But a moral standard that never calls you to do something that you don't want to do (or not do something you want to do) is no moral standard at all. And if I ever come to believe that this whole god thing is false, I don't ever again want to obligate myself to do what I don't want to do. The standard that God sets is so high that I find myself violating it continuously, if my thoughts are taken into consideration. I'll never, by my own strength, meet His requirements. That involves guilt and shame, the necessary results of violating moral law (of course the guilt and shame are met in Christ, and the result is joy!).
So if there is no god, then thanks but no thanks to moral obligations. I'll just do the best I can, but when I fail, I don't want guilt and shame (with no Christ).

Not true that the fees are higher for a microtransaction. At the $12 inflection point, the fee is $0.648 at the 2.9% + $0.30 rate, and $0.650 at the 5% + $0.05 rate, which is essentially equal. Below that, the 5% rate provides a **lower** total fee than the 2.9% rate provides, because of the lower flat fee.

The US' founding documents have been as much of a tectonic shift in world affairs as Bitcoin promises to be in finance. And its principles of liberty and justice still apply.

PLEASE do not fool yourself into thinking that the United Nations, a rag-tag dysfunctional organization set up by the then-world-powers, would do a better job. The UN is not founded on the beautiful principles set forth by the Declaration of Independence, Constitution and Federalist Papers.

Every node assumes (correctly, if it is running valid code) that it has the correct hash result. Any neighboring node that disagrees is then assumed to be incorrect, and the node isolates it by disconnecting from it. All other "correct" nodes will do likewise, and the "incorrect" node or nodes will be removed from the fabric. If a wallet is running "correct" code, it cannot be removed from the "correct" fabric, unless it is surrounded by (dozens or hundreds) of "incorrect" nodes, which would be very difficult, since the connection algorithm forces each node to connect with nodes all over the network.

A Ponzi scheme rewards early-comers with the funds of late-comers, without actually generating any value. It's a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin has no such characteristic, either intentionally or unintentionally.
As a matter of fact, the US Social Security system, Medicare and Medicaid *are* turning out to be a Ponzi scheme, even if it was not originally set up that way. There is not NEARLY enough money in the SS "lock"-box to cover the actuarially-predicted future needs, and they WILL go bankrupt. This will occur because our irresponsible government tapped into these caches when they realized that it was a way to procure funds with no pain to the *current* citizenry. Apparently, we had left our conservative roots enough by that time to swallow Keynesian economic mumbo-jumbo (I hate to think that we just didn't care about future generations).

I think you're applying my comments to Bitcoin. In the Byzantine Generals Problem, it is necessary that *all* generals participate in the attack for the attack to be successful (not true of Bitcoin). If there are 1000 generals and one has not heard, the attack fails. I don't see anything in Satoshi's scenario that guarantees that all generals participate.
If one general did not participate in the "mining", the computation time would only increase 0.1%, from 10:00 minutes average to 10:00.6 minutes (in the noise).

Why would anyone *own* fiat if it is inflationary?
Why would anyone *accept* fiat if it is inflationary?
In a fiat-only economic milieu, one has no choice but to own fiat. But why would one own fiat, which is inflationary (decreases in value), if there is the option to own Bitcoin, which is deflationary (increases in value)?
And if all my money is in Bitcoin, why would I ever spend it? Well, duh, I would spend it because I want to buy something! People say that a deflationary currency encourages hoarding... why do they call it ***hoarding*** instead of what it really is, ***saving***?
I lived in Israel when inflation was almost 16%... per ***month***! When I received a paycheck, I had to *immediately* go buy something -- anything. A refrigerator I didn't need. Oh, how nice Bitcoin would have been!


I'm incredulous that you are comparing Bitcoin to the internet, like it's a bad thing! The "dotcom boom" gave us the World Wide Web, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, email, Skype, YouTube, Twitter, etc., etc., and now, Bitcoin. How short-sighted can you be?

I'm very excited about Bitcoin, but it saddens me to see people elevate it to *the meaning of life*. The major problem in this world is not some form of government, nor rich and powerful people, nor our financial system. It is the heart of man. We are created in the image of God, but mankind has rebelled against its creator. Some governmental and financial systems may be better at keeping man's twisted, selfish ways in check, but the problems will always be here, because people are here (and I include myself as part of the problem).
Have you considered that there is now a [bitcoin-crowd-funded site for political assassinations]( The founder wants to put a bounty on the heads of political leaders. After a bunch are offed, he figures, everyone will be afraid to run for office and we will all live happily ever after in a post-government world. How sad that these people can't see that when they throw off one system, another, perhaps more corrupt, system will fill the void. 
The problem is you and me! We will never solve the problem of evil with something like a new currency.

I think that a thumb-drive-like USB dongle could be made for &lt; $20 that holds your Armory-style seed and all private keys, but ***does not allow*** them to be accessed via the USB port. It would have a second female USB port on its other end that is used exclusively for creating paper/digital backups (and downloading from a digital backup). In this way, the seed and private keys are **never** exposed to the computer or internet. To be stolen, they would have to be *physically* stolen. The host computer would use a read-only wallet, and would only be able to authorize transactions through the dongle. Sending money would require that the user press a button on the dongle, so that authorizations could not occur without your physical consent.

I get so tired of hearing people disparaging all wars. Sure, there have been wars that should not have occurred, and every war has a "bad guy" side. But military and the wars they wage are the international equivalent of the intra-state battle between police and criminals. Police are a *good* idea, even if there are bad cops, and sometimes "good" criminals (i.e., we agree with their objectives). Societies always set up a police force to enforce the established cultural rules (laws). If they don't, chaos ensues as the bad guys take over (and of course, the bad guys then proceed to set up their own police-thugs). Similarly, a society that does not provide for the common defense does not last long.
I don't know where you live, but here in America, I'm glad we won the **war** of independence (or we'd still be under king so-and-so), and especially World **War** II (or our police would be the Gestapo, if we're still alive).

Sorry for the delay in responding; I just saw your post.
For Jews before Christ, there wasn't the dichotomy between "literal" and "allegorical" interpretation of clearly prophetic scriptures like Isaiah 53, Ezekiel 38, Psalm 22 and Daniel 9. Deconstructions such as ["Historical Criticism"]( (Deutero-Isaiah and the Documentary Hypothesis) are purely modern analyses.
Until 1948, scholars discounted Isaiah 53 as having been rewritten after the fact, simply because it so explicitly predicted the NT events. But the [Dead Sea Scrolls]( dispelled that, since all agree that they predate the NT era, and they validate the historical Isaiah manuscripts, of which none survived from prior to about the 10th century AD.
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:26:04
A fabric interconnected in this scheme's fashion is very resistant to splitting (I referred to it as "ripping"). Because of the way the node connection assignment works, it is not possible to connect to only nodes in a specific locality. Think of the digits of the address as dimensions in space: the algorithm forces each node to connect in every dimension. You may have some local connections (conceptually speaking, the least significant digits of the address), but you will also have connections to other regions of the planet (the most significant digits). Thus, it is very difficult for you to be totally isolated.
A software bug could cause havoc, as occurred to Bitcoin recently, but I don't see how this scheme would be any *more* susceptible.

Finding a solution is a matter of chance. For example, say the solution was flipping a coin and getting 5 heads in a row. You would have to flip the coin 32 times on average to come up with a solution. So, to double the difficulty, simply make the solution require 6 heads in a row. This is very simplistic, but it illustrates the idea.
The solution difficulty is programmed into the code, so as long as everyone runs the same code, they all agree on the difficulty. No one can arbitrarily modify the difficulty, because if they do, no one else will accept their solutions... that is, unless someone takes over &gt;50% of the mining activity. That is why it is good when many miners mine, because the more mining computation goes on, the harder it is for anyone to achieve &gt;50%.

A "rogue" node is one that is not playing by the rules. If you have a wallet and want to join the network, make sure you are running a compliant version of the client. If you are, you will be a "correct" node, on the winning side of every dispute; if your software is non-compliant, whether by malice or otherwise, you will be rogue. Of course, if the "official" software has a bug, as occurred with Bitcoin, both parties will see themselves as correct (big problem).

To be precise, the Blockchain is a Journal, not a Ledger. A Journal is a complete list of transactions in chronological order; a Ledger is a summary of the account balances. A Journal contains much more information than a Ledger (A Ledger can be generated from a Journal, but not vice-versa). In order to know if an address exists and what its current balance is, a scan of the entire blockchain is required. The Zapcoin Ledger is simply a list of every account and its current balance.

You may be right... after all, the prophesies in Revelation *will* eventually be fulfilled. I'm just saying that Bitcoin at least fights against such a system.

The only way to prevent that (and again it would only be temporary), would be to go "off the grid" entirely.

Thanks for your thoughtful reply, though I disagree that the Scriptures speak against government. See:

* Hebrews 13:17 "Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account. Let them do this joyfully, and not sadly, for that would be of no advantage to you."
* I Peter 2:13-17 "Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right."
* Titus 3:1 "Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any honest work"
* Proverbs 24:21 "My son, fear the Lord and the king,
    and do not disobey either of them"
Also, prophesy *does* predict events. Prophecies that have already been fulfilled (e.g., Isaiah 53) give us validation that the Bible is true, and reason to believe that as-yet-unfulfilled prophesies (e.g., most of Revelations) can be trusted to be true as well.

Thanks, everyone for your replies. To summarize, it would be "quite difficult" for an attacker to pull this off, and probably not financially worth the while. But my concern is a government with NSA-like resources. If threatened, this government could set up one or more Bitcoin look-alikes and point new users at its blockchain. It could also shut down nodes that publicly advertise as portals into the genuine Bitcoin network.
I'm also asking the question because I am interested in a radically different cryptocurrency tentatively dubbed [Zapcoin]( This cryptocurrency employs a Ledger in place of the Blockchain, and relies on a tightly-linked fabric with real-time updates to prevent double-spending. Its main vulnerability, as I see it, would be a DDoS attack, which would **not** allow funds to be stolen, but **would** allow the attacker to fragment the network and force nodes to reconnect to the genuine network. The problem is identifying the genuine network.

If you have 100,000 transactions per second, that's 60,000,000 transactions in ten minutes. Why would Bitcoin be better at handling that transaction load than this scheme?
Also, keep in mind that the "depth" of the proposed network (the max distance between any two nodes) is very shallow, in the order of 5 or 6 hops, so transactions propagate very quickly. The network starts each round with a fixed set of transactions, which are the transactions that accumulated during the previous round. So it would only take 5 or six iterations for all nodes to have received all transactions. But I see your point that every node must be able to handle those 100,000 transactions per second. But isn't this also a limitation for Bitcoin? Every node must be able to make 60,000,000 modifications in ten minutes, with those mods being daisy-chained from node to node over a much more loosely connected fabric (each node has only dozens of connections), which means that its "depth" is much greater.
