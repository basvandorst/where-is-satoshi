can we sticky this?

this /\ I read somewhere that the adoption rate for segwit is around 12% and that most of the exchanges don't use it. Not sure how reliable that is though

How can you do this operating in the EU with no ID, doesn't that imply that you're not cooperating with KYC/AML regs? that'll get you shut down immediately.

I mean, that argument is flawed. Kinda like saying I'm a professional mechanic, just ask my customers. Except none of them have ever asked for your qualifications, catch my drift? No disrespect meant! Blockfolio was busted for transmitting info to chinese servers. It pays to be cautious in the crypto world, I know you understand that.

anybody packet sniff this? No offence to you creator guy, this looks slick as hell, it's just in my nature to trust nothing

As someone who works in software themself, you can't, a third party however can. Have a trusted source audit the code, I assume you don't want to make all that hard work open source, that's cool. I think you'll find the hyper-paranoid freaks like me are in the minority, most people will be trusting. When I get some free time, I'll do the packet sniffing myself, judging by the community focus I presume there'll be more traffic than your bog standard portfolio tracker. I love the design though, really, this is very slick and you should be extremely proud of it.

I love your optimism, but I think you're in dangerous waters. I guarantee that despite your claims potentially being accurate, this is still a vector for money laundering when you explicitly advertise "No ID" and that'll attract unwanted attention, you're going to be fighting to keep the wolves from your doors. Again, I applaud your efforts, I love what you're doing but you need to be prepared to defend yourself.

blockfolio sends your info to china, use delta instead
