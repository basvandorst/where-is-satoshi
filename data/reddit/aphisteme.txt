The whole idea of bitcoin cash is to have blocks that are not full.. The fact that you grew accustomed to full blocks is worrying.

I don't know if you are trolling, but an extra input increases the transaction size, and hence the transaction fee.

The second that you will spend that tip, it will count as an extra input. The transaction fee sadly will be greater than that tip.

I'm not sure if you know this, but a transaction includes all input addresses, and the destination adress. 
The 9 dollar worth comes from a different adress than the rest of your coins. This increases the transaction size, and thus the fee. (Fees are x satoshi per byte). 
What I'm getting at is that the additional bits to encode the input address could cost over 9 dollars when the fees are high. You may only be able to spend it at a loss.

I did understand that, but I was pointing at the moment in which you will want to spend (part of) those 9 dollars. There may yet be hope if the fees continue to fall, though!

Not only repeating the propaganda, but even yourself. You are one of a kind.

The sub existed years before you joined reddit. And years before Bitcoin Cash was created.

"Sorry, fees are too high" or "I paid I swear, it will confirm within two weeks!"

It is already implemented in Bitcoin. The results are an average of 5 minutes confirmation time and subcent transaction costs.

A few dollars would still be ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:27:05
Well that depends on yourself then

Well, I'm sure it does. Except it's been unsolved for decades and is NP hard.
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:49:04
I don't think that the routing problem has been solved yet. Not only has it been out there for tens of years, it has also been proven to be NP hard. This makes me feel insecure to use the sidechain, and makes me stick to the main chain. Sadly, this is becoming more and more expensive, and I start to lean in the direction of Bitcoin Cash.

You must be retarded but he's talking about 8k/year over say 45 years, to live 5 years off

Hahahah
