Thanks for your reply. Does electrum have an all in one crypto wallet or do you need to download a different application for each currency?

thanks for the replies guys, but with so many more competing coins on the market gaining steam, what edge does bitcoin really have?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:10:49
what about electrum?
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:03:32
how would one connect to this satellite?

so is it safe to sell off bCash? It doesn't compromise my BTC in any way does it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:27:30
why does it give the option not to? I'm just trying to fully understand it here
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:31:13
so is it going well? i'm curious how the progress can be watched/measured
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:19:20
no i fully understand that, but if I transfer all my bitcoin under the segwit umbrella, can I move it back through a non-segwit address?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:23:02
if it continues this ownward trend then yes 10 is very acheivable

What do they do with all that money??
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:56:11
oh I see!
I use breadwallet and consider that a pretty trustworthy third party. my bigger amounts I store on a paper wallet. So basically I could run a node for my own security, but just running one without connecting my wallet really doesn't do anything for anyone?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:47:03
whats it worth right now?
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:08:47
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the node concept. What would be the benefit to myself? I don't want to run it for the false sense of pride that I am helping strengthen the network when I am actually in fact not doing anything

How do you intend on purchasing $10 per day? Or are you saving $10 per day to buy a lump sum of bitcoin later?

What do they do with all that money??
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:36:18
237k, did you even watch the shining? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:35:26
would the 12 word backup phrase be good enough for them to access the wallet on a platform of their choosing?
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:50:36
the legend and creator himself!
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:03:23
can anyone suggest a better iOS ether wallet alternative? I'm using breadwallet for my bitcoin, I'm using Jaxx for my ether because I dont know why
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:54:18
Should I move all my BTC to a new wallet when cashing out my BCH? Is there still a risk of someone uncovering my Private key? I was planning to cash out through breadwallet
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:33:18
Can you elaborate? This is a sub I trust because my values tend to align with most of the folks on here, so it seemed like a good place to get some opinions on a cryptocurrency related subject
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:09:17
does it print out the backup phrase as well?
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:13:44
I'm assuming he means running a full node yourself. Thats something I want to do but not up on the technical knowhow
