Dam, where were you at $5000.00?
Hey, what's the floor this time?

That's what I say. Fuck Venezuelans. Deal with it, bitches.
Who cares that certain people have the ability and desire to have a positive impact on the world? Fuck anybody who isn't at where I am at right now. 
Here's to hoping nothing and nobody ever depends on people like us, right?

HAHA! That you don't understand literal genocides go on regularly in the world is part of the problem.
Until a second ago, we weren't "us" and you weren't "them". But then you came! Now we got a nice "You guys" tradition, that's sure to take this conversation to a reasonable place. You cunts.

John says: "I'll pay you 5 dollars for that chicken, farmer Joe."
How was the market price of the chicken determined? B/c John said he'd pay 5 dollars for it.

Coinbase is good to buy (limits on deposits are harsh, horror stories of mistakes made are harsh, but in a couple weeks you'll have your coins if you're patient and relatively careful). And it's got GDAX for trading.
Krakken is indeed the worst piece of dick ever. I started probably 3 weeks ago and am still not verified (I actually gave up after the 4th round of nit pickey bullshit their verification team came back to me with).
Don't scan your driver's license (For some unmentioned reason. Guess the quality of the photo is too good...)

Don't write "For trading digital currencies on krakken.com" when you should've written "For trading digital currencies on
