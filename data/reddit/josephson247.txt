Good. Its only selling point is confusion.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:58:30
BCH's biggest problem is not lack of miners, but lack of users. What is their use case in the world of trustless instant almost-free off-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:35:33
All this doesn't matter if we move to user activated soft forks.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:28:34
It would cost $110,000 on AWS during off-peak hours.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:55:26
You describe Bitcoin Unlimited. Bitcoin works differently.
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:58:58
95% miner support is not enough for a hard fork, sorry.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:38:59
Yes, the strongest chain is defined as the chain demonstrating the most PoW. A solo miner who has mined blocks with a very low difficulty in an isolated environment since 2009 should not be able to replace the current chain. As a further example, the testnet chain is more than twice the length of the Bitcoin chain, but it is neither stronger nor valid.
As for validation, it is necessary to prevent miners from printing infinite money. Valid means the chain follows the rules that are enforced by the nodes. Finally, a PoW change would be a hard fork which is incompatible with the old rules. There would be no comparison with the old PoW, unless the new rules allow both algos.
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:07:24
Why are the devs so quiet about this proposal in the mailing list? If they are afraid of Bitmain's wrath, isn't it a good thing to give them the option to intentionally fork off from the Bitcoin network without booting off the honest miners?
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:17:23
Theymos actually suggested a combination of Keccak (ASIC friendly), Cuckoo (ASIC resistant) and PoS.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:07:28
Changing the algo is no more difficult than hard forking to BU. However, both are far more risky than a soft fork like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:52:48
Not if that someone is backed by the government.
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:26:23
Something I have never understood about BU is why they insist on changing the block size instead of the block frequency. Thousands of altcoins have already tested that, while AFAIK there is no coin with blocks larger than 1 MB. Why take the unnecessary risk?
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:26:30
No, that is the premise of BU. In Bitcoin miners cannot hard fork without consent from the users.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:58:15
Centralization is a pro, not a con, if you are a big miner.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:14:22
It is also time to discuss which PoW would be optimal in case a plan B is necessary. Cuckoo is an interesting choice for decentralization: 
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:35:48
A majority of the economy supports SegWit. The miners should listen to their employers. Of course, the best solution would be no hard fork, but if the choice is between BU and a PoW change + what users want (SegWit), then I choose the latter.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:06:09
SegWit is the fastest way to increase the capacity right now. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:38:44
Bitmain controls more than 45% of the hash power in Bitcoin, although not in one single pool.
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:58:33
Are they aware that the users can change the PoW if they are not happy with the miners?
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:27:06
So you agree that hashpower is mostly irrelevant when it comes to hard forks?
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:11:02
If the transition will be too painful the community may decide to change PoW. Still a less contentious change than BU.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:24:55
$110,000 during off-peak hours on AWS, but this cost will decrease with time.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:34:01
Schnorr signatures should be ready within a year, and MAST a little later than that. Together with SegWit, these improvements will give a significant increase in on-chain throughput with other benefits and less disadvantages than a simple hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:48:34
Nope, the whitepaper is wrong about this. It is the strongest valid chain.
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:43:14
What matters are the users and how they vote with their wallets.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:22:59
My proposition would be to wait for BU to fork off and then hope that the remaining miners adopt SegWit. If BU is just an empty threat, we should also threaten with changing the PoW.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:02:45
No, the block subsidy would be the same per unit of time. And if it is OK how it is now, why do a risky hard fork in the first place?
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:03:25
But why bother when there are politically neutral languages without this mess of proprietary forks? A lot of developers simply won't touch anything that has to do with C
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:30:29
And what would happen if the BTC chain overtook the BTU chain? I see lot of potential attack vectors against exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:45:43
Besides what has already been mentioned (Cuckoo), another interesting PoW is the one used by Primecoin. After four years of existence there still are no ASICs.
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:27:48
Not really. Users can activate a soft fork as well. If some miner decides to fork off, that miner will no longer be paid by the users.
@_date: 2017-03-25 07:31:28
Yes, if you mean block weight.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:52:27
Anonymous developers are probably preferable at this point (e.g. btcdrak, Shaolin Fry). While they can have conflicts of interest, at least they cannot be compromised by governments.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:06:16
I believe the opening poster is afraid of losing the utility of his ASICs.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:46:14
Well, since BU is closed source now, they obviously cannot run it. Pools need to make modifications to the code, which isn't available with BU.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:49:24
Yes, I'm talking about an attack on exchanges. Miners could sell coins from the BTU chain, then reorganize to BTC, then reorganize back to BTU. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:15:57
Not sure about that. Firstly, centralization is not secure. Secondly, Bitcoin Core can implement SPECTRE with 15 second blocks to increase the security by a factor of 10. I doubt BU has the know-how to implement SPECTRE.
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:55:23
I wholeheartedly agree, but the last thing we need is a company that controls the distribution of the most used client.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:14:52
The best way the government can help is to not interfere and not be part of it.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:14:25
Nobody can force users to follow a hard fork. If miners decide to abandon their new fork and instead produce empty blocks on the old fork, the users can change the hash algorithm. Soft forks are the only changes miners can enforce, and even in this case the users can create a hard fork to reverse such a decision.
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:13:38
If the fork leads to faster SegWit activation on the users' chain, it may be a good thing in the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:02:28
I don't know enough about Ethereum to comment on that, but I do know that LN is a better scaling solution than RSK. I'm afraid RSK will be used as an argument to block LN. Jihan's involvement with RSK is a giant red flag.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:57:39
So the mining cartel is planning a 51% attack. We need to discuss PoW alternatives before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:38:47
But is security more important than decentralization?
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:58:21
Miners don't get paid to rule.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:06:17
A natural born hodler.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:09:00
Letting miners decide on such issues makes no sense. Their role is to order valid transactions into blocks, nothing else.
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:44:09
What if their next demand is larger block rewards? The cartel's greed needs to be put to an end.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:52:39
Yeah, it is too late for a hard fork now. There would be too much opposition.
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:46:47
If miners don't follow the rules, they won't get paid. Would they rather activate SegWit or get nothing at all?
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:26:31
8 nodes now. It shouldn't be too difficult to at least overtake BU.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:13:44
One word: BTC.TOP
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:54:24
BU decides to instead compete with a similarly-minded project - Ripple.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:01:33
The block frequency can be increased by submitting fake timestamps. The fact that miners haven't tried this already (which would increase their hourly payout) shows that they are either altruistic or incompetent.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:44:16
C# is not a fully open platform. Nobody would take such a coin seriously, just like nobody takes BU seriously.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:52:20
Yep, the miners are most likely running Core but only signaling something else.
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:44:12
This is an open attack on the very foundation of Bitcoin - trustlessness. What is worrying is how open they are with their intent to completely eliminate decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:02:06
We are not talking about the United States Air Force.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:30:46
UASF has all the benefits of a hard fork but not all the disadvantages. The users still get to choose, and if the miners agree, there will not be a split. If the miners don't agree, there will be a split, but the SegWit chain will be valid on the non-SegWit chain, so if the SegWit chain ever gets more hash power, it will replace the non-SegWit chain. Since the opposite cannot happen, there will be less risk holding coins on the SegWit chain. The risk of a reorganization will limit the non-SegWit chain from any serious use. So if you want as broad adoption as possible, UASF is way better than HF.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:54:49
Mining is one of the best ways to get coins relatively anonymously. I'm sure some people are willing to pay to avoid ID checks.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:13:00
Because the open source fork is a second class citizen. Visual Studio is the preferred way to do C# development. Most of the ecosystem is tied to Windows.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:12:57
How much is known about Shaolin Fry? It isn't entirely impossible that it is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto, stepping in to save his work from a hostile take-over.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:02:30
I don't think anyone is saying that the original Bitcoin will be worth more because of a split. But hashpower has little to do with the market cap, and hence the loss of some miners will not crash the price.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:00:38
A UASF still has to be backwards compatible. This means the "crazy features" you talk about will be optional, if activated at all.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:39:18
Bitcoin is not about political compromises. SegWit can be activated by the user nodes and then miners can choose to opt-in or not without breaking compatibility.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:44:35
That is how Bitcoin is designed to avoid trusting third parties.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:50:44
Hash functions are supposed to be designed in such a way that collisions are practically impossible. For example, SHA256 has 128 security bits, which makes collisions unfeasible with existing technology. But there can be a flaw in the algorithm which decreases the security. Alternatively, a mathematical or technological breakthrough could change everything.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:29:23
RSK involves trusted parties. Right now SegWit is the best solution to add new functionality in a trustless way.
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:14:02
Look at this troll's post history. He is a Microsoft employee, his only participation in Bitcoin is to advocate for C
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:52:43
It is good for Microsoft's patent program.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:03:54
It's really interesting that every time someone asks why BU doesn't increase the block frequency instead they say it's not needed because 0-confs are secure. Security is merely an afterthought.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:55:12
SegWit is opt-in. You can run old software and pretend that it isn't activated.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:40:05
/Satoshi BIP148:0.14.0/ to be precise.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:54:37
Trusted third parties, are you talking about PayPal?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:43:56
UASF != HF
A UASF chain is valid on the other chain, a HF chain is not. You essentially avoid the biggest disadvantage of a HF with a UASF. The same proposal has a lot better chances to go through as a UASF than a HF. In both cases, users decide, so that is no longer an advantage for the HF.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:41:01
This is a true grassroots movement, unlike the centralized BU. Let's show who has the most user support!
@_date: 2017-01-29 08:10:20
China and Taiwan can be viewed as a chain split. One problem here is that both claim to be the original. I believe the same would happen with a Bitcoin hard fork.
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:07:13
We should seriously start threating the miners with a change of PoW.
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:20:06
Isn't it risky to assume that technology will continue to improve at the same rate as today for decades to come? The desktop CPU market would suggest that there may be technological walls.
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:14:57
Hopefully you are right. It would be extremely dangerous if miners planned a hard fork in private.
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:56:12
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:45:08
Higher block frequency would be a better solution for that.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:43:33
Core can promise a hard fork, but Core cannot promise that anyone will use it. Considering there is no consensus for SegWit, what is the probability that an even more radical change will gain more support? Developers don't want to write code that is never going to be used.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:31:46
Are we willing to fire the miners if they don't cooperate?
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:56:26
This is nonsense. Miners can't "boot off" nodes, it goes in the other direction.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:01:15
Someone should create a "wallet distro" for this specific purpose and remove unnecessary features to reduce the attack surface.
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:05:41
They mined an empty block. Looks like an experiment, but let's see.
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:13:23
You don't need a majority to split the chain (see ETC). However, changing the PoW is risky and should be avoided. Nevertheless, it can be used as a threat to pressure miners to follow the will of the users and nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:32:27
No. We also need Schnorr signatures and merkleized abstract syntax trees.
@_date: 2017-01-29 05:40:43
If a hard fork happens, nodes decide which chain is valid (irrespective of hashrate).
@_date: 2017-01-19 05:10:19
Miners want more power, which is given to them by Bitcoin Unlimited and not SegWit, but they also want to avoid a chain split, hence the deadlock. Miners have no incentive to care about nodes.
@_date: 2017-01-30 17:26:20
Miners don't represent the majority of the economy. A vast majority does support SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:48:05
Why would F2Pool activate SegWit on Litecoin if they don't want to do it on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:40:33
Those chains would follow different rules, they would be completely independent. Litecoin cannot converge with Bitcoin. ETC cannot converge with ETH.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:05:02
That is not a valid reason to not implement this feature.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:47:27
*faster blocks
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:40:39
I agree that there is time to wait, but one should always have a plan B.
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:37:40
It's sad that the current implementation of the block subsidy doesn't continue forever as a geometric series is supposed to.
Edit: This would of course require infinite precision.
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:07:03
BU (not SegWit) lets miners pick the block size. There is a clear conflict of interest (vs nodes) with miners supporting BU.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:00:48
Are patents really enforceable in the Bitcoin world? Who would be responsible? Could Bitcoin be banned if someone tried to? I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:10:27
Yep, the real scaling challenge is to increase the transaction density.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:38:18
It would be confusing to rename the existing blockchain. Some exchanges actually care about their customers!
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:26:38
You are confused. Hard forks mean different blockchains.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:13:03
No, that will happen in 0.15.2.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:11:10
We need Bitcoin Core with SPV mode. It would help more people to take the step to independence.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:45:58
Haha, no. The best way to support BTC is to hold/buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-15 10:28:33
A successful UASF on Litecoin should convince many of the doubtful in the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:56:03
And that was unsustainable. That's why it didn't last long.
@_date: 2017-04-19 07:49:11
33% is enough to resist attacks. If an attack happens, which requires another 33%, the other chain will be annihilated.
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:31:29
But Jihan is the one who is responsible for almost all bad news about Bitcoin. How can he be afraid of something he is trying to achieve?
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:32:16
We will still need further soft forks like Schnorr signatures. It's not over when SegWit has activated.
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:45:11
They need us more than we need them. I'm not even sure if we need them at all.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:13:02
Litecoin if it manages to activate SegWit?
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:36:04
They are probably afraid of a successful UASF, which would encourage the Bitcoin community to do the same.
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:51:53
Jihan can be orphaned out if needed.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:07:46
Also Wiktionary. Probably the best multilingual dictionary.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:00:04
UASF = user activated SOFT fork :)
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:05:38
How are you going to enforce that BIP? If it's going to be up to the users, then I really don't understand why SegWit cannot be implemented simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:13:58
But if you are going to do a UASF anyway, why not activate SegWit at the same time?
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:55:22
No, doing two UASFs is completely unnecessary. If we are going to do a UASF, it should not only prevent ASICBOOST, but also activate SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:22:06
Jihan's monopoly is protected by the government :(
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:25:01
No. Use a live system for stuff like this. It's quite easy and very little risk.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:03:49
I agree that it doesn't matter. Appeal to authority is a fallacy.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:09:59
The same thing can be said about P2SH. If you're against soft forks in general, please say so. Right now you're just spreading FUD about SegWit.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:35:42
We did not choose Bitcoin because we wanted a better master. We wanted to be in full control ourselves, and we are not going to compromise on this. However, these guys are free to compete for Ripple's market share if that is their wish.

It's not nonsense. Read this:

Why not both? Satoshi's words and time zone match with Szabo, but the project and code was probably done together with Finney.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:04:46
Bitpay is practically a subsidiary of Bitmain nowadays. This was expected. I hope the founders will have a good time with the cash.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:00:35
Nope, it's Nick Szabo, but they knew each other and the name was probably suggested by Hal.

0-conf payments would be abused if they were more widely accepted. All Bitcoin developers unanimously agree that 0-confs are a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:49:26
Big blockers want a hard fork, small blockers don't want a contentious hard fork. How is a contentious hard fork a compromise? Trust me, most small blockers would accept and support a non-contentious hard fork. The problem is that nobody has offered one so far. There may be consensus for a block size increase after SegWit has activated, let's see when that happens!
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:18:01

@_date: 2017-05-20 18:05:20
This is absurd. Since you seem worried about patents, maybe you have confused Blockstream with Bitmain?

The bug is real. The FUD is from Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:57:09
Right, but fortunately it is rarely the case that Bitcoin loses value over longer periods of time.

SegWit's 2 MB blocks are already controversial. The point isn't that a HF wouldn't bring more capacity, it is that 2 MB is enough combined with LN.

Ignorance should not be rewarded.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:02:46
ASICBoost in general is still a vulnerability. No reason to have it there. (Of course, covert ASICBoost is far more harmful and should be prioritized, but ASICBoost should not exist at all.)
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:50:00
If you would ask any other coin's community whether decentralization could be sacrificed for a guaranteed doubled price, it would say "yes, we can always move on to another similarly decentralized coin, but now with twice the stake". Bitcoin does not have this privilege. That is the reason why it has its value.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:44:29
There are even more people who will sell their BU coins. Bitfinex has a good estimate of how much a BTU would be worth (about one tenth of a BTC).
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:35:34
33% hashpower is enough to withstand attacks. If the remaining hashpower decides to attack the minority chain, they need more than 33%, and then their own chain dissappears. SegWit currently has 36%. 40% would be more than enough, provided that the economic majority supports the UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:53:57
Important note about Jeff Garzik's own (conflicting) interests: 
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:26:59
But how are you going to do that? UASF is the only possible way, and then why not activate SegWit at the same time?
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:21:55
MASF (BIP 34) - introduced by nobody else but... Gavin Andersen.
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:24:31
Was going to say the same thing. Should I support a grassroots movement or a backdoor deal? Tough choice!
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:55:51
I'm sorry, but this backdoor deal is a scam. It is bankers and corporations trying to make Bitcoin too expensive to use for normal people (the way it is meant to be used, i.e., running a full node). It is an attempt to redefine what Bitcoin is - it is an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:59:09
The UASF chain cannot be annihilated. The causality goes in the other direction.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:19:47
That was a hard fork. A UASF would kill the minority chain.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:37:27
Bitmain essentially bought BitPay's name. It is a sad attempt to do a sybil attack on the consensus mechanism.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:19:19
But then the market is controlled by the government. You suddenly need lobbyists to get anywhere.

Bitcoin is not an oligarchy.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:30:16
If all you care about is the price of Bitcoin and not its decentralization then you will lose both and deserve neither.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:43:09
The difference is that the UASF chain can (and probably will) annihilate the other chain. That would be impossible with a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:52:06
Let me guess: you don't run a node.

IMO 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:19:41
Bitcoin is currently fine, but there is reason to be worried. There is a critical bug that needs to be squashed fast:  This bug is serious, and it is spreading quickly. One could say that it has already affected BitPay.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:05:31
Once. That's what rarely means.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:44:20
Bitpay was recently bought by Bitmain. Sad but true.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:14:30
BitPay gets paid to preserve ASICBoost (a technical reason to oppose SegWit as a softfork). Let's not be too idealistic here, wouldn't you take free money if you could get away with it?
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:50:56
This is the reason we need off-chain transactions. Miners will always be able to confirm their own free transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:00:10
Funny thing Satoshi himself did UASFs.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:08:15


@_date: 2017-05-21 17:10:14
Miners have no say in consensus rules. Whether we like it or not, that's how Bitcoin was designed.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:18:41
Have you read any of the listed arguments? Most of them say that users would like it, not that it is viable (without something like LN). And I don't see any Bitcoin developer's name there.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:57:40
Almost every user and business wants to activate SegWit. Unfortunately we just haven't agreed upon a method of activation. Hopefully Bitcoin Core will be able to officially support BIP149.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:58:31
Nah, many (but not all, maybe not even most) altcoins are still better than fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:36:35
Nonsense. They oppose  the quickest way to get an on-chain increase. At the same time, they support a far more dangerous hard fork, so cautiousness cannot be their reason. Actions have consequences. They have no right to complain about full blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:05:49
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:25:16
The HF is to preserve ASICBoost.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:47:17
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:19:53
You're completely wrong. For example, have you heard about the quadratic hashing problem? No offense, but if you don't understand how Bitcoin works, let those who do discuss possible solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:43:33
I'd say BU has been a menace to the network. Countless bugs, doesn't always follow consensus even when it tries to.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:52:39
Your inability to answer the question depends on your ignorance and nothing else.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:04:54
Did you read the replies? Such behavior would be considered as an attack on the network and would lead to a PoW change.

He proposed to remove the blocksize limit without any other alterations, such as limiting the transaction size. Clearly he does not know what he is talking about.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:41:06
So Satoshi was right - UASF is the way to fork.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:43:30
SegWit is a scaling solution, but not an on-chain scaling solution (no such solutions are currently known). And yes, Bitcoin badly needs a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:50:43
The difference is the possibility of annihilation. Very important for game theory.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:55:31
Let me get this straight. You moved to Ethereum and want to prevent SegWit on Bitcoin. Who do you think you are going to convince?
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:36:26
has very few real users.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:57:12
No one has ever used BU in production.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:02:27
I didn't claim Hal is Satoshi. Szabo is someone else.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:06:39
It has begun.

Everyone who supports SegWit2x automatically supports BIP148.

Satoshi has pretty much been confirmed to be Nick Shabo (forum post timestamps establishing Satoshi lived in the East Coast, word usage matching almost perfectly, old achieved blog posts which were later modified). The second answer on the following page gives a pretty good summary: 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:34:27
It's pretty unlikely considering that the timestamps, vocabulary etc. don't match with Finney. Maybe Nick Szabo was framed, but I somehow doubt that.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:30:30
UASF. That's how Satoshi used to do soft forks and that's also how SegWit should be activated.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:31:14
If this backroom deal goes through, it means Bitcoin is no different than any other coin. It will have a terrible long-term impact. Decentralization is really the thing Bitcoin has going for it. Without it, why not just use Ripple?
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:58:06
A contentious hard fork is definitely not the best way to ensure a rally. That said, I think Bitcoin will survive, and it should appreciate in the long term.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:08:52
Bitcoin has no manual. You are free to use it however you want, including forking yourself off the network as Jihan seems to desire.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:11:57
What about you use PayPal instead of trying to create an identical copy of it?

You don't have to cash out everything at once. I don't think any crypto billionaire is that stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:32:49
Yes, it was the first truly permissionless cryptocurrency. It is still the most permissionless currency right now (although there are forces trying to change this).

This guy is a con artist. Anyone who observed Litecoin's SegWit activation knows that.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:47:57
No, the reorganization threat is still needed until SegWit is actually activated.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:48:46
And they didn't even mention ASICBoost. Wow.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:55:37
Core is not a miner. Core cannot force miners to choose a certain blocksize. Bitmain is free to increase the blocksize of the blocks they mine, but the catch is that they need to find someone who will accept those blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:55:50
The game theory of Bitcoin assumes that 51% attacks are not profitable. Such miners would be fired very quickly, and they would lose their hardware investments.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:29:15
No, BIP9 was the mistake. Satoshi never did miner-activated forks, and neither should we now. This whole mess would have been avoided if SegWit used BIP8.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:33:08
It is a descendant of BIP34, which was authored by Gavin Andresen...
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:04:24
BIP9 is not going to be used any more. It has been replaced by BIP8.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:42:18
Nick Szabo is an American of Hungarian descent. The other potential candidates, such as Finney, don't match with the metadata.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:36:28
By now I think we can all agree that the whole battle has been about ASICBoost. At least disable it in Core.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:09:13
It still depends on Jihan not blocking it (sadly we can't get 80% without him).
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:41:01
Then why aren't they doing this HF increase? Maybe because their work would be useless without users. If they don't follow the will of the users, they should expect a change of PoW.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:57:03
Fermat never proved any of his assertions, and he was always correct. It was his style to leave the proof to the reader. However, in this case, I believe he had an incomplete proof in mind.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:04:47
A necessary condition for me to even consider that proposal is that ASICBoost is eliminated once and for all so this situation doesn't happen again.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:26:44
I want to see how the situation will look like when SegWit is activated before I commit to a HF. Maybe LN with 1 MB blocks is enough for now?
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:14:21
Did someone say ICO?
