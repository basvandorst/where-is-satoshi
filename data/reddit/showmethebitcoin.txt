This is my first time listing a product there; I'm very excited!
I posted these two weeks ago and had a few takers, but I thought Amazon might be a good secure way to go.
Here's my old post for reference:

It's a little late for Christmas but my idea for reusable cold storage wallets has finally arrived!
My relatives always used to give me commerative U.S. coins in fancy boxes as a nice collectable at Christmas. I was looking for something similar to do with bitcoins. Folding up an ink-jet printer printout doesn't seem to have the same feeling of legitimacy.
With that in mind, I had some of these made up (see picture.)
I also wanted something I could carry around for receiving payments and displaying a QR code. A paper wallet might be easier for somebody new to bitcoin, and the plastic window would keep it protected.
This is also my first attempt at an online store so if there are any issues I'd be happy to address them here.
Does have any interest in something like this?

It's a little rough, but I made my address checking tool into a mobile formatted website. I only have a Galaxy Note 3 at the moment, but I set the viewport size pretty low.
You "save" your addresses by adding a bookmark - all the info needed by this website app is stored in the hash portion of the url.
If it doesn't work on your phone, please let me know!
Edit: It uses blockchain.org for the value estimation and most of the figures
Also, anybody know how to remove the image associated with this link in reddit? I didn't intend for that to happen.
To see it pre-formatted with an address, try this link:

I got sick of logging in to blockchain every time I wanted to check on my paper wallet public addresses so I wrote a jQuery utility to take care of it for me.
This thing only uses public data, so you can use it to check your own wallets or monitor other addresses (such as charity accounts.)
It's manual refresh right now since I didn't want to spam blockchain.
Enjoy! Please comment if you find bugs or have suggestions =)
There's a link for a standalone html version you can use which plays nicer with phones and removes the extra site stuff.
Also, I wanted to MIT license this, but I wasn't really sure how to do that. Is it just a comment in the files?

Getting banned would mess up PayPal in my store, which I use mainly to print shipping labels at home. I guess I could always make a new account for that.
Do you have an suggestions for marketplaces? I already posted here once, and I was going to try bitcointalk . I got a UPC code so I can list them on Amazon, but aside from Ebay I don't know of that many other markets.
Thanks for the comment.

There's a bunch on there now, is it just not yet banned?

Well reddit's an open forum, so you're entitled to your opinion. The function of most products can be achieved by alternate means but most people aren't going to go all Ron Swanson on it. Comparing making something by hand (i.e. etsy) with less features (no plastic window, metal emblem, engraving plate) to a piece of leather seems unnecessarily hostile but I'm probably just taking it personally.
Thanks for your opinion; if you saw these up close I think you might change your mind.

Yes I agree! I mention multiple times on the site that only BIP38 keys should be carried in the wallet.
If the wallet is going to sit in a deposit box or something for safe keeping, it's probably ok to keep private keys in it.

I was definitely going for the cop thing. It really does look like a badge (it's gold plated.) I'm not sure what it would take to block RFID. One of those ESD mylar bags wouldn't cut it I guess.
I wanted to throw in my lot with Bitcoins which is why it doesn't have a paper money slot. I'm sorry to lose a sale, but I think it makes more of a statement not having a slot for fiat. It's a specialized wallet, not a transition; you could just use a regular wallet and my wallet insert for that.
It's more like a checkbook cover -- specialized purpose, used for when you intend to buy something.
Thanks for the comment.

Thanks, I'm glad you like it! I also split mine across paper wallets so this is my balance tracker. I'm not really sure how to get more people to see this.

My diploma is like 10" x 14", maybe your diploma looks like a wallet? ;)
