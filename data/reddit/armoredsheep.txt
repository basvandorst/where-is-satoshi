OK well I actually do see Gemini but not Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:16:45
Ah OK brilliant. Thank you!

Nice find, thank you.

I'm fairly new to Reddit. I suppose we should keep talking on this thread to make it active. As it gets upvoted it will snowball.
I think the next step aside from that ^ is contacting someone who works on the lightning network? Or talk to someone on GitHub.

Any time. OK, the higher fee will speed up confirmations on the Bitcoin network but isn't necessary to get the transaction through. The "wallet out of sync" issue is a Mycelium problem. If you had canceled the transaction and sent again with a low fee you should have been fine. As long as it doesn't give you that "wallet out of sync" response". That is just a matter of waiting on Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:53:10
Yes. I canceled the transaction and tried again about 3 days later and it worked. I believe this is a Mycelium issue and not a network issue. Trezor didn't have the same issue. Mycelium is on the cusp of launching it's biggest update ever so they have a lot on their hands.

Meh... $10 is a nice hamburger where I live. I will gladly spend $20 or more to boost development. Plus, that fee goes to the miners which is good for Bitcoin as a whole. LETS FUND THE MINERS AND LIGHTNING NETWORK AT THE SAME TIME W00T!

This is showing a balance of 0 lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:04:12
Ah OK. Well thanks for clearing that up
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:33:34
I want accurate information to make decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:26:32
You mean so we could donate to them as well and speed up ease of use on iPhones?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:06:51
Thanks for responding. 
Texas and Trezor (recently got off mycelium)

When will the first contracts mature?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:21:46
How do i do that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:00:48
Yes I'm already on it. I'm sending emails out to people on GitHub
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:57:14
How do we know this was actually Andreas? OH WAIT! YOU SPELLED HIS NAME WRONG!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:48:55
Good idea as well
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:45:55
Thank you. I am searching my address on that link but i'm confused by the results. It yields 2 options when I search-BTC and BCH. Underneath both of those it says "no results". But when I click on them it brings up a huge list of all the history involving that address. I was expecting to see a transaction history and current balance.
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:08:33
Interesting. What is the make and model? When you say "better" are you talking about more powerful and efficient, or easier to use?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:12:22
Hmmm OK. Well yes I'm sure I had coins on there before 1 August. I'll keep trying
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:31:57
Looks like they did and then they resubmitted it with a decision somewhere around 04/2/19...
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:10:50
Or switch wallets...

Are there any "New Collar" programs for Bitcoin coding similar to "codeup" or something of that nature? A 12-18 week coding boot camp to be a paid Bitcoin dev?
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:16:23
That scenario doesn't exist. But what you really seem to be asking is "does Bitcoin have use outside of speculative investing?" To which I say yes. It has proven to be useful as a store of value. It functions as a neutral currency and money, and currency. But it's not just about people "buying in". It's also about people using it. Many people earn it and use it. In such cases, the appreciation of value doesn't really matter as long as it retains it's value.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:11:51
Oh sarcasm I'm crushed :(
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:33:26
It IS because of technology. It is not speculation on thin air. It is betting on the chance that Bitcoin will continue to do what it has been doing. SURVIVING AND GROWING. It is the IMMUTABLE BLOCKCHAIN. It is the single most powerful computing force on the planet that uses the most energy of any network on the planet. NO OTHER SYSTEM OFFERS THAT. Nothing is as important as the ability to withstand attack. That is what security is. Transaction speed, privacy, ease of use... all of these qualities are worthless if you cant trust the system. TRUST comes from immutability. Immutability comes from time tested, open source, code with money at stake and HASH RATE on a purely proof of work public blockchain. PEOPLE ARE INVESTING BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL THE SYSTEM CAN DELIVER AND BECAUSE OF WHAT IT HAS ALREADY ACHIEVED. Your welcome. Thank you. Done.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:08:27
It has proven itself by maintaining, for nine years, an immutable public blockchain which is currently worth over $125 billion dollars. It has continued to grow it's computing power even after becoming the most powerful computing force on the planet.... by far.... That's why people have bought into it. And that's why they continue. No other system comes anywhere close to matching Bitcoin on computing power and energy consumption. No other crypto has protected an equal amount of money for an equal amount of time. People buy Bitcoin because they trust the system. They trust the system because it has proven itself, over time, with real money.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:17:46
Are you saying there is no value in taking a course?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:11:26
Proven track record of resisting all attacks. I never said it wasn't a bubble. A bubble can burst and continue. Hype can over extend the price. My point is that the reason for the hype is founded in the fact that Bitcoin has proven itself, not simply because of bandwagon mentality.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:16:19
Here are two similar definitions of a bubble: 
 Investopedia.com: A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction. It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, a massive selloff occurs, causing the bubble to deflate.
 Wikipedia: An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.
Bubble like behavior has been portrayed, in the market as a whole and in the price of Bitcoin. But I would say Bitcoin is not a bubble, based on these two definitions, because much of the hype is based on fundamental value, which I stated before is a system that offers trust and security by utilizing time tested code and an unrivaled amount of computing power. Volatility does not = bubble. But more importantly, nowhere in anyones definition of bubble does it say that the asset or market is doomed. So to call Bitcoin a bubble is extremely vague. How long before it bursts? After it bursts, is it gone for good or will it start a new growth cycle? How long will the next growth cycle be and how high will the price go? What is the actual intrinsic value of Bitcoin anyway?.......... Only time will tell. To call it a bubble and bet against it is just as much a speculation as the alternative-maybe even more, because so far the track record has been growth and more growth and it spreads like a virus and it survives like a Tardigrade.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:14:52
But do you refute my point? Probably not because it's fact on top of fact. Most computing power and energy consumption-FACT. Most time tested code with largest pool of capital at stake-FACT. Reason for hype is FACTS.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:34:33
We're all in different positions. This is my voice. I posted this in hopes of comforting people and encouraging them that Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:49:09
It creates an alternative, global, monetary and economic system that can be trusted without a central authority, that has enormous value. 
For the most part it is not anonymous and doesn't need to be.
It is currently 650% higher in price than it was last year, during what is arguably It's "worst ever slump"-that is outstanding! Furthermore, amid the current price drop, an incredible amount of growth has been happening in the area of technology development (creates jobs), participants entering the network (exchanges and traders), and computing power entering the network. So even when the price takes a huge hit, the network still grows and becomes stronger-the exact opposite of your claim that all interest is because of the price.

I've always listened closely to Andreas because his information regarding Bitcoin is of the highest level. I disagree with much of his political opinions, which are relevant to Bitcoin. It seems as though he thinks the US should have no borders and should accept overflowing amounts of undocumented immigrants. He supports the incentive based, competition driven, ecosystem of selfishness that makes Bitcoin robust, yet somehow steam comes out of his ears when the most capitalistic people protect their interests. This is life-to listen to everyone, recognize their good information and use it, then recognize their mistakes and learn from them. The same goes for my father, mother, brother, sister, and everyone I know. MAGA! MEGA! (Make Earth Great Again). I support Bitcoin and I support America the America first agenda.

Thanks for the link. This confirms the May 21 date I had in my memory.
Are you asking how the ETF works? It's not forks of Bitcoin, it is actual Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:10:22
Google's definition of ETF: "a type of investment fund that is traded on a stock exchange."
Investopedia.com says that most ETF are a basket of securities, but some are more focused than others. Perhaps this would be the first ETF focused on a single "security" (Bitcoin is property?). The goal of this ETF seems simple; to enable institutional investment in Bitcoin. So it seems like it is basically a workaround the current regulatory structure. Whatever the case may be, the fact that so many ETF have been filed is a signal of demand and interest. I am aware of some of the potentially negative long term effects of an ETF, but as far as the price goes, I believe it would be a monster bull trigger.
