The first public release was released one week after the genesis block. That is literally a pre-mine.

Sorry, but Bitcoin was pre-mined for a week. Let's not rewrite history.

I think SegWit is a reasonable compromise for now. Since there is a limit to how low block time can go, larger blocks would eventually be necessary anyway. However, there should be more discussion about how to increase the block frequency in the long term, possibly including the concept of microblocks.

The block frequency can be increased by a softfork, giving many more advantages and also avoiding a hardfork. What is the point of this besides politics?

You are essentially buying votes, but I have nothing against that, votes are nothing other than a commodity.

This is good. The current hashrate is still no match for the NSA.

Running a node is a form of public expression.

Web apps have better privacy than apps from a centralized app store. Why do you need another middleman?

Why are larger blocks preferable to more frequent blocks? If larger blocks are implemented, it will be much more difficult to increase the block frequency in the future (where there are advances to be made).
