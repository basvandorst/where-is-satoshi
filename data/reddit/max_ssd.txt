There is plenty of opposition, only thing is, its so pathetic and antipatriotic that anyone who has a bit of brain will vote against them. What would you say about so-called politicians in the states that would advocate for giving Texas and California to Mexico? Or give Alaska back to Russia? Braindead, right? No one would vote for them. However, russian opposition is all about giving away Crimea to americans, or giving the Kurili islands to Japan. Who in their right mind would say things like that if they would want to be elected? You seem to be brainwashed by western media and can not think for yourself. Its ok, there are may of you.

"Dictatorship is a form of government in which a country or a group of countries is ruled by one person (a dictator) or by a polity and power is exercised through various mechanisms to ensure that the entity's power remains strong."
- If you had any clue as to how that country is ran, you would not say that. But, you do not.

Omg, you are so full of yourself. Putin is not a dictator, he says,  in this very video, "stone age ended not because people were out of stones, but because the new technologies came about". For stupid, he says that Russia should embrace new technology and get on with the times. Or left far behind. There is no fear, there is huge interest.

If you are an adept of western media, then, i suppose, you would be very surprised to hear, Russian Federation has a democracy, may be even more than states for that matter. 
"The 1993 constitution declares Russia a democratic, federative, law-based state with a republican form of government." - wiki.
