The problem with alts is this:
1) Satoshi built BTC with no intention of profitting from it - but most popular altcoins are looking to create wealth for the creators - herein lies the incentive to lie, pump, short  and essentially manipulate the coin.
2) The biggest problem with cryptocurrencies was double spending. After solving that problem, none of the other coins solve anything useful enough. Who needs smart contracts anyway? Most alt-coins don't have a USP

Without proof of work, you can just recreate the entire blockchain with whatever fudging you want.

Do you understand how bitcoin works?
There is no way to declare it illegal in any sane manner.
No one knows that you own bitcoin - it cant be proved - even if the governments demand that exchanges tell them who bought, and which address it ended up in, they cannot prove it is your address.
If exchanges are shut down, people will trade in cash.
Right now they are just rattling the sabers, because someone is scared.
The official statement is "Bitcoin is not legal tender in India" - meaning that a registered business cannot trade goods and services and receive bitcoin as payment (this is to prevent tax evasion)

What is a foolproof protocol for exchanging cash for bitcoins face to face?
(assume S &amp; B are buyer and seller)
I learned of multisign wallets:
1. Make a 2 party wallet
2. S makes a transaction and signs it
3. B copies transaction to his device
4. B pays cash to S
5. S signs the transaction and gets the BTC
The flaw in this is at (4) I could punch the lights out of S and skip to step 5
Another way is I get my friend to lock us both in a room until everyone is satisfied.
But again, the "punch the lights out" scenario is possible.
It seems like its impossible to do without a mutually trusted third party - but how can you trust a third party with cash?

20 years is a very long term - The new world order will be upon us by then.
But there may be wisdom in that - it may be the time when fiat currency is mostly obsolete, and most of the wealth in the world is spread among cryptocurrencies.
It's kind of like the first proto-humans who collected gold because it was shiny, and then suddenly found that another tribe was trading large amounts of meat and sex for that shiny stuff.

You cannot replace fiat without having centralization.
Things like loans require identity and centralization. Unless there is a cryptocurrency (CC)  which is like a bank account (fully linked to identity) traditional uses of money (lending) is impossible.
Identity linked cryptocurrency will need centralization, and centralized cryptocurrencies will never be accepted, it's only as good as regular money.
So the two systems will have to co-exist. If they co-exist, CC has to keep rising against fiat, because fiat requires inflation to work. The fact that fiat inflates makes CC even more valuable, so it deflates CCs. This is a vicious cycle.
I do not see any way out unless fiat itself becomes deflationary and is limited in supply forever. If that happens then there is a balance between the two.
Between any two currencies, if one is more valuable, everyone moves to that that and causes it to get more desirable - its positive feedback.

Some of us believe so - some of us are doing what you say.
We think that the desirability of BTC as a store of value trumps every other asset.
Fiat can only go down versus BTC - massive economic upheavals may occur, but probably many years from now - the banking systems and economies are too large to topple.
Meanwhile bitcoin seems too large to topple now.
As long as they co-exist the prices will keep going up.

Cryptocurrencies work by natural selection.
The most popular one evolves the fastest. 
LTC seems to be popular, ETH too, but outside of that nothing else will be able to grow in the shadow of BTC.

Coinbase is not a wallet - coinbase is a company that lets you buy/sell and manages wallets for you. It requires your trust that it wont suddenly vanish.
In some ways it is exactly like a bank that exchanges currencies.
But keeping your bitcoin addresses with someone else destroys one of the main points of bitcoin. It's what banks do with cash, and we all know how well we can trust them

I don't even think TA can predict even regular stock prices of companies (which have clear real world indicators of performance - like launch of a new product)
If so called financial experts were really capable of predicting things based on only price numbers, why on earth would they sell their "secrets" and skill to others?
True gurus like Buffet just buy stocks that they believe in and HODL
If you read the book "The misbehavior of markets" you will see Benoit Mandelbrot, the genius mathematician take down all the pseudo science that so called economists have been peddling about predicting markets.

bitcoin will never completely replace fiat.
If its always rising, then there is going to be a pressure for people to sell, to spend the money...
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:49:09
Since lost bitcoins are unusable, they are essentially destroyed
Which means that the total supply of BTC diminished, and the value increased. 
This means that the value eventually gets distributed among the remaining coins.
Think about it in money terms - if you destroy half the money supply, the value of the remaining money adjusts over time to 2x of its value.
Losing BTC is like giving everyone else who owns it a small gift 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:59:37
Nonsense... You're just scamming

As of now, the transaction costs of bitcoin are too high to do microtransactions - it is not yet sure how that problem will be solved.
Leaving that aside, its not impossible to come up with a scheme in Etherum that makes digital redeemable IOUs - The payer will generate an IOU with the receivers address on it, and the receiver uploads that IOU onto the network to get it into the system.
It's not unlike a signed check - obviously there are issues with bounced checks and so on - if you are outside the network, you always have the limitation of not having the absolute knowlegde of whether anyone is overspending or not.
There are many ways to mitigate these problems, they will come up when the need arises.

There's no such thing as "coins stored right on the wallet"
Coins are stored across all bitcoin nodes across the world - all the wallet stores is your private and public keys
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:36:51
The most ethical thing to do is to post the public key and ask the owner of that to prove it was them
There is a way to make payment requests - the person who owns that wallet can make one for the 800$ - fees.
Then you can be a good samaritan and send it back.

Lets consider this from a money angle.
Leaving aside money multipliers like fractional reserve.... Assume a country has 1 billion currency notes of 1000 doubloons.
What happens when you burn half of them?
The people who owned the destroyed notes lose, and since the nothing changed about the value of the buyable goods and services in the country, the value of the doubloon slowly adjusts until it reaches half the previous value.
This does not happen instantly, but it eventually irons out.
So the value of the "lost" money gets distributed among the remaining notes.
The exact opposite happens when government prints new doubloons - the government profits (free money). But the remaining doubloons in the country reduce in value.
TLDR: Lost coins end up increasing the value of the remaining coins.

You realize that this system is only Positive to both parties or negative to one party?
Is there an any incentive to harm others when you get no profit from that action?
Such people are usually incapable of thriving in society.
Also since there is no anonymity here - the two parties have to collaborate to initiate the trade - hence reputation will be ruined if someone simply locks up someone else's funds
Cheating only happens if one person can profit at the expense of the other - this scheme doesn't allow that

Unfortunately, you cant buy everything with BTC yet. In fact you can buy very little outside of the US with it.

You can never have only one currency in the world whether its dollars or BTC - because any material object is currency, including the bits of the blockchain.
Standardization of value is exactly the same way the dollar or any other currency was standardized - based on some previous currency like Joachims Thaler or the pound sterling, and eventually down to precious metal.
Bitcoin can never completely replace physical cash, any more than cash has replaced other commodities like silver or gold completely.
Right now BTC is a volatile commodity - so it varies wrt to stable currencies like the dollar. 
If a currencies value increases, people will have to adjust prices - If BTC is 10000$ today and 20000$ next month, it's not that a 10000$ value item will be sold for 20000$ worth of BTC next month if it was being sold for 1 BTC today.
Prices are always adjusted for fluctuating currencies - inflation is doing it all the time....
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:58:52
You lack a fundamental understanding of money.
Currencies in countries are often scaled up or down - like in Romania, the new RON was made equal to 10000 of the old LEI.
That doesn't mean prices rose by 10000x
Currencies are always based on some standard - for now the USD is the standard for BTC - so if a burger costs 12$, you give 12$ worth of bitcoin at that point of time.
Just like if you paid in rupees, you pay whatever rupees is worth 12$
