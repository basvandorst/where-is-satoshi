Hi everyone. 
We've just released a new version of Boilr, a free (as in freedom) price alarm app for Android  Last year we received some good tips around here on reddit, that's why I am coming up with this announcement. 
As always, feel free to check out the source code and open issue reports or feature request at our GitHub:

Our current solution as no server side, the application does all the tracking and processing by itself locally.
We have talked a lot about having a server side which would greatly improve battery efficiency and reduce data consumption, since most of the data processing would be on the server, but our vision for Boilr was to be standalone and independent application. While it's unlikely that something like that will happen, keep an eye on our github for further developments. 
We have no ideia how Boilr behaves with Doze, feel free to give a try and report back.

Had never thought about it, but it does seem an interesting idea. IFTTT is still building their "Channel Platform", until it's finished is nothing we can do. We've subscribed to their news feed and will keep an eye on it.

At the moment we haven't planned an IOS port. because we don't have iPhones or Macs to work with. That's one of the few things we will have to sort out before advancing into an IOS port.
Keep an eye on our social media and for further developments.
