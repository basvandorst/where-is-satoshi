What are you talking about? 25,000 bitcoins where dumped onto the exchange ALL from the same wallet. Then 25,000 where picked back up 30 minutes later.

Nothing! Ha I woke up sitting at 8,600 then next thing i know my auto sale notification ringed meaning 9k was hit, I log on and see a Monster spike and assumed I sold too soon, before I can buy back in the damn thing tanks to 8,100 in 10 minutes! 
... shit clearly went down
