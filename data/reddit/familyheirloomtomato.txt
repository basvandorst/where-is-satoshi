It's for the noob "investors" who see the price dive a bit and sell.

cool story bro
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:26:38


Bullshit. It isn't being traded as a currency. It's being traded like a commodity. It is only worth the electricity used to mine it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:50:33
Give up on Bitcoin as a currency. It's garbage. It failed at the most basic task of a functional currency - transferring money timely and reliably.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:21:30
lol. Bitcoin has been around for YEARS and only just 3 months ago hit 8500. What makes that the new bottom?

A bot losing money?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:38:56
how much was the transaction fee?

What a perfect way for them to be scammed out of $50.

Can you explain? I'm not watching it that closely. I'm only interested in it crashing so gamers can buy gpus again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:49:20
Buy High Sell Low is what grampy always used to say.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:53:00
Hopefully. Then I can finally get a gaming gpu.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:20:49
So how isn't that people cutting their losses? Someone is losing money.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:34:55


I'd venture to say... no.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:41:33
Except Dave Ramsey would never invest in a single stock.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:55:20
People who think they are cutting their losses. (Who the hell bought at $18k??)
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:33:39
Bad analogy. That might make sense from a consumer standpoint. From a business standpoint, why would I accept bitcoin if it's so volatile? I don't have time to decide when to exchange, and I can't take the risk of it losing value. I'll stick with a stable currency like the USD.
Even if everyone that I do business with accepts BTC, I still wouldn't touch it unless I could instantly exchange for something more stable. Then what's the point of BTC? It's just a middleman for exchanging fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:30:04
People profited from beanie babies without understanding them.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:23:46
ctrl+f "invest" on the article, 14 results. This is why I can't get behind bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:08:48
He said that because he has vested interest in the future of bitcoin. He is advising a bitcoin startup. He will say whatever it takes to get people to invest in this fad. He doesn't have to provide a reason because it's right there.
In other news, Amazon.com investors think share prices will skyrocket by 2015. Invest now!!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:26:35
Exactly, which is why I laugh when people say it should be used as a currency. If I could be guaranteed that it wouldn't change by +/-1% then I would get behind it. Everyone else wants to get rich off of it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:34:18
PLEASE don't do anything with bitcoin before you learn more about it. You are asking elementary questions that could be answered with a couple days of research.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:57:18
No, nobody can lose money on bitcoin. That's the genius of it!
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:55:01
So a magazine completely dedicated to bitcoin has a price in USD? This is why I don't believe in it. You can't even print the price because it's so volatile.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:41:11
Again, USD is fairly stable. Not getting into the whole Fiat thing right now, but the $10 I earned last year buys me pretty much the same this year. Can't say that about bitcoin. Why would I want to exchange them if they are going to be worth 100x in a week/month/year? (or worse, keep them if they are worth 100x less)
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:10:33
Have you seen the retail checkout process for that? [It looks awful.](
I've personally seen merchants have trouble with Square, which uses traditional credit cards. I can't imagine them figuring out bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:38:11
Yes, they are setting a precedence so that you can't buy stuff with bitcoin in future apps. That would bypass their greedy hands.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:04:14
That's cool, getting closer to where it needs to be. Too bad it's a proprietary POS terminal.
When can I pay with NFC?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:30:50
...back them up like anything else on your HDD that you want to keep?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:39:05
Yeah but distributing "unauthorized" apps isn't exactly elegant to the average user.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:28:38


By using this language, you are treating bitcoin like an investment, not a currency. This totally contradicts the rest of your post.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:33:04
If I sell goods for $100 worth of BTC, and in 2 weeks it is worth $10, I have lost. With how volatile it is right now, this could totally happen. People won't accept BTC as a currency unless this is fixed.
Can you make a solid argument against that?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:52:56
It's part of the fad lifecycle. Rappers need to stay "cool" so they have to hop on these fads while they are still rising. Bitcoin is a fad that will die like beanie babies did.
I mean the short-term speculative bullshit. I have hope for the long-term viability of cryptocurrency.
[Look at this chart and tell me it's not a fad.](
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:22:18
My point is that bitcoin isn't viable as a currency as it is right now because of this.
3-5 years? *maybe*. 10 years? More likely.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:56:55
What does it solve for you?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:35:48
Google will do the same as Apple if they see their in-app purchase profits decline. I guarantee it. It's not about bitcoin, it's about bypassing their cut of the purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:45:18
Lets get a bunch of people with vested interest in bitcoin to put out headlines about it.
They quote Steve Kirsch who is advising a "stealth" (unnamed) bitcoin startup. They also quote Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital who is invested in CoinBase.
You guys are being spoon-fed this bullshit and eating it like junkies. The headline could have been this quote straight from the article: **there is a really good chance it’ll go to zero**. Hmm, I wonder why they chose the 1000x part?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:38:43
How soon until Google does the same thing?
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:11:36
... have fun with that... I'm gonna buy some beanie babies on ebay.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:29:20
You aren't buying it as a currency, you are buying it as a fad investment. Don't do it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:12:37
That isn't a solid argument against the fact that if I accept bitcoin today, it could be worth a fraction tomorrow. Businesses can't get behind that.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:25:03
That is EXACTLY the mindset I am pointing out, bitcoin is a GAMBLE. It is not a currency in its current state.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:17:52
Not really, look how complicated this is. It requires two devices, a solid internet connection, two people who know what they are doing, and more time than traditional methods. 
I've had trouble paying with Square which uses traditional credit cards, I can't imagine anyone using this.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:39:32
Ok, so Beanie Babies were a big fad in the 90's. Little palm sized stuffed animals. For some reason, people went nuts over them and they started selling for hundreds of dollars. Then the "market" collapsed and they were worth what they should be, a couple bucks each.
Save yourself some cash and don't give in to the bitcoin fad.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:37:47
They aren't anti-bitcoin, they are protecting their cut of in-app purchases.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:26:53
It isn't about the programmers, it's the sysadmins (and/or the people who handle security). In this particular case, it was a hosting company, not Bitcoin Central, that caused the problem.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:13:45
I didn't write it, don't ask me. It's from the article.

If you are in the US, it might comfort you to know that Coinbase is from San Francisco, and are backed by investors ($6 million). They aren't a fly-by-night scam out of Nigeria.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:38:19


So it's slower than a credit card.


However your wallet isn't FDIC insured like your checking/savings account is. If something happens, you are screwed.


Not like you can with cold hard cash! Bitcoin has a public transaction log, cash doesn't.

$10 USD that I earned last year is the same $10 this year (less because of inflation, but not even close to as volatile as bitcoin).
People don't want to gamble on a means of exchange that varies so much.
