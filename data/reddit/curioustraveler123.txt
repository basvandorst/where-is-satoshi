Well, I feel silly cashing my 401k + IRA for bitcoin over Christmas. RIP early retirement.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:29:54
What is bitcoin backed by? I've learned that one of the downsides to fiat currency is that, well, it's just made up - it's backed by nothing. Is it the blockchain that makes it different? Serious question, just trying to learn.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:12:05
You sure can. My bank gives me three options: overdraft (no charge, you just pay interest on the amount overdrafted), decline charge, or pull money from savings account. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:03:35
Here’s the thing tho: bitcoin wants to be a long term store of value, right? A safe haven similar to gold. Well, who is going to store any value in bitcoin if it has all of the stability and wild price fluctuations as penny stocks?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:37:35
We’ve well recovered since 08.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:26:25
Penny stocks for sure, but I wouldn’t lump all of the stock market into that.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:15:47
I’d say exchanges play a very important role, though... it’s hard to buy and sell without a market.

So Lightning Network... I see how this would help with fixed spending (I usually shop at the same grocery store, get gas at the station that's most convenient, etc.), but the total number of monthly fixed transactions are fairly small.
In my case, I go grocery shopping twice a month, fill up on gas once a week, and have fixed monthly payments like insurance, mortgage, etc. Let's say 10 transactions become 6 with LN.
The rest of my spending is sporadic: I feel like Indian food, let's see what's good on Yelp. Oh look, there's that ice cream place I've heard about, let's give it a try.  Oh I need cough medicine, where's the closest drug store?
Am I going to be opening up one-time ledgers with these businesses and the broadcasting to the blockchain right away? If so, how does this decrease transaction load.
Am I missing something?

@_date: 2018-02-25 10:35:34
I don’t buy it - if the point is to hedge against inflation, why not just buy an actually stable asset like TIPS? It’s maintained its value relative to fiat currencies because: A. There is a massive bubble that’s in the process of deflating, and B. Currencies aren’t designed to increase in value. A better comparison would be investing in Bitcoin vs technology stocks. Bitcoin had a much greater ROI compared to the tech sector, but the tech sector also hasn’t lost half its value since Christmas.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:55:36
To be fair, nobody ever said it was a _good_ store of value.

Probably need some central planning, a government organization to oversee monetary policy, stuff like that.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:08:01
In this case inflation works in your favor: you’re taking out a loan in 2020 dollars and repaying them in 2030, 2040, and 2050 dollars. 
The other thing is, your home is not going to be worth what it was 30 years ago when you bought it. It’s going to appreciate and will most likely compensate for whatever you paid in interest. 
Also: don’t buy a home using a 30 year mortgage that stretches your ability to repay it. You don’t need a 400k house unless you’re already wealthy. Save up a 20% down payment, figure out a 15 year mortgage that comfortably fits in your budget, make sure you have the rest of your financial situation in order before signing anything, and chances are you’ll be golden. 
These are like, worst case, self inflicted scenarios you’re cooking up and then yelling slavery. At least with our current system people are able to responsibly finance a house. I have yet to hear a reasonable answer for how a lending system would work with with a deflationary currency, I mean, store of value like bitcoin.

If a person doesn't have access to a traditional bank, bitcoin is not going to help them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:09:13
What are you even talking about? Nobody just holds cash, man, you invest in stocks and bonds. You save a small emergency fund of cash and put the rest in investments that will easily outpace inflation. $1 in the Dow invested in 1930 would be worth more than $1,000 today. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:17:30
Bitcoin is a highly speculative commodity, not really a safe haven... If people are spooked, they're probably going to be cutting back on luxuries and non-essentials, making sure all their essentials are covered, and holding as much cash as they can. You can't pay your mortgage in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:46:00
Good luck, friend! You'll have to convince these hodlers to part with their bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:49:35
How is bitcoin 0 risk? It could drop to zero overnight. Or it could climb to 100k tomorrow. It's a highly, highly speculative commodity.
It's the easiest thing in the world to find a free checking account. My bank provides ATM access, bill pay, and they'll even mail a physical check if I really need to... all for free.
Yes, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have done some shady things. They also got slapped HARD by regulators. [Look at what Yellen did](

Cash doesn’t do anyone any good if it’s just stashed under your mattress (or sitting in your private wallet). I feel like you’re describing a future where lending is expensive, hard to obtain, and only viable for very short terms.

You don’t have to be a connected super Wall Street banker to protect yourself from inflation. Just buy a bond fund if you want to be sure that your money is protected, or buy some index funds if you want to grow your money over time.

Well, if the U.S. economy tanks it's pretty safe to say that the rest of the world is in trouble too. If anything, I would see even more volatility which might bring in speculators... Not because Bitcoin is a safe haven, just because it's crashing and/or fluctuating wildly and people wanna gamble.

@_date: 2018-02-17 20:50:57
If a person is willing to take steps to correct their credit there are ways to do this. You can get a prepaid credit card that reports to the credit bureaus every month. Eventually you'll repair your credit to a point where you can open a starter credit card. Keep using that (paying your statement in full every month) long enough and your score is going to keep climbing. 
If somehow you're not able to open a free checking account, you could open a Serve or Bluebird account that gives you free access to bill pay, direct deposits, and free ATM withdrawals. 
There are also "second chance" checking accounts that you can open and rebuild your reputation.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:26:52
So I need to go to college. I'm going to take out a 50 BTC loan when Bitcoin is worth $100 a coin.
In four years I graduate and it's time to start repaying my loan. Well, crap, it looks like BTC is now worth $20,000 a coin which means that my original $50,000 loan is now $1,000,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:44:19
It has been an excellent store of value so far, but it’s also extremely risky. “Storing value” usually means that you need to be confident that your value will be there when you need it. Right now it’s nothing more than a highly speculative asset. If bitcoin was actually stable at $10k and only fluctuated a few percentage points a year, do you think we would still have the volume of people trading it? I doubt it - people are here for the thrill of striking it rich, if it’s about as interesting as trading bonds people will lose interest fast.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:10:13
Nah man, I think we should call our bank and ask them to confirm every item on our shopping list. That seems more reasonable to me.

If a company has millions of dollars of cash on hand they don’t just have a savings account with an X million dollar balance. They’ll use repurchase agreements or short term treasuries to gain interest and keep up with inflation. Likewise, if you’re a millionaire you’re not going to keep your money in cash. You’ll have stocks and bonds. Criminals would be the most likely category to stockpile cash, but, I don’t really care if they have trouble because they’re criminals, ya know?
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:20:14
Well, that's why people buy stocks and bonds. They do something useful with their money rather than just letting it sit under their mattress doing nothing.
Keep some in your checking account, have an emergency fund, put the rest in assets that will appreciate. 
As for a world currency based on bitcoin, look at some of the issues the EU has had with the Euro. Now imagine that instead of Greece and Italy being the weak links, it's Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

It really has nothing to do with purchasing bitcoin. Banks just don't want you to purchase any type of cash or cash equivalent. Try walking into a bank and buying a roll of quarters with your credit card. Banks also get skittish if you try buying too many gift cards on credit. It opens them up to a lot of issues with money laundering, abuse of their rewards system, and other stuff.

If your bitcoin is worth 10,000 cybereuros when you initiate the loan, and 15,000 cybereuros when you repay it you’re still having to repay with a currency that is worth more. Just because the values in btc are the same doesn’t mean that it’s not worth more or less relative to other currencies.

@_date: 2018-02-04 19:54:29
Than you for your insight. I agree with everything you have said, except I believe we are actually in an inverse Fibonacci sequence and the chart will actually emerge as a rodeo clown with an eagle perched upon its head.

Bitcoin is down like 13%? Where’s the safe haven again?

So if I buy an ice cream cone from a random place I'm never going to shop at again... Am I still decreasing the load? Would they bundle my transaction with others, therefore broadcasting to the blockchain once?

If cash increases value even at a modest 2% a year, people are going to horde cash instead of keeping it somewhere that is beneficial to the economy (like stocks, bonds, or treasury notes)

Yes, I expect tether to be fully vindicated. Buy now before the jump.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:39:19
So you’ve got to convince people life with bitcoin is going to be better. Right now it’s just going to concentrate wealth even more. Why switch if we just have a bigger problem than we do now?
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:10:59
We’re a big community. I think even the hodlers could contribute... they could sell at a lower price and then immediately rebuy at a slightly higher price to help the price direction. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:11:20
So in this future, are all currencies placed by btc? It’s a world currency?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:05:08
Oh snap, 20%
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:00:10
Well, you've got to convince people that their lives would be better with a system based solely on bitcoin. Right now you're just saying, "yeah, there's probably going to be inequality, what of it?"
Are we going to have the mega wealthy living on Crypto Island with their Lambos while the rest of us try to improvise a viable economic system?  
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:49:01
So wealth concentrated to the few, to wealth concentrated to the very very very few.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:38:47
Hahaha... if everyone is rushing into bitcoin as a safe haven, why is it down so much today? USD is actually much stronger today because people are holding cash right now instead of stocks/bonds.

Gotta pay your taxes man
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:17:10
My opinion is bitcoin price is not related to anything with SegWit, LN, etc. It's mostly just speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:28:41
Thank you I put a lot of time and research into it.

Hahaha wow... okay, have fun.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:09:24
I think you're being a little paranoid here. Banks don't want you to buy _any_ cash equivalent on credit. Same reason you can't walk into a bank and buy a roll of quarters, pay off one credit card with another, buy high value gift cards, or buy stocks/bonds. They're not cracking down on crypto because they're afraid of it, they're just now realizing that they need to extend their existing rules to the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:56:31
Haha 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:46:30
Is this because banks aren’t allowing credit card purchases of bitcoin? If so, they won’t let you buy any other cash equivalent either. It’s not that they’re scared of bitcoin. Try going into a bank and asking to buy $1 coins with a credit card, see how it goes. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:03:52
Hoarding cash was a problem during the Great Depression.

I just love when I take out a $20,000 loan to buy a car and the next month after making my first payment I owe $60,000 and the month after that I owe $2,000.

The market price would drop as you started to sell.

Any truth if bitcoin being a safe haven for people looking to get out of the choppy stock/bond markets?

How does that give Bitcoin value?

How are loans going to work with a deflationary currency? What incentive do people have to loan money when they could just keep it and grow their money instead?

I know, right - My current bank is so inconvenient and oppressive. I'd better switch to Bitcoin.

1 doge is also 1 doge. It doesn’t mean you can buy anything meaningful with it.

Nobody ever talks about wealth inequality with bitcoin. If everyone started using it, wouldn’t the top 0.0000001% control most of the wealth basically?

FUD! Fake news!
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:16:37
How does lending work with a currency that increases in value? First off, the bank is not going to have incentive to loan money. They can just sit on it. Second, what are interest rates going to look like? Let’s say bitcoin increases 5% a good year (assuming it stabilizes). This is the rate that banks will receive if they sit on their money and do nothing. Now factor in the risks of people not repaying loans, etc, and we’re looking at what, 15-20% interest rates with good credit? 
Now let’s say you bought a house with a 15 year mortgage at 15%. In addition to the higher interest rate, you’re also having to repay a loan in a currency that is increasing in value. If you borrowed 10btc you’ll have to pay back 10btc, but instead of being worth 10k a coin when you started your loan they’re now worth 15k.
So you have higher interest rates overall, and you also have to repay your loan using a currency that is getting more valuable over time. 
In my opinion banking is going to be nonexistent or extremely expensive for anyone who wants to buy a house or a car without paying for it outright.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:38:16
My fault I wasn’t more precise:
Criminals store USD because they don’t have access to the banking system (not legally anyway). This is not ideal for them, but their money was also gathered illicitly so who cares.
Nobody stores large amounts of value in _USD_. People do store value in inflation protected cash equivalents 
Buying stocks/bonds is not limited to the wealthy. Anyone who spends 5 minutes on Google, prepares a tax return (you can receive your refund in bonds), or walks into a bank can easily start a retirement account. 
Hell, if you’re _only_ interested in combating inflation go to treasury direct.com and buy an i savings bond. Easy peasy!
