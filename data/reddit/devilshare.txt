After this incident the entire MtGox brand is dead and burried. Even if they magically paid everyone back their Bitcoin with interest noone would ever go near Gox again.
The fact that people have stored their money in MtGox after all the fuckups means I don't shed tears for the lost bitcoins :)

FUD... the leaked document which predicted all events which has unfolded afterwards is fake, is that what you think?

Wtf are you talking about? I am talking about a document that leaked that showed their strategy.
But GOX.com and rebrand themselves.
Shut down the MtGox site.
Etc. these things all happened very soon after the document leaked
STop being a fucktard

You mean more like 0.00005%?

Not just empty conjecture, traders lose way more daily and there is not a huge epidemic of suicides on wallstreet. Has it happened? Sure.
Due to MtGox? I 100% doubt it since issues are not even cleared up yet.

There's a bigger problem: 
Bitcoin was supposed to be a solution for billionaires in China who wanted to move big amounts of value out of the country, which today has a 500K restriction annually.
So they can't just wire more than 500K to some Bank in Slovenia, if they could they wouldn't need Bitcoin in the first place.
