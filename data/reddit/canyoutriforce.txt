I'd rather have a shot of espresso from a nice espresso machine. 
Aeropress is good if you're on a budget
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:48:27
[Sure, why not!](
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:09:57
So you think that 99.9% of the current currencies will be replaced by bitcoin? I believe in it as well, but this is just delusional in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:41:36
Can you eli5 this bearwhale thing?
@_date: 2014-04-25 09:20:29

@_date: 2015-01-14 15:28:39
This would actually be hilarious

The moment when you've been hodling for 2 years and decided to sell at 1100 because the next crash must be imminent
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:07:22
It's like saying more photos have been uploaded to the internet in the last week than in the first 15 years.
The growth is exponential
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:33:47
How is this supposed to work with banks and the stock market?
Can I sue every site that uses https?
Will my e-banking be unencryptes now?
@_date: 2016-10-06 07:38:24

@_date: 2013-12-10 20:38:15

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:38:15

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:20:51

@_date: 2013-11-20 11:05:11
I noticed this as well.
Paying 0.01 feels different from paying 5 bucks.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:39:16
I always thought a bitcoin is a really long key, something like a huge calculated prime number.
Can anybody ELI5 how it really is? And how you can split one coin into millions of parts?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:04:06
Any problems with bitcoin.de?
