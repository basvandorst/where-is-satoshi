I’m sorry but 5$ is still way too high. Many day to day purchases are less than that. Go bitcoin and all but LN and other scaling solutions can not come soon enough.

Yeh and we see that with a lot of other coins. Bitcoin is lagging. I’m all for bitcoin succeeding dong get me wrong. But this price is not healthy the network is no where near ready.

Only because everyone is stuck on MySpace and facebook isn’t big yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:56:09
That doesn’t change the fact that there are better alternatives in terms of tech out there. That’s all I’m saying.

Vanilla ice cream if you could never actually eat it only look at it. It’s completely non functional. How can you overlook previous examples of new technology first movers not always succeeding.

Why can’t people have conversations anymore without such insults. Pathetic. You paid 15 sat/byte and it took how long to confirm? There are 173k unconfirmed transaction and you’re telling me there’s not a problem? And what kind of person even mentions there girlfriend on reddit as a way to prop themselves up? Congrats you have a girlfriend, you and I both but who fucking cares? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:11:00
That’s a horrible statement completely unsupported by any real evidence.  What are you even trying to get at? Do you mean PoS which is not a monthly reward? It’s just a different way of ensuring transactions are secure. If you don’t know what you are talking about why pretend to?

But if you had had the option of getting 100mgb for 1.99 wouldn’t you take it? There are other cryptos that are already offering these benefits.

If you aren’t well educated then you should educate yourself and come back. I’m not going to explain all of crypto to you.

Raiblocks, iota, could handle this much volume. Neo probably too but it’s not quite a currency, it’s more. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:27:31
lol it’s really not a powerful currency. Bitcoin can’t handle this much volume.

I've seen this comment before on so many mining threads. Seems suspicious to perpetually dissuade mining with the exact same message. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:57:06
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:39:25
People have been reporting that website way overshoots what you’re supposed to pay. Someone reported they were quoted at 80% which is just wrong.

Greenaddress is my personal go to if I didn’t have a hardware wallet. It’s segwit activated which is a must.

And banks have caused financial meltdowns time and time again. Crypto is about removing banks. If that means finding an alternative to loans somewhere else, like sand, so be it. Bitcoin is not alone. It will do the most work but it certainly will not be alone.

Are you dense? The use case is replacing fiat with crypto. Everything u use fiat for would be the use case of btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:58:45
Yeh it’s a great resource, I  just would take it with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:43:26
We are still no where near what bitcoin can be. Most Mobile wallets aren't segwit supported so fees are high, lightning isn't out yet for even faster transactions. It's still a new technology, yet there are already reputable stores around the world that already fully accept bitcoin. Overstock.com, for example, their stock rose significantly recently because they started accepting bitcoins. If  the market finds the price of bitcoin it should stay constant with minor deflation at similar, hopefully even smaller than current inflation. And if we compare it to gold in market cap or other currencies, with only 21million bitcoins the price  could be thousands more than today if it becomes what we all hope it does, a global currency.

Didn't realize increasing the fee voided the last tx (is that right)? Couldn't I still do that if it's unconfirmed
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:16:42
oo thanks! havent heard of that before, also should have payed more attention didnt realize the mempool was so full. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:04:51
Also because of the efficient market theory, that's already included in the price since we assume the market is already affected by all knowledge (that this is happening). 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:57:30
Your initial statement say they lose money on average since the fees guarantee it. You explained a different situation comparing the holder and the Trader. The validity of your second comment does not prove or justify your, what i hope is just, poorly worded statement. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:57:02
Im the far future it's not speculation that will raise price but supply. In a world where people use it for everyday transaction the limited and essentially decreasing because of lost wallets and what not, will create more demand then the capped supply. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:31:49
I mean you have to realize that's false right? Yes holding is safer and you will make money, but trading is not a guaranteed lose although definitely a guaranteed challenge. The fees are .1 on most exchanges, easy enough to get back in a market where 5% changes can happen in an instant
