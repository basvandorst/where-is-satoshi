Dang missed out. Thanks for the generosity though!

I recently took out $50,000 from my bank, RBC, and put it into a free to use direct bank. I did this cause they started charging fucking $10 a month. Really now. 
I wonder how they reacted over there to loose a decent sum (I did it all through chequing and what not).
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:25:21
Yeah, that statement alone is why it's still not too late to hop on this train. Though I admit the barrier to entry is higher. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:24:09
I suppose we would do the same thing we do now when actually paper currency becomes lost forever. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:28:13
Really? Time to buy low now then?
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:59:31
Yeah theres a huge circle jerk in haha

I never said that. What I am saying is you can't get taxed until sales are made. If you have 1 million worth of bitcoin but sell under $10000, you can toss that in the bank, and no questions are asked. This is how dope dealers in Canada work. They don't get taxed. It falls under the stipulation of that money coming from an odd job, or kijiji sale.

I'm stuck in Canada, so I don't have coinbase. I meant buying a full bitcoin is more expensive then ever.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:30:45
Yeah I'm setting up all my accounts, and everything to be ready to buy in when the price is more stable. I hope I don't end up eating my words if it continues to jump. Hell if it does, I might have to bite the bullet and be patient for that $10,000 train. OR even better, Bitcoin being the primary currency and I switched ahead of the game.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:57:44
You're right. It's just I feel like I'm missing out, but it's all just speculation...
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:16:50
What why, what is this? lol, is this guy actually giving em out or what.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:22:43
I do however, feel like in the long run, it will be profitable. 
The way I'm sort of thinking of it, is like investing in something like Pay-Pal while it was still young, like bitcoin now is still fairly young.
I mean I knew about bit coin a while ago, but I did not know the nature of the beast when it came to trading it. I honestly thought it was just another, better version pay-pal; apparently it's turned into a commodity. 
"You're not omniscient and this is a hard market to predict."
-This right here is something I needed said to me. I'm just getting far to caught up from the news. But hey if it's anything, people, and I, are looking into this with interest and enthusiasm; *after a crash*. That must mean something.

How is it tax evasion. You hold onto an item, a commodity, it's not your fault the commodity increased in value. I don't pay taxes on Canadian Dollars I hold that end up being worth more than USD. It's the selling of things that could be attributed to tax evasion, but only if you sell a noteworthy sum.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:45:36
And to eat my words it rebounded to $800. Wow this is truly not a bubble. Ugh, wait don't wait. Thats the question. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:46:31
Open up an account in a non-taxable market. Like a Dubai USD bank account. And transfer a little bit over each tax year.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:32:04
You know what, anytime it dives. It dive down to a new stable ATH baseline price. The currency keeps getting stronger. Last time when it peaked and crashed ~$300, it stablized around $120ish. Now that it peaks at $900, it stablizes at around $300-400ish. I feel like theres a law of thirds here that I'm seeing a peak, and it stabilizing 1/3 of that ATH.
All I know is that last time I had an opportunity when it was ~$100. I'm not going to waste this opportunity again when prices stabilizing again. I'm investing, cold storing and just gona toss it in a safe place for a good long while.

The Social Network is on in my living room too.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:24:59
Thanks, apparently saving up as much as I did, is not what the general population does. I guess that just came with my frugal upbringing. 
But yeah, any tips or recommendations on mutual funds?
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:42:10
Canadians need more options, or more reliable options. It has taken me forever to get verified at mt.gox and CaVirtEx. Vault of Satoshi was fast, but don't accept CDN fund yet, and has recently haulted their direct deposit with BMO due to traffic.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:17:53
That's the thing though, now the bitcoin bubble has burst, or whatever.
Wouldn't it just become stable in the coming weeks like the Canadian Dollar, sometimes it's worth more than USD and sometimes it's a bit less.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:27:50
Yeah I'm working on setting up verified accounts there and mt. gox at the moment. Are there any other notable Canadian exchanges that you can recommend? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:12:09
Same here, I work in the oil fields of Alberta, and I have a bunch saved and wanted to start trading bitcoin, this shit scared me off a bit. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:03:12
I'm putting a sizeable, but affordable chunk of my current savings once all my accounts are verified. I missed the ride 6 months ago, and I regret it, a lot. I'm just going to invest, lock it up and hold for the future.
I love the idea, I believe in the idea, and hopefully I'll never have to sell, I'll just have more value to spend with using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:05:49
I'm dumb, mostly. I've put it in a two percent savings account now, which is dick. 
Obviously, I am looking to play/gamble with Bitcoin atm. I'm relatively young though, so that money came only this first year out of university. So I'm really, really getting into personal financial management now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:29:56
That's nuts, that subway owner/manager must be a local celebrity at this point. I recognized him from the CNBC interview. Good for him!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:26:22
Calm as a hindu cow.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:50:55
I don't own any bitcoin, but this is exciting!
