Guys lately the world of Bitcoin isn't looking so good. Can anyone say anything positive about recent developments?

I wish bitcoins weren't rapidly loosing their worth...

I don't have any issues with the internet. Doesn't seem to affect anything I do.

Haha. Much appreciated. I just thought that the law of supply and demand would come into play.

Yes. I live here. Very affordable. I live in a nice studio apt. and pay $400/month for rent. I pay a little bit more for maid service each week + electricity. The food is amazing, the people are really nice. There are downsides of course, but if you have a medical issue I can't think of a better place to be. Obtaining citizenship is difficult, but you can get a 3 month travel visa and renew it. I have a work permit because I have a full time job here.

You would be fine. Peanuts are in a lot of things but not everything.

The buys are going up but the price of a coin is still relatively the same as it was a week ago. It's gone up a bit but not dramatically. Should we see a more dramatic rise in the price of a BTC in the near future?

Sorry, I didn't realize I was obligated to give you that information.
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:21:46
This is something I would like to know more about.
