It's most likely CPU bound as the blocks have to be verified as they download.

Try reading this: 
Coinbase has off-blockchain confirmations and they are the biggest US exchange/wallet.
TBH as you say you only need to worry about waiting for block confirmations for large transactions (or if you're doing a lot of small transactions).

Sell some for the cash you need and hold the rest. PM me if you want to sell.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:51:54
True. Though GPU is not usually used for script mining mostly CPU and the title specified bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:00:24
The real question is not how long it takes to "do" but how long it takes before they cannot be reversed anymore. This is what I count as "final".
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:02:49
This this true but with "large" transactions you should wait for several block to ensure there is no double spending.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:01:21
GPU mining is dead. Even with a botnet it is not worth the time/risk with the new ASIC and industrial minoring farms. Just another attempt to tarnish bitcoin's image.
@_date: 2015-05-08 02:54:50
Bitcoin is fast compared to other services. A transaction is "normally" consider final after 10 blocks are confirmed (10 per block = 1 hour) though you can usually wait 2-3 blocks and be ok.
1. Paypal transactions can be reversed for up to 180 days
2. Checks take weeks
3. Wire transfers take days
Overall waiting up to an hour for a transaction that can never be reversed seems like a good deal.
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:02:53
Bitcoin's underlying tec. is solid per usually people just panic sell. Buy and hold.
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:56:14
I agree but it will take much time. :/
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:24:52
A double spend should work. Try using a different wallet maybe? or just wait it out and hopefully someone will put it in a block.

- Investment has grown every year. Including this year: 
- Can you explain "That is part of the problem. Bitcoin hasn't improved but other fintech has. Bitcoin isn't competitive in any mainstream use cases anymore." more?
- How is having a talk about a limit of 7 trans/sec. not a talk about expansion?
- I agree it is still early for most governments but its encouraging to see some interest. If they thought it was a fad they would ignore.
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:34:06
use something different next time :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:44:46
The drop is related to overall world markets. Sit tight and hold. Hell, buy more if you can manage the risk.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:41:29
Bump. You'd need a node to broadcast p2p
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:07:29
- If you don't want irreversible transactions then use multi. sig. and a third party to settle disputes if one comes up. This way if there is no problem third party does nothing.
- Buying bitcoin is an up front fee one time fee. Every single transaction within bitcoin is then lower cost. Without bitcoin every transaction is higher cost.
- I agree most consumers don't like per item pricing but the world of b2b absolutely needs micro-payments. Some examples, charge per API call, charge per user record provided, or charge per dataset analyzed.
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:59:01
Alaska. Free cooling (for mining) and lots of power. Plus people keep to themselves and respect your space. :)
@_date: 2015-08-23 04:35:51
In theory you'd only need to try about half but I agree between my ISP and governments not worth it.

@_date: 2015-08-25 02:43:45
It's functionality that dictates the price of the good and part of the functionality of bitcoin is knowing that your bitcoins are going to be there tomorrow and still work.
I know I can transfer money quickly, irreversible and cheaply and that I will be able to do so tomorrow or the next day or next year.
Someone can't just pop in and break the system.
This "solidness" is one of the main reasons bitcoin has value.
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:19:19
Assuming that there is enough fluid bitcoin available to draw upon yes, but in reality I think even with the BTC -&gt; Fiat model there is: "some minimal" holding/waiting time bc bank transfers aren't instant.
More transactions means hold more coins for "some minimal" time -&gt; more coins out of circulation in markets - &gt; less bitcoin -&gt; drive up price minimally (supply and demand).
I don't know how much actual effect this has though just a theory.
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:47:03
- I'll take a look at investment charts. Thanks for the info. 
- No other system that I know of allows irreversible transactions after an hour and can send &gt;1000 BTC (&gt;200,000 ish US) for under 10 bucks across any border or send cost effective micro-payments.

The crash is also related to the overall downward trend worldwide. 
Sit tight and hold. Things will be fine, bitcoin is a solid technology with billions in VC flowing in.
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:45:45
I ran a business selling on eBay and Paypal chargebacks are a killer. Someone should not be able to get their item, have it for 100 days later and file a complaint.
Finding a trusted third party can be found through reputation, market competition works.
Why would I pay your company when I can use micro-payments I can implement in-house for free? Plus, in time there will even be open source libraries to handle easy set-up (if there isn't already).
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:25:50
- I also agree that having centralized mining is dangerous but I have a hard time seeing a way around large mining centers. Having people run nodes and mine from home systems isn't a long term solution. What other alternatives are there? I think altcoins with alternate puzzles are only a temporary solution. Buying power, memory and computing power in bulk will be cheaper in the end. 
- Investment has grown every year. Including this year: 
- How is having a talk about a limit of 7 trans/sec. not a talk about expansion?
- Sure there are debates, updates, improvements and security issues but the main idea is solid. I know I can send some coins quickly and irreversible and they will get there and using good practices storing my coins is safe.
- I'm afraid regulation in the end is going to be unavoidable. My point is bitcoin is at the point where it can attract some attention (even if its going to be rough/hard to comply).
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:08:54
How do you propose this is implemented? Nodes hold no firm identity.
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:47:14
But hearing their side is part of learning your side better. :)

What was the "tipping point" the caused you to know you wanted to do this?
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:29:54
1. Bitcoins image is in the toilet. People see it as "used by criminals". Bitcoin has had major media coverage for Silkroad, Mt. Gox, "currency of darkness" etc. so they don't learn about it.
2. Also people don't truly understand how it works and what makes it different. Say "blockchain", "p2p", or "the miners verify transactions" and you get blank looks. Once people see how/why they can send/receive money anywhere for cheap and not have it deflated or stolen later it becomes attractive.

The crash is related to the overall downward trend worldwide. Like it or not bitcoin is still tightly tied to traditional trading and banking systems. People see things going badly and want out. 
Just sit tight and hold. Things will be fine, bitcoin is a solid technology with billions in VC flowing in.
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:44:25
How did you get the Apple stock thing to show bitcoin price? Or is it photoshopped?
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:31:37
One of the fundamental premises bitcoin is build around is allowing nodes to enter and leave at anytime they want. They cannot hold an identity in the P2P network. Their "voice" to propose new blocks is weighed by there hash power.
Some alt-coin try use alternate mining puzzles to try to avoid centralization in mining, for example use of memory hard puzzles. I think that different mining schemes may be the answer to your centralization question. Try reading this:

If anyone wants to try hitting 54.231.10.68 it's  (Personal site of OP I think) or 70.32.108.210 it's  (OP's place of work from FB). If they work throw me some coins.
Other then that I'm out of ideas/not gonna brute force it.
EDIT: grammer
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:03:17
Ok I see that would be a solution. Won't this problem also apply to key generation (though It's not SHA-2)? Break ECDSA and private keys could be retrieved.
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:00:09
We need more people to buy and hold rather then sell out when things dip. Just because world markets decided it was time to take a plunge doesn't mean bitcoin is any less solid of a technology. Buy, hold, sit tight.
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:50:38

Possibly fluctuation. Did you check market price of bitcoin before and after coins were sent?
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:39:41
(155).99-10  = 143.45 
As long as the price went up I would assume you would have more then 143.45? Maybe check fees again?
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:42:56
Agreed. If you every use Paypal to sell coins either you do not know what you are doing or it should be a very close friend or family member you trust wholeheartedly. 
P2P bitcoin to paypal is a no go
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:49:43
No. I suppose not. Maybe try making a multi-sign wallet and give one key to trusted friend/family member with the agreement they will return when price reaches X. I in general do not trust escrows.

If you are using PayPal, how will chargebacks on PayPal be addressed?

@_date: 2015-03-30 03:51:32
Imagine money transfers anywhere worldwide without large fees, ridicules time delays or annoying bank tellers asking for your ID while you wait in line behind that old lady trying to get a 20 for a bag of coins.
That is what bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:19:50
I've been a user of the Exchange for several weeks now and designed an analysis tool for high volume traders. Its free too. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:13:44
To answer your first question the price is so volatile because:
1. the market is so small compared to "normal investments"
(millions instead of billions)
2. the market is very young
3. people treat bitcoin as a "get rich quick" investment which decreases stability
4. media has great influence over prices (as a result of the first three) and "good" or "bad" news has a major impact 
Personally I treat bitcoin as a long term investment. In 5 or 10 years I believe it is going to be much higher then today so I am not to concerned with what the price may be next week or in a couple of months.
The core ideals of bitcoin are strong. In the long haul low fees, fast money transfers and control over your funds is going to be very appealing to people. Not to mention the possibles of micro-payments and ease of access to third-world countries.
Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:11:03
Sure but searching through a space that is 2^256 (SHA-256) large is on the same level as trying to find a specific atom in the visible universe. Going a little faster doesn't really help you.
