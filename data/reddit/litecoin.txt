Litecoin is the only good alt coin. Bitcoin is gold, litecoin is silver.

yawn, forum politics, stick to real topics like how rich were gonna be!
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:14:50
Can't wait to see the butt-hurt when mtgox implements litecoin. All you bitcoiners are gonna be sooo mad, it's gonna be amazing to watch. "b-b-b-but its not real! ya'll are dumb :hmm maybe Ill diversify into litecoins"
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:02:31
and of course, you can buy/sell/trade litecoins :)
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:17:34
Convert to litecoin :) It's going on mt gox in the next week and pretty much guaranteed to go up to approx 10 % of bitcoin's price. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 00:54:42
Why would miners sell at 40 when they can hold longterm and get 400? There is going to be a huge shortage soon which will launch the price up. The only people selling right now are just trying to get back in cheaper and make some coin.

wait for it..wait for it..
believe it bitcoiners
bitcoin and litecoin will forever be inseparable
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:27:44
It's so painfully obvious too. but bitcoiners will only be able to react after it already happens. That's always the best part. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 06:46:09
and 99 % of those gigs of transactions are from satoshi dice
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:51:22
litecoin bro!! second chance for missed bitcoin users. mtgox is taking it soon (announcement coming this week) so you can expect it to take off.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:46:26
The people here want bitcoin to make them rich. They will cash out the moment it reaches a certain price. They have every reason to convince you litecoin is garbage. The truth is, litecoin is a great alternative and solves several problems that bitcoin has. As bitcoin gets bigger, these problems will start being way more obvious. You can't ignore litecoin.
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:34:40
They already delete threads they dont like. Litecoin and alts are not allowed to be discussed here. You only want to live in your little bitcoin bubble and pretend it's the only thing that exists. Or it probably makes bitcoiners see themselves and realize how they come across to others (as much as you hate litecoin, others hate bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:44:08
Makes you wonder whose moronic idea it was to start a 'foundation' in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:31:29
litecoin is being added on mtgox, we have confirmation that confirmation is coming this week. It is a pretty safe bet right now.
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:06:40
litecoin is soon going to be traded on mt gox. It is currently undervalued. People will see litecoin for $5 alongside bitcoin and boost it up to $10-$20... with mt gox will come silk road then every site that takes btc will take ltc. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:42:02
mt gox has announced litecoin is coming, this is fuelling the rise. once it gets on the exchange its rising to 10 or 20. bitcoin users hate litecoin though, they want to pretend it doesnt exist
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:05:35
Haha I love how mad these bitcoiners are. After downvoting any mention of litecoin and trying to pretend it doesn't exist, gox is about to make it explode. O, they mad

not J, but you get to be a hero and immortalized in everyone's thoughts, you get to die with a purpose, rather than slogging through 50 yrs, breaking down physically and mentally and losing everything.

apple hipsters think it's because apple is better. no, hackers just don't give a shit about your little computer toy.

Litecoin and bitcoin, that is all there is. All the others are junk junk junk
@_date: 2013-03-16 00:44:37
what are the next psychological points? $100 then $1000?

@_date: 2013-04-08 21:57:20
you just have to look at how stubborn the devs are. they will get more and more deluded from reality, and unwilling to adapt to meet the demands of users. remember when they said, 'microtransactions? that defeats the purpose of bitcoin!'............ idiots don't even understand their own creation
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:27:21
litecoin users not affected :)
@_date: 2013-03-15 23:26:19
litecoin is going to surpass bitcoin's marketcap :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:46:38
yeah we will need all the old farts to get on board
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:33:28
Litecoin :) ... Currently it's trading at $4. MtGox is going to be implementing it soon, meaning wider adoption. and it is ASIC-proof, you can mine with GPU's. Litecoin is basically the second chance for people who missed out on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:11:30
Sounds like you have to read up on the differences more. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:33:41
Like this entire subreddit?
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:15:10
he isnt japanese though
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:37:52
litecoin is the second chance for people who missed out on the bitcoin boom. remember, if anything happened to bitcoin, litecoin would take over.
@_date: 2013-09-18 06:50:11
If they use litecoin too they are okay in my book!
@_date: 2013-08-20 06:42:30
You missed the boat, litecoin, is currently trading at .023 btc/ltc, if mt gox even sneezes the word litecoin it is going to soar. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:28:13
That would require the africans to have computers first.
@_date: 2013-03-13 18:13:09
Yeah it's soooo obnoxious to grow 1000 % in two weeks. You're all just jealous that you missed the boat. All this time you could've joined litecoin but mocked it instead. No sympathy
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:08:07
Litecoin is going to be trading at $10 soon, mtgox, then silkroad is next. This is the second chance for bitcoin users who missed out
@_date: 2013-04-25 02:33:49
Get 'em while you can
@_date: 2013-03-11 05:29:54
but when that happens, you don't have bitcoin anymore, you have paypal. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 05:52:09
It all comes down to:
people who use litecoin=smart (gained 1000% on their investment in 2 weeks)
people who use bitcoin=sheep (gained nothing in 2 weeks)
@_date: 2013-03-12 22:53:57
litecoin not affected
