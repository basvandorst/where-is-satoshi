It’s all pure manipulation. It’s just a matter of time when the big boys and governments say: we buy untill a new ATH.

Yes.

You think crypto is the real reason for the measures taken by financial institutions and governments?!
Look back looks like the history is repeating itself.

This needs a lot more of exploration. Why should I choose Nobank? With my bank account I don’t need to swap between crypto and euro for doing payments. The costs at my bank are 1,40 euro’s a month with everything limitless in use and free of extra costs. When crypto is in a real adoption fase the idea of Nobank could be useful. Do you have more information to look into? I’am a former banker and curious to how I can help with my feedback.

Stick to your own plan. Don’t let the ETF desicion and it’s hype determin cryptofuture. Once an ETF is approved, at a time it will be, the world of crypto will move forward with a lot more and bigger things to come. Don’t let the date of approval blind your own plan.

Great, let’s get on with our (crypto)lives. I didn’t expect an approval. Let’s focus on what really must be and stay our main focus: make crypto greater, bigger and honest! Another selfmade influencer destroyed on the way to a bright crypto future. Nothing can stop it, only once in a while delay it.

I think Korean news is positivly influencing the market. For the time being, enjoy it.

Bears or bulls posting on Reddit....is like Warren Buffet on Snapchat. 
Grow up, the people with the fiat filled wallets aren’t posting anything on Reddit, Telegram and so on. Just enjoy the funny articles, crappy TA’s and Oracles of the crypto world. 
Take it easy, than everything is just a fun ride en perhaps you can earn some money by investing for the long term.

If the trendline would follow the Nasdaq trend then crypto isn’t even near it’s peak.
But this is comparing something (Nasdaq) started from the 70’s to something with nearly ten years in exsistance. 
The financial and technology surrounding is completly changed and will keep on changing in a fast moving pace.
Fun to watch where we will stand within the next ten years.

Nobody knows. Really, people are trying to forecast, but I am in crypto for many years and none of them was right. It is about believe longterm and there are many people on the right side concerning crypto. It will continu to rise till....2040?! TA is a farce, don’t fall for that crap. Believe in crypto and don’t only think of investing. Always keep some crypto because in time you will buy youre grocerries with it.

Check? Really? I don’t blame you, but using checks?! And giving the reason to switch to crypto because of non acceptance checks?
It took your bank 20 years for not accepting checks? And you wan’t to use crypto and still wan’t to use checks? That’s like asking the post to still use a pigeon and on the other hand you already have e-mail. Checks? OMG we have a long way to go...Crypto will take decades, many decades to get mainstream in your country!

When the daily percentages are double digits for like 3 days in a row...perhaps the bull is slowly waking up.

A hack is never a good sign. But to be honest: I have worked at several banks and hacks are common. The only difference with crypto Exchanges are that communicating hacks at your bank and banks overall are caussing a massive problem. So in agreement with Central banks it won’t be communicated. They take there losses and the clients won’t notice anything when their accounts are hacked.

Any info on how many people followed the hearing? Worldwide? I did follow the livestream and do not live in the U.S. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:52:03
Major? 7000 customers isn’t that major and the “exchange” has written a pyramid scheme all over it. Please do not exaggerate this kind of news. This kind of news is harming the community too much and i’am getting tired from this kind of “news”.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:50:57
This was hilarious. Think of all the money these people “earn” to attend such a meeting. Even a meeting at a youthcouncil is more interesting. This meeting should never have taken place. People were unprepaired en not capable for asking questions or answering them.

Because 95% of the people on reddit no nothing about economics. And 90% of those 95% believe the Wall Street bonus crap or tax crap. Just stay calm and the future will tell us. One thing I know is we are small fish in a very small economic space (crypto) that has to evolve in a big world with people with a huge amount of power and influence. Just stay calm and we will see what the future brings us. Maybe nothing or maybe a lot.
