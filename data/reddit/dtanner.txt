Ooooops, I missed this post yesterday, you need an additional / in front of my username to properly summon :)
Some points I would add is Tiger Direct and Overtsock.com.
I've also been watching all the good news steadily come in over the past 2-3 months and anticipate a new bubble soon. But I think it won't be for another month at least (maybe 2-3). The market is just too spooked right now by the Gox failure and the China uncertainty. We need a long period of slow upwards movement before I'm willing to say a new bubble is imminent.

Why does it take a whole week for an *express* package to arrive from Tiger Direct CA to a Canadian address? Is it because it's being sent from the USA? The shipping cost is ridiculous too.

It's legit, for anyone wanting to double-check their Bitcoin balance (I knew approximately but because they shut down the website I didn't have the exact number) here is how I was able to find mine:
* Look for your last withdraw e-mail "[Mt.Gox] Withdraw from your account [Name]"
* Take the "Transaction reference: [Number]" and search for it in btc_xfer_report.csv
* The left-most number is your wallet identifier
* Search for that in the mtgox_balances.csv file, the fourth number is your BTC balance in Satoshis

Slightly related, I ran a trading bot on Gox and reported a trading bug to them a few weeks ago (sometimes filled orders would linger on the order books with one Satoshi left). I gave them a detailed description of what I was doing to create the orders and the exact order numbers that failed. They were completely unwilling to investigate the bug on their end and basically blamed me for their problem. They eventually closed the ticket without taking any action.
You'd think a **bug in the trading engine** would be top priority for a fucking *exchange*. But no, I guess their frappuccino cafe was more important.

Don't worry about it, Segwit has been activated, I've been told it's a 1.7-4 Mb block increase. So the mempool should empty out really quickly now that the blocksize has been increased so dramatically.
Or just wait a few days and use the Lightning Network. Instant, free, totally decentralized p2p payments. Now that Segwit is active it's just around the corner.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:27:17
It will actually activate 6 blocks after 12:20, and the first block &gt; 1 MB will probably take a long time to create because the hash power of the BCH chain will be really low.
See [this comment]( for details.

Bitcoin Cash supporters don't want SegWit2x, we've already got 8mb blocks and we don't want Segwit. It would be better for everyone if we just dropped S2X and let the two existing chains compete on the market.

The CEO of a VC-backed private corporation, and a handful of Chinese miners, just unilaterally decided the future of Bitcoin. And they have the *gall* to call it consensus.
This is bad, really bad.
**Editing this comment to respond in one place to the army of throwaway accounts jumping down my throat:**
What would consensus look like? In my view there are five main groups that would need to agree on changes to Bitcoin to achieve consensus: The developers (the code), the miners (the hashpower), the nodes (the network), the exchanges and payment processors (the economic majority), and of course the users (Bitcoin early adopters). The users don't really steer the ship, they just vote by deciding to use/hold Bitcoin, and they'll vote by buying alt-coins if they don't agree with the direction the other four take.
At this meeting there are only representatives of two of those groups; the code and the hashpower. Missing from the developers are extremely important people like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's chief scientist), and Jeff Garzik. It looks like the majority of the hashpower was present, but not all (Slush for example), who have decided *a hard fork to 2 MB needs to happen urgently, not over a year from now*.
Calling this tiny meeting consensus? Laughable.
As to VC-backed Blockstream taking control of the Bitcoin protocol, they have a fiduciary duty to create a return for their investors. Their business plan is to profit from protocols built on top of Bitcoin, protocols that benefit from a crippled Bitcoin layer usable only for settlement. All their actions so far show they have a laser-like focus on enabling features in Bitcoin that will benefit the Lightning Network, while restricting the throughput of the Bitcoin network as much as possible until their product is ready to sell.
This will backfire, the users and the economic majority will move to a network that functions correctly.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:03:38
I read this as them trying to find a technicality to back out. They've realized the 'consensus' peddled to them by Blockstream was anything but, but they don't want to admit they were duped.
An attempt to save face essentially.
I wish the miners would actually decide what they want and stick to it. First they all pledge for Classic, then Core, now they're flip-flopping on that.

If you copy your home wallet.dat onto your work computer, you would have access to the home Bitcoins at both places (until you create more than ~100 receiver addresses anyway, then the wallets would diverge). Of course, if you have Bitcoins already in the work wallet.dat you'd need to send them home before removing/deleting that wallet.dat.

No, and that one really should have, unless it's dependent on the 'change' addresses from the previous two transactions.

@_date: 2011-06-28 22:14:11
A little angry to be honest, what he says is demonstrably false:
* There is currently no (legal) risk whatsoever for a merchant. Bitcoins are not currently illegal, and even if they are made illegal in the future, you can't be prosecuted for acts that weren't illegal at the time you did them.
* The financial risk for merchants is almost nil if they immediately convert their Bitcoins to local currency (and of course declare that income on their taxes properly). There's no gambling involved.
* Calling Bitcoin a ponzi scheme is just ignorance of the definition of a ponzi scheme. No one is guaranteeing people who invest in Bitcoin a payout of any kind (in fact most people are warning potential investors that they could lose everything they invest).
It's just rhetoric, and unfortunately very compelling rhetoric for anyone who doesn't know the facts.

Obviously if they don't care about that they'd just consolidate all in one place. But if they send it through a laundry (or if an exchange supports unique deposit addresses) as an intermediary step they could do that.

1. Read up on the technical specs behind the protocol, make sure you have faith in the technology.
2. Think about whether or not you see this technology being widely used in the future (a good-sized minimum comparison would be Paypal).
3. Ask yourself what will happen when the US government makes it illegal, will your country follow suit?
4. (Most important) Only invest the amount you are prepared to lose 100%. A failure at any of those three points could make a Bitcoin virtually worthless while you sleep.
If you're okay with the above, my all means invest!

The difficulty will go up and you will almost certainly generate less Bitcoins every week than the week before (as long as interest in the project keeps going up). On the other hand the price per Bitcoin will probably go up at the same time.

Yes, selling. Some possible scenarios:
* One of the guys with 300,000+ Bitcoins decides to cash out all at once.
* A couple of people selling all at once suddenly drives the value down a noticeable amount which causes other people to sell in a chain reaction of panic (this depends how many people bough to hold, or bought to speculate).
* Technical flaw that causes Bitcoin to be useless (or convincing enough fake that went viral) would crash the value instantly.
* A major government declaring Bitcoin illegal could cause people who bought to hold for the long run to suddenly all sell at once.
* [This guy]( has some theories too.

For micro-transactions, it beats the hell out of PayPal (they charge like a $1 fee for every transfer I believe?).
Do you support WikiLeaks? If you do and wanted to donate, you can't with PayPal or Mastercard because the US government put pressure on them to stop that. With Bitcoins there's no middle man to target.
There a chance online merchants like Newegg or Amazon would accept Bitcoins at a better rate than PayPal, because there's no risk of charge-backs and no middle man to leech 3% of every transaction. This is the "year in the future" scenario.
Do you sell anything online on a big scale? PayPal is risky as hell for you, remember that Notch (creator of Minecraft) had his PayPal account frozen and had his only revenue stream cut off completely. Also again, you don't have to worry about credit card companies leeching your profit margin.
eBay sellers would benefit big-time, because there is no risk of charge-back scammers.
For people living in countries with strict currency export laws (obviously doesn't apply to Americans), it's a very safe and convenient way to transfer currency abroad.

[Cognitive dissonance]( For some reason or other this person decided to not like Bitcoin (maybe for a perfectly fine reason). But this person has a very fragile ego that requires constant validation, so whenever they see some one in favour of Bitcoin this makes them feel bad. Most people would take this as a sign that, hey, maybe Bitcoin isn't so bad after all, lots of people like it maybe there is something to it, even if it isn't for me. But this sad lonely person sees this as sort of a personal attack on him and his opinions.

Here's some pure speculation (see what I did there?) on my part:
* Some forex traders became interested in Bitcoin when the story broke [in Forbes]( last month. Just recently they've decided to invest some serious play money to ride the sudden [wave of interest](
* The Russian federation is currently the most trending nation interested in Bitcoin. Either a bunch of people are buying some up as a hedge against inflation (the Russian economy has been a basket case since capitalism came), or some major criminal syndicates are buying some up to potentially use it for untraceable transactions.
* Linden dollars (a $29.3 million USD economy) can now be purchased with Bitcoins.
* China was a major trending nation last week, there's a good chance people wanted to get a hold of some currency not tied to their authoritarian government.
* Rickard Falkvinge, the founder of the pirate party, recently wrote an article entitled [Why I’m Putting All My Savings Into Bitcoin]( Sweden/Norway/Finland are now the next three highest nations interested in Bitcoin.
* Gawker wrote an article about [Bitcoin and the Silk Road]( which went massively viral. The delay between that article and the current buying frenzy is a bit too short (Dwolla takes forever to move funds), so most likely it prompted people who had money at Mt. Gox already to buy.
So, *mostly* speculation, IMHO, which could cause a temporary bubble (although I would expect the Bubble to pop maybe a month from now, if no new major articles come out). But **if** Bitcoin succeeds in the long run they'll be worth upwards of $10,000 each so I would hesitate to call them overvalued.

As a socialist I've actually thought a bit about this. It's a fairly complex issue and I don't really have a definitive answer for you, but here are a couple of thoughts:
Under the table deals (and tax evasion in general) happen all the time in the current economy. I sold my paint-ball gear on Craigslist, did I pay taxes on that transaction? Hell no. You can go down to any farmers market and exchange cash for food. I was once paid 100% under the table when I was washing dishes at a restaurant. There's an entire industry built around tax evasion: tips for servers and bartenders. The stinking rich do their transactions using illegal overseas bank accounts, and avoid paying billions in taxes. Bitcoin is just facilities existing behaviour, so it's nothing new in that sense.
Large corporations aren't suddenly going to start paying their employees in Bitcoins. And even if they did and didn't report the income, they'd eventually be audited and fined or put in jail. Income taxes are the single largest source of tax for countries (I think?).
Even though I'm a fairly left-wing socialist, we're currently living in a capitalist economy; so fuck'em. The system is rigged to favour the rich, they avoid paying their taxes because their incomes come from 'capital gains' and 'bonuses' and 'dividends'. I'd get in on the tax-evasion game in a second, just like they do.
Final point, given the choice of sending my taxes to my government so they can blow up brown people in other countries without my consent, I'd rather give my money directly to charities that help the poor, to make up for the % of my taxes that would ordinarily go to social programs.

Not true, miners will still receive Bitcoin rewards for verifying transactions. It's still rare, but at the moment some low-priority transactions (like 0.01 BTC) are being delayed by several days. In the future as the network grows, people will have to attached fees to their transactions to make sure they get accepted in a reasonable time frame.

I really like the concept of "metacurrency" that this article talks about. This is exactly the area I think Bitcoin will be most successful. I don't ever see it replacing the dollar, or even credit cards. The one thing that Bitcoin *really* excels at is the instantaneous transfer of unlimited amounts of money from one place in the world to another.

It won't necessarily deflate forever monotonically, the price of a Bitcoin correlates (not accounting for bubbles etc..) with the size of the Bitcoin economy, divided by the available Bitcoins. So if in the future a large segment of the Bitcoin economy suddenly drops out, for example if the US made Bitcoin illegal and all US businesses that accepted Bitcoin stopped, there could be some fairly large inflation as people move out of the Bitcoin economy.
But I do agree that a deflationary spiral is unlikely, the higher the price goes, the more likely people will be to want to 'cash out' fearing a bubble, so there will always be available Bitcoins for purchase. Not to mention their almost infinite divisibility. People who don't want to hold Bitcoins will always be able to buy some, and then transfer their Bitcoins   right away, not having to care at all about the exchange rate.

@_date: 2013-11-28 13:08:44
One thing I would disagree with is that "higher dispersion of coins" is universal.
This is all speculation on my part, but I get the impression that there are one or more 'manipulators' out there with *huge huge* stashes of coins. They see the Bitcoin market as a sort of game where their number of coins is their high score and their only goal is to accumulate more.
I believe that most of the flash-crashes we've experienced on the way up from $200 are the result of them initiating sell-offs at moments when the market is overbought/nervous. For example at $900 for the first time there were huge sells to start the flash-crash down to $450. If played right, the coins initially dumped could have been bought back at almost half the price and their quantity increased.
But yes overall I agree with you, coins are being spread out from early adopters to new. But there are almost certainly players out there constantly increasing their stashes as well.

@_date: 2013-04-13 20:14:44
Let me explain to you what I think is happening (just speculation, but based on publicly available information):
* When a trade is filled on an account every trade below it has to be "refreshed" to make sure it still has enough money available
* This is extremely slow because each verification causes database reads
* Each account can create up to 1000 open trades (I asked Tux directly on IRC a while back)
* So to create lag all you have to do is set up a few hundred (free, unverified) accounts and create a thousand bids for $0.01
* Then execute a large sell and every time one of those bids is filled it causes a thousand database accesses (times hundreds of accounts)
* Then everyone panic sells and rushes to the website to F5 and it makes it 10 times worse
It's such an easy problem to fix:
* Charge $1 per open order
* Limit the max number of open orders per account to 100 (or less)
* Only allow verified accounts to trade (and close accounts that are obviously attacking the system)
* Take the website offline for a week and implement the new trading engine already
* Or all the above
But Gox is just greedy/stupid/incompetent/in denial.

My personal plan is to slowly sell off as the price rises. Pick a plan and stick to it, something like "sell 10% of your Bitcoins every time the price doubles". I'm going to run a bot that places asks automatically as the price rises (and also attempts to make me some extra $ and BTC off volatility).
No strategy can be optimal though, there will always be disappointments; that you sold too much too early, or waited too long to sell.

1. It's going to be hard to scale the network as transactions increase. There's currently a hardcoded max number of transactions per block and any peaks of activity above that will cause delayed or lost transactions.
2. Bitcoin is under constant development so there's the possibility of introducing bugs into the code, causing forks or worse.
3. It's too easy for new users to lose their Bitcoins to hacking or viruses. Or to lose their wallet in a HDD crash.
4. The financial system is currently hostile to Bitcoin companies because it tends to attract a large number of scammers. If things get worse there will be no way to get money in/out of Bitcoin in large quantities (see Mt. Gox's current situation).
5. It's currently way too volatile, every other week someone dumps a stack of coins on the market trying to cause a flash crash (and profit from the panic).
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:40:40
Things can get pretty turbulent with Bitcoin, don't panic if it drops by 10-25% over the next week (although my bet is it will go up, but it's impossible to be sure). You'll have a better idea in a few months on how it's doing.

That's what I expect, I'm often wrong though.


I think you need to learn a bit more about how Bitcoins are traded before jumping in. If the price goes up that means there are people actively seeking to buy your Bitcoins at that new price. A lot like how stocks are traded. Yes, you'll always be able to sell at the current market price.

No charge-backs means better prices for everyone because the merchants don't have to factor in credit card fraud and scammers into their prices.

One possible solution (let's say for argument Bitcoin succeeds) is for the Billionaires created by Bitcoin to stockpile mining hardware 'off the grid' and set up a small corporation to actively monitor the network for these attacks. When they are detected, they fire up the surprise hardware and keep the attackers % as low as possible.
They would have the incentive to spend a big enough % of their fortune on maintenance of such an enterprise, to ensure the value of the vast majority of their coins keeps that value. Much the same way you buy insurance for cars or houses.

There are currently [8 million dollars USD]( in bids sitting on MtGox, that's 4 times the amount there was just a month ago. And it looks to be rising exponentially.
That influx of cash will definitely keep the price from dipping too low, but the upwards pressure could lead to a sudden and violent rise if all those people content to sit on bids decide to put in market orders when they feel the stability is ending.
So my personal opinion is extreme stability for 3-5 days then a sudden upwards surge. But who the fuck knows really?

Of course there's a delayed reaction, it takes people time to learn about Bitcoin and then decide to buy, then to get a hold of cash then to transfer it to exchanges.

I like the idea of this thread, let's all have a good cry together.
When I first heard about Bitcoin they were trading at $1.30, the conventional wisdom at the time was that *it was a bubble* and would soon come back down to &lt; $1.00. So instead of buying $1000 worth of Bitcoins I bought $1000 worth of mining equipment (cheap computer with two very nice ATI cards). A month or so later the 2011 bubble was in progress and the mining difficulty soared exponentially as gaming forums and kids with free electricity and nice video cards started mining. I only ended up mining 100 or so (instead of the ~800 I would have gotten by buying them).
Early last summer 2012 I sold my condo and quit my job to start up my own company (living off savings). I invested $5000 into Bitcoins (about 6% of my savings) and put the biggest chunk of my savings into a 2%-a-year chequing account.
If I'd put that cash into Bitcoins, instead of having a decent down-payment on a future house, I could have been financially independent. I count myself incredibly fortunate, but at the same time there's that sense that I missed out on a great opportunity.
(Note: I'm slowly selling off my Bitcoins as the price rises, with a bot, so I don't have quite as much total as would be indicated by the above paragraphs)
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:18:46

1. It's going to be hard to scale the network as transactions increase. There's currently a hardcoded max number of transactions per block and any peaks of activity above that will cause delayed or lost transactions.
2. Bitcoin is under constant development so there's the possibility of introducing bugs into the code, causing forks or worse.
3. It's too easy for new users to lose their Bitcoins to hacking or viruses. Or to lose their wallet in a HDD crash.
4. The financial system is currently hostile to Bitcoin companies because it tends to attract a large number of scammers. If things get worse there will be no way to get money in/out of Bitcoin in large quantities (see Mt. Gox's current situation).
5. It's currently way too volatile, every other week someone dumps a stack of coins on the market trying to cause a flash crash (and profit from the panic).

The green lines are the price, the higher up the further back in time.
The orange lines are the open bids (people who want to buy Bitcoins with USD), the blue lines are asks (people who want to sell Bitcoins for USD).
The bars on the left are the volume of trades, green being buys and red being sells. With the black part being half-half.
The lines (boxes) on the right are the trades that took place in the last hour.
@_date: 2013-02-04 18:14:15
When you create your offer, you'll input a secret code. The seller will 'fund' the transaction with the Bitcoins, placing them on the localbitcoins.com website. When you meet, the seller will 'release' the Bitcoins to you and will receive your secret code. When the seller shows you your secret code, you know that you have your Bitcoins.

I've always estimated the final price of a Bitcoin at between $10,000 - $1,000,000 maybe 5-10 years from now.
The low end being based on the size and volume of Western Union, PayPal, Visa/MasterCard. And the high end being based on the total global gold supply.
Of course there's the risk that the value of a Bitcoin in 10 years will be $0, and that's why the price is where it is right now. The risk is factored in.
But as more and more businesses accept Bitcoin and the network proves itself safe and robust (with time and scrutiny and stress testing), that risk drops. And that's why we're seeing the current growth.
Also, people always make the mistake of graphing Bitcoin on a linear scale which makes the growth look too fast, Bitcoin was always going to grow exponentially. Look at [where Facebook was]( four years into its adoption. [This is what Bitcoin growth looks like on a log chart]( linear growth since January.

I may have confused people with "on the cusp", that means 'at the start of' not 'at the top of'.
I don't believe Bitcoin itself is a bubble or currently in a bubble, but we've seen that sometimes the price rises too quickly and eventually causes a crash that lasts a year or more. I think there's a good chance of that starting within the next few weeks/months. We won't know it's a bubble until it's over, of course.
We'd all prefer a slow and steady rise that keeps pace with adoption, but I don't see that happening :)

I think we'll hit $80 easily enough on Monday, then go up by about $5 a day until Friday (we'll probably max out at about $95). We won't hit $100 this week though, that's too much of a psychological barrier without a bit of consolidation.
Edit: My [last prediction]( was spot on, just FYI. Four days after that post the price broke out from the ~47 stagnation. The conditions are still similar to 9 days ago, but with less bids/asks on the books.

I'm sure the exact data that was encoded into the Bitcoin block-chain is also encoded somewhere in the number Pi. All it would take was knowing which digit to start at and what encoding to use.
It's not like a comment on a website that is self-contained, an http link to a child porn website is self-evident. But something like this requires an outside source of information to know where to look.

I think the people who would have sold this weekend already sold the last two days during the DDOS panic and instawallet hacking news. Based on the position of the current walls and new all-time high USD in bids (&gt; $12 Million USD) and the deafening media coverage, we might even see a bit of a rally over the weekend.
Although if we blast past $150 this afternoon all bets are off, that's going to be some crazy volatility.

I bought in at $8 (with money I could afford to easily lose) and I have been steadily selling off my Bitcoins since $16.
I liquidated most of the rest at $225 when the Gox lag-crash started to get out of control and then all the rest at $170 when I was convinced that the second Gox lag was going to cause an all-out panic.
I withdrew half my profit to my bank account and I have buy orders set up from $70 down to $10 with the other half.
I 100% believe in the future of Bitcoin and want to re-invest, but I also believe we're in for a long slow crash like last time after the last bubble.

I think we've entered a bit of a bubble phase right now, where no one wants to sell because no one else is selling. But the reasons that kicked off the current bubble:
* Blockchain reward halved, so professional miners who immediately sell their coins are having half the impact that they normally would (they also might be refusing to sell below a certain price).
* No major Bitcoin website has been hacked for a few months, a rarity in this world.
* Lots and lots of good press for Bitcoin, particularly Bitinstant and Satoshi Dice.
* Because of the above, lots of people want to invest in Satoshi dice stocks, which are bought in Bitcoin.
* Real-money gambling websites are adding Bitcoin payment options, big websites like WordPress are as well.
* [Bitcoins are being used more and more]( So more people need to be holding Bitcoins.* Bitcoin tools are getting more mature (the default client is still fucking terrible though), and good online wallets like CoinBase (a YC-startup) exist.
* It's much easier to get dollars -&gt; BTC than it was last summer, lots of exchanges in many different areas of the world.
* Not to mention sites like Coinbase that make it so easy to buy they're seeing [$1 million per month]( in sales.

**Buying bitcoins is annoying**
It's really easy in Canada, depositing to our Bitcoin exchange is as easy as paying an online bill (literally, that's one of the deposit options). We can also buy/sell over LocalBitcoins really easily online because of the e-Interact system we have set up.
**Bitcoin transfers are not instantaneous**
On average it takes 10 minutes for a transaction to be initially confirmed (this is good enough for most usages), depending on the receiver they might wait for 6+ confirmations to be 100% sure there was no double-spend attempt. To ensure that your transaction is accepted into the next block you will want to attach a transaction fee to the transfer (small sends with no transaction fee can linger for hours as you mentioned, the miners keeping the network secure need to be compensated for their efforts).
Note: It **is** possible to do instantaneous transfers with [green address](
**Real-time bitcoin data is not always available**
I've had good luck with [btccharts.com]( It costs a subscription fee, but they always have very up-to-date real-time data. I have yet to see them go down.
Or just F5 the [MtGox Wall Observer Thread]( :)
**There's a lot about bitcoins that may go unknown**
You don't need to know about public-key cryptography to use SSL for your credit card transactions, or take a mechanics course to drive your car. Basically you just need a consensus from people that do know these things to say "It's safe to use credit cards on the internet/it's safe to drive a car". In 10 years people will be using Bitcoin-protocol software but will have no idea what a Bitcoin even is (sort of like users of Samsung's S3/S4 phones who have no idea what Android is).

When I first heard about Bitcoin, the price was $1.30 ish. I was recommended not to buy because "it was a bubble and would come down soon", so I invested in some mining gear (right before the run-up to $30 and the huge spike in difficulty). I kept buying small amounts before, during and after the spike to $30, and kept buying through the next year as it dropped to $2. I wish I'd had access to larger sums of money at the time. But I guess I can't complain at all, my original modest investment has netted me 400x returns and I'm well enough positioned if Bitcoin truly does succeed.
What an incredible journey so far, and so much more to come.

That's entirely reasonable, it's the ultimate non-hierarchical experiment (the currency literally moves from peer to peer), and high-level decisions about the open-source software and the management of block-chain mining are made by consensus.

First off, don't invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. $800 seems reasonable if you're not a student or something.
Pretty much everyone on this sub-Reddit expects the value of Bitcoin to eventually increase. Will it go down to $150 before going up? Will the price stagnate for months around the same level? Who knows? It could also crash to $0 if something really catastrophic happens.
My feeling is that a huge price increase is coming in the next few weeks/months. Based on the timing of the current crop of news, I would expect some upwards movement in about a week (Novogartz), with some more a week after that (the $27 story and the ATMs). If the price increases significantly from those two events we'll have a media frenzy and another bubble. If it doesn't we might stagnate around $200 for a few months.

All the BTC investments are doing the same thing, Virtex/Satoshi Dice etc... It's because suddenly instead of having $1000 invested in a company for a fixed share you have $5000 invested and it's not worth it anymore at the current price of BTC.
Basically think of them as $ investments and that you're selling your BTC to invest.

Yeah, it's just a list of usernames with random e-mails. I recognize my old one there, it's probably from the last hack/leak that happened a year or two ago.

Better than the other idiot TV shows lately, but the 'knowledgeable' guy straight out said that the Bitcoin controllers could just 'print' more and cause the value to plummet.
US TV news is fucking awful. The European TV shows didn't shit it up *this* badly.

I'll never understand the media's obsession with buying things in real life with Bitcoins, it's an internet currency... Would you barge into Starbucks and demand they accept PayPal?

If more important things come along I'm sure they'll be upvoted above this post (today is a slow news day so there's nothing really worthwhile). In the meantime click the "hide" button and move along with your life.

Sean's Outpost showed up once the bubble was already in full swing. I seem to remember the bot only really gained prominence during the bubble, not before? I might be wrong. What date was it setup to tip everywhere on Reddit?
I only just heard about Bit.gg myself, but yeah maybe it was around before the last bubble, when did the site go online?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:09:29
I was able to pay in BTC. They made me verify my phone number though... I guess it's for 2FA but that should really be optional.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:00:34
I heard that the problem was miners depositing freshly mined coins (which can't be spent for 100 confirmations). If your withdrawal got mixed up with those you will have to wait until they 'unblock'. It's a very random issue, some withdrawals have that problem, others don't.
I think there's a thread on Bitcointalk somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:39:09
No, 0 or greater than 10,000. Nothing in between.

When there's a 60-minute trade delay, um... there's a delay.
And what good are reserves if they're worth half or double what they were a few hours ago?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:51:08
Cash out the original $500 and let the rest ride for a few years. Or wait until $1000/BTC and cash out the original investment if you must. But do it soon, then at least you can say you haven't lost a thing and it's all profit from here on out.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:59:32
No problem. Have fun, just remember Bitcoin is *really really volatile*, there will be days it loses 25% of its value in hours.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:00
The lag (now at 1 hour plus) will just keep building to infinity.
How have they not shut down trading yet, this is **shocking incompetence**. Mt. Gox have single-handedly set Bitcoin back two years.
Oh well, time to cost-average all the way back down to $10.
Edit: [It's almost looking like they got hacked again]( There's no way people were selling that low an hour ago?
@_date: 2013-02-10 15:25:09


For sure, I doubt ever see single digits again (barring some catastrophe like a fundamental problem with the protocol). But I think it's rising too fast to not be slightly based on speculation.
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:27:54
From what I remember the Reddit news hit when it was already at $27, pushing it up to $27.50, but it has since come down a bit and stabilized.

I don't use them to buy Bitcoins (just as a wallet) but as others have said they're a legit company. To buy a single Bitcoin it might be easier to just use  to find a seller near you for cash.

Nothing's going to change, theymos is one of those "moderators are just there to look pretty" hands-off libertarians. Over time this sub-Reddit will eventually resemble 90% reaction .gifs and barely-on-topic memes.
I've been reporting non-Bitcoin-related submissions for months and they've never removed any of them.
