Could be, anyone else using greenbits got something similar?

Dropped 2 pc today but my investment is up 16 pc from this morning wth
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:33:23
Nearly 9pc today. New to BTC and knew it was volatile but 9 pc in less than 24 hours? Any ideas what's causing it?

Knew I should have bought when it hits 7. Given how volatile it is though will be plenty of opportunities ahead

Seems quite a few on here are panicking and offloading...on the same day it reached its highest..

Sent some from green bits to coinbase more than 4 hours ago and still pending. Just increased the price  hoping to get it through, it's ridiculous. Will never get widely accepted like this.

No I don't know how. I haven't got a lot at stake, will be getting more before the fork. Checked it this morning, was down still, still down roughly the same amount 10 hours later but I'm about $50 better off. Weird

As Covenant states "the gang hung for valuable old bitcoin"

True true

Quite new to BTC, is it wise to buy more now pre fork so that I can just one or the other post fork?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:42:42
Not complaining, just curious as to what may have caused the dip as I haven't seen any news come out. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:09:45
It'll bounce back, don't worry.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:20:36
I think it'll fall the closer we get, I'll be making sure I buy some very soon after.

Actually just checked and it was just above 7200 before 9 this morning, 7030 now but I've taken a jump. Don't know how that's possible
