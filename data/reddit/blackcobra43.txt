Please do not "invest" more than you can afford to lose in this totally awesome magic internet money that's going to the moon.

By THAT logic, they accept Bitpay and nothing more.Microsoft accepts Mastercard/Visa/American Express/etc, not a generic "credit card currency". Dunce.

Bitcoin cannot fail, it can only be failed by those lacking in faith.
Not a cult.

Why is John "I fucking LOVE bath salts and fucking underage south american girls" McAfee a source on ANYTHING?

Yes, if I refuse to participate in an obvious scam then clearly I am not  allowed(? by whom?) to criticize the fraudsters.

You're a gullible fool, which explains why you have been parted from your money.

What? They seized US dollars held in Mt Gox's bank accounts, how is this relevant at all?

ZEN has a fixed dollar value when purchased *outside* of the games (barring the occasional 15%-20% off "sale"). The only thing that fluctuates is what people trade for it ingame. It's more akin to a Steam Wallet than an alt currency.

ZEN is a virtual currency used in all of Perfect World Entertainment games' microtransaction systems. It has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin.

You're right OP, investing in real physical companies producing real products and services is JUST LIKE buying virtual currencies and hum....rig-dried berries? I guess?

..as opposed to obliterating in secret?
