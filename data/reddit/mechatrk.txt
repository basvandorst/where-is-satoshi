Check out coursera, udemy, udacity, youtube, mit ocw, library genesis, etc. etc.
Internet search is your friend.

It seems like he understands the nature of money, however, it seems to be that he can't conceptualize the idea of Bitcoin (a cryptocurrency) in his mind -- which is completely expected considering the fact that he doesn't have much experience with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is here. It is already a unit of account, it is already a medium of exchange, and it is already a store of value. Whatever Ray Dalio, or other older generation people say. My generation (millenials) are smart, tech-savvy, and open to doing thing differently (such as "doing money"). We have grown up with computers and the internet and we spend most of our days online. We see things that simply people like Ray are unable to see. 
That's ok. Their time will pass.

If you are paying for a coffee, cake, etc. at a cafe, I don't think it matters much to use lightning. Probably nobody is going to double spend the amount of sats used for paying a coffee. So, for a coffee, or a cake, I'd be OK with accepting zero-conf payments if I was the cafe owner.
However, as the payment amount in sats goes higher (like, a person buying 5 cups of coffee and some slices of cake) I might be keeping an eye on the confirmations, or might use Lightning altogether.

I downloaded and expanded the bitcoincore package to my home folder (ubuntu). Should I move the contents of `bin` of bitcoin folder to my `/usr/local/bin`? It seems weird for the bitcoin package binaries to sit on my home folder.

I hear a lot of people writing this on the internet. However, I haven't seen a concrete data on the life-time of a 512 GB microsdxc card used for Bitcoin full node.
Everybody says your microsd card will last barely a year, however, nobody seems to have documented this assumption.

can you explain what these `dbcache` and `par` specifications do?

1 sat/byte is the min allowed transaction fee for the transaction to be propagated by the nodes, afaik. I've not had a transaction of mine took more than a day even though I always use 1 sat/byte.
But you say it has happened to yourself. Well, in this case it's a risk and a tradeoff that the cafe owner has to make: Am I going to allow convenience of accepting 0-conf, or am I going to burden some of my customers with waiting for 1-conf.
I would say, for our hypothethical cafe owner, start with accepting 0-conf's. If your customer is a fraudster bunch, then tighten up your confirmation requirements.

Buy and hodl is good and well; however, real investment should be on teaching yourself on how to use Bitcoin properly. Here is a good start: 
Edit: lmao why the downvote? Are you guys all traders here?

I don't know what that means.

Yep, I can confirm this. It seems like sync process has gotten more heavier for me once I am down to last 200'000 blocks or so.

What's the syllabus going to be like? Which subjects/topics are you going to be teaching?
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:07:56
there are many free and open tutorials, books, videos, codes, etc. etc. are available on the internet. You can still find good learning material online.

Just stick with the BTC and you'll be fine.
Edit: perhaps throw in some XMR.
@_date: 2019-12-09 15:50:20
Thanks. Sounds like a good way of keeping up with the updates to the bitcoincore.
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:09:04


I would say teach yourself about the technical aspects of bitcoin. Start reading Grokking Bitcoin by Kalle Rosenbaum.
@_date: 2019-12-12 08:59:28
that ETA will increase to a week later on, as you get closer to the top of the blockchain. I think it's because of heavier use of the block space as time goes on.
