Giving money from person A to person B does not increase the total amount of goods and services. If you increase the velocity of money like you are describing, but keep aggregate supply the same, all schools of economics, Keynesian, mainstream economics, and Austrian, will all tell you that this is an inflationary pressure. There are many other negative effects as well-- handouts do not encourage resourcefulness and thrift, and will turn elections into the contest of whichever candidate promises the biggest increase in the monthly handout, which will over time bankrupt out country just like our existing social programs are doing.

I think one reason you have such high inflation in these countries is that the less sophisticated the people, the more easily they are fooled by the antics of the central banks, the nuances of nominal vs. real rates, etc. It's sad when you think about it.

I believe the next bull run will bring an altcoin season with it... I think this is natural result of people who make money chasing BTC and take their speculative winnings and pour it into more speculative bets. 
That being said, if this comes true it is possible that the altcoin season we see is much smaller than last one.
In any case altcoins are shitcoins but there is always a potential speculation for those who are so inclined

as the price ripens, the problems with the numbers of algorithms dating people (Assuming this means sexbots), why take a picture of yourself?(ie have your assets frozen) One way that to to have the milk of the numbers of ponies deposited(ie big gains), is looking to the moon(inflation!!!) for many deposits of the number of banknotes and the deposits in the banks.

standard view of economics is what you said-- that assets that are not the dollar, fall relative to the dollar during a recession.
other view says that recession will increase public fear about the way that finance works and lead to a move in the price. 
I take the second view, because Bitcoin is still a young asset that can benefit hugely from headlines and fear. Doubling or tripling of the price is nothing. However over time, BTC will come to trade like gold, and will fall during recessions like a normal asset.

Not to hop in on the nitpicking train but I feel qualified to say that Antifa is NOT fascist.
Fascism has pretty much 5 components:
1. Authoritarianism
2. Nationalism
3. Militarism
4. Corporatism(not "handouts to corporations," but govt influence over industry to maximize military and national strength)
5. Belief in national destiny.
Thugging around on the streets is characteristic of both fascists and antifascists. Hitler's brownshirts had street brawls with the German Communists, for instance. In terms of ideology, antifa doesn't have anything in common with fascism.

It's the opposite bro!
The "double tax" situation is what currently exists in the United States as earning BTC counts as income and spending BTC counts as selling and is subject to capital gains.

There really does need to be more talk of monero by BTC advocates. Monero is just a more extreme form of BTC, even harder to stop, harder to confiscate. A natural hedge against govt crackdown. Dark coins are the only altcoins that serve some SoV function that BTC cannot(BTC can do this imperfectly through lightning). Nick Szabo has advocated this. Maybe market cap weighted portfolio between BTC and monero is genuine improvement to 100% BTC portfolio.

Lowering rates increasing aggregate demand/consumption is agreed on by all schools of economics as far as I know.
When the fed shot down the rates you saw things like 0% APR financing for cars, lower rate mortgages, these are pulls to expand consumer credit. Consumer credit = consumption. 
Those resources that are being spent by consumers would otherwise be saved. From your intro macro textbook equation Savings = Investment, you can see that the resources being pulled into consumer spending are coming directly out of investment.

no you are not bro. :) it's maybe more abstract and vague than the math you were exposed to if you went the engineering route
For instance Szabo assumes the existence of a general PoW function-- a function that takes an input string and produces output string of similar length with similar properties, and, where the output is easy to verify, but computationally intensive to produce. 
Szabo also assumes that timestamping can be done reliably and with consensus across the computer networks (and therefore just ignores all of the tricky details in doing this)
Szabo also ignores how people send transactions... as of now, this architecture just proves ownership of newly minted "bit gold." But you need a way to transmit Bit Gold too. (Maybe he ignores this part because it is easy to do? I don't know)
Anyway this work was really early stages... I think it was at this moment that he believed it was possible to do and worth sharing with the world, but there was a lot of work remaining.

Seems like commie economics. Actually Marx predicted mass automation would lead to falling wages, what happened over the last 200 years was totally and completely opposite, standard of living exploded, job losses, although they certainly occurred, were over time irrelevant compared to soaring industrial production.
Part of the reason people are not doing as well as in the past is they can't save money when the value of the money is eroded and interest rates are negative in real terms. There is also structural inequality as a result of money creation in the Cantillon Effect which says that the first to receive newly minted money see their purchasing power increase, whereas the last to receive it, see their real income fall as consumer price inflation comes about.
Bitcoin is designed to address these economic problems. It is sound money reborn from the mind of Satoshi as Pallas sprung from the head of Zeus.

ANY country can tank its own currency just by creating more of it and selling it... no country controls the BTC supply so no country can do that. Long story short, no.
With the Chinese economy in particular, you have a fake exchange rate. They manipulate their fake exchange rate to create whatever kind of headlines they want. Their offshore currency is very thinly traded and they can easily pump and dump(whereas their onshore currency does not trade against USD, hence there is no real market-driven exchange rate for China)

It's not a tax on the financial value of a corporation, that's where you're confused. Has nothing to do with earnings or stock value. 
As we say in accounting, these are "above-the-line" items that are being taxed.
It's a tax on the production of goods, essentially. So if you make a car, the company is taxed by the value of that car. The company passes this higher cost to the consumer, who pays this tax... so you did not end up taxing corporations at all.

It's not directly related to the total amount of BTC that the whale sold, but the depth of the order book.
There's not a lot of depth to the BTC order book. If you wipe out the "buy" orders, the price can fall a lot before liquidity recovers. Even a small whale, if he's fast and aggressive(and stupid), can tank the price.

Too much focus on chasing price, not on fundamentals. And too much focus on altcoins=shitcoins narrative(while this is true as a rule of thumb, with a little thinking you can improve on this)
At current prices, you can have a 99.5% BTC, .5% XMR portfolio that is market-cap weighted... this is amazingly cheap insurance, you can pay for all of this simply by moving from a high-fee exchange like Gemini to a low fee one like CBPro or Kraken.

dollar cost average, I guess for you it's pound-cost average. This is a strategy to make money off of a long term trend without having to time the market. 
A simple monthly DCA is every month you buy 30 pounds(or whatever number of pounds) worth of BTC. Do this at regular intervals regardless of the price. That way if the volatility over time gets smoothed out and you get a nice low-stress average price.

Gotcha yes. That is basically the nature of centralized institutions... they will have to report to IRS. They cannot hide. 
The feds taking down liberty dollar, the centralized gold depot, was what inspired Bitcoin in the first place. 
Nick Szabo lists "decentralized exchanges" as one of the three critical areas of improvement for Bitcoin, the other being "key management and security" and "layer 2 solutions"
Nobody knows whether decentralized exchanges are really feasible however, so... we will have to pay our taxes, most likely.

My Russian friend Yuri's take on current price action:
"You see MrCumsHisPants, BTC only goes up, and when it goes down thees is coiling for when it go up, build up energy like springboard you see, and when it goes sidewayes thees is profit taking from whales and about to go up when whale all have shot his snot. So with American capitalist greed you cannot see, but thees only go up"

By the way you're right COL goes up. In nominal terms always, and in real terms, in many parts of the country. I want deflationary money so that people can save money over time, and at the local level, zoning and land use restrictions like "historical districts"(this one is very common where I live) make housing much less affordable, and impede the ability of businesses to hire people and create growth. There are also some goods like healthcare and education which go in real terms up due to licensing and rising salaries in these fields, and sometimes shenanigans with the FDA.
I think these problems need to be addressed as to WHY they are constantly getting more expensive, and fixed where possible, but paying people more money just slaps a band aid on the issue, and like federal student loan grants, this will have the effect of driving prices for these industries up. The issue in both of these cases is structural in the ability of these goods to be supplied-- and increasing demand cannot solve the scarcity on the supply half of the equation.

yes, that is the mechanism of money creation but you can also look at the inputs and outputs of the system itself. at a higher level the fed produces the incentives for money creation by allowing banks to borrow money more cheaply (and therefore profit by loaning money at higher long-term rates, creating money in the process)
To describe the same thing differently, the fed creates base money, which is in essence an option for banks to extend consumer credit. 
To say "the fed prints money" may ignore the proximate causes of money printing but as a high level understanding it is correct.
