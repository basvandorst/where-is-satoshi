How old are you? Do you know what silk road was. He was running the world largest drug marketplace and tried to hire assasins multiple times to kill someone he knew.
You're confusing selling drugs on the dark web with inventing a technology that allows websites to be hosted and browsed anonymously. One will get you a high paying job at any tech company or government security agency and is universally respected work, the other is deliberately facilitating crime and profiting from it.

This is not how free open source software or the security community works, if the founders for example are detained or corrupted, the software can be forked and developed by other people. If someone puts malicious code into it, it can be easily seen by others and the branch disused... 
It’s the same for Tor, there’s not much the government can do. If they persecute the people who develop it locally it will just be developed by people in another country. 
In terms of how the InfoSec community operates, it’s possible some of the developers may be poached as offered very high paying contracts by the government to consult them on it and possibly find flaws. One of the biggest contributions to Linux security started this way with the NSA and eventually turned into SELinux, a widely used, deeply integrated security system built into about half Linux operating systems (Ubuntu uses a lame alternative)

To clarify, from a legal perspective there is no Actus Reus or Mens Rea behind the development of the software for it to be considered a criminal act and the developer of the software play no part in actual exchange of money for them to have any responsibilities, especially to some random regulator in an overseas country that none of the developers  are based in from looking at their profiles.
This is the same reason why the record industry never went after the creators or the torrent protocol or even the companies making torrenting software such as uTorrent that use the protocol, as they are not party to any illegal acts.
The responsibility will be on the two people making the trade to meet the regulations of their country as no data is passed to visa itself, similar to your tax obligations with bitcoin.
Even within the perspective of the EU or UK, the Financial Services Authority is not going to waste time on this as it is essentially unenforceable, and it’s outside of their remit.

As someone who works in the security community, please be aware, when making your paper wallets there are many trains of malware that are capable of sorting and running themselves from motherboard firmware or hard disk firmware and storing information there... so if you’re running a live CD to make some paper wallets you should destroy the laptop and printer once you are done, similar to what we do with our company laptop after going to the DefCon conference, we destroy the HDD, put an old clean HDD in and give the laptop to charity. Like an STD, it’s unlikely but we are not taking the risk.

Jobs would never support something he couldn’t centralise/control and put artificial limitations and some wrapper on top of it to make money.
There is no business case for Apple to make money from bitcoin as it is.
Jobs was generally not interested in the philosophy to technology behind a product, he was interested in dealing with the reality of it day to day.
Can I have 10,000 songs in my pocket, can I buy a coke instantly and easily without a bank involved? Can I make people pay to use this?
Apple makes more profit off me from my iPhone than all my banks do from my accounts and car loan and the effort to administrate it is much higher.

Yeah it shows as a transaction. 
It was actually on an exchange I didn’t use. I thought it was a spam email. 
If the exchange was called ‘discover’ I picked the handle ‘discove’ for my user account. (You can send money by handle on this exchange) so someone must have sent the money to  by mistake because it’s next to impossible someone sent it to the wallet address. I reckon them must have been an addict trying to score and got confused

You say that but BTC is the one centralising with lightning. Don’t get me wrong, I’m 100% in BCT but BCH is less centralised. The mining difficulty itself is a much stronger weighting to centralisation than the block size.

Cheaper including fee, Not just fees. I generally don’t buy huge amounts at the same time so this works for me. I want to buy the coins and move them elsewhere, not keep them on the exchange I bought them on.

@_date: 2017-12-17 12:18:35
Not quite true. The issue most people don’t understand around market cap is it’s not the amount invested or traded. If 90% of investors are not trading the currency, just hodling forever, only 10% of the volume is influencing the price. In this scenario if these 10% all tried to sell the value would go close to $0.
I don’t know what percentage of bitcoin is actually traded but it’s gotta be a lot less than 10%
And lastly, prices don’t work that way, if bitcoins market cap increases by $1billion that doesn’t mean an additional $1b was spent on bitcoin, it could be as little as $1.00 being traded when there is no demand in the market to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:21:10

Honestly, why use an exchange. Use a local site that will sell you coins to an address of your choice (the UK ones I use give better rates than Bitstamp or Coinbase). If you need an exchange sent it to something like Bitfinex if you want to trade. Exchanges are more painful than banks, incredibly unreliable, often high fees and with block you from doing things like withdrawing for no apparent reason.
Bitstamp took two weeks to confirm my identity documents and blocked my colleague from withdrawing for a month.
As someone who works in CyberSecurity exchanges are a huge target and provide little protection if they are reckless with storage or go bust. They are not banks.

The thing is, I see a lot of people on here that don’t have the slightest clue what they are talking about when they say market cap.
They think, or imply that because the market cap is half a trillion that means people have spent collectively half a trillion which is laughable. 
If 95% of people are not actively trading, it only takes a minute fraction of the market cap to sell to bring down the market value to $1
So it’s not unrealistic for the market cap to reach 100 Trillion as market cap is not a measure of total investment, just a multiplication of how much the currently traded coins are worth multiplied by all coins.
You could argue the market cap should be lower anyway as there is not really any proof that the satoshi portion is available to anyone anymore and it’s likely if he traded it bitcoin as a whole would void those coins to protect itself. Also, there must be a significant percentage of coins in wallets that people have lost the keys for. Especially from the early days where you could mine thousands of coins and then lose the keys because they were worth pennies and you didn’t think it was worth continuing your experiment.

What’s the logic of keeping coins in an exchange if you are holding. I constantly hear issues people have with them... issues I can’t relate to.
Hardware wallets, paper wallets or a segwit wallet like green address ensuring you control your own money as the only person with the private keys. 
Buy your coins from a trading site where you put your wallet address in when buying the coins and shop around for the most competitive rate.
Then, if you want to diversify by buying alt coins, spread it across 3 or 4 alt coin exchanges and if you ever accumulate to much of an individual alt coin, possibly consider managing your own wallet in that coin too

People say the biggest problems are the transaction fees, confirmation times etc... 
No, the biggest problems is how shitty all the companies are that we have to deal with.
Bitfinex: Shitty or no support, bad code from what I’ve seen in their JavaScript and generally how their site is architected, I have no confidence in its security. The fact they use cloud flare the way they do instead of Akamai or Imperva says a lot about them (cheap and not really concerned with end user experience). They also obviously never hired a UX designer.
Coinbase: shitty or no support, code I’ve seen was written ok but is obviously poorly QA’d, the amount of errors I get on the site at inappropriate times.
GDAX: Shitty support, nothing to give me any opinion about the site.
Bittylicious: Crappy site, occasional crap prices, but great support
GreenAddress: Ignore you until you publicly complain about their lack of response on and generally terrible readme.md/documentation on github with crap quality code
If you can’t run your business without providing decent support to your customers, make slightly more margin or charge for premium support because this is so amateur. It’s worse than the Indian Call centre I had for my broadband in the early 2000s
