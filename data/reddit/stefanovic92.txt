The whole point of crypto is to not have to exchange with fiat anymore. So they can KYC and tax all they want. But IF Bitcoin reaches critical adoption, you will work, buy, sell and trade in crypto. As we say: hodl

You pay a higher fee for a private, faster and easier way of getting bitcoin (no need to set-up account with ID etc). Seems fair to me depe ding on your priorities

Yeah it’s crazy. Just stumbled upon an old picture of the first iPhone 3G announcement. IT WAS $199 LOL

True maybe a bit optimistic. But that’s why I gave a range starting from 0.5M
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:39:18
I agree. Just stating the risks to bitcoin adoption. Tho I think the governmental problems will be a much higher risk than some other coin taking over. And with other coin I mean: who knows what kind of technologies will come that may compete with Bitcoin. Just stating the problems Bitcoin MIGHT face

To be honest, 5 years is a pretty long time for Bitcoin to develop into a mass adopted currency. However, it will either explode in adoption somewhere in the next 5 years OR it will get overtaken by another coin or some governmental bans or some other sh\*t will really push back adoption. So I think the price will either be way over 100K (0.5M - 3M) or it will stay relatively the same or even lower then the current price. What do you guys think?

I remember reading somewhere that 2 ATM's in Amsterdam were vandalized / stolen. Maybe that's why nobody wants to try again, not sure. I live in Amsterdam and haven't seen a bitcoin ATM yet.

I don't understand how someone like Ray Dalio, who preaches radical open-mindedness, hasn't let himself be informed on the exact workings of Bitcoin. I know he has touched upon Bitcoin a couple of times but he then always concludes with the disappointing statement: "Blockchain, not Bitcoin". 
In this article he's basically explaining how the current system will collapse and how we need a new system and big paradigm shift. Ray.. It's already there and ti's called Bitcoin..

That's strange. I've ordered my wirex card a couple of weeks ago and haven't had any trouble so far. Have been using it intensely (booked a flight and hotel in the philippines) transfered btc to and from the wallet. Everything worked smoothly but I will stay cautious.. thnx

"The blockchain revolution" by Don &amp; Alex Tapscott is pretty good. It doesn't go into the technical details of Blockchain/Cryptocurrency that much. It's more of a projection of the future applications of Blockchain. A lot of critics find it too optimistic/utopian-like. However I bet these were the same critics that could not see the value of the internet before it grew out to what it is today. Blockchain WILL disrupt the future and this books shows in what ways.

Buy a couple of bitcoins with money you are willing and are able to lose. Hodl until bitcoin price reaches the moon. If it doesn't you lose some money. If it does you will be rich. Just accept that you've lost the invested money so you don't freak out when the price drops.
The flip side is: You can decide you don't want to take the risk. So you don't buy bitcoin but the price does skyrocket in the future. I could not live with that "if only" feeling for the rest of my life.
I'd rather invest and fail than not invest and regret for the rest of my life.

Thanks guys, real clear explanation. Just one thing I don't understand yet. How come traders are allowed to make a "deal" with exchanges so they set their own buy or sell price. But when I buy or sell at an exchange there's a fixed price, take it or leave it?
Cheers guys

When the btc price started rising this month I was waiting for a dip. But I have learned from an investment mentor that you should pick a fixed date (for me its every 21st when my salary arrives) to buy stock/btc. If you try and wait for a "dip" you are speculating. Its statistically proven that its better to buy at a fixed date than to speculate. And guess what, I didn't wait for a dip when the btc was around 780. Now its almost 1000. Lucky me or strategy?
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:05:33
What actually determines the price of bitcoin? I understand that relation between demand and supply determine the price. But How does this directly influence the price? Who changes the price? The exchange? How come all exchanges equally change the price, or do they follow some "main exchange"? If so, which one? I needz to know diz

Don't invest if you lack the knowledge to answer these questions yourself. Sorry mate but i'm keeping it real.

Miners basically keep the Bitcoin Network secure by solving complex mathematical equations with their mining rigs. Because this costs electricity they need an incentive to keep mining. Which is called the “Block Reward”.  This reward get’s cut in half every 4 years or so. So basically every 10 minutes, 12,5 BTC get added into the supply. Next year this reward will be 6,25. Which will make Bitcoin more scarce —&gt; Moon
