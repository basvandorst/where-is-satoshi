Wall street takes nights, weekends, and holidays off. Crypto exchanges run 24/7/365. System updates are much more difficult to pull off when you have no scheduled downtime.

I agree, why would he have said that?

Oh please. Do you even realize that they replied to your shitpost?

False. I just withdrew. 
read in the t-box that some people were having trouble because the confirm withdrawal links had a www. in the URL, but you can only reach poloniex at the non www. address right now.  &lt; no www

Neat. Did you know that you can browse and search it here?

There is a precedent

For those concerned about the arbitration clause. Coinbase, Bitfinex, Gemini, HitBTC, Kraken, and Bittrex all state similar. 
I'm not saying I agree, just pointing out that this language is industry standard.

Kind of ironic

Cold storage is only as safe as the private keys. While it is a best practice, it does not make the funds immune to theft. It all depends on the security protocols. Many high-profile Bitcoin heists have been carried out by insiders who had access to cold storage keys.

Coinbase leads customers to believe they are fully insured but if you read carefully you'll find that only their hot wallet is insured, which is less than 2% of total customer deposits. If there is a major hack the insurance probably will not be of help.

This 2FA FUD again? Read their response to the claim about 2FA [here]( and [here]( The OP is clearly lying.
As far as the terms go, all exchanges have class action clauses. In fact Poloniex added their clause long after other exchanges had them in place.

Withdrawals come from their common hot wallet address, not your deposit address. True of all exchanges isn't it?
