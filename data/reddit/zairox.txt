Mainly because they stole the Bitcoin name and are trying to scam users into thinking bcash is the real BTC.

gdax doesn't have segwit yet though.

Looks like that is the idea.....

My belief is that Malta wants to increase their own GDP by selling shovels (so to speak) to crypto investors.
They are in it for the money, just like everyone else.

Bisq actually accepts FIAT.

Is this the new hodl?

Your platform is 95 washtrading so I hardly belive you care that much about laundering.

You're here so you should be used to volatility, but stockbrokers enter panic mode after -2%.

Litecoin is basically Bitcoin4X. 
4x the supply
4x the block size

Basically, you're fucked either way.

That rumor was only posted on a singular newssite without a source and has not been proven.

I don't use Trezor, but with Ledger you have to manually choose blockchain before the app will open.
Ledger doesn't "default" to one particular chain or hide that option away from you.

Coinjoined coins are not  indistinguishable from unmixed BTC.
Now if this was implemented as a core protocol so every BTC was mandatory mixed you would have had a point.

For privacy maybe.  Fungibility no.
I can choose to not accept mixed BTC as the process is clearly detectable.
Authorities have already stated that mixed bitcoins raise suspicion.

Thus if I don't want to be subjected to an investigation it would be better for me to buy bitcoins from known (legit) owners. Thus 1BTC /= 1BTC or in other words not fungible.

Assuming that the world is round it will surely go to hell and exit on the other side before continuing on the journey to the moon.
You're fucked if the world is flat though.

Bitconnect is a scam
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:07:15
Am I missing something? 
Your link shows  9.87 BTC for the last 24h. 
Not amazing sure, but it's \*something\*
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:03:24
Any thoughts on this?
