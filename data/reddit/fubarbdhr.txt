I am a miner and I use 0 fee transactions to move money between my own wallets.  Can't see spending money to move coins from my front pocket to my back or to offline wallet.  I don't care the time that takes.  Now I do include fees if I am spending somewhere and want it to get there in a block or 2.  
I've also used a very low fee transaction to pay for something.  The cost was .15btc but the transaction size due to my wallet being nearly empty and all the dust collections was over 900k.  Yea that's right almost a full block for a .15btc transaction.

Well love to show you transactions but some of us spend our tips on beer.  Not a bad thing when the empty cans are picked up and sold by one charity (can't remember which), The pull tabs go into a collection and are sent to a local children hospital that take them as payments for some treatment for sick kids.  Oh and the cardboard and newspapers get picked up and sold to the local paper mill by a local church that use the money to buy food and clothes for those that need it.  So indirectly part of every tip makes it to charity.

Well I have a couple of servers and over 10 computers.  All are set to sync with either the servers or a time source that syncs with the atomic clocks.  I don't know what the update interval is but I can tell you that going between those computers they vary by 2-3 minutes between each other over the course of a day.  It all comes down to clock speeds of chips.  I haven't tried it with modern processors but with the older chips (286-P3) changing the clock frequency of the chip changed the rate at which time would become out of sync.  I would assume newer chips have similar issues.

It's called escrow.  You get use of the property and pay until you own it.  Just like with any other loan if you miss a payment you default on the contract and the property goes back to the original owner.  What happened here is a bit more complicated since the site was being bought on escrow then leased out to a 3rd party (probably not legal in the first place).

@_date: 2015-05-18 09:09:00
It's a lot more complicated than that.  It varies state by state, area by area.  Some places require the fed to be involved in the seizure process, others don't.  I think this was an IRS case (may have been multiple departments) which would require fed involvement but there are other departments that do civil forfeiture as well.  One of the things they are tying to prevent is the use of the laws to take peoples money on simple things like traffic stops so they can line their own departments pockets.  If the law requires them to bring in the fed the fed wont do it.  If the state has a law then you are still screwed.

That are close to 400 but you need to leave at least a 20% margin of safety so that's at lest 480.  Now on top of that you also need a psu that is not a cheap no name brand.  Corsair for instance.  Oh and entry level mining is an s5 so your about 9 months out of date and they will use more electric than they make so ROI = never even if they are free.
The expected generation output, at 180 ghps, given difficulty of 47,643,398,017.803443908691, is 0.001900015044 BTC per day and 0.000079167293 BTC per hour.  Given this rate it will take you 1 year, 23 weeks, 0 days, 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 44 seconds to make 1.0 BTC
A miner with a hashrate of 180.00 ghps that uses 400 watts at 0.10 USD/kWh requires a BTC price of 505.26 USD to break even on the cost of electric. The current bitcoin price is 237.44 USD a difference of -267.82 USD
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:11:31
Do an ipconfig on your laptop.  Make sure the gateway in the s3 is the same as the laptop.  Set the dns to the gateway or whatever your laptop is using.  Make sure the subnet is correct.  The broadcast is probably whatever the gateway is with 255 as the last octet.  So if the router is 192.168.1.1 the broadcast is 192.168.1.255.  
You can also go to the diagnostics under network in the miner and try pinging from there.
@_date: 2015-05-17 09:51:00
Then just buy the bitcoin if your expecting it to go up that much.  No electric needed.  
And why 2 s1 and 2 psu when he could get 1 s3 and 1 psu for about the same price.  Over twice the btc for the same electric cost.  S1 makes no sense at all right now (well maybe where it is winter and you can offset heating costs)
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:02:44
It's a scam not an attack.  If you read the description of the transactions they ask you to send btc to a specific address to get more btc in return.  They are hoping at least one idiot tries it so they make more then they spent.

You have an address in one of their wallets not in a wallet of your own.  Each wallet can contain many addresses.  Look what happened to bitstamp and the 5mil in coins.

Hash is moving to china where the big pools get cheap electric.  Also have to figure in a lot of newer miners were ordered before the price drop.  It's either run them at a loss and hope the price goes up, try to sell them and probably take a loss, or leave them off and definitely take a loss.

I haven't seen anything where it says they are turning off their miners.  Disabling cloud and not paying out does not mean they aren't still using those miners to mine for themselves.

@_date: 2015-01-17 10:14:33
That was for a home miner.  While big corps get cheaper electric and can locate places like china they also have to pay staff.  
What really worries me long term is if mining becomes only profitable in a few locations than you get setup for a 51% attack.  Last time I checked Chinese mining pools make up 42% of the hash and that's not counting unknown.  When bitcoin becomes a more accepted currency the Chinese government could just step in and take over all those mining operations and boom they control it all.

Difficulty has no direct correlation to price.  Basically what difficulty does is makes it so no matter how much hash is added (or removed) from the network that the average time to find 1 block is 10 minutes.  
Now indirectly it can have and effect if people stop mining due to low price or increase mining due to high price.

Well everyone I know that mines is doing so at a loss right now.  I was about break even on electric costs at $400 and that's without trying to make the cost of the miners back.  To pay off the miners and electric I would need to see over $600.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:22:32
I think you have it backwards.  It will be the home miners that get forced out.  The big companies can negotiate for cheaper power, get tax breaks, buy equipment in bulk (if they don't make it themselves), and raise capital to get through the hard times.  If they do go out they can declare bankruptcy, walk away with what they already paid themselves, and then reorganize or just start all over again as a new company. 
The home miner has no control except the power switch.

That's the one thing about bitcoin I've never really liked it has no other use other than as a commodity.  Other things like gold, silver, oil, etc have value outside of the market.  There is always demand because there is a need for them.  This means the market isn't as unstable (yes it can be at times) as something that is purely just 0's and 1's.  
Maybe to make it more stable all coins should have been assigned market value at the moment of mining and get adjusted to current value when used.  The market value would be the average of nearly all coins (chop off coins that are way high or low in value) not just the ones currently being traded.  It would make it harder to push the market up or down since you would need enough coins moved to offset the current average of all the other coins already mined.

First every appliance would need to be connected to the internet somehow.  Second the owner would have to know how to configure it or the manufacturer would control the hash.  Third even if the owner can configure it such small amounts of hash would need to connect to a pool to be effective (if a pool would even register that small amount of hash).  This would give the pool control of that hash just like it is now with the big mining pools.

The miners themselves are paid for so as long as the cost to run them is less than the electric they are profitable for the company.  Let say the company takes 70% in fees on the contracts and payout 30%.  That means they need to make 30% more than the electric costs just to break even.  Cut out that 30% payout, tell people they are disabled because they aren't profitable and they keep 100% of the payouts instead of 70% a 30% profit.  Even if it cost them 90% of what they make to run them they are still making 10% but not enough to pay the 30%.

Cost to mine varies greatly depending on cost of power, location (if it's hot you need power to keep the miners cool), and hardware.  Luck also plays a big role.  Luck aside your looking about about 4000 worth of equipment to mine 2btc a month with current difficulty.  That's between 5000 and 6000 watts of power a month for the most efficient miners.  Estimate that at around 450-500 a month in electric at .085/kwh + transmission and other fees.    So with price where it is now you are basically at break even or even a small loss for electric in a month.  Then you need to ROI the cost of the miners.  As equipment becomes obsolete pretty fast you have about 6 months to do that.  That means you need to make another 3 btc a month at current prices.  So that comes out to around $550.  Remember that's without difficulty increases.  
Kind of got lost there.  Have to track that back to 1btc
OK figured out where I got off track.  450 to 500 a month for 2btc so 225-250 for 1 in half a month.  Divide the 667 bucks a month by 2 also you got $333.  Add them up and your around 575 a coin give or take $25.  So 600 is pretty damn close.

It's not just about bitcoin devices.  In my case I can't use IPv6 for bitcoin or anything else since I have some devices that aren't capable of doing IPv6.  Up until 18 months ago IPv6 wasn't even a possibility with DSL in my area.  It only became available when uverse was finally offered with static IP packages.  I'm sure there are a lot of areas that haven't been updated.  Lets face it internet in the US is terrible unless you live in a big city where there is competition between providers.  In my area I have 2 options AT&amp;T or the local crappy cable company who buys their bandwidth from AT&amp;T.

Local charities seem to do the most good with the money they get.  Things like food banks, homeless shelters, shoes and clothing (can't think of what they are called but places that give used and new clothes to those in need).  
Problem is a lot of these types of places work off of donations of items not money.  Maybe getting a big company involved with taking bitcoin and giving out goods to local organizations would be a starting point.  Heck if people have the right connections they might even be able to get them to match bitcoin donations.

No a judge can throw you in jail for anything he wants to (within reason).  I've seen judges throw their own friends and coworkers in jail just because they got pissed off at them in court.

They may find more 10x more blocks but for every one they find you get 10% of what you would get with the smaller pool.  The equations do hold true for solo mining it's just it takes so much hash to have a decent possibility of hitting a block in a year the cost of the equipment is ridiculous.

You can do the same in the US by claiming as many dependents as you want to decrease your taxes to 0.  Actually a good idea if you know you are getting big tax refunds so you have control of your money each pay instead of giving uncle sam the interest.  Problem is at the end of the year you still owe taxes on what you were paid.  If those are more then 10% of your income you get slammed with penalties.  So yea you can opt out of them being withheld but at the end of the year you are still on the hook for what you actually owe.

It's fixed to a number yes but does that mean it's finite as a commodity?  Things like oil and gold can only be subdivided so many times then you hit a limit.  With oil it's the size of the molecule, with gold the size of the atom.  With numbers the only true limit is the amount of data the universe can hold.  Math has shown that something can be both finite and infinite at the same time.  I believe one such example is called gabriel's horn.  I

With checks the canceled check is your receipt.  Credit cards you have a statement that acts as proof of payment.  Cash you can ask for a receipt because it's in person (unless your dumb enough to mail cash).  With bitcoin you would have to rely on the other party to send a receipt.  Even with big companies sometimes all you get is an order confirmation and packing list no actual receipt.

While I agree about the bank making money off your your money while they have it if your paying fees for deposits or withdraws your either doing something wrong or dealing with the wrong bank.  I have never paid a fee or interest to any bank or credit card company with the exception to one foreign transaction fee for a wire to England and that was about $6 and only because of the currency conversion (something bitcoin would have prevented).

It's the smallest unit for now.  If the value increases that much then it's probable more decimal places would be added and it would no longer be the smallest unit.

Not crazy at all.  Coins unlike dollars don't have serial numbers and don't get pulled from circulation.  They get spent all the time.  My uncle used to buy bags (yes bags not rolls) of quarters and go through them looking for silver ones.  Not that he needed the money. He accidentally sold a Cadillac with a few thousands dollars worth of quarters in the trunk.  Dealer did return them.
On topic that's got to be the craziest thing to hide anything in.  If someone is going to steal something they will start with any money.  Try making something less obvious like a button or belt buckle.

Anything can be hacked.  Bank accounts and credit cards are hacked all the time.  The only reason you hear about bitcoin hacks so much is that when it happens the people who got hacked are the ones effected.  When bank accounts and credit cards are hacked everyone that uses banks and credit cards is effected they just don't realize it.  It comes out of those fees retailers pay, interest charges, etc.  Since bitcoins only fees are those miniscule ones that go to miners to keep the blockchain going the person/entity that gets hacked takes the full burden. 
Now for how to convince her explain that if she uses a payment processor then they are the ones that would have the coins and she gets cash.  Very little risk that way.  Probably less than if you payed her in cash and she got mugged or pulled over by the cops on the way to the bank and had it taken.

What you download is a bootstrap file.  The computer still has to build all the files from that file just as it would need to do if you did not download the torrent.  The speedup comes from having most of the info (up until the time the bootstrap was created) on your drive already and not needing to grab it from the internet.  Again along with processor your restricted by the speed of the drive itself during this process.  The new bitcoin core is supposed to be a lot faster on the initial sync but I've only done an upgrade not a full sync to test.

All mining involves luck.  You could try to solo mine and hit a block in a few seconds or never no matter what your hash rate.  More hash better your odds.  The 74 years is just what it would take given 100% luck at current difficulty to make 1btc.  100% luck solo mining would be 25x as long to hit a block.

The only thing that is cpu intensive is the initial sync.  Just having it running doesn't use much at all.   Running on a core2 2ghz machine with 2gig ram and no issues except qt crashing once and awhile.

9 USB miners will make next to nothing with the current difficulty.  If a pool has a transaction or min payout you will take years just to make enough btc to get a payout. Better off mining an altcoin with them and hoping you can make some btc that way.

Another idea.  Print codes/addresses on either materials used in your business (cups for instance) or on register receipts.

Depending on the size of the business there could be a couple of decent prizes.
