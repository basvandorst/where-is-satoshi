Android only requires you to check a box in the settings menu to install from untrusted sources, not root.

6 digit PIN only.

So when you select the mix funds checkbox in the actions tab it automatically starts mixing your funds? For how long? I've had it checked but didn't notice my funds reducing due to fees, but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention.

Just about everyone besides bitcoin enthusiasts have no idea what you mean by those two things, including me. Care to explain?

What are deterministic wallets?

That app is a horrible solution for a business, and even really low protection for a personal mobile wallet. At bare minimum it needs pin code protection.

I wouldn't be surprised at all that countries in the region would want to get off the dollar, especially for oil prices.

I have one from January 13th. I still have the original funds though in a different wallet. Maybe I double spent myself.

How do you backup your keys? Can you do that with Google Authenticator?
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:35:05
You need to make an offline storage. Only store the address in mycelium, and use the cold storage feature to withdraw. And generate a new address when you withdraw if you're super paranoid.

How does it go through coin join all day? I thought it just did it when you sent them. How much in fees do you rack up?
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:14:16
I would prefer a separate app for that.

How do I use testnet?
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:25:03
Just curious, how long is it supposed to take? I placed my order about an hour ago.

That's kind of the appeal about the show though. It's great to have podcasts where the hosts are experts on certain things, but on JRE, probably because it's so laid back, they get a lot of different guests who have knowledge on all kinds of subjects. Sometimes the show runs close to 3 hours long so you get really in depth discussions with some interesting people and some other people who have more common knowledge on the subject so things never really get to technical without being explained first. So of course as a bitcoin enthusiast you weren't exactly wowed by the depth of the discussion, neither of them are exactly bitcoin experts. But most people today still haven't heard of or understand bitcoin at all. There's also a lot of comedians as guests, and other podcast hosts who I probably would have never subscribed to if I hadn't heard them as guests first.


This is usually because they're high. Which also makes it fun to listen to high.

Don't ever talk to the cops. You'll only make things worse. Remain silent, record the conversation, and comply but never consent.

So what if I buy BTC through Coinbase, then transfer it to a BTC wallet app?
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:12:36
I made this one 
I suppose you can just flip a coin and let me know?...

My wife used to work for a call center that received their calls. The floral shops hate them because they're taking away all of the local calls and they're using their massive amount of orders to under cut the floral shops prices to increase their profit. It was a real shitty place.

Coinbase has recurring payments.
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:01:39
You "have" them when you have the private key.
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:30:00
What does that mean?

How do you make any money from faucets? Several evenings of work netted me about 10 cents.
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:54:14
Cool, would it work to input heads or tails or something? What's the easiest thing to do?
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:32:23
Also a couple things I noticed. A QR Code would be nice, I keep all my spending money on my phone. The chat room sidebar thing is way to intrusive, it's not clear how to minimize it at first, and it keeps beeping like there's a new message, but I don't see any new messages in the chat room.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:25:06
Cool thanks! That helps a lot.

Usually the go to a microtransaction service that uses your address as the account and allows you to cash out after you've accumulated a certain amount.

White paper?

What are some other good options?

I have never heard of this being the case in the US. I know that some states have laws against talking video in some situations, which is bullshit.
The ACLU actually has a great android app that will upload your conversation to their servers.

I don't get it...

Bummer I missed it. Want me to send it back to the same address?
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:47:16
Cool. Here's my address if it's still available 1Mv38GHP6UerxKqbEkJ1y2qK2AEcitKkK9

I honestly have no idea.
