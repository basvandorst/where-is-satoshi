Just general good practices to follow going forward, regardless of how much bitcoin they have. 0.016 btc may not be a lot now, but who can say what it's value will be in a year. And exchanges can go down, accounts can get hacked and wiped, regardless of how much crypto you own.

"UBS has called the market a “speculative bubble”, while JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon has lambasted it as an outright “fraud”.
Moas writes that these criticisms do not deter him from his positive outlook.
“What would we expect them to say?” he wrote. They’re “heavily invested in the publicly traded U.S. banks that are threatened by cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not a scam and it is not in a bubble. You are more likely to find scams and bubbles in the U.S. stock market.”" ��

Considering that JP Morgan bought BTC after the price dropped following his comments, I highly doubt he is crying.

Any good alternatives to this service for Canadians? Looking into Quadriga right now.

So many times I've avoided buying because of fees, only for the price to increase immediately after and negate the fees by a ton lol
