MSM is way too slow to report on crypto, it's a hot topic so they always want something to print but the trouble is the market moves so fast that by the time they've gone to press things have already changed. Then their articles online stay live for weeks and almost always make things look worse than they already are. This 'crash' linked to S.Korea had almost recovered yet if you Google bitcoin all that comes up is doom and bloody gloom!

I spent 3 whole months locked out of my Poloniex account because of an attempted hack. Took them 3 months to answer a ticket to unfreeze my account. It's a good platform as long as nothing goes wrong. But if it does you're in for a long ride.

Well I have a job, but I've never had shit my whole life. Never had any savings or anything like that. Got a bit of money from a relative passing away and bought BTC last year with it. Now I have something. Had I followed your advice then I'd only have marginally more than I started with. Sometimes you've gotta say fuck it and let it ride.

I've bought big and small (countless times) on there in the past with zero issues. Can't speak for anyone else but as far as I know it's solid.

Satoshi Nakamoto IS Bitcoin, he uploaded himself to the blockchain and the price rises and dips are caused solely by him. Satoshi doesn't like weak hearted b*tches, and doesn't want them to prosper in life, so he routinely plummets the price to scare them off....

My fear isn't losing out on my initial investment it'd have to go a looking way down for that to happen. I'm just pissed I didn't cash out some car money when it was at its ATH. Now I'm super reluctant to cash out any amount because it's worth so much less then what it was. Back to waiting I guess!

My uncle died last year and his estate was broken up amongst his siblings. My mum gave a little of her share. I bought bitcoin with it in June last year. I think he might be watching over my investment! :)

BTC turned my initial £4k into about £20k. I can't imagine anything else that could have got me there
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:45:02
Oh and I only ever bought online, never in person.

I'm in the UK, you have to sign up to coinbase and deposit a small amount in Euros via IBAN, this then validates your bank account so you can use it through GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:34:20
I once bought at the top, back in June last year. Had a terrible couple of months, even dipped below what I paid, I got scared, but I didn't consider bailing. Now I'm still way up on my initial investment and still not scared!

I'm also not saying that ALL Romanians that are in London are the shitty kind, I work with Romanians, I have a few Romanian friends, they're cool people. But there are tonnes of shitty ones here too. And it's obviously not just Romanians, we have shitty people here from all over the world. London is a major city and major cities always attract criminals. I was just replying to your comment that Romania is a beautiful and friendly place. It probably is, because all the criminals moved here! Lol

Was watching a documentary about Mr Buffet the other day. He's a very practical investor and not a risk taker. Crypto is risky, it's new and a little unpredictable. I can see why someone like him wouldn't touch it and to be fair he doesn't need to. He's old and rich already.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:14:36
Yes, because all the shitty Romanians moved to London to scam us. I bet the crime rate in Romania is zero right now!

I just got word from Yoshi Takamoto (bitcoins's creator if you're not in the know). He said that Bitcoins has now found its inherent value, and it's $9,500.

Might as well sell it and buy some actual coins. If you're in profit then it's already served it's purpose

Bought big at £2225, thought it was a massive risk at the time but the money was free so took the gamble, thus far it's paid off. Used to buy bitcoin for dodgy purposes going back about 2 years, remember it being $700 something but never held anything back then.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:39:28
I'm talking about spending a few thousand £ on a 2nd hand car, not blowing my whole load on a brand new Benz. Also I know I car isn't an investment, neither is music or beer, but people still buy them. To me it's about spending a bit of money and enjoying myself. And I've got a lot more right now than I've ever had before.

I think I might be addicted to BTC, sold half my holdings yesterday to save myself from a heart attack and today I'm itching to buy right back in. 
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:25:51

100% BTC!
Made some decent money trading around early in the year (DigiByte did me proud). But now I'm just scared any money that isn't in BTC potentially won't perform as well.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:54:34
Was thinking that this morning before I bought in, it's been a good day though!
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:10:21
I don't actually understand the process but I'll ask a question anyway. As a miner can you choose to mine blocks with low tx fees? Is there a wealth of unconfirmed transactions sitting there that could easily be processed by a miner who goes for low fee txs? Or would that not be in any miners interest? (Assuming it's actually a thing?)
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:14:09
I'm not an Aussie bit this doesn't look too hot
 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:16:34
I bought in at a really good time (relatively). Even at the base of the last dip I was still very much in profit. But I'm a tight bastard who's always been broke so I beat myself up about every quid I miss out on. But at this point I've taken out my original stake, so the only thing I can lose is my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:10:02
Hell no, they wouldn't take money from my own bank account because my ID name and bank acct name were different... (Think Matthew / Matt, that's not my name but you get what I mean).
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:10:48
And I was kicking myself for not buying in Jan
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:59:24
It worked! And so quick too. Thanks again ��

@_date: 2019-07-28 23:13:17
I don't believe I do, I suppose now would be a good time to obtain one ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:10:06
I'm no expert and in certainly not a whale. However I bought in June at an all time high... Gained a couple of hundred dollars then shit dipped HARD and I was actually at a loss for a while. Then it turned around and I now have 5 times what I put in. Point is, no one knows. Invest what you can afford to lose and take the plunge!
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:43:37
What does the walking penis signify?
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:35:33
Yeah, this is the issue for me and I'm sure for thousands of other holders.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:42
God damn what a crazy couple of days. Lost myself 0.14 BTC trying to be a smart cunt and move around my holdings to capitalise on the dips. Won't be doing that shit again, strictly HODLing from here on out!
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:08:11
Bitcoin Gold was another fork but it's not that well supported. Coinbase doesn't yet trade it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:31:50
Nah, not for the amount I'm talking. Like £8k
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:18:06
I was telling myself that when BTC gets back to $19,000 approx I was gonna buy myself a car, a little present after 6 months of HODLing. Now the time is fast approaching I don't think I can bare to sell any bitcoin. What's the point in having money if I'm scared to spend it???
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:33:07
Lol that's the issue!! (Not 1m but if it shoots up significantly).
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:02:41
Thanks for the info!

@_date: 2017-12-30 17:21:22
Just sold half my holdings, heart literally couldn't take it anymore. I'm cool now though, got back double what I put in and the rest is staying in BTC no matter what!!!
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:54:33
I just had a thought I'd like to share. You know how Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese name. You know who else is Japanese?? 
"The Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed of hunting dog. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan. A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting."
Copes very well with 'mountainous terrain'! Anyone care to tell me what the 1 year BTC chart looks like?
You're welcome!
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:40:40
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:36:56
I certainly wouldn't!
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:01:27
There was a point when it was 500% up from what I bought at. I really should have taken some profits... and reinvested them!
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:20:22

Wow,  just liquidated about a grand's worth of BTC an hour ago because I'm buying a car on Friday. Sold at 10,260 approx. Caught the train home from workb and just checked the price and WHOA! Wtf?? Now I'm feeling super tempted to fuck the car off and rebuy the dip. Fuck!!
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:13:26
