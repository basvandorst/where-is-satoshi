Interesting, she wasn't recording her conversation with him? Or is this available somewhere?

I bought it already with Bitcoin earlier, why did they stop accepting it? The only reason I bought it was bitcoin! ;)
Anyways, keep being awesome MalwareBytes.
EDIT: Quick to the gun, saw the answer already. Website reformatting.

I am honestly worn out hearing about Bitcoin being banned in China. Lets not post China related news anyone, good or bad. PLEASE.

I joined to post a link about an episode of Justified that mentioned Bitcoin. Went unnoticed then I bought reddit gold.

I guess Almost Human is more popular among Bitcoin users than Justified is. Since no one at all upvoted the mention of Bitcoin in Justified. :(

I ban China's PBOC.

I've decided against Amazon.ca for a while now. Emailed them saying I'll come back once you get Amazon.ca accepting Bitcoin. Got a response from an actual person within the hour saying they are escalating it. Pretty good customer service at least.
EDIT: Emailed them in response to another post today.

Justified Season 5 Episode 7 Mention of "The money is in Bitcoins" @ 17:50 minute mark.

OK, will make sure to link a video for future posts that like that. :)

I am holding my amount I find appropriate. I have sold a bunch over the years, and spent just as many. I bought 200 in October 2011 via Carvirtex (only way I knew how back then).

Snapcard is amazing for a Canadian wanting to buy things with Bitcoin. I have used them twice now and each time has been smooth, plus their support is extremely nice. If you're Canadian like me and have tried to get gyft, tiger direct, overstock to work and it won't, try snapcard. I don't work for them either, just a happy customer. (Dislcaimer; didn't read article at all)

I can't stand that name, is it supposed to make me thing it's dodgey? That's exactly what comes to mind everytime my eyes see it.
