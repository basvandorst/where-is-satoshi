You know what's funny about child porn? Something like 80% of it is MADE BY THE KIDS THEMSELVES. As in, two 14 year olds with an iPhone camera.
If some guy finds this shit on the internet and downloads it, where is the harm?
The FBI needs to focus more energy on catching the shitbags that manufacture the child porn where it *actually causes harm*. Spend resources going after MANUFACTURERS, not the losers downloading.

It only costs what it does because of government meddling...like the housing bubble.
If anyone with a pulse couldn't get a student loan, backed by Uncle Sam, these universities wouldn't be able to charge these exorbitant tuitions. If the free market made student loans, there's no way in fuck they'd loan $150k to a Art History major. Thus the universities would need to lower their tuition to keep the diploma factory going.
But my real thoughts on the matter? We all have a Hopkins/MIT/Oxford education in our fucking pockets....but we squander it on Facebook and Twitter.

The Finnish government would be a very different government adversary, than say, the makeshift pseudo-government of Somalia.
Get everything into BTC, trade entirely peer to peer...and go dark in regards to being a Bitcoiner.
Anything short of this, you're exposed.
But reading the Bitcoin subreddit is too entertaining to ever go dark. The government knows we all read this shit. We are ALL on a list, no matter how clean you think you are.
In the eyes of the government, Bitcoin ≈ criminal money....and that shit ain't changing anytime soon.
It's amazing to me that there are people that are openly trading Bitcoin are also simultaneously selling drugs clandestinely. (And there's a lot of people doing this)
You might as well wear a fucking sign.

How the fuck would you even know this, jackass? You've never even been to the US.
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:33:38
You are incorrect.
If I am not required to obtain licensure on the state level and am not operating a Money Services Business (MSB) per the federal definition, recordkeeping (i.e. a CTR for over $10k in cash) is not required. If your Bitcoin trading activity falls within the realm of operating a Money Services Business, at a minimum you would need to register as a MSB with FinCEN, and depending on the state, possibly obtain a license for money transmission.
If you bought coins a while back and you want to sell them to someone in a peer-to-peer fashion, there is absolutely nothing illegal about that....and no paperwork is required because you are NOT engaging in money transmission as a business.
However, if the person you're selling coins to makes even a HINT that they are purchasing your coins to do something illegal.....don’t do the trade and walk away. Even though some courts have held that Bitcoin doesn't constitute legal tender (i.e. Florida), you could still be potentially charged with money laundering.

Why they did it? I already know.
It's a compliance issue. Banks are afraid of being associated with things that look like money laundering. Whether we like it or not, Bitcoin has an aura around it....and it's not a good aura.
They would rather terminate the account of a customer with a "risky" profile than continue to serve them if they fear future BSA compliance issues.
To banks, we are all just numbers. When we become unpalatable for whatever reason, they write us off.
This is just a fact of banking.

They wouldn't be able to follow up...legally.
You see, when a bank closes an account for compliance reasons, it simultaneously (in most cases) files a SAR with FinCEN. Since SARs are confidential in nature, the bank will not discuss the matter with the client out of fear of violating the confidentiality of the filing.
Banks file SARs at a rate that would make your head spin. Last I read, they filed between 1.5 and 2 million annually, and growing each year.
"File early and often" is the expression in banking. 
Furthermore, what incentive do they have to have an employee on payroll spend time on someone that is no longer a customer with the bank? An employee's time costs them money..

I mean, anybody that has purchased Bitcoin in decent sized quantities knows about the closure of bank accounts.
It's only the small time Coinbase "I bought .25 BTC with Coinbase and they never closed my account" people that doubt my story.
Do this:
Go deposit $50,000 to a bank account. Then wire the money to a major Bitcoin exchange. Come back in 30 days and tell us if you still have a bank account.
I opened this new bank account SPECIFICALLY to wire it to an exchange to buy coins when the price was sitting at $560-$580 for a while. 
Why didn't I just use my existing bank accounts?
Because I was already aware of banks closing the accounts of people for Bitcoin activity. (No, not buying $10 off Coinbase)
What I was **NOT** aware of is how this makes a person a physical threat to the bank's security.

What’s the rush anyway? You do realize the masses will never use on-chain Bitcoin for daily purchases even if you made blocks 500GB, right?
Daily purchases will come with apps that run on payment channels with zero mention of Bitcoin to the user -OR- by centralized third parties like Circle. Why? Because people want stable money denominated in their local currency. You can't have a floating currency with 5% daily volatility and accomplish this without a third party. 
Average people care fuck-all about what we care about; decentralization, immutability, etc. They want money that they understand and that spends.

If you believe the vast majority of ads on Backpage are of vulnerable women and children, you are a goddamn idiot.
Here's the thing about most prostitution; it's a low barrier to entry. Most of these WOMEN have limited options. They can either fuck for a night and make $400-$500 from a few Johns every couple of days....or they can get the 3-11pm shift at fucking Burger King for $400/week.
Considering how companies like Burger King treat their employees, you can see why they stick to fucking Johns.
Truth is maybe 1/3000 of these ads involves an underage girl...if that. But of course they'll misrepresent this fact...how else are they going to justify their Puritanical crusade?
Protecting women? Ha...this isn't about protecting women. Sure, there are several cases of women finding themselves the victim of crime because of Backpage...but that isn't Backpage’s fault...**that's the criminalization of prostitutions fault.**

This subreddit actually just pisses me off. I have no idea why I even read this shit.
Nobody verifies anything...it all just gets repeated as truth. I even had to correct Andreas on this very issue previously.
Failure to verify information destroys credibility of the community when someone well versed comes along and expresses interest, only to be turned off by their bullshit detector. There is SO MUCH flawed infornation being spewed all over the place here.
We don't need to intimidate new users here in VN with claims like “bitcoin is illegal” when it's simply not true. Why scare them away?
We need more Vietnamese people doing legit stuff with Bitcoin here...and less Russians doing not-so-legal stuff with Bitcoin.
VND inflation is massive. Perfect use case for those with savings. An otherwise law abiding, curious user would instantly be turned off at using Bitcoin just with the THOUGHT of having to deal with canh sat for merely buying some bitcoin.

Question: Do you always answer questions when you are completely unfamiliar with the topic?
Bitcoin is not illegal in Vietnam. Bitcoin is not “banned” in Vietnam. Bitcoin is not a crime in Vietnam.
The Central Bank of Vietnam, like most central banks and other authorities around the world, have issued a blanket warning on the risks of cryptocurrency. They have publicly stated that Bitcoin is not considered legal tender. They have made no comments whatsoever on the legality of Bitcoin nor stated anything prohibiting its use.
In fact, there were some Bitcoiners that were arrested a couple years back that had their case dismissed by the court for lack of laws surrounding cryptocurrency. This case was similar to the case now on appeal in Florida where the government was on a “fishing expedition” for judicial clarification on Bitcoin.
There has not been another Bitcoin related arrest since that time. Why? Because the police got their clarification...Bitcoin is presently NOT illegal according to the courts here.

Is that how they are going to tell the story? Hoarding for cyber ransoms?
You know what I hear? I hear someone hedging their bets and using “cyber ransoms” as an excuse.
After all, buying BTC through a US based “safe” exchange like Gemini for example will involve KYC, especially for buying larger quantities. Since places like Gemini require the disclosure of shareholder/membership interest of institutions looking to buy BTC, how would these banks buy using shell companies without the information getting leaked that they are buying BTC? Even a shell inside a shell inside a shell would become apparent through due diligence.
So what do the banks do? They make the perfect excuse. 
“We are buying coins in case we get hacked and need to pay a ransom!”
Cue tin foil hat.
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:05:57
Absolutely the fuck not.
Here's the thing...US law applies here. Why? Because “Fuck you, we're the US” that's why. Plus, US customers affected.
Under US federal law, criminal defendants can expect a downward departure at sentencing for making restitution prior to indictment. However, the US DOJ would still very much prosecute the person. There would be absolutely no safe harbor for the hacker by paying any of the money back in exchange for “being able to keep some and safely spend it”.
But all this is moot anyway. Why? Because Bitfinex WERE the hackers. This is all just a show.
