Emailed bitfloor support again today. I have not received a single response from any emails I have sent. This company is a fucking joke and I can't believe I ever did business with them in the first place. It seems like no one is even posting any experiences here anymore. I have no idea if others are getting their refunds or not I have not seen any posting activity on here in like 20 days about any new refunds processed.

I didn't need to open a IAFCU account due to the amount being under $3K, Submitted my information to Bitfloor on 7/8 and ever since then the message when logging onto Bitfloor says "Your refund information is under review. Once reviewed, your refund will be sent to you electronically." No other email or phone contact has been made. I guess its just a waiting game as I have not seen a single person on here post they have received any funds yet. Thanks to the IAFCU for taking this venture on even though I have only seen 1 post of someone that has received their funds.

I am still waiting as well. I tweeted a nasty comment a week or two ago on bitfloor's twitter and my twitter account got suspended because of it. I still have not received my refund either

I am still waiting as well and have not got any new information. They will not answer my emails that I have sent to support and they tries to ban my Twitter account. I am not sure what to do anymore

Update: I am starting to lose hope in this refund as my account has been in the status below for well over 2 weeks now. "Your refund information is under review. Once reviewed, your refund will be sent to you electronically." No updates on Bitfloor or anything. I was feeling pretty good about the whole deal but I am quickly losing hope. I am just downright frustrated with the whole situation and for someone that is unemployed at the moment I could really use this money that is being held hostage for living expenses.

Update: Still waiting on my refund I have emailed Bitfloor support and have not received an email back. Status shows the same when I log into Bitfloor as well.

Still no response from Bitfloor support and status still shows and being processed on the website. This is getting even more frustrating knowing they are supposed to be getting the refunds done but the communication is horrible "non existent" I am so sick of dealing with this stupid crap. I wish they would just take care of it and let us have "our" money back. I am not seeing anyone else posting anything about getting their refunds for the last like 11 days so I have no idea what is going on.

Sent bitfloor an email asking about the refund today. Will post and update when I get a response. I do not see many people that have not got their refunds that are posting in here I assume audenx might be getting emails from people but who knows.

As far as I see only like 3 people have gotten their refunds still to this date unless people are not updating on here. Is that about right Audenx?

Emailed bitfloor support again since I have not received a response. This is just ridiculous and unjust.
