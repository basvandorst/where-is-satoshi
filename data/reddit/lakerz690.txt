Well said. ��

You seem pretty ignorant considering you never gave an actual response to my question. Typical of this space granted the amount of people that are FOMO'ing into cryptos.

Thank you for the insightful response. People on here need to chill the fuck out. Seems like if you ask a question on here you're attacked by a bunch of maximalists, half whom don't understand how the basics of blockchain even work.

Isn't LN going to make the network more vulnerable and aren't there too many unresolved issues with LN?

He should toss the other atm away, FIAT will become obsolete eventually.

Sheep usually look at the ground, that's why.

There is doubt in the scalability of BTC considering it cannot scale without LN. This is obvious, it is even stated in numerous research papers and has been the topic of discussion for a long, long time. I have no affiliation with BCH, nor was I trying to "bash" LN. People don't want to face the facts when asked a question, especially when it is seen as a "threatening" question. Considering that I only received two informative responses followed by a bunch of useless comments doesn't help. But that is Reddit for you right.

I'm asking.
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:13:48
So basically don't trade Bitcoin...

So when's the sequel?

He's still waiting on his transaction to confirm...
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:51:15
When did I ever say any BTC developers left to ETH. You are reading what you want to hear...
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:25:05
Bc almost 70% of the entire market cap is in BTC. Is this a serious question, I can ask the same thing for every crypto market...
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:45:59
Time to buy some MAKER, only 1,000,000 in supply...

Nothing surprising at all, but bullish af. Glad to see ETH has hundreds of partnerships with all these corporations, banks, etc. with hundreds more to come. Creating networks and partnerships with others is what brings ingenuity.

Considering all the developers that have flocked to the ETH blockchain years ago and the exponential rate it continues to grow at, along with everything I mentioned before, I have no worries atm. Go compare development between the two, ETH development never stops... I can say the opposite for BTC.
