I just set my scheduled auto-buy in Coinbase and then I don't have to ever look at the price. dollar-cost-average FTW.

I think this why litecoin went with ~2min blocks rather than bitcoin's 10min?

Why not just swap BTC profits into a less volatile alt-coin and only convert to USD when you want to cash out?

Bitcoin noob here: If mining rates increase, what does this do to the price of BT?

My understanding of daytrading BTC here is that people are swapping between USD and BTC.  
There are tax obligations once you switch back into USD. I was suggesting that since the other alt coins aren't as popular as bitcoin, which means lower volume, so not as much price movement. If you traded your BTC profits into another alt-coin you're going to hold onto your profits (because the price doesn't fluctuate as wildly in the short-term) without the tax obligations (like with USD). You'd still be able to buy back into BTC just as easily when you were ready to trade again. 
My day trading experience is taking 5k and turning it into $500 during the dot com boom, so you don't have to take my word on it.

I discount all our [wine accessories]( on bitmit compared to our ebay prices

Thanks for explaining

I did put up [one item]( to test the waters. Will probably load everything eventually since listing doesn't cost anything. 
Edit: Also now on [coinpost]( The image cropping is different so posting on coinpost.com will require special attention to the images compared to ebay/Amazon/bitmit so that's gonna slow me down. 
Double edit: Holy crap! my cake day!

As an ebay seller who wants to get in on the bitcoin market its disappointing to see no one with bitcoins has an interest in the wine related items (since that what I sell)

You should coordinate with the mod from so that there's only one meme-filled bitcoin subreddit

Hey guys, I'm from [Distinguished Imports]( and currently we have a few things up on [bitmit]( We want to be your bitcoin wine accessory store. 
We're just getting started, but if there is some bar/drink/kitchen related item that you want to buy with btc we'll try to stock it for you.
