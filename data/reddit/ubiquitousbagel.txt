You’re comparing a product vs a product, to a product vs multiple institutions offering different products. Suggesting that bitcoin will wipe out all banks is like saying Wikipedia wiped out all tech companies. 
A more accurate comparison would be to say watch out traditional currencies, Bitcoin is coming.

We can’t be absolutely sure the correction is over until a trend reversal is confirmed. Hasn’t happened yet.

I think yo misunderstood what I said. For all intents and purposes it is no better than central bank currency, bitcoin is not backed by anything. Neither is central bank currency. The definition of fiat is not backed by a commodity when it comes to currency. Maybe you should look up the definition.

So sad. Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:13:33
I hate to break it to you, but for all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is no less fiat than central bank currencies. The fact bitcoin has a hard mathematical limit to its quantity does not make it backed by a commodity. The only thing that gives it value, just like central bank currencies, is that people agree to use it as a medium of exchange and agree on its value. Neither has intrinsic value. 
As for the future of either bitcoin or central bank currencies, no one knows for certain where either is going. Don’t pin all your hopes and dreams on what you think is a sure thing. Not saying not to invest (speculate) in it, but be careful. Confirmation bias is a real thing.

@_date: 2018-06-30 22:09:10
Unfortunately there is no forward-looking method to confirm a reversal has happened, it is often only seen in hindsight. Having said that, a good indicator is when price moves higher than the downtrend resistance line, pulls back and comes close to touching or touches that line but doesn’t break below it, then continues upward.

Literal interpretation has little use in the real world where context adds meaning to a lot of things. 
What you have proven is that you are able to read a dictionary entry. That is great but you need to dig deeper to understand real issues. 
The argument being made is that bitcoin is better than fiat because currency manipulation, and fiat is play money, etc. 
The comparison I was making is that much like fiat, bitcoin is not based on anything but arbitrary values. It has no intrinsic value at all. It has no value tied to any commodity. The fact that fiat currency, according to the dictionary, requires an official decree for it to be considered fiat is immaterial. The argument is that bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

Fair enough but that is still companies making one product. Banks have multiple products. Yes, all denominated in currency, but I think they’ll adapt. Some of our banks in Canada are already hiring for crypto-related positions to try and stay ahead of the curve. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:43:00
I think what u/t_hab was trying to say (and please correct me if I’ve got this wrong) is that the introduction of a bitcoin ETF can cause companies with access to large amounts of capital to force the price down, to their benefit, causing a cascading event that keeps the price low enough so that it wipes out many miners who can’t float losses forever. And I don’t think it will require 100% of the miners to be wiped out in order to severely shake the price of bitcoin. 
You say that miners can carry losses if they feel that the price will recover but for how long exactly is that? Until they run out of capital? Until they’re forced to liquidate their assets to cover expenses? Until they’ve given up on the dream? (Everyone has their breaking point)
Remember, the only thing that gives bitcoin value is the fact that many people agree it has value. When those people start believing that there is no more utility in bitcoin (whether it’s because it’s too unstable, volatile, or some other superior technology replaces it), the value of it will approach 0.

The “law of trading” is that there will always be a reversion to the mean. Nowhere will this tell you where the bottom will be. Hence, if you wait until where you think the bottom is to buy in again, you will be mistaken as to where that bottom is more often than not.

Addressed in my original post. Works on small scale, but consider what happens on a large scale when entire nations adopt bitcoin and ditch fiat. Eventually millions of bitcoins will be needed in addition to that which already exists.

Using your example of interest only representing 1% of total supply, and 1% of loans having to default, effectively this means that a bank would say: “I am still willing to lend money, but if I must do so at 1%, and knowing 1% of loans will default, in the long term I will make 0 money.” What is the incentive for the bank to keep lending money when they are making zero profit from it? Why not just keep the bitcoin for itself knowing it will continue to increase in value. 
“Until no one wants to borrow it...”
Sorry but this just isn’t a reality. There will always be a need to borrow. If you have interest rates so high that no one wants to borrow, the economy grinds to a halt. Unless you are proposing a better or different way to maintain economic growth...?

Let me put this another way. Say I came to you and said “Hey, RickJamesB1tch, can I borrow a bitcoin from you and I totally promise to pay it back in a month, and you should totally do this because that bitcoin will be worth even more in a month.” And then I borrow it. I gain the value of the increased purchasing power. And then I don’t pay you back. You are now down 1 bitcoin and lots of purchasing power. There was a risk of default there, which will always exist. So you may not lend it to me because you don’t want to, but banks will because that is their business. They know there will always be a level of default risk, so they need to charge interest to mitigate that risk. Why would a bank lend out money at zero interest? It wouldn’t. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:27:08
What I’m saying is people who support bitcoin and it taking over fiat currency is because bitcoin is not a debt-based currency. The solutions you provide would make bitcoin into a debt-based currency which completely goes against what I have read about why people want bitcoin to replace fiat. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:16:20
You’re talking about a central bank’s overnight lending rate. I’m talking about the consumer rate. The consumer rate takes into account the overnight rate, and individually adds on an additional amount based on the borrower’s risk of default. 
Even if what you are saying that the interest rates would be predictable, this doesn’t negate the fact that over time, much more BTC will be owed than can ever be mined. So how do you pay that back when it doesn’t exist and you can’t just mine it into existence?
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:16:41
I would strongly suggest you read up more on this before making statements that are false. You are relating a small-scale example to a large-scale issue and moving the goal posts so that it fits your argument. 
What I said is factually accurate. That is not the question as you will see if you read the other comments. The question is, how is it sustainable. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:29:21
Oh, technical analysis isn’t a method to only show that price will increase. It’s just a way to predict future short term movement of price based on patterns and past events. Also, I don’t think all HODLers want all price to drop.

You can’t borrow BTC with interest? Really. Guess what, I just lent my friend 0.0005 BTC and he will be paying me back 0.0006 BTC next month. Boom I just lent someone BTC at interest. Take off your blinders.

Right now the majority of consumer loans are from banks, and the majority of government borrowing is from other governments and their own citizens. But yes, everyone and every nation does borrow. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:23:41
I haven’t forgotten that. But that is tangential and unrelated to the problem I have presented. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:08:10
I was thinking that. But both of those are also of limited supply and their value fluctuates at different rates than the underlying loan’s asset. So let’s say I loan you 10 bitcoin and I want the equivalent value 11 bitcoin paid back. As you’re paying me back, litecoin or any other crypto you pay back with plummets in value relative to bitcoin. So you need to come up with way more litecoin to pay me back but because you aren’t earning that much more litecoin, you default on the loan. Knowing this is a possibility, why would a lender allow someone to pay back in a different crypto or asset?
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:30:22
You make good points. But what is to stop people with massive amounts of crypto, or anyone for that matter, from deciding to lend it at interest and thus creating the dilemma that I describe? We can’t expect that no one will abide by the 0% interest idea. Then what happens?
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:24:30
You illustrate a good example of the velocity of money, which exactly speaks to the example you provide. How fast money circulates is an indicator of an economy’s health. But at some point, the velocity of money won’t be fast enough to repay all debt owed in the time it is owed. If the velocity of money slows down at all, it would be a massive economic issue with a limited supply of currency. With no entity able to intervene to inject more cash into the system, defaults go way up which further slows the velocity of money as it’s not lent and spent nearly as much because people will hoard and banks won’t tolerate the risk. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:14:52


How will you know where the bottom is?
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:41:39
I did address your example in my original post, indicating that future earnings could be used to pay off the interest. But that doesn’t negate the fact that there is still an obligation to pay more bitcoin that currently exists. So then we get back into BTC being a debt instrument. Let’s say, over time, BTC is lent enough that now there are 21 million BTC, and an additional 55 million BTC in debt obligations to be paid back. This will happen over time so long as BTC continues to be lent. Every time you lend money, you are creating an obligation to pay back that money plus more. This never goes away it just keeps growing and growing. So the borrower has to make more money which means they need to charge more which means their customers may have to get loans or pay on credit which causes more debt and interest owed etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:21:45
This doesn’t assume that the 21 million would never move though. At some point, with loans continually being made, there physically won’t be enough bitcoin to repay debt obligations if you had to pay it back using BTC. Plus it also creates the further problem of bank creating into existence BTC that has not been mined (similar to how banks create fiat currency by a number on a ledger through fractional reserve banking).
Denominating the interest payments in eth: let’s say I ask you for a loan of 1 BTC. And you say: “ubiquitousbagel, based on the risk of non-repayment and your credit history, in order for this loan to make sense for me, I need 1 BTC paid back plus 10 ETH.” I’m like sure, deal. Then ETH drops like a rock and what you thought you were getting was a 20% return, now ends up being a 2% return. So now you’ve lost a bunch of money that you planned to get because it was going to be spent on salaries or repaying your own debts. Multiple different scenarios that can come of that. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:56:53
That’s why the question was posed to people who believe crypto will take over all forms of fiat. Aren’t the entire hopes and dreams of crypto supporters based on the fact that the currency will not be used as a debt instrument or be used to create more of itself? Writing an IOU to your neighbour aside, everything else you mentioned is a debt instrument that, if denominated in BTC, will create an obligation to pay back more BTC than ever will exist.
What is nonsense is vomiting ideas on to a post without fully thinking them through.

Note: technical analysis is not a 100&amp; proven science, I am not an expert, and past results is not always a reliable indicator of future performance. Find out more about technical analysis and how it's used by people to predict price entry and exit points [at investopedia.](
I forgot to mention on the chart that the reason I expect a pullback to close to the resistance line or long-term support line in this case is due to decreasing volume and momentum. It is very possible that given a major event, or even with sometimes no trigger at all, the price could shoot straight up without touching either of those lines, as happened in the most recent trend reversal. Shooting straight up is also a trend reversal confirmation (obviously).
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:48:27
Interesting thought! So just to see if I have this right, your idea is instead of taking out loans, you would deposit a certain amount of bitcoin now with that institution, they would hold on to it for 10 years, and then you’d get a certain amount less back? The institution gets to keep a certain amount of it as a payment essentially. 
But two questions: one, why wouldn’t you just give them the difference between what they would normally keep? Like why give them 0.5 bitcoins and they give you back 0.4 in 10 years? instead why not just give them 0.1 now, since they can’t really use the remaining 0.4 if they can’t loan it out?
Second, what happens if you don’t have enough money to do that?

Awesome point! I know banks in my area are already starting to hire people for cryptocurrency related positions.

@_date: 2018-07-24 00:04:24
Yes this is exactly what I was getting at. I’m also stumped as to a solution to it tho. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:59:39
Then what is the incentive to take the risk to lend the money out with a risk of not being paid back when you can instead just hold the BTC yourself and be guaranteed to have your purchasing power increased?
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:18:01
Dude, he’s right though and you aren’t. Honestly, without trying to be rude here, you’re telling someone to learn something because you think he’s got it wrong when it’s really you that does. That’s insanity. Read up more on interest and loans. There’s a reason most people here are actually responding to the question that I posted as though it represents a real dilemma and not flat out denying that that problems exists or will exist. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:43:34
But then doesn’t that effectively create a debt-based monetary system which we are trying to get away from by using crypto? It creates more currency in circulation which devalues the base currency.

An interesting idea if it were to happen!
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:13:42
Interesting comment, but there’s one tiny little detail that you missed that turns your argument on its head. 
Interest is a hedge against inflation AND repayment risk. If not for that second part, your argument would stand. However, a loan’s interest rate is made up of two factors: the risk-free rate (normally called prime or overnight lending rate), plus the rate at which it makes sense to charge someone based on the risk they may not repay the loan. So it wouldn’t make sense to charge little to no interest on a loan because there will always be a default risk and then that bank loses money. So why would it lend to begin with?
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:51:59
The scaling of the currency doesn’t matter, no matter what the value becomes. The fact it can be fractioned also doesn’t matter. The fact is, with continual lending, even lending 1 satoshi will create the obligation to pay back more than 1 satoshi. This will, over time, if continually done, very quickly result in the obligation to pay back more bitcoin than ever existed and could ever exist. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:15:07
Lol. So, I am familiar with accounting, and your accounting equation is wrong. Assets do not equal liabilities. The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
So, effectively what I am illustrating is, from the perspective of a lender when making a loan, what was once a balance sheet of 100,000 BTC = 0 BTC + 100,000 BTC, effectively becomes 130,000 BTC = 0 BTC + 130,000 BTC when the future value of the repaid loan is calculated. You have just created 30,000 BTC that has not been mined. Perhaps you should watch a video on the concept of accounting. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:41:00
How do you figure you would pay less bitcoin if enough time had passed? A loan of 10 bitcoins at 10% interest per year will always be an interest payment of 1 bitcoin per year if interest is only paid. If you’re suggesting you would pay less bitcoin because the loan would be denominated in USD, there won’t be USD if crypto enthusiasts think it will go the way they want it to. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:56:26
Interesting idea. If the value of bitcoin increases over time, however, does it increase relative to other currencies or does it increase relative to its purchasing power? If the former, when fiat disappears, this won’t mean anything. If the latter, that would cause inflation and the cost of goods and services to increase relative to the increasing value of bitcoin.
