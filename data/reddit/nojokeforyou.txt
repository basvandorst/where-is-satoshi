The potential is definitely there.
The main question is your risk profile. Are you young? Do you need this money? Are you okay having it drop a lot for a long time, possibly forever?
If you are still down to do it, when is impossible to answer, so you should dollar cost average.

nice little primer.
Under shapeshift of under wallets i would include keepkey integration with shapeshift.
I find it quite amazing that I can basically use my hard wallet as an exchange in some ways. I have read some bad reviews about losing money and/or bad support, but my experience trading within keepkey have been flawless. (maybe trading within keepkey is better than the website?)
They say the spread they take is the average between many exchange sites, often being on the lower end and they only charge a fixed mining fee which is close to what would end up being charged anyway (the fixed fee helps with faster transactions).
The con is they are quite slow to add coins. They finally added BCH weeks after the ledger. And they will likely be very slow on segwit transactions.
To their credit they are going through the shapeshift acquisition right now so they had a lot on their plate. The good news is they said that they will eventually support all coins that are supported by shapeshift.
(another con: i know trezor/ledger have compatibility with MEW (for erc-20 token support), mycelium, etc... keepkey only works with electrum wallet (for segwit transaction).
