This may imply that twitch/amazon may add their own crypto currency

Never say how much bitcoin you have.

We dont know if they record any input or not. It is better creating it locally on no internet device. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:03:06
How do you know they have it or not?

in theory, BAT is not special. the only difference of BAT is the software it integrated to, in this case it is brave browser. No innovation in term of blockchain, so it is just like many other shitcoins that fork from bitcoin with very little code changes.
I love to see bitcoin do the same thing and BAT will die for sure.

Developer, developer, developer... this makes Btc (similarly for Eth) outplay all other coins on the market in long term.

I think when backup and watchtower are implemented even more people will host lightining node

The way bluewallet did is bad for crypto. We give them money to use lightning feature. And I hope that it will not go popular. Basically we not own money on lightning. So why not just use bank instead?

Bitmex liquidates their users. That is normal :)

In my place, people call it virtual money which is unreal and very scammy. People need to be educated before they can see bitcoin potential.

I still remember windows 95 has no network password protection by default. I could easily scan ip and remote connected to any machine that was opening modem.
Compared bitcoin to the old internet, bitcoin is still way better.

Blockchain has higher chance to be adopted than bitcoin. Bitcoin technology itself is too slow evolving and not easy to use for average people. Who knows maybe bitcoin will fail and another alt coin will be mainstream.

I lost 40% on bitcoin alone. Most successful coin :cry

All these features are very positive. Wonder how long it may take to implement.
