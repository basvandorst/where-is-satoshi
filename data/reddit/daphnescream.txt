How old are you? Seriously, can you read? A wannabe murderer? 
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:37:15
That is IF he hired a hitman to kill. NY doesn't think so. Why do you persist? I guess facts go over your head and you cling to drama. Maryland will drop too. See, in this country (for now anyway) prosecution actually has to prove allegations.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:14:28
Yeh, I'm stunned by the level of your reasoning/comments, but not concerned. eeeew, go bash my head on a wall....ow!

No, the Ulbricht side is saying that all charges are alleged and Ross has said "not guilty" to all. Could be that he is being framed? Why do you just accept the feds when they already admitted to a sting?
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:16:21
You seem very sure he is guilty, even before any evidence has been submitted or a trial has been held. That's the problem with your posts. A fair trial? The family is trying, but these days it costs big bucks. And don't point to a public prosecutor. It's good they exist, but is that what you'd be happy with? So if it turns out the feds have the wrong guy, you think the donations have been wasted? Is it OK that his rights have been, and continue to be, denied cause you say he's guilty? Prosecution has defied the judge in multiple instances, and for months. "Oh, we will get it done." But those are just pesky rules, right? Might be a good idea to get up to speed with what is happening before weighing in. No one idolizes Ross. Who and what is next?

That all sounds nice. I really like the part about defending yourself by going to the police and they deal with it. I used to believe that. I wish you were right. Do some research. Prosecutorial overreach is known and has been happening for years. Yes, they even make stuff up and withhold evidence. Very wrong, but very true.
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:02:27
Wake up! He didn't order murders.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:23:26
Everyone is so quick to trust these prosecutors. They've already changed the story once. What else are they fabricating? The defense needs help and all of us should stand up and donate. I have. They are fighting for your rights too.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:51:40
The problem is you don't have all the evidence and don't know the whole story. Perhaps his mother knows more than you do.
They should have never messed with the Dread Mother Roberts! Arrrrhh

Just cause Maryland hasn't been dropped doesn't mean it won't. The law moves slowly -- but opinions around here don't. The family won't/can't talk about the case but they can talk about his character -- so they do. The press smeared him right out of the gate. So what if the family tries to counter that with some reality. Facts and evidence matter. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:15:51
So sad that you add to the regurgitation of lame news. You don't know that he tried to have someone murdered or that he is a sociopath. oh yeh, Rollingstone says so... NY would be prosecuting to the fullest on the murder charges if they could -- why wouldn't they? It would help their case. They throw this on cause most drug kingpins will murder. Oh nice -- such a great system. That's where your anger should go. Don't think for a second that your freedom isn't in the cross-hairs. This is only a first step. Maryland will fall too. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:59:18
So you know for certain that Ross is DPR. Guess you are the only other person besides Ross. Please share your vast knowledge/evidence.
@_date: 2014-04-21 01:45:27
Actually, you have no evidence -- just what you've read in the media that only seems to lean on those writing before (aka regurgitation). Maryland has a corrupt system and will indict anything. If NY is not including the murder in the indictment, that means something. Think about it -- if they had any proof they'd keep the charges - why wouldn't they?...so what else have they made up? Yes, you bet the feds are after a plea. Then they don't have to prove anything and come away looking good? Using scare tactics?  Their masters want a conviction as they are after bitcoin. The comments here are craaazy! Time to really think...this is not TV.
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:47:57
The feds wouldn't make stuff up?? What fairyland do you come from? It is well known, so do some research on prosecutorial over-reach. Why would they? Cause it didn't happen and they wanted take down the site and specifically bitcoin. Can't let anything go untaxed, right? They often work backwards -- and practice on such characters as Mother Teresa, etc. If you can get someone to plea then you don't need to go to court and actually prove anything. This is how careers are made. Wake up! Oh, and if you think the Internet won't change if they get a conviction, you are living in a dream world.

Elmer you are soooo funny, and you are soooo angry. I wonder what you look like? a would-be ____?
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:27:01
NY isn't charging murder...why not? Gee, I'd think it is a pretty bad crime that you could use to put someone away for a long time. All the rest is small fry in comparison. ew...evidence? might need some of that. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:41:49
...too much TV time.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:55:17
It will affect us all because of the new laws to control the Internet and online commerce that will come as a result. This is a landmark case. Read how vague the laws are now.  Hey, just need to tighten 'em up (see the motions that have been released). Follow the dancing ball folks...The feds (as well as Schumer) are salivating over controlling this. Bitcoin and its untaxed status irritates them and they find it unacceptable. I find it weird how many people are willing to just accept more erosion on what freedom we have left. A free Internet was nice while it lasted, I guess. This case does matter. I've donated. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:30:37
Try to stay coherent. Might also help to read the indictment and the current motions. Lots of ranting going on around here.
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:03:46
If you have evidence that the family or defense is missing, please send it to them. You seem very sure. oh btw: this case will determine law going forward and yes, it will affect you.
