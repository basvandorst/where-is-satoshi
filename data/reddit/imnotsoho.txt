Maybe its because of the hodlers? If you want merchants to accept bitcoin as a currency, more people have to spend it. Why don't more shops accept shares of my Vanguard fund as payment?

IIRC If you don't tell them how much you earned, they will tell you! Meaning they will make up a number that is far above what you really made to get you to come clean.

The dollar dropping encourages people to invest in productive assets, that is a good thing. There are only 3 states to prices, flat, inflation or deflation. Inflation has been the norm for decades, that is a good thing, because deflation is a disaster. No one will buy today if the price is lower tomorrow. Prices will never be "fixed" because then we will be just one tick away from deflation.

Do you consider bitcoin stable?

Thanks for not answering my questions. If you don't know the answers, don't diminish my questions. I will make it simple: If I buy $100 worth of bitcoin, how much will I pay in fees? If I buy 1 bitcoin, what will I pay in fees? Best case scenario on each question.

So you don't like fractional reserve banking? You don't like economic growth?

I bought $100 at an ATM on Sept 8. Today it is worth $79.
On Oct 26 at 1:45 PDT I bought $100 at the same ATM and created a new wallet. It took 11 hours to be processed and today I only have $26 worth of bitcoin. WTF?
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:52:43
Could you be a little more specific? I know the ATM adds a fee, but it is not $70. I am thinking the major problem with most recent buy was the big jump on Saturday. But if the price jumped 50% from the time I deposited my money until 11 hours later when it was processed shouldn't the price I bought at be set at time of processing, so I would have fewer bitcoins but the same value in dollars. 
How come I can never get an answer of what a bitcoin transaction costs. When I take money out of an ATM with my bank card I have to approve whatever fee they charge, with bitcoin I have to agree to an unknown fee?

If you can find a title company who will escrow the deal and provide title insurance while dealing with bitcoin, I don't see the problem with this deal. We could make the same kind of deal with corn, or wheat or anything. I don't think you will find a title company that will take their cut in bitcoin or validate that purchase. Good luck.
Bitcoin fans: Would you take out a mortgage denominated in Bitcoin. Sale price: 30 BTC, 2 BTC down, 1 per year for 28 years, you in?

I have a house that I will quitclaim to you right now for 5 bitcoins. It is listed for sale for $350,000 dollars. Send my the bitcoin and I will send you a quitclaim deed by FedEx.

From Wikipedia: 
 A **quitclaim deed** is a  legal instrument that is used to transfer interest in real property. The  entity transferring its interest is called the grantor, and when the **quitclaim deed**  is properly completed and executed, it transfers any interest the  grantor has in the property to a recipient, called the grantee. 
As I said, I will give you a quitclaim deed for 123 Main St, Peoria, AZ today. Just send me 5 bitcoins and I will email the deed to you, you can trust me.

I don't think the county does that. Haven't you heard the commercials for "Title Lock Insurance?" The county will record any document you give them with a check for $30. Sometimes they require a notary which can be forged also. The county would never accept that risk, that is for the private market.

For the county, all of it. They do not guarantee that you are who you say you are, all they do is record the documents submitted. If they are fraudulent, go to court, county recorder is not at fault. The county does not verify your ID, your ownership, or any notarized documents, they only record.
 FYI Each morning all of the local title agencies (at least in my county) meet at the recorder's office and compare the deals they are going to record, so that they don't submit more than one sale for the same property.

I am new here and don't follow everything, especially the TLAs, but, what is the problem with losing power to a node without a UPS? I thought that is what blockchain is for, multiple ledgers so the info is distributed. Shouldn't you be able to reboot when power comes on a rebuild the blockchain on your server?

Any particular Android wallet you would recommend. I will only use for small amounts and occasional transactions.
