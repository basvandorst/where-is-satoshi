But doesn't that just tie into the value of the coin rather than the utility of it? Don't get me wrong I can completely understand that you want to have a health value on the coin but I can't shake the feeling that is what most people are focusing on atm. like at (give or take) $10,600 I think value should be the least of peoples concern. ofc that is if it doesn't crash

With bitcoin I feel like it doesn't have enough utility to justify the price, the only thing that is driving it at the moment is public opinion and the only reason people think so highly of it is due to the fact you can make a lot of money from it. I don't want it to get to the stage where faster transfer of coins and more retailers accepting bitcoin, by that time the general public already have a sour taste in their mouth because they lost money investing in "this next big thing"

It is now akin to currency day trading and is more about the fiat return than the future of bitcoin itself. No one actually uses it they "hodl" with hopes to make dollars/euro/pounds etc. nice throwaway

Well to be fair where else would I go? If there is a better place for information it would be greatly appreciated

Don't mind replying to him, he is apart of the community and I did ask for your guys opinion and he is just yet to give me his :)

That is the best way to put it. I know they are memes but all you see is lambo this and lambo that HODL and to the moon, you don't really see anyone else talking about helping it grow outside of the price. Thanks for making it a bit clearer even for me lol

Is that all you do is just answer questions with questions?

I hope your right, I think bitcoin definitely has it's place in the world, I just can't help but feel like it has attracted the wrong crowd so to speak.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:27:02
little overly aggressive for a question don't you think?

You gave me the benefit of the doubt lmao I'm done.

I don't know what you mean by "uninformed" and "non specific"? I'm asking what people think about the new direction that bitcoin seems to have taken?
