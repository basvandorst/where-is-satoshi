Pls, you are probably not even the 100th by now. This is the first thing geeks do with bitcoin.

How many coins?  
Look to me like over 20 coins... OUCH!

Wow very cool, I will be able to print my dream home for $30,000.

When $1 USD = 1 bit.

So, if I buy 20 Divcoin, I could receive 0.4336 BTC/day? This offer from VoS doesn't add-up.

This looks interesting. What is the limit on the number of SJCX? Is 5 million the hard cap?  
Edit: 500 million.

I know that the bitcoin network adjusts its difficulty every two weeks. Theoretically, if cost isn't a concern, is it possible to mine all the rest of the bitcoin before the network change the mining difficulty?

The core service of bitcoin is network security. All else follows from that.
