That means Bitcoin is unlikely to become [fully-fledged money]( it can function as a unit of account and store of value, but less so as a medium of exchange because of its deflationary nature.

It would definitely work as it does today. I'm just saying that switching to Bitcoin might shrink the economy (GDP-wise) and not be able to scale the money supply to keep markets operating efficiently, leading to hyper-deflation. Combine this with the fact that it's a pure fiat currency and it's inherently unstable even as a store of value. One of the roles of a central bank is to grow/shrink the money supply by making/collecting loans to other banks, thus mitigating some of these issues.
To answer your second question you can kind of compare Bitcoin to a fixed-cap asset like gold. Sure, you could buy kilograms of gold and hoard it, but that isn't doing the economy any good compared to if you were to lend out your money to someone who could put it to better use (create GDP).
The problems stem from the absence of regulation, the same core principle which is one of Bitcoin's biggest strengths. I'm not an economist so I won't pretend to know all of the macroeconomic implications of having Bitcoin as a mainstream currency, but the point is there are various positives and negatives.

It's more like no one gives a fuck when they could just use their credit card. Sure they could learn how to do it, but the payoff is not great.

That's his point...

I'm curious why you didn't go with EC2 hosting?
