Definitely Bitso! Incredible service and instant peso withdrawals.

Best looking btm i've seen out there! No wonder, the design of their exchange is pretty ( Apparently it is the first one in central Mexico and the first btm to accept pesos. Way to go Bitso!

Anybody knows the official tipping address?

Average $2300 monthly income for operators?! That is 46K worth of transactions a month at a HIGH 5% fee and 0% operators fee. Seems very unlikely.

It also accepts credit card!

Andrew, Rajiv, what a nightmare! Hope internet justice gets the job done. If it doesn't, I wish you destroy them in court.

With  you can sell Bitcoin, send the funds to your mobile wallet, and withdraw as cash at a 7 Eleven. Takes two minutes. I highly recommend [Bitso](

Fiverr accepts Bitcoin

Anybody knows if they also do payouts in btc?

Why do people still listen to Peter Todd? The only thing he is doing is slowing down Bitcoin core's development.

What they were doing was illegal according to Mexican anti-money laundering laws. I am guessing they either got shut down by the government or by the bank.

There is a big red banner at the bottom saying that they are doing maintenance or that the service is offline. They just published that they will be back in a couple hours. Unprofessional, no heads up or announcements anywhere for hours. Horrible experience. I'm out.

That's not ok for any exchange. People have pending orders. And yes, I think you are referring to BitMEX. These other guys have a crappy AlphaPoint exchange.

Timing is cruel! At least wait a day with your promo, today's news with CaVirtex is just too recent.
