Yea it is easy to use but not for the layman, cheap is coming back as the tx's in the mempool have dropped drastically for first time in awhile
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:14:58
Or a dead cat bounce..
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:43:55
These are reasons that a person should not trust exchanges with imo.. 
Learn relationships between pub/priv keys and multisig and nlock time transactions, and hold your coins yourself or as part of a trust..
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:51:13
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:28:35
Yea changetip, as of now it's pretty infeasible with fee being so high..
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:50:15
Android plzz, great job too!!
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:10:43
I understood it as yea right to nodes processing tx's free
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:23:52
On sale baby, keep em cooming weak hands haha
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:27:49
I run a full node as well and I think every user should but I understood it as mining node, which I haven't ran in years
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:49:11
The cat is looking in the rearview, he's missing the past..
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:50:50
It grew when it was those things
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:26:37
By I heard it has been changed to 2 weeks much obliged. Is that enforced even if someone is an asshole and reconfigured their node to always rebroacast?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:56:26
That's the best part about it. =)
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:23:27
Dude I need smart people help please link to my post
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:33:07
Actually hot on mobile so yea
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:22:14
Far from it buddy
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:59:15
Just remind me how long tx's stay in mempool??
And I keep hearing soon for 2 years now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:58
This guy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:16:23
Well yes of course that's the problem it's the whales who will take control
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:15:44
I'm learning how to do that ty
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:03:11
It's people who don't use btc frequently I pay bills buy shit online every other day with btc I paid less than 200$ for now hahahahah
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:51:00
Dox themselves wtf you talking about???
Fuck off, if it weren't for people like me who a actually use bitcoin it wouldn't be worth shit idiot
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:45:42
No I jus paid 60$fee on a CPFP because my original tx stuck for over day and a half now so I'm broadcasting child tx with high fee to entice a miner to mine both same block
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:49:25
Umm you know youre unconfirmed too
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:57:46
How am I getting your identity from txid idc enough to even put energy to try I'm jus looking a sat/byte
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:02
Top of every hour, in 25 mins spam it
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:39
Via.btc top of the hour 100 free submissions if/when they find a block
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:04:59
Isn't that replace by fee, I'm using electrum and unfortunately since I didn't check the rbf box prior I can't use rbf smh
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:29:28
How can I attempt to double spend them with a higher fee??
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:01:30
I know but if you read my thread I don't understand why they aren't picking up both tx's stack exchange has a great list of them I been spamming the hex tx id, if I wanted to wait I wouldn't have thrown as much as I did at it, if it don't get picked by morning I'm fucking breaking my keyboard like a 4chan autistic faggot
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:29:56
Speculative bubble for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:36:01
Tx id or bullshit, it doesn't provide no info on who you are, do you even know what it Is? Sheesh I must be talking to a noob  
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:15:39
No no no you're right but that's how this community has always been innovations because you know who implements it??? Bitcoin =)
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:14:38
Well my fee was 17$ is that considered super low? 
Also I though 72 hours till unconfirmed txs drop from mempool
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:47
Use the tx accelerator on the top of any hour at via.btc
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:28:16
I know I been reading soon for like 2 years no joke
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:20:54
Ahh shit damn man drop that knowledge would love to hear more thanks, 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:38:21
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:55:34
Yes there is a change address that's mine with alot more coin to it can you eli5?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:37:58
So coins will be forever lost in limbo?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:14:35
Ty for this been in this btc game 5 years and between using tx accelerators never had this issue even though I'm loving price utility is lacking
I do have change address but I'm def going to look into updating electrum thought I had current version, child pays for parent with these 20$ fees seems ridiculous
How long does an unconfirmed tx stay in mempool I thought it was 72 hours??
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:37:04
Yes I know this but it has never been this bad, price rise coupled with increased usage and/or spam attacks like the enjoysochi
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:49:41
You basically dont have your coins at all
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:32:01
Thanks for this but I need help from veterans, I agree with almost everything you said just the price part, your right the hodlers but it's not just them the people.transacting are the ones putting the value in the coin in conjunction with how.much it costs for.mining to remain profitable...anyway get in here plz.lol 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:09:16
Sounds like you been doxxed before sad.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:55:31
Dude look it up on blockchain.info that tx id you gave me had 2 outputs .95510208btc or 18,858.20$ and .023076btc or 438$ status unconfirmed the blockchain hasn't confirmed your tx either idc what you app says it's lying we are both in same boat plus the fee paid on that tx was .0008827 which is less than my 17$ fee
We are both in same boat
Edit: nvm yours confirmed mine still hasn't even with a more expensive fee, maybe exchanges get priority with big miners??
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:33:43
Maybe you're a shill idk I don't trust strangers on the internets 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:00:44
I see, it's only been 24hrs I'm going to wait alil longer I paid 100sat/byte it should ease up soon, the mempool I mean
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:49:03
I know it'll eventually subside but I use btc as medium of exchange more than most I imagine so timing and price level matters when you buy something....
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:58:11
My fee unconfirmed for 5 hours paid 17$ fee and sent around 470$
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:35:00
Can you link me more documentation on this please
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:37:28
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:33:46
I mean I think I'd have to send all coins in my wallet to a new address? Would it included ones in the mempool already being broadcasted? Plus I'm using spectrum it don't have coin control like core did when I used to use it..So I can't be sure to pick those specific outputs...hmmm
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:59
Yes it is youre spreading misinformation 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:46:53
At least you got skin in the game my man, I started like that buying jus .1 btc 4 years ago for 15 to 20 $ now they are 1500$ ea
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:38:05
This is my point, the rest of these people can't see that cuz they dumb or noobs
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:04
Diversifying, taking profits...
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:28:46
Well I sent a .024btc tx with a .00080096 fee or 98.277 sat/byte how can I get it dropped from me.look or send a RBF with a higher fee tx?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:00:54
Yes I'm attempting to double spend, I'm thi king to send all the coins in that specific wallet to a new address with outrageous fee
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:19:36
Dude lolwut fuck bcash  I don't mind hearing differing opinions and chyll in echochambers, sounds like you do if you think that's how the world operates. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:58:58
Buy coin mining unless datacenter wise is worthless those days are over
Edit: all cloud hashrate are scams mine yourself or don't bother mining
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:18:27
Sent it from my electrum wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:17
Like you aren't, done wit you bye felicia
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:35
Happy to help, too many people focused on price around here, utility is what matters imo..
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:18:09
Bug up your ass I'm looking for solutions not just complaining if you're a veteran and know CPFP and RBF help a brotha out sheesh 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:11:51
I DO my part by being a user supporter and hodler for 5 plus years. Now I ain't a dev and haven't mined since the knc Jupiter in 2013 but don't tell me jus cause I ain't committing code I ain't doing my part
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:10
I know I use my coin as a store of value but once in awhile instead of cashing out to usd or euro I like to buy shit, so that requires on chain confirmations..medium of exchange is lacking and some other coin might pick it up, this has always been a fear here
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:16:49
Appreciate the honesty 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:14:20
I know thisnis normal, my man im like that mr bean meme bitcoin veteran rollercoaster lol, i alwayabhold majlrity iin btc always till 0 ifnit happens my point is since I didn't initially RBF the tx I'm forced to do a CPFP tx hoping to entice miners to mine parent and child same block I increase my fee to 800sat/byte my man dropped.like 50+$ USD just cuz I hate limbo...endrant
Xmr is coming up and you know it thermos....lmao couldn't help it sorry
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:28:54
Yes I have my reasons plus I'm worried about some of these coins I had for years and it's sounds dumb but there's some sentimental value to them being lost in limbo
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:32:28
I mean if you can't provide txid I call bullshit 
That's what is great about btc it's so easily checkable
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:16:59
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:25:30
Thanks for detailed response I use viabtc tx accelerators it's being spammed so hard can't get in and I been trying every hour top of hour, as can as rbf I activated it in my spectrum wallet but apparently it o my works of it was activated before the broadcast??
Thanks for that tip on moving them to separate address when they come back. Are there other tx accelerators besides viabtc that aren't scams or stupid prices 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:01:59
That's irs not me
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:17:58
No I m looking into how to use segwit addys now thanks*****  u/Bashco for replying, aren't you theymos too lmao I been around since bitcointalk days..
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:37:35
Sorry for the bother jus ate an addy I wanna learn an eli5 for segwit addresses  any leads?? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:44:29
Umm do you know which currencies you purchased are you talking about forex or crypto...and why you trust some random app??
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:38:41
When I first sent 2 days ago no, now yes so I did what I'll link you to
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:53:35
There are all diff threads on bitcointalk I'm going thru now but electrum isn't coin control like core if I'm not mistaken, I'm trying to reload my.electrum from seed while offline and broadcast a new tx with an outrageous fee and move all my coins to brand new address
Copy hash of tx
Open wallet file.in text editor
Ctrl f to find matching tx hashes in json file 
4 diff copies of hashes and keep correct syntax
Reload wallet offline, if it loads then you did good job if not you fucked up so try again
Manually sign tx and save with .txn extension 
Start internet create fresh electrum dummy wallet
Load save tx from file
Click broadcast and pray lol????
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:12:45
Prob older than you chap judging by avg age of librul snowflakes 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:07:45
Never heard of that please provide sauce??
Doubt that's true at all
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:32:55
Lol ur noob for sure 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:31
Reminds me of a similar time...totally not a bubble though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:38:18
Do you know any other tx accelerator besides viabtc??
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:41:09
Not at you and no idc who you are it's cool to be a noob I'm only asking for the transaction id to lookup the fee that was paid on your specific tx, how many satoshis/byte because I put a 17$ fee and why wouldn't a miner pick up a more profitable tx fee unless you paid more you just don't know it
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:09:29
Like you're post
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:28:50
Can you provide tx id I'd like to see fee paid / byte
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:28:21
How do I go.about double spending it, would I have to send all my coins in my entire wallet to a new address? Would it include the one that's unconfirmed? I'll make sure I send a big fee on that one lol tried accelerators please help me out on double spend that's best idea so far ty
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:07:30
Just did it called CPFP check out my pust ill link it to you
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:20:14
Is there anyway I can stop nodes from continually rebroadcasting or is that impossible because of how decentralized nodes are?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:09:28
You people make this sub about her than it used to be not it's so much less technical, noobs not understanding technology bout to lose major money if played wrong, too bad
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:42:42
The price is irrelevant, the use cases however...
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:16:20
Is this indicative if a selfish miner?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:50:58
I understand the masses and their appeal to authority, I will use whatever is the dominant chain, bitcoin works no matter what. I feel people forget that most important part, that at any price level it works.
Granted 51%  attack as long as you don't move coins until the "dust settles" you're fine, besides that cryptanalysis is our next biggest issue but satoshi was smart enough to use proper ECDSA curve SHA256 secp256k1 curve. But it that's neutralize through cryptanalysis just switch hashing algorithm.
Either way working as intended and there is no growth overnight here in btcland its organic and takes time to kick in, give segwit a chance let's see how it plays out because at the end of the day
BITCOIN IS STILL IN BETA. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:11:19
While I am a hodler for years and supporter since 2012ish the price will ALWAYS drop. This is a bull market and we don't know how high it will go, but it will come down, just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:53:40
Drop I need moar
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:16:34
Shh let them have weak hands better for us who buy dips
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:06:50
Why leave out smart scaling from your question, motives much??
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:48:26
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:24:30
You're not too late but you're not too early either, all you gotta remember is the tech works and is legit, when to buy no one can tell you, however I can tell you from experience buying at 100$ levels that I got the same feeling you have now, then. If you believe in the tech, then get some skin in the game.
Coinbase to Trezor is fine just remember to backup and safely store that recovery seed, so even if you lose the Trezor you're golden.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:13:18
Me too me too, but just being a part of this we are all doing the same essentially
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:15:47
Even though I agree with top comment, I was telling the fam at 110$
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:40:23
Hahaha hell yea
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:03:39
Yes my mistake thats for the back end private keys
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:29:19
Sign me up, I'll bring the coc aine
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:06:11
It is fine, but if those people lose 50% of their investment because bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about them or their investment all they will do is talk shit and rag on this unregulated asset, I hope they all make alot of money I truly do, but wealth isn't created or destroyed, only transferred and a fool and their money will soon part especially if they don't understand what they invested in and how price swings of 10%+ are the norm in this wild west.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:56
Nothing, that's like 100 years away anyway, by then miners will run on pure transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:52
Yea I think i remember that let me see if I can dig it up
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:44:47
Anyone who attempts to answer that question don't know shit
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:36:17
Yea but not here
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:27:20
It actually hasn't but it's still welcome lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:02:33
It is, also nice bull market.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:42:56
...it still hit doesn't matter if it was 10 seconds or 10 hours
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:29:07
Dude, this is still the Wild West..good luck with that, Ver renounced his citizenship a couple years back in a non extradition country of his own or some bullshit
As I said this is still the Wild West, I know it's an asshole thing to say " lol newbs "...its sad but true however...BITCOIN you're supposed to be your own bank, and all the newbs who don't  understand the ins and outs and are just here for the get rich quick moon ride will be the ones to lose, it's the nature of the game
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:02:59
Not at all, 80 percent drops to me just mean 80%off clearance sales, I'll gladly pickup coins dropped by weak hands...maybe the diff is I buy alot less coins during bull markets as opposed to bear markets..
been in this game for years, made me an animal, there's rules to this shit, wrote me a manual...step by step booklet for you to  get your game on track not your wig pushed BACK..lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:58:04
Everyone?? I'm waiting for the flash sale personally, but I always buy the whooole waaay dowwnn
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:53:36
Seems like you haven't ever really used bitcoin as a currency if you make that argument, while I agree this is a bubble, this is more than just 100%speculation 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:33:26
While i agree with you, and don't think you should be downvoted to oblivion like you have, the tx fee historically increases during attacks and bull markets..
Let me just add one thing, I made the mistake years ago of getting people into crypto who weren't understanders of the tech and just here for the moon ride, bull markets end and bear markets begin, rinse repeat, markets are cyclic, but if the people you got in have weak hands they will most likely lose and you'll be to blame YMMV good luck
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:19:41
You're  nuts
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:20:15
Yes, timing the peak is the lucky impossibility,  however..
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:19
Lmao full retard
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:48:08
I buy at any price level, but yea 65 would be pretty sweet, but let's be honest all the people who came here for quick profits and have weak hands will most likely add to the dip
They see price drop cuz profit takers, they get scared and sell further pushing the price down, it's like a snowball effect, I'll be buying all the way down, I also spend too though which I bet 95% of the newbs here don't do
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:57:55
Smart :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:37:21
Someone's gotta buy at the top
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:01:03
Change that limit and it's no longer Bitcoin, the user base who started btc and are still around today, and the other understanders of the tech will jump ship to another crypto that shares the deflation that initially gave them that "aha" moment..
As far as decision makers, it's every individual user who spends or speculates in its value, coupled with the miners who secure the network, and will essentially point their Asics toward whichever blockchain is most profitable, and finally the devs who maintain core and any other devs who commit forks like bch bitcoin unlimited etc.. there are checks and balances, it's not as easy as you describe ..
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:44:58
Granted, his damage will be done by the time anything can be done in a courtroom however..
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:45
Just wait..
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:26:43
I wouldn't call it thrown off, if you don't have private keys yoh basically don't have coin, all you have is a company who owes you... see MT. Gox 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:41:25
Pretty sure Ver owned it couple years ago already, correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:25
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:54:34
Yea I agree with everything except one thing, a bull market by definition if I'm not mistake is exceeding the previous ATH, and yeah hindsight is 20/20, I had alot of whole bitcoins beginning of the year..im not gunna beat myself up for that though there's still time before moon imo
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:55:02
Your friend has Weak hands, not built for crypto, don't smack him, thank him and the rest of the noobs like him that let me gobble up coins on sale I may be wrong but I feel we might test 5k, maybe lower
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:55
Whatever you believe that top it hits still counts as an ATH 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:08
You are in for a rude awakening.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:49:19
China ban made bitcoin price go down immediately from previous ATH ~1180$ to 400 overnight.
Then it steadily rose over ~2 months or so until ~1k$ until MT Gox and stayed at ~200$ for 3 years until the beginning of 2017, wouldn't call that Temporary. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:08:08
True story, however alil bit of some cost averaging works good for Joe sixpack, not only that but spending more while cost averaging during bear markets... like let's say 300 per week during a bull market, and if affordable 5 to 600 per week in a bear market, all assuming they can afford it..
Bear markets last longer imo than bull markets, although this bull market has lasted around 8 to 9 months or so, but compare to previous bear market was what 3 years?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:09:17
I agree =)
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:05:32
There's many reasons why bitcoin can crash, were you ever around for a major exchange hack? Not this tether bullshit, a real exchange.. or China's banhammer in 2013? My point is any of those things can happen again and there are many more reasons why it can

Strong hands are rare in this space, I've been through that as well

Me neither, I been buying since low 100$ and in all this time I have become sort of immune to massive swings in price, maybe it's because I spend btc alot and it works at any price level,...who knows

I agree, but that's what got the newbs here in the first place, not any appreciation of the technology, but for what it means to their pocket, and that same greed is what will make them have weak hands and sell low when they bought high

In NYC I had a friend that would put these everywhere and had nothing to do with cryptos or btc

Bitcoin will always hit bubbles and pop, markets are cyclic, my point is it's unregulated and still a wild west here...the bubbles have always historically popped and created a new bottom that's each exponentially higher than the last

You prob don't remember the China banhammer..it was a lot more effective than this.

I still have coins I bought ~220usd I use them noe to buy gold or silver bullion, I have bought beers and steam games with bitcoins and will always use it as a currency and store of value, it can be neither alone so my answer is yes THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF BITCOIN WILL FAIL IF IT CANNOT BE USED AS A CURRENCY

Nice but hurt my eyes reading!

Arbitrary in the sense that, let's say for example all the btc in the network are lost and only 1 whole coin remains, we can stretch that 1 coin past they arbitrary 8 digit lowest unit a satoshi to however many digits we want too, that's one of the advantages of programmable money
I guess who decided an apple should be called an apple arbitrary, satoshi decided on the 8 decimal places but we could always change that if we wanted...willing the community backs the idea..

While I agree that I don't expect 300$ anytime soon either, (maybe ever again?) The beginning of this year we were around 600 USD, now we are pushing 6000 USD, maybe we will hit 10k before dropping back down maybe even 20k, but the fact remains we are in a bull market and it will end, maybe we sit at 2k for next 3 years I don't know, and I'm not going to argue semantics about a bubble, but price will drop, it's inevitable, the rollercoaster of an unregulated asset, commodity, currency or whatever you want to call it will continue in my opinion...

Yes, that's why you keep your recovery seed phrase of 12 or 24 words
My trezor I bought prob 2 or 3 years ago broke, I had to sweep all my keys to my electrum wallet.

Its cool to disagree, but with what exactly?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:52:45
Doubt its over yet

That's what I call evolution.

Ugh I went through that like 4 years ago, sooner hopefully rather than later you'll keep your btc beliefs to yourself and not talk to anyone about it, then when it finally hits their social media feeds they will all come asking you about it or linking you articles etc etc...
When you have your epiphany about btc it's very easy to get a little obsessive just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster, everyone is still early imo...

I've been involved with btc for about 4 almost 5 years now, my personal opinion is we are in a bubble, a nice one mind you.. anyway markets are cyclical, btc bubbles n pops all the time, it's the price discovery of the market and a normal thing when you don't have 3 letter agencies regulating it to shit..
By the way the unit satoshi is entirely arbitrary.

Then they fight you..
