I don’t know what gatehub is but if it’s a XRP wallet than it must have 20 in it at all times or something like that. If it’s an exchange you should be able to sell it on there no problem. 
Disclaimer: This is all my understanding I am no ripple expert. If someone knows how to move those 20 XRP I would love to know how

Wells Fargo checking in, not a peep from them. And for the people saying telling them is a problem, I disagree. They see all your transactions anyway if they wanted to take a stand on bitcoin they would know who’s account to close without asking. The minute I get any shit from Wells Fargo is the day I close every account I have with them

The first bitcoin address. Started with 50 bitcoin and people have been sending small amounts there ever since. There are many of these addresses with their original 50 coin reward still in them from very early on, all of which are Satoshis coins.

My advice put a small amount in to trade with because you will probably lose it.
Get a good candle chart, set the candles to an hour and buy red ones and sell green ones, depending on your average cost of whatever your holding. However you risk bitcoin running away from you. Anyone trading bitcoin is selling this run up waiting for a pullback, some less experienced traders would have sold and bought back i at a higher price because of FOMO. 
Watch a video or two give it a shot but if you lose whatever amount you put in, quit, it’s not for you and at least your risk was well defined. 
Good luck!

I think it will eventually end up on the SCOTUS's desk but on what grounds could they "ban" it? You will hear them talk about money laundering a lot but I don't think bitcoin makes it any easier to get clean money into US bank accounts, especially in large numbers.

“Short bitcoin safely” sounds like a scary proposition to me. I know what you mean tho; for the first time there will be a real vehicle they’re already comfortable with.

I noticed that too. How does it change the anonymity of the account?
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:21:38
Doesn't that still ruin the anonymity of the account? For instance: if I buy coins from coinbase and deposit them straight to bread no one knows that wallet is my account or can tie the deposit address to my name, maybe I sold the coins to a third party right after buying. But if I buy them from bread now the addresses and coins are undeniably mine and in my possession.

I feel like all this new FUD about NK and bitcoin will be used by governments to argue for bitcoin regulation or laws in general. It is worth pointing out they have one of the most sophisticated counterfeiting operations in the world producing some of the best counterfeit dollars on the market.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:32:55
Don't get me wrong I love bitcoin but your logic on gold is fucked. Gold is proven to hold its value and appreciate over time better than anything in history. It is not something to buy and sell within the same year. You buy it and hold it for years and sell it for MUCH more than you paid. Pawn shops would be the worst possible place to sell gold because they will rip you off. You could drive to the nearest big city and sell it to a dealer or you could mail it to one of the big dealers. APMEX is the biggest one that comes to mind and they have deep pockets and would buy however much you have to sell.

Why would china going back to the gold standard ruin the dollar? It's my understanding china and Russia have abandoned using the dollar for their oil trade for years now? And I'm assuming he is implying all the dollars held overseas for the oil trade would come back the US, that would ruin the value of the dollar and in that case your crypto would be worth a lot more dollars. But again why would china doing this effect the rest of the world

What do you think that is funding? Yes if bitcoin and crypto start costing the US a lot of tax revenue you can bet your ass they will look long and hard about what can be done about it but I do not believe it will be "banned".  Bitcoin is the free market at work what kind of country would we live in if our government decided to not allow trading of crypto? One thing our government is really good at is overthrowing and killing crazy world leaders and if Kim continues to act crazy I'm sure he will find out.

You’re buggin. Settle down. Gold will be the last thing to go. There are a shit ton of investment vehicles that people will rush out of before gold. No mention of the stock markets market cap of over 18 trillion? Or the bond or derivatives markets? The truth is no one knows what will happen next time the investment bubble burst with this new asset class but I’m sure some will rush to gold just like they’ve done literally forever, not out of it. Inflation effects investments measured in US dollars bitcoin and gold are separate from US dollars unlike most other investments.
