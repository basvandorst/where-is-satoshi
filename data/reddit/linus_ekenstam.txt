Hey!   
I'm one of the team members at GetBamboo. This is a great question. Thanks for asking it.   
So we are currently operating in Australia (founders are from there) and it is our natural habitat.   
Banking there is not like in Europe (yet) but is slowly getting better with some new NEO banks popping up and innovation is starting to catch up.  
We do micro-investing into digital assets (BTC, ETH is currently supported) but more assets are coming later this year. We are excited as speedy, jumping kangaroos to be honest.   
So to answer your question, we don't actually transact each of the $0.01-$0.99 transactions individually, we accumulate them in the app, and slowly build up something we call "Round-up-o-meter" So each of your transactions get's piled into this meter (on average a user would round-up around $50 a month) one the meter is full, we go to the market and does the trade for you, buying according to your portfolio composition. Could be 50/50 BTC/ETH or whatever you prefer.   
So at this point, you are paying as low or lower fees then if you where to buy at CoinBase or elsewhere.   
We also allow for individual top-ups, so you can add $100 a month and not have the round-up method turned on. And we are currently developing the feature for recurring top-ups, so let's say you want to invest $100 a month, you set it up once, and we make sure it gets done each month. Or if you are more aggressive in your investing, you can do it bi-weekly or weekly.   
Our current fees for top-ups are these: (all prices in AUD) **1 AUD = 0.7 USD.** 
* less than or equal to $100, the fee is $1.49.
* more than $100 but less than or equal to $250, the fee is $2.49.
* more than $250 but less than or equal to $500, the fee is $3.99.  
Super happy to hear more thoughts from your side, maybe as a frame of reference, we are targeting people that find it cumbersome to set up wallets, do a lot of tech stuff and are already afraid of using tech but have friends or family that have spoken to them about this revolution and is looking for some exposure.   
We would see ourselves as a spring board, you might start using our service for 12-24 months, learn about digital assets, personal finance, benefits of Dollar Cost Average, you'll learn more about modern assets. And then choice to stay with us because we have extended our offerings, or you feel like you need a more competent tool and move to a more full-stack service or simply run everything yourself with cold wallets, on device wallets etc.   
We are not building a silver bullet, but we are aiming to help more people get exposure and knowledge about crypto / digital assets. Mainly in a responsible way, we are not advocating you to put your lifesavings in this, rather the opposite, have a steady cadence in new exposure using fiat that you otherwise would have lost in the couch or spent on a couple of coffees and a take out meal.   
Let me know if you got questions would be happy to try to answer them.

Hey!   
I'm one of the team members at [GetBamboo.io]( thanks for asking about this.   
Our current fees for transactions are: *(all prices in AUD)* **1 AUD = 0.7 USD.**
* less than or equal to $100, the fee is $1.49.
* more than $100 but less than or equal to $250, the fee is $2.49.
* more than $250 but less than or equal to $500, the fee is $3.99. 
* more than $500, the fee is 0.8% (only applicable to withdrawals, maximum top-up is $500). 
And we could not agree more about Lightning Network, we do however move peoples fiat into crypto, not crypto to crypto. So hence our transactions fees in fiat (need to cover direct debit costs in a legacy bank system, as well as any exchange fees) so the fees we impose are basically just covering those costs. With a very slim margin.   
We hope to be able to offer even better rates in the future, but since we are just a couple of months old, hot off the press, we need these in place to survive and not occur costs on each transaction.
