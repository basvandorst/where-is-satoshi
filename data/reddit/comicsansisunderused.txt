Why buy at 9400 when you can buy at 10400?
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:49:17
I hear you, man. I am here because I believe in the evitable decline of fiat not backed by gold, and I want to support its adoption as a currency. I'm not in it for capital gain, though it's nice, and it's frustrating seeing those who are more short sighted. And far more vocal.

What is mining gold?

Settle down, McAfee
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:23:16


Yeah basically. But it's a critical mass kinda thing. Need folks with btc for stores to accept, and folks won't get btc unless it can be easily spent.

What is mining bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-30 00:47:28
I appreciate the optimism behind the post, and firmly believe in bitcoin. That said, to say it's in the hands of the people is misleading. It's in the hands with those who have the means to mine. Hence my gold mining analogy.
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:59:51
For those operating at scale.

I have a metal detector.

Depends on the drug bro. And quantity also matters.
For example heroin is probably not gonna help you climb that corporate ladder. But coke might.

Double negative so it is actually over 9000.

How is gold deflationary, exactly?

Deflation is typically associated with stagnant economic growth.
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:24:05
It's also possible that deflation is a result of stagnation not the cause of it.
That said, if folks can accidentally send btc to the wrong address with no hope for recovery, and it's gone forever, the decrease in money supply becomes a real problem. We want it to be scare, but not TOO scarce. After a time, enough btc will be lost that it may not be viable, no matter how many decimal points we move.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:04:33
I'm always amused by the ups and downs of btc and this subs reaction.
There's a widespread blackmarket for drugs that depend on crypto. And if there is one thing you should always count on is people's ability to get themselves hooked on to one drug or another. Speaking from experience.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:44:36
Pot, sure.

Japan's economy was a good example at one point. I've stopped paying attention, not sure if it's true now.

The man most at risk for suicide in the prison system not on suicide watch. 
The man with the task of ensuring he gets to trial (Attorney General) is currently a Trump stooge.
Imo he had dirt on everyone, so he was never gonna last long.

The same argument is made with cash, and revaluing currency is a huge problem, no matter the format it comes in.
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:30:27
A deflationary money supply doesn't concern anybody else? Maybe it is good for us, but bad for mainstream adoption.

Agreed, and well said.
I can't buy drugs with stock. But I can with BTC!
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:59:29
I buy drugs with my btc, and then buy more btc. Gotta support those businesses.
I like to think that I am doing my part.
