palantir is a scary failure. Look up the drama from companies that are leaving them. Employees are pissed they can't liquidate either
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:47:57
Good luck with that. Gemini is way worse when they hit peak loads 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:30:35
gemini will fall over even harder if they had the same level of load coinbase does.

Market doesn't care about news right now. I wasn't referring to the news but the actual trading of Bitcoin futures once it goes live.  This will make it available for people to finally trade in traditional brokerages like td or etrade

do you guys think btc will drop if this news hits? I'm thinking of buying some BTC... not sure if I should wait.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:49:57
how is this likely? They would have to create another central neutral bank to hold everyone's money. They would also be buying and selling to each other. There would be zero liquidity. Who will mine for the banks? What if one of them gets over 51%? what's stopping hackers from connecting to their network and start mining?
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:36:52
is anyone really going to use their services? If they implement bitcoin and no one uses it, then what's the point.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:11:33
i think the price will plummet as gox reopens. there will be a mad dash for the exits and there are only so many buyers
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:46:40
lmao. so many dogecoin haters here. You guys sound just like the bitcoin haters. I can't wait to see when twitch.tv goes live with dogecoin tipping. you guys will lose ur nuts.
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:44:15
MG did not describe the problem. they said there is a problem with bitcoin protocol. there is not. therefore mt gox is wrong. I think this is where you are getting confused. they were wrong and are still wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:47:25
am I missing something? why do you need to continuously backup a wallet? I thought the wallet.dat was just a private key that never changes.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:28:12
what? why would you have to buy bitcoins to get out when you already have them?
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:19:47
How does he manage his bitcoins? I imagine he hired some tech guy to do it for him. That puts a lot of trust in this guy.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:39:56
so I made a deposit to VOS last week. where did my money go now then?
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:35:00
holy shit whyyyyyyyyy.
in all seriousness, I think you will be fine. I don't think gox is really that dumb to be completely insolvent. Everyone will be running for the exits once they open though.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:03:57
yes but the first thing people will do is make a copy in digital format. Imagine if someone just dropped their card. If they didn't make a backup it will be lost forever.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:56:10
How much in dollar amounts did you buy?
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:46:15
ok, that doesn't make much sense. Banks have billions of dollars. Making coins where 1 coin = 1 usd will effectively mean they just printed billions of dollars. It's not like when they exchange dollars for coins the dollars just cease to exist.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:03:32
Im buying in coinbase
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:29:05
I noticed a few mistakes too. For one, he said bitcoins are stored in wallets. They are not, they are referenced from wallets but really only exist in the network/blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:58:16
sounds VERY suspicious. pretty sure a regular burglar wouldn't take the time to take a heavy ass safe out of a house that was bolted to the floor. Why not take electronics, jewelry, cash, etc?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:55:10
lmao. what a welcoming reception this is.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:58:15
lmao so why can't bank B just call bank A to print $50 billion usd and have bank B destroy $50 billions usd? Seems easier. i win :D
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:13:31
what's the point in even having the private key on the card? I really don't see the point.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:54:53
here's a hint for you guys, a lot of companies already have the capability to accept bitcoins(as in they implemented it into their checkout systems). A lot of companies are simply waiting to see how it pans out/waiting for the right time to jump in. You would be surprised at how many already have it implemented(I know since I used to work for a big tech company that is doing this).
  
I would even go so far as to say amazon probably has it implemented. Think of all of the hack sessions these companies organize. Don't you think at least one enterprising software engineer would of at least made a prototype?
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:54:03
There are 2 banks. bank A and bank B. They each have $100 billion. Lets say they decide to make 100 billion coins. Both banks remove $50 billion usd from circulation on each side to make them(total $100 billion). So at this point each bank has $50 billion dollars and 50 billion coins. Bank B wants to send bank A all of their coins. Now bank A has $50 billion usd and 100 billion coins. How does bank A exchange that for usd? Oh wait they can't cause the $100 billion in usd was cut out of circulation.
    
either way I'm done arguing this. good luck with your bankcoin goals of 2014.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:28:56
The same reason it scared everyone in the first place. I'm worried people will lose confidence and just start selling to protect what little value they have remaining in btc 
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:48:59
what do you mean? buying more than $10k worth of bitcoins at once?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:30:56
"a system, in other words, that could completely eliminate naked short selling and other schemes like it."
  
uhhh don't think so. Even with the bitcoin network you can still short sell. The difference is you can't short sell as an individual, but you can short sell through a broker. This is how it works today with stocks. I know what you guys are saying, there will be no need for brokers! fat chance. brokers will just adapt and people will flock to them.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:58:18
this was my first thought. lmao. just in time for monday.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:03:12
what if i move $10k into my brokerage account to trade stocks?
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:31:05


lol first of all I never took a side. but thanks for being rude. gl to you.

If BU is so small and so wrong why do they have so much power? Why is there even disagreement? Also the 99% vs 1% thing is kinda flawed. At one point experts believed earth was flat and 1% said it was round 
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:31:14
If there are 1000 more traders that means there needs to be 1000 bitcoins locked in the system assuming they all buy 1 Bitcoin. Now let's say a million traders cone in .. that's s million bitcoins needed. Etc etc. I don't know the specs of the Bitcoin contracts but it may just be 1-5 btc per contract. 
Volatility may go down but no one knows what the initial impact of allowing more people into the ecosystem will do

Who is the counter party for people who short oil? I can sell oil and not own it. Same concept
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:01:56
Plz no
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:58:24
Bakkt allows more people to enter the space and each buy or sell will be real Bitcoin just like how oil futures is backed by real oil. I'm bullish on this as once these futures are live, they will allow for other financial products/derivatives to be created like options on futures. More traders means more bitcoins changing hands. This should mean higher demand since there's only a limited amount that exists
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:49:30
why would it
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:15:05
bitcoin isn't an organization therefore there's no "inside" for insider trading to happen
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:06:43
lmao noticed this too. what a shit design
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:54:18
don't think they did. they said all previous ICO's they will do nothing. I think maybe new ICO's may be under scrutiny
