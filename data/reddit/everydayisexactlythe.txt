I've been taking a Coursera course about Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies and one thing they semi-explained that I don't understand is forking. I understand the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork, what I don't understand is how a consensus is reached to accept the fork. 
For example: Lets say I add a new security feature to bitcoin and want to add it to the protocol. I would assume that most nodes are not owned by C++ developers. How do these nodes that have no idea what i'm trying to add to the protocol say, "Yep, we need to add that" and then convince the majority of nodes to accept it to create the fork? 
Is this a common thing with people constantly trying to add "features" to bitcoin and they are rejected? I'm just super confused how a consensus can be reached when the majority of nodes aren't going to read the proposed code to create the fork (Because they aren't fluent in C++ or just don't care)

So consensus has to be reached by the miners, not the nodes? 
If that is the case, miners are accepting it based on faith the developers are telling them this fork is a good addition to the protocol?
Is there a centralized location where these developers report the new features?

Right, but how does that translate to a consensus on whether or not to accept a fork? Are nodes just arbitrarily accepting forks? Or do they actually look at what the change is doing to the protocol before they accept it?

Do you happen to have an Edward Jones account and go through your "financial advisor" to make trades? Cause that's what they charge.
