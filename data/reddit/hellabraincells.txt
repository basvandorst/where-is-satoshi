No you don’t mean that because you’ve continued to generalize in much broader terms. The vocal majority? Lol. So you think media represents the mainstream citizen? Most of us don’t get sarcasm? That’s ridiculous man come on you have to realize that. Where are you from may I ask?

Most of us are trying to do many things, it’s a very complicated system that most of us can’t help to change, you keep insulting me but I’m not sure why. Clearly I care enough to express my concern about these things. It’s obvious you’re an angry child with a lot of misdirected pent up rage who thinks cussing has an effect on the internet. You’ll realize you’re not at all straight forward in due time. You’re quite confused. Maybe don’t play with daddy and mommy’s money in bitcoin.

You just edited your comment extensively so I’ll reply to the additional part. I don’t support war, yet this comment demonstrates how shallow and misplaced your anger is. My country doesn’t always act directly on behalf of the will of its people, there is a ton of opposition. I’m sure your country has done things you aren’t proud of and will continue to do things you do not fully support. Our leader wasn’t even elected in on a majority. I bet we have about as much say in each others governments as we do in where we’re born. Well, slightly more, I vote and express my opinion. If I think that North Korea does a lot of fucked up things I don’t immediately assume insane things like “none of them get sarcasm” or “they are all terrible people”. I hope you get this very basic point because unnecessary anger like yours is the driving force behind many of the things you hate about us, like foreign wars.

I’m speaking in polite logical terms, not working for our PR division. You just don’t want to give that a chance because your too angry at what a chosen few have decided. Besides this weird thought of not understanding sarcasm you’ve literally named nothing specific you dislike. You’re just angry. Why do you think cussing over and over again will make me not comment again? Is that something your people don’t understand? What makes someone a willful participant in the things you hate about America? Simply being born there? What if You immigrated and became a citizen? Would you hate that person equally?

Lol a grown man who cussed over and over again to go away like it has some sort of effect on the internet. Who generalizes millions with no cause. Do you understand how a modern democracy works? Stateless lmao faking hilarious. I’m stateless too then. I just was born in what everyone else identifies as the USA good cop out. You’re so angry that you don’t realize how little sense you make. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:20:32
Your extreme and displaced anger for Americans is hyperbole? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:12:11
I’m not arguing at all but I am sorry you’re so angry at millions of people you’ve never met. Hopefully you have someone to talk to about your problem. Hating an entire country of people is neither rational or healthy. It’s a delusion.

I got that comment, it was your angry and clearly bitter follow up that I commented on.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:01:06
This time it worked! You got em. Stateless boi I bow down to you and all of your anger! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:00:35
I asked questions you just refuse to answer any of them and then demand I answer to something you didn’t even ask or State, you’ve done this several times and it’s hilarious. Just keep cussing that works. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:14:53
I personally don’t believe in generalizing hundreds of millions of people but I’m also a pompous cunt so who knows. I guess you’re better.
