Alas, a right is an action that can be enforced.
The governments of the world will outlaw Wasabi's blockchain obfuscation simply by extending *existing* law that forbids the "structuring" of payments in a way that obstructs law enforcement.

Indeed. It took centuries of extreme violence.
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:02:44
Yes. I believe it.
Speakeasies and moonshine were also a thing. There was the rise of a continent-wide organized crime system, and extreme violence among gangs and between "criminals" and government; of course, we see the same has happened with the *War&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;Drugs*.
[I suspect we'll see the same trouble with Bitcoin.]( However, it may just be the case that Bitcoin usage is so captured by the State, that it will become a tool of oppression and surveillance rather than liberty. People want to get drunk and high (and hence they ignore the State), but they also want to get rich (and hence may just do what the State tells them); getting *liberty* is a little too abstract for most people.

Thanks for working on software such as this!
However, in my opinion, neither JavaScript nor any browser is an acceptable means by which to implement these ideas; they are terribly complicated and compromised foundations.

a FAQ

He didn't make an argument, *but you did.*
You derived a straw man from what he said, with a rhetorical implication being that he's wrong due to the absurdity of your derived statement.
Logic. How does it work?
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:11:04
It takes a Bitcoin transaction to set up a payment channel; you're suggesting it might be very costly to *start* using the *Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network*, a layer which is supposed to make Bitcoin essentially *less* costly to use.
The incentives are beginning to become unintuitive if not intractable, which usually spells instability for a sufficiently complex system.

Listen, I'm not trying to shut down your imagination, but rather provoke your practicality.
It's a romantic idea that Bitcoin emerged from the ether like some magical tool of the gods, but that just isn't true; there's a reason the whitepaper is only 8 pages long: All of the constituent parts were well-developed technologies that had been around for years if not decades (or centuries, if you include the idea of [tally&amp;nbsp;sticks](
Besides plugging them together, Satoshi Nakamoto's main contribution was tweaking Adam&amp;nbsp;Back's (*Hash&amp;nbsp;Cash* algorithm to scale dynamically. Git was already providing Merkle trees with compounded "verification" (e.g., the software works and was merged by a maintainer).
In retrospect, Bitcoin was inevitable and imminent. In contrast, where is the infrastructure for your IoT?
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:21:29
Nobody said otherwise.
Of course, it's not clear that it will change in the future; if it does change, it might be that it just gets worse.

It's not misinformation.
* As stated, it's what I remember.
* It's obviously still a problem, as evidenced by our exchange here.
Please re-instate my comment.

Certainly, it is my opinion that the discussion was far more interesting in the past, but I am not misremembering.
Moderators were deleting comments left and right, to the degree that custom subreddit CSS was being employed to conceal it; this is a fact that cannot be denied, as it was explicitly discovered and reported.
You're right. Some of the moderators made mistakes: They forgot that comment deletion is not an acceptable way to disagree with someone (and, as evidenced by our discussion, said mistake is still being made).

The word "capitalism" is stuck onto a lot of misnomers. For example, "chrony&amp;nbsp;capitalism" has nothing to do with capitalism, as it involves government bureaucrats stealing resources from citizens at the point of a gun (e.g., taxation), and then using those resources to line the pockets of their buddies in industry (e.g., by picking winners and losers for governmental "contracts").
So, I think what is trying to say is that the word "capitalism" in "surveillance&amp;nbsp;capitalism" is another such misnomer: Capitalism implies voluntary agreement, and the *deceitful* nature in which corporations spy on users might not be worthy of the description "voluntary"; if consumers knew more, or weren't misled by marketing language, or if governments didn't pump so much black money into spreading Amazon Echos and their ilk, then consumers might be much less inclined to participate (or might be more inclined to spend their resources on alternatives).
In short, "capitalism" is being treated as a dirty word, and it shouldn't be.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:17:12
It's an inspiring concept, namely that the authoritarians can be thwarted with just the superiority of voluntary interaction&amp;mdash;with just a better way of existing. After all, if you fight violent imposition with violent imposition, then we just end up with a lot more violent imposition. Indeed, wasn't it Isaac Azimov who repeated in his *Foundation&amp;nbsp;Series* that violence is the last resort of the incompetent? Well, I don't want to be incompetent!
What makes Bitcoin so attractive to those who think like this is that it holds the potential to free us from the most irritating aspect of our mission: Convincing everyone else to think like us, too. I mean, if a superior money can be implemented as a technological juggernaut, then it doesn't matter whether the authoritarians (or the clueless masses) agree with the underlying principles; it just matters that it exists at all, and will prevail on its merits alone.
That is what drew me to Bitcoin many years ago, and my instincts on the matter were seemingly confirmed by the greetings of an excited "community" of fellow travelers, eager to discuss the nature of resource allocation, the role and characteristics of money, and the dynamics of Liberty and Tyranny.
Alas, my faith is faltering; I'm beginning to think it was a mirage.
When the Great War struck these forums, I took off for the hills, weary of the endless battling; hell, either this thing is anti-fragile or it ain't, so I thought, and thus left it to the universe to figure out. Everyone thinks the conflict has been a *technical* one, but really it has always been *political*: The real battle has always been between the libertarian ideologues and the get-rich-quick schemers (or their artsy groupies), who poured into the community in overwhelming numbers and who couldn't give 2 farts about Hayek's fantasy.
Well, I've recently climbed down from my reclusive retreat, only to wish that I hadn't. None of the technical developments have gone anywhere "provably" useful, and the on/off ramps between the old fiat and the new cryptocurrency are more tightly controlled than ever before! It's *worse* than the old system.
Good Lord, Satoshi! You can't even spend more than an **accumulative** $9500 at Coinbase without a thorough verification process, and even then, you're not allowed to move "your&amp;nbsp;own" BTC to your own external wallet without the highest level of verification, including a photo ID (and, apparently, an explanation of how you will be using that transaction)! Soon, I'm sure it will be adjudicated that obfuscation of transactions in the blockchain is tantamount to criminal "structuring" for the purposes of thwarting law enforcement. They've already made Tor all but useless on the Web, what with the endless Captchas that frequently fail on purpose, anyway; and, let's not even mention the stripping of comment sections from news websites, the overbearing moderation across all manner of discussion boards, and the algorithmic manipulation of information channels.
That is *not* what Hayek had in mind. That is *not* what I had in mind. That is, I suspect, *not* what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. There is no liberty here; there are only shackles, greased with greed.
The truth of the matter is that there is no technological juggernaut. You must either convince everyone around you that authoritarianism is bad, or you must be willing to defend your Liberty with extreme prejudice. Do you think you can convince the proletariat to leave you alone? I&amp;nbsp;don't. They want your stuff, and psychopathic government agents want the "mandated" power to take it from you. What hope is there in the inherent asymmetry between voluntary interaction and deliberate, culturally respected coercion? None! You can't *possibly* beat that, especially when your foes creep up around your freedom machine and push you out of the control room, you know, for the sake of the *children!*
What else can you really do besides crush the authoritarians, and then frighten off the proles with the threat of terrifying, merciless reprisals for their mindless, beastly, sticky-fingered transgressions? Maybe this inability to provide an alternative makes me incompetent, but at least it has the greatest potential to make me free; as Thomas Jefferson wrote: "What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
When they come for your guns, you'll know the time is nigh.

You are undoubtedly correct.
However, I believe you are being willfully blind to the period of horror that *must* ensue between now and your desired future; you are squaring up with soulless murderers who are adept at manipulating the masses. People *love* Big&amp;nbsp;Brother; they *love* Him, and will die for Him, and will gladly watch you suffer for His glory.
Millions of people's lives have been utterly ruined around the world for growing certain plants in their homes; you think you can fuck with the money system? Oh yes, you can profit by helping to integrate Bitcoin into an even more intrusive world order, but you won't achieve freedom without the violent domination of your opponents.

That's just rhetoric.

That's very unlikely.
Ain't nobody got the mobile power to waste doing those calculations.

Capitalism does not fail to account for said failings; that's why capitalists aren't afraid to point out that taxation is theft.
In contrast, Communists can't bear to accept such failings, and thus seek to create a New&amp;nbsp;Man, first by educating the youth; then by re-educating the adults; then by segregating the dissidents into camps; then by using those camps for slave labor; then by mass murder.

A large maker of Bitcoin ATMs is [bitaccess]( apparently, their machines require verification of a phone number for a life-time maximum purchase amount of $2000 USD (or so). To spend more fiat than that, you'd have to provide a scan of your ID, which gives you a roughly $3k/transaction limit, with a $10k daily limit.
@_date: 2019-01-17 20:38:08
You're referring to what's called the "No True Scotsman" fallacy.
Von Mises explained that Communism will always devolve to violent authoritarianism, because it doesn't respect the *price&amp;nbsp;mechanism* required for allocating resources sustainably in a complex system; the outcome in Russia was inevitable, which is why saying "it wasn't true communism" invokes that fallacy.
In contrast, capitalism was alive and well in Soviet Russia; as in North Korea, the black markets are the only thing that \[have\] kept people from starving to death&amp;mdash;capitalism was (and&amp;nbsp;is) in play despite the best efforts of the powers to destroy it.
The situation is no different here. People aren't saying "this isn't true capitalism", but rather they are saying that there exists an anti-capitalist element at play, namely fraud and government. If your streaming bitcoin replaces surveillance, it won't be the replacement of capitalism, but rather the diminishment of anti-capitalism.
