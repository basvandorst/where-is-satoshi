I see. Thanks for your insight. I've started using Electrum to store my BTC's. If I've got the concept right, the idea is that Electrum stores your Wallet locally so its much more secure. You buy BTC from an alternate source and send it over to your wallet stored in Electrum. With that, you can also sell your BTC whenever you need to. Did I get that more or less right?

Thank you! I noticed that BittyBot doesn't allow you to buy BTC as you please and only by bids?

Okay, I shouldn't buy BTC on it. But what about storing the BTC? Which service would you recommend that I use?
Edit: Could you also elaborate on why you don't store BTC on any exchange?

Not allowed here, sorry mate.
In fact, Reddit for one day, I'm willing to bet its a spam bot.

Anyone ever had issues with Coinbase? I get that they essentially act as a bank and it goes against the interests of Cryptocurrency, not to mention their annoying transfer fees, has there ever bee any kind of major issues with them?

Thats the point. People saying that the price of Bitcoin can be accurately predicted are talking out of their asses.

What option would you recommend? Cold wallets?

I use Coinbase to purchase and store my coins. Not the best, but its certainly convenient. What does the current change do? Im not sure I understand it.

$1000 when the market price remains moderate? The market didn't particularly drop. Why not wait for a crash to buy in bulk?

Those are expensive but if you are investing heavily into Bitcoin, you may as well.

Just opened an account with them and I notice all the currencies are in EURO. Do you know if they accept GBP?

Ive only started using Coinbase recently. How reliable and secure is Bitpanda? Should I transfer over?

Like that poor dude who ordered pizza with Bitcoin. That burger better have tasted bloody amazing!
