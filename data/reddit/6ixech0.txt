You can set bitcoin to run through a proxy.  just set -proxy="127.0.0.1:9050" (9050 being your tor port) when you have tor running.  
For gui bitcoin, go to preferences and connect through proxy.  Put in your tor settings.

One drawback to using .onion sites is you only know about them through word of mouth.  It'd be easy to set up an .onion site, put up a website front that looks like the silk road, post the address on a site like reddit, and simply harvest your email, passwords, or other information.
For all we know, the onion address gwern gives in the write up could be a phishing scam.

Tried doing this a few months ago. People were fairly interested in bitcoin, but didnt give a shit about reddit gold.

I think you're talking about BitCoinLabs
Runs well, but I haven't actually used it yet.
