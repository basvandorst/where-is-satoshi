Whilst I'm not disagreeing the point you are trying to make, your example is wrong.
Touch screen phones had been around a while before Apple got involved. Windows Phones (with shockingly bad OS) had touch screen for a few years before Apple's first iPhone. Plus the first capacitive touchscreen was used in LG's Prada back in 2006.
Apple were the first to actually bring it all together making an easy to use interface with a product that people would want - which is what companies should be doing with Bitcoin.

This is now common culture in my previous role.
Risks are raised whether it be project or operational, this is then escalated the relevant level, Manager, Director, Executive for sign off. However what usually happens is that it gets put in a hodling pattern until its forgotten about or no longer an issue.

Around 30% of the worlds population dont have a bank account, so whats your point?

Yep! Thing is... its not just management from outside of IT, there's also a contingent inside the departments own structure who can't make a decision.
This is why my company still has 100+ services that are running on Windows Server 2003 and 14th July looms ever closer. IT management knew it was coming, projects were put before them to resolve it (hell hardware was even purchased specifically for it!) and every iteration got canned somewhere down the line.
Because? "oh noes... downtime! we can't be having that!"

I find it infuriating that banks refuse to have any dealings with bitcoin based business (especially in the UK) and yet they these types of stories of fraud, front running, cartel behavior &amp; dodgy practices come out almost on a weekly basis.

Don't be so sure, just because the nature of the game is changing doesn't mean to say that they are dying.
MS are making massive waves in the cloud computing arena with Azure. They are pulling a lot of features together to make IT for business an easy commodity.

What a farce... it was only 3 months ago when the same judge refused expert testimony from Andreas Antonopoulos.
She's unfit to judge a bake off, let alone something this high profile.

"Gold has value because people want it; electronics, fashion, investment, etc. If nobody wants it, then it has no value.
Bitcoin follows the same ideals; the blockchain, agreed value at a point in time, ease of transfer, multi-sig control, smart contracts, etc."

There's massive blow back on the eurogroup after its initial proposal of 50Bn sell off that would be held outside of Greece (under direct control of the German Finance minister).
Twitter is full of posts on this:

Yup, gonna chime in here and say its awesome. I've paid 3 of my colleagues (one of them using Android) all who originally withdrew the payment back to their account, then a few days later were paying other people with circle!
Quietly hoping this is the game changer that helps push it mainstream.

Theres uShip in the UK for that.
It worked really well for me (bought an arcade cab and had it shipped across the country for the fraction of the price I had been quoted by the big companies)

Look at Ethereum after their contentious hard fork (see DAO Bailout hardfork). They now have ETH and ETC (Ethereum Classic), as two separate chains. Anybody holding ETH during the hard fork would have the ability to spend their ether token on both chains but their 'money' was never 'doubled'.
The value of the ether on the ETC chain hasn't reached parity (yet) and despite making serious progress, it may never.... Unless ETH screws up again by implementing another rollback.

Unfortunately when ordering expensive items there aren't any options for international shipping. Despite contacting both sales support and Roger regarding shipping options, they advised that the site developers would get this sorted - it's now almost a month on and nothing has changed.
I want to buy around $2000 worth of stuff from them and have it delivered to the UK but until they fix it I'll have to look elsewhere :( shame really

FUCKING AMIR TAKKI!
There's only 1 reason I can think of as to why he gets so much airtime; is because he comes off as a complete tool and anyone listening to him will think that bitcoin is a joke.
Yes, I get he's excited and enthusiastic but his desire for getting a share of the limelight is doing bitcoin a massive disservice.
He really should get trained up on how to give presentations / interviews or STFU!

It's amazing how many companies fail at business 101!
"Make it easy for your customers to give you money."
I guess using bitcoin meets half of that but at least get the rest sorted!
