Yeah &amp; Bitcoin has no limitations.   /s
Ya me neither I’m not gonna argue with a 1 week old Reddit account. Experts so many experts out of the woodwork

“I don’t see much potential there”  ha
 Yeah you don’t realise what Ethereum is capable of once it solves scalability.
Yes it’s lagging cause of crypto cats; Ethereum is processing close to almost million TX a day. (850k at it’s highest). Plasma hasn’t been implemented yet and it still doesn’t have as many pending TX as bitcoin. 
Once Plasma is implemented, &amp; the hype dies &amp; the dust clears, we’ll see who emerges as King

That’s exactly what I mean. “Bitcoin is only in demand cause it’s built a name”
In the crypto war, fundamentals will win in the long term. By 2020, I see Ethereum as king. Once plasma &amp; Raiden are implemented successfully

This is a very young space and the ecosystem hasn’t matured yet that’s why everyone seems to be pouring their money into Bitcoin now. Its all hype.
It’s got 220k pending transactions, that is simply not sustainable. How many would be pending in 2018? Half a million? Imagine a bitcoin transfer taking a week. People would start looking at alternatives.
The real fundamentals &amp; potential lie with Ethereum.

Ethereum. Not bitcoin.

At this rate..by 2018, Bitcoin will have 500k pending transactions. That’s half a million. Probably would take 3-4 days for 1 transfer. Pray tell me, is that sustainable?

Ethereum, people, Ethereum. 
Not dinosaur bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:57:57
Yes yes but is it going to be ready in a few months? Even if it is, will it work as expected? 
I predict a million pending transactions by March 2018

No FUCK BITCOIN and everyone that has ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!
Ha I’m just kidding, you’re right..peace. Let’s just witness how the whole industry unfolds.

That’s not the way to respond to a legitimate concern.

Obviously the crypto space is much more volatile in comparison to traditional stock markets - however, it doesn't hurt to know a few basic indicators.. Bull flags, wedges etc. They can be handy &amp; I find I'm right more often than wrong.

Damn, this bear looked like a bull for a minute...
