Only happened once, I was there. The stadium internet was iffy. Even mentioned it in the video.

What business are you in sir/ma'am? I'm sure that if their business were to die in your estimation then the source code would be revealed since they mentioned competition as the reasoning... better yet, why not ask them the question since this an AMA? Direct your comment to the moderator.

So in your estimation, with Coinbase and Bitstamp, convenience and the fact that you don't download the wallet means trust, even though they control every aspect of your bitcoins?

Have you guys taken on any money? If not why haven't you received any investors?

Think about Coinbase they have all of your information regardless.

TIL: PNGsue doesn't really read all the information in a thread before completely trolling. There is no coop regulated or unregulated that handles or manages anyones money that has been mentioned on this page.
My answer was truthfully in regards to having a company use proprietary software to manage an open source, irreversible unregulated currency.
Disclosure: I'm friends with both Lafe and Lamar. I know their work and their business ethics. I also own and use bitcoin daily. I also know that the internet is full of trolls and whether intentional or unintentional bitcoin draws a lot of trolls to forums especially Reddit.

You still didn't answer the question. To answer the question I have.

In truth only nerds use github, and care about open-source. I agree with bigmarh in that businesses for the mainstream have to build trust the old fashioned way. 
I also understand that MtGox has everyone scared in the bitcoin space, however Coinbase and Bitstamp still continue on without any issues and have amassed a huge following. I personally like their services so I am in no way discrediting their business model or their intent.
Also one of the problems with open-source projects that I haven't seen anyone mention is the fact that some open-source projects just die because of a non-supportive community base. Contributors (not all good/quality mind you) fade away and move on to the next project catches their eye.

I use both Coinbase and the Pheeva Wallet so I guess twice.

Again, the one thing I find funny about this thread is the fact that all of the trolls who yell open-source neglect the fact that Coinbase and Bitstamp are closed-source goliaths in the space. This argument is funny because if you understood how code works then you would see that what is considered closed-source really isn't. It's just not handed to you on a platter.

I love what Sean is doing to help others while promoting Bitcoin at the same time.
