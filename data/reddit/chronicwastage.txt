Unconfirmed parent could mean that you had bitcoin sent to your wallet and did not wait for that to confirm before you sent that bitcoin somewhere else.
Now the network won't process your send till the original deposit to your wallet is confirmed.

when big players get into bitcoin they won't hesitate at paying $2 / $10 / $100 / $1000 for a transaction if that is what they need to do .... that will be peanuts to the amount that they are moving

1) BigBlock Believers leave to BCH due to segwit2x failure
that was the trigger
2) People who put too much money into BTC crap their pants and sell
3) Traders see an opportunsellto sell and buy back into something else...maybe BTC maybe BCH maybe Alts
this creates more pants crapping
4) More people who put too much money in crap their pants and sell
price rebounds 25% above the bottom as traders return some money to BTC
conclusion: price had far exceeded current value of bitcoin.  devolopment of bitcoin will continue thus gradually increasing its value and price

Do you mean 80% of miners plan on mining the segwit2x?
Segwit2x needs mining power so that big holders can move them and sell them for more BTC increasing their Satoshis.  If it didn't get hash rate then would be hard to sell them.  Therefor b2x must get hash rate at least until the miners have sold theirs.
Just my uneducated guess.  I'm a know nothing scrub.

BCH is ultimately uninteresting to me.  To my eyes it looks like it is lumbering towards centralization and isnt decentralization one of the key points that give BTC its value?
There is unquestionably a thirst for low transfer fees which is the only thing that BCH is addressing.
If BCH couldnt solve the problem when it forked then I was unclear as to why some people thought a puny increase in blocksize via segwit2x was going to accomplish anyrhing meaningful.  Segwit2x was useless at least BCH is trying to accomplish something.  Though I think it is doomed to become corporate and centralized.
If I were to look elsewhere for a coin it would not be BCH.  First I would look for a coin that addressed the centralization of mining and work from there.
So.  Bitcoin is maintaining small blocksize which enables more people to run nodes, especially in poor countries where the equipment may be second and third generation.  More nodes means greater decentralization.  Decentralization and as a result of that decentralization creates freedom from government meddling and that is what gives BTC its value as a store of value.
BCH claims to be able to provide transactions for pennies.  It is claimed that Lightning Network will do it nearly free.  Well in the big scheme of things pennies are important.  Pennies are not good enough.
So, not being a trader and being a bit of an idealist, I will be holding onto my BTC.

I'm becoming very cynical.  Forks are nothing more than an opportunity to increase ones holding of Satoshis.
Fork creates item that can be traded for more Satoshi.  Who probably will have a ton of the fork items should the fork occur?  Answer is miners.  Who has the ability to force the fork?  Answer is miners.  Who will provide hash rate to the fork while they sell their forked items?  Answer is miners.  Who will pull their hash rate and once again support the main coi  once they have sold their forked items?  Answer is miners.
Therefor miners will provide the hash power to force every fork to come into existance.  We are in never ending fork hell.

I sold my single ounce of gold at a cute little shop.   She took my coin, put onto some sort of submerged scale and wrote me a cheque.  She then asked my why I was selling it already.  I had bought it only one month before and I responded that it was too boring and that I was going to use the money to buy more bitcoin.  I suggested as I left that she should diversify into crypto telling her that it wasn't that hard in my opinion.  She wouldn't have told hold a bunch of I said.  Just buy and sell it for people while taking a percentage.
I think these businesses are in a good position to jump right into crypto and offer a safe place for people to walk in and put their money down.

mmm eBay ... sell fake stuff to fake customers ... eBay probably tracks that kind of repetitive activity
kyc coming to bitcoins near you soon I guess

I'm only going to guess that as the transaction rate increases that the amount of electricity per transaction will go down.
If only one transaction were done per hour then I could say that it took all the electricity that miners consumed in one hour to make that one transaction.

As bitcoin reaches its market value it's appeal to investors hoping to profit off its rise will diminish.  Small players will get pushed out or sell off as it will take larger and larger amounts to make a reasonable profit off of trading.  The players will get bigger and bigger but there cannot be too few players or it won't work.  I think it is obvious that only two players or just one player would be too few.
At that point will the utility of bitcoin be enough to support its continued use?  I guess it would have to be and the balance point will be it's ultimate price.
ok.  As a store of wealth and as a means of transferring wealth I'd say that bitcoin has gold beat hands down.  Except in case of civilization ending stuff.  So therefor bitcoin will replace gold and consume it's market cap.
$333,333 usd each.  Did I do that right?
Currently I do not believe that gold is much used as a transfer of wealth.  If bitcoin is used as a transfer of wealth which it sure seems designed to do then I think that a value much higher than $333,333 usd will be achieved.
I got no idea really just messing around...idk ... $1,000,000 usd

after adding the fiat value of my sell with the current fiat value of my remaining stack i am looking at x12
if i had actually known what i was doing alot more could have been made...alas i new nothing...it was LUCK and honestly a monkey pushing buttons could have profited at that time
take what you from this story of LUCK

coffee shop best place to put them...out in the open...not buried in some corner where you have to ask people to move in order to get to it....not in a sketchy looking location...cannot make u feel like you are in a dark backalley...people like to sit with their back to a wall so others cannot look over shoulder...back to wall is best so no fear of someone grabbing from behind
based on my own experiences being an atm customer
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:24:35
and your real problem is you are not using the same wallet that you asked coinbase to send to... or its not synchronized in some way

ive personally dealt with:
btcsolutions located in edmonton
bitnational located in calgary
bitnational i did a face to face buy....and btcsolutions i did instant over the phone etransfer sell...and ive used both their atms
call them and see if they can help you...expect fees and that but thats how they make their money

bitcoin is a limited real estate...like water front property they ain't making anymore...though 12.5 bitcoins added every ten minutes and some water front property is created still
without considering any other effects I think bitcoin is just going to go up and up an up

passive btc earnings are possible by lending your bitcoin on poloniex...not much but you are trying to increase the number of satoshi you have.  i think you would get about $2 worth of bitcoin per month right now.  also be aware of transaction fee...could take you a month just to earn your transaction fee back

f it im in
365,000 subs in this reddit.  if each of these subs converts 1 person per month, and it doubles every month, then the entire population if the planet will be converted in under 15 months
or 20 months if only online subs are counted
please correct me or laugh!  good times for all
honestly my conversion rate has been 3 per year...maybe.  2 for sure i think
so total conversion in 10 years in that case...but the conversions should get easier so i wildly guess total conversion in 5 years if all 365,000 subs are converting at 3 per year.
if 8000 online subs are used and convert 3 per year then 13 years are required for full earth conversion...or 7.5 wildly guessing again
clearly there are alot more factors at play than simply doubling each month because if that were true than Satoshi Nakamoto would have achieved total earth conversion in just 34 months and that obviously did not happen

don't do this but imagine:

each time it forks make a copy of the original and write the name of the fork on it
use the appropriate software to send from each paper wallet depending on which fork is written on it

 looks to me that he and his team have developed a strategy that has worked very well for them and Bitcoin falls outside of that strategy.
Their strategy does not possess the tools needed to make an educated decision on the direction that Bitcoin will take and thus Bitcoin is outside of his scope.
Obviously he is an expert in what he does.  Is he an expert of Bitcoin? How transferable is his accumulated knowledge and experience to Bitcoin?
He cannot see with any reliability where Bitcoin is headed is what I think he is saying.  And so therefor will not touch it.  Nothing wrong with that.

mining bitcoin is very competitive
try not to get scammed
you should be able to just follow instructions given by others on how to set it up

i had not touched my trezor in months not having a use for it....just did a firmware updaou today, logged in and found 20usd of bitcoin still on it...thought it was empty...transfered those bitcoin which were on a pre segwit address to a segwit address just to try it out
no complaints here
except that ive seen or read of people plugging the trezor directly to their android phone so i bought a cheap cable to try it.  did not work.  wrong cable? idk i didnt try too hard to figure it out
mmm where the heck is my trezor recovery...oh ya in my safety deposit box... is that ironic? keeping my bitcoin stuff in a bank?

If i own something that produces goods that other people want will they not, if bitcoin takes over other currencies, pay me for those goods in bitcoin?  Then I will have a continuous income stream of bitcoin instead of having a stack that I continually spend until it is all gone.
I may not be able to claim true believer status if I sell I suppose.  I thought afterwards that I should not have labelled myself a true believer as I may have offended the real true believers!

People taking loans and going all in scare me.  I feel for them if they lose it all.  So hard to make that money back working overtime and cutting expenses.
Sometimes I wonder when I sold some if I was just taking some kids Christmas and birthday money from Grandma.  Did kids pay off my house!!!???  I feel a little dirty.  I was in the Polo troll box just laughing and having a fun old time.  Some people got wrecked.  Probably not fun old times for them.
I find bitcoin very conflicting at times.
So the standard answere applies.  Only what you can afford to lose people.
Don't get wrecked.

That year, an Iranian shoemaker with a bitcoin-only e-commerce shop called Persian Shoes reached out to the Bitcoin community. CEO Mor Roghani wrote on his website that he could not take other forms of payment to sell his products worldwide. He explained, “the problem is we operate in Iran and most payment systems either are not willing to serve us at all or impose a huge risk on our business.” While bitcoin has been helping him circumvent his payments problem, sanctions placed on the country by the US still make it illegal for US residents to purchase goods from the country.
While the founders of Linköping-based Brave New World Investments initially took their idea of creating an investment vehicle for companies traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange to the six largest banks in Sweden, each, they said, refused the idea.
Investing in Iran is legal in Sweden, but concern among the banks that Brave New World Investments might be perceived as a violation of US sanctions against Iran proved an insurmountable obstacle.

the gold will be confiscated if authorities choose to
so is not the same thing as crypto imo ... 
if a key is lost who gets to keep the gold?
who pays to store the gold?

id say bitcoin is not a big problem.  i would not be using it for crime what with every transaction leaving a trail for all to see.  imo bitcoin is a stupid choice for crime. id use something else
actually bitcoin scares me a bit...kinda feels like being under a microscope...government would love to watch my every move. something that i feel bitcoin will enable them to do
government is going to freakin love bitcoin imo
none of my guns came from the darknet...i bought it at the sports store for fs sake...and another a private sale...the old dude didnt even have a cell phone...was land line.... there was no bitcoin or darknet involved there i assure you...i just find the gun part extra stupid

i should prob leave this for peoples who actually use gdax and electrum...whatever
gdax thats an exchange right?  ive used poloniex only...no it does not happen right away...poloniex appears, based on my experience, to gather up about ten minutes worth of bitcoin withdraw requests and send them out once every ten minutes...roughly...sometimes ive waited 15 minutes...idk i dont time it...sometimes it is instant...my theory i just got in at the last second of the ten minute gathering
then about 3 seconds after i get the green light from polo my mycelium wallet shows the incoming btc amount but with zero confirmations....this is because the polo transaction to me is waiting for the next block to be found so it can get on it (my polo withdraws seem to usually get on the next block)...blocks being found are not under the exchanges control...blocks are found by the miners when they are found and that is it....blocks may be found about every ten minutes but sometimes have taken up to an hour....doesnt matter how high your fee is ...your transaction must wait for the next block to be found to get any confirmations
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:23:14
you just need the private key and the public address that comes with it...figure out how you can obtain one of those, store it safely, and then send your bitcoin to that address
or you could just say f this forking bs and not worry about it

non hacker scrub here...
i guess id have to know who you are irl...New Zealand i guess is a start...getting my hands on your mycelium recovery key would be my primary goal...or perhaps i could separate you from your phone, install something, then return it to you
why does your phone have bluetooth turned on? of what use that could be to me i have no idea being a scrub
i again get my hands on your phone...i place a transparent screen saver over you screen like what comes from the factory...its scratched up and nasty....maybe you dont notice for a while and use your phone typing in your password...you get annoyed with the screen saver and throw it into the garbage...i retrieve it note where you pressed
haha f me getting crazy
not what you wanted but you make an interesting post
its just past 3pm in new zealand now

i like paper wallets but i think i agree with those who say it is difficult to do it 100% securely...how do i know if someone is somehow seeing my paper wallet when i print it off...is there still potentially a file on the printer that someone could copy?  now i have to find out and ensure everything is wiped after i print it
i also have a trezor.  it or something like it is a worthwhile investment i believe
my initital money has ballooned from 10,000 usd to 180,000 usd.  spend the 100 bucks or whatever and get a hardware wallet
dont be so cheap!

If you have 1.2 bitcoin in your wallet it stays that way till you send some to another wallet.  Bitcoin is worth whatever people feel like paying or selling it for.
Yes the price of bitcoin goes up and down.  It is insane.  The amount the price has gone up and down in the last year is nuts.
Bitcoin has created a new frontier of which the bitcoins themselves are the land that is up for grabs.  Real estate in a world which allows storage of wealth almost untouchable by others.  Real estate in a world which allows transfer of wealth across the earth in minutes.  This real estate is up for grabs.

gold is cool...id actually like to have a stash if i had the money to spare
Is it ironic that i a bitcoin holder cannot take gold bugs seriously?
it looks to me that gold, other than a couple pumps, has essentially done nothing for about as long as i have been alive...yet gold bugs keep predicting the end times that are just around the corner but never seem to come
so forgive me if ive become jaded
but im glad that bitcoin is providing content for so many articles and shows.  keep making that content...thats what they are really about anyway...views and clicks...everybody has got to eat

"Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase."
"We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time."
"Coinbase's current priority is to add support for Segwit2x, followed by Bitcoin Cash. We will continue to monitor the development of Bitcoin Gold, and if its network proves to be both secure and valuable, Coinbase may decide to support it at a later date."

nobody wants to go through the hassle of setting up an exchange account and sending funds to it just so they can try it out...you do all that yourself then you can just hand them a paper wallet in an envelope that they can stick in their lockbox at home

I love watching the banks get beat on in here and was being sarcastic obviously.  But then on the way home I picked up the single envolope that was in my mailbox.  In it was a letter notifying me that a deposit had been made to my account in Canadian dollars, via an atm, had actually been USD.  They credited my account.  I'm not going to say who did it but I love her very much...and it's not like I never make mistakes.
