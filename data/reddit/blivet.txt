I read somewhere that in the former Soviet Bloc countries there is a joke to the effect that everything the Communists told them about communism was a lie, but unfortunately, everything the Communists told them about capitalism was true.

It says "should not", not "may not". It's just, like, their opinion, man.

Except there are tons of people and websites that use PayPal exclusively. IMO they are unwise, but they do exist, and if I want to transact with them online I have to use PayPal.

They may not believe in it, but they will accommodate those who do. That's not so bad. If someone wanted to pay me in yen or Euros, I would accept, but probably convert the funds into USD as soon as I could because I don't have any creditors in Japan or the EU. Nothing to do with whether I think the currency is sound.

Not really. Coin, paper, note and pay are all words related to money

A *lot* of the early hackers were model train enthusiasts.

Yeah, libertarian ideas sound good, but in practice you end up giving swindlers free rein.
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:18:23
Why do you think that is going to happen?

I haven't read Wired in years, but back when I did I was amazed that there seemed to be no amount of corporate guff that the editors would not swallow. The whole thing seemed like rewritten press releases.

Too late for what? It's supposed to be a medium of exchange. Its value relative to other currencies is irrelevant if you just want to buy something or pay a debt.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:21:59
Or macks.

I thought Bitcoin was infinitely divisible?
@_date: 2015-05-02 22:36:28
Those were the days.
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:17:28
So there are always enough seats. You can always buy $1 worth of Bitcoin for $1.

I know, man. It sucks having to be a member of society.

Yeah, I think I have five followers, and I don't even know who three of them are or how they found my totally inactive feed or channel or stream or whatever the fuck you call it.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:09:50
Fuck him, then.

I'm sorry to be offensive, but that is truly a repulsive sentiment. How can you possibly think that the right to control your property is more important than the right to control your body?
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:17:02
Why not both?
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:08:00
Only if the authorities consider money more important than individual rights.
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:16:24
Just goes to show how little libertarians actually care about individual rights. It's all about money.
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:42:07
And letting people starve in the streets.
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:40:57


About time.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:21:57
It's really shady.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:45:24
Not bad. Clear, succinct.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:43:05


Seeing as how the name has the word "coin" in it and all.

Could you be clearer about what Apple's rules are that relate to bitcoin apps? What do you mean by "like storing wallet files"?
