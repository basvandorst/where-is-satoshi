How much does this actually earn per hour or so?

I mean how do you give it bitcoin? A QR code? Scanning paper wallets? NFC?
And how long does that take? Whenever I send bitcoin to another address it takes forever to get a confirmation. Would I have to be standing there at the ATM waiting for up to an hour before it spits out cash because it is waiting for the blockchain to confirm it?

Thanks for the info; I was actually looking for a video and couldn't find one.

How do I work in a mine like he did? Or even find one to work in?

hold until 40k? (serious question)

The thought is nice, but a big reason I use bitcoin is to avoid these kind of fees -_-

I hit my goal of 2.1 BTC.
That might not sound like a lot to some people, but it wasn't easy for me. 21 BTC would be a dream.

or hold until the moon..?

Thanks for the down vote instead of answering my question. I read something about bitcoin maybe being worth forty thousand each one day. Just wanted to know others' thoughts… seems like a moonshot to me.
