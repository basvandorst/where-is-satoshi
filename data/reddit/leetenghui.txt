See my other post.
In 2008 I got hit badly by the money printing. As a result I moved all my money into hard assets such as arable land. I currently own a fair bit of land and housing in a village. 
This village is surrounded on three sides by dwarf mountains (1700ish ft) it has a fair amount of acreage for growing arable land and it also has it's own water supply AND remnants of the city walls from 200 years ago. While it is not perfectly defensible. It survived the extermination wars between 1850-1870.

Some do some don't. My non Han Chinese clan have this mentality because we're sort of like the Jewish people. Persecuted for centuries. 1800 was a terrible period where a war of extermination was waged against us. This was after a Qing extermination effort 150 years before that.


Some will some won't. A thing which is a huge advantage is close knit ruthlessness. Whereby everybody has a close knit community to their own but aren't so good to outsiders.


I have no idea.
