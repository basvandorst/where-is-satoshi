I set up a bitcoin qt app on my computer, but I might ignore that and just get started by using online.  I just feel useless by not understanding anything.

I know. I was being sarcastic. I need a perm tag that tells everyone I missed the 20 buys in January and didnt think about bitcoin again until peak...

Im not going to lie, I totally want in. Sadly I have no idea where to begin. I need someone to literally walk me through this whole wallet thing.

Things... happened. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:37:33
it's completely fine. I never said I was ever informed, just bitter... very very bitter.

do i just give you my credit card number, or Social security number too?

Ill buy in at 20. I can afford to lose at 20. Although I still need to learn how to buy.

A couple things. Money first off. I have some extra but i would rather buy 5 coins for 100$ at a 20 $ value then 1 coin at a 100$ value.
Second, its hard to buy in my area. Ive been looking and only found a few shady seeming ways. Only one buyer and seller locally, and i would much prefer a cash exchange over anything else.

I just wish there was something I could do to make coin, however I only have a laptop that seems to be unusable for mining.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:55:04
Well, I had only found the site just now. Honestly, I posted too soon, i thought it was more suspicious activity. I am assuming it is the block that is mined?

It isnt diablo 2 by any means, but it did grasp my attention for a few days. I am iffy on it still, but not mad at my purchase like last year.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:19:30
Wait... where is more info on this? This seems a lot easier.

Though they could suspend our account for buying gifts, if they setup for bitcoins, this guys site would be obsolete.

North Korea! Those tricky bastards. Make us look for missiles when really you are attacking online!

do not want &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:47:36
The only thing I found was a site to download and my computer said it seemed malicious.
