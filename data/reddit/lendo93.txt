Coinbase "vault" is just a normal wallet, except Coinbase is the custodian. If you track how they store the coins that are just sitting in people's accounts, they have "hot wallets" that are just a pool of everyone's Bitcoin split into hundreds of quickly rotating wallets.

This was clearly a fake account masquerading as real because whoever controlled the account (if enough people thought it was legitimate) could easily cause a massive pump or dump by posting a false update about the ETF status. And then profit.

You just never hear about all the billionaire kids who ended up in a lower 'caste' than their parents. Obviously, a person's wealth is related to parent's wealth due to better education, opportunities, and potentially inherited wealth/genes, but dynasties are far rarer than one-off or two-off successful generations.

Is this true/no strings attached? I've only been able to find Bitcoin-promoting news sources like CoinDesk that have posted this story.

For the most part, if finance professors were really experts, they wouldn't be finance professors.

No, the ETF was insured. Some exchanges are as well, like GDAX.

If you want to support the ETF by commenting, make sure you have someone on here proof-read it.

Higher transaction costs necessarily push up the value of Bitcoin. This is why the value is expected to increase long term after each halving -- fees are the only way to fund the network after mining rewards get smaller.
EDIT: So to clarify, this means the fees will be proportionally very small to the kinds of transactions Bitcoin is competing with (ACH transfers/investments) as the value rises. And as many people here realize, Bitcoin was never set to be a full replacement for Visa -- it still needs its own transaction layer built on top of trusted providers for that kind of ubiquitous use.

Great idea to add a checksum. I was just thinking of ways to address this problem of potentially fat-fingering a way all your money. Fundamentally, I think it should be impossible to send money to a wallet that doesn't exist on the Blockchain.

He won a Nobel Prize for a mathematical proof of what seemed like a relatively intuitive, trivial result about global trade and purchasing power. Must have been a slow year for economics. All of his Keynesian ideas are completely unrelated to his Nobel Prize and people need to differentiate that. Just because he won a Nobel Prize for something in a different, less politicized part of economics, does not mean he knows what he's talking about in every aspect of economics (even though he probably should).

Chinese developers are notoriously ignorant to security -- personal experience. This was open-sourced; it was not a backdoor so much as a front-door.
Is Bitmain extremely ignorant and amateurish? Yes. Should you buy their products? Absolutely not. But don't turn everything into a conspiracy theory.

This guy has no reason to be angry at Coinbase -- nor IS HE AT FAULT. The fault is clearly Verizon's here, and perhaps a massive settlement will make phone companies less susceptible to social engineering.
