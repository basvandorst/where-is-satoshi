probably my favorite comment ;)
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:02:14
if you'd like!
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:10:52
Congrats and I will! Just got him into Bitcoin as well XD

We took that server down the other day, at the moment we are in a very private beta. A few members of the press, a couple members of some partner companies. We are working very close with a few other companies on guaranteeing security.
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:15:32
Was a fun hackathon! I'm very interested in seeing where they take this.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:27:55
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:05:20
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:19:37
no all we can do is install our apps. We removed the ability to remote wipe, you will be able to confirm this by checking the user permissions before installation.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:50:02
"Ask and you shall receive." Keep in mind there are just two of us though so it'll take a day or two!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:00:59
thank you for your kind words ;)
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:12:14
1. We will have some sort of approval process. It will be extremely liberal though. I am not interested in being the provider of a child porn app &lt;-- this is about the only thing I'd say we are looking to block though.
2. AppleTV would be fun to work with, I'm sure that would really piss Cupertino off. We would most likely build our own set top box or form a partner ship with someone who already has a set top box.
3. We will be Bitcoin only, this makes it easier for us to launch worldwide.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:19:43
GFC baby
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:17:11
email tyler and we will get you set up to develop! There are only two of us, we are working on the developer site but as you can imagine an android/apple app store with our own version of iCloud and other goodies requires a lot of time. There will be a developer portal soon though!
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:57:13
it will most likely be around noon tomorrow! I sincerely apologize for not being more clear!
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:58:40
the App Store is cloud based.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:16:48
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:37:07
Thanks! I'll just reply here!
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:25:56
Thanks for posting I am the creator of this App Store. We currently have our own subreddit Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:05:01
You will be more secure with our store because we will be able to prevent malware, a feature we know we can implement (on iOS only so far) is actually virus protection. More on this later.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:38:27
Windows phone is next, then wearables! I've already began work on Google Glass and Pebble.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:58:42
Because we are using Coinbase to power our payments and wallet and upon launch we will request that they audit our software.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:22:01
Thank you! All of your kind words mean more then you know! Coding something this large for this long (there are only two of us) is scary because you don't know how people will react!
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:30:32
That is why I am still up. Finishing the load balancer configuration to theoretically handle "20,000 connections with spikes of up to 100,000." We will see though!
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:05:55
you appear to be quite the intelligent investor.
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:49:20
breaking our store would also break billions of dollars worth of already existing infrastructure. It has taken a very long time to reverse engineer, implement and invent but this is too creative for them to simply say no to. Our protocols are currently backwards compatible all the way to iOS 4.0, which means they would have to actively host two versions of their very low level server code. Also they don't know exactly how we are doing what we do because we are hosting everything. They also don't know what else we have up our sleeves, we have backup implementations.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:09:35
For now we are calling it the "Bit Store". Come up with a better name and we will definitely take it into consideration!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:07:42
beta invites will be sent out soon ;)
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:27:30
Email a coinbase email address to atd and I will record a video of myself installing the app store, then the wallet and send any amount (under a dollar) you request to said coinbase address.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:08:49
thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:45:39
Apple cannot ban Bit Store because we do not use the App Store to install Bit Store. There is no 30% fee for our store or a two week long review process either.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:51:14
you are correct.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:56:56
we have added a donation link on  Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:22:12
No exploit, just a creative use of existing documented and undocumented protocols!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:04:09
Appster has my vote at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:59:09
we will!
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:55:32
I promise it is not. You can sign up at  and later next week we will be sending invites to download the store. Finishing the server configuration required to handle the expected load and finalizing a few apps are all that is left.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:15:18
I see where you are coming from with this, our current stance on this is:
If having an app in my store could result in me facing jail time or my users encountering fraud then hell no, otherwise I honestly don't care.
In the next few weeks we will go into more details about our app store policies but honestly user safety and me not going to jail are two policies I hope we can all agree on. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:18:55
We are currently having our wallet audited by outside "trusted" companies. More on this soon. Trust me we want it to be secure far more then you do. Last thing I want is to be comparable to Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:35:42
yes I have given it out to a few reporters. I'll be sure to let you know when they finish their review. Also we gave live demos earlier this week at Inside Bitcoins and will also be available to demo the rest of this week at the Bitcoin Expo in Toronto.
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:26:34
That is the plan. The Bit Store is not intended to be only Bitcoin related apps, it is intended to use Bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:44:14
they have access to far more, they can read your iMessages.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:46:19
We disabled the ability to remote wipe via our profile permissions. I actually never figured out the code to do this either. We reverse engineered this without documentation and I was never interested in guessing the payload that would actually allow me to do that.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:56:16
We definitely plan on launching version 1.0 with WP8 ;) We are fans!
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:57:24
My dad went to Ole Miss for college and medical school if that is what you meant by rebel :) Thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2014-04-05 08:56:23
KDE appears to be a definite and Sailfish and Firefox seem quite possible but I would need to actual use them before I'll know for sure. My top priority is Windows Phone, followed by Google Glass. Ideally there will be more then two of us in the coming months and if that is the case then expanding to as many platforms as possible (within reason) is our goal. Allowing users to pick the best, while allowing developers to write once and release on tablets, phablets and phones seamlessly is the plan! 
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:48:17
You are also incorrect. Do you honestly think I'm that stupid?
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:25:06
Apple can't prevent our store's existence because, on iOS, Safari allows applications to be installed to the the home screen. In the event that the implementation we currently have in place is compromised by an update we will modify our code to circumvent the update. If our seamless implementation is still disabled by such a future update, which while possible isn't likely to happen in the near future due to the damages this would cause to existing software that has existed since iOS 4, we would revert to an app store that you install with the "install to home screen method." If we can install our store to the home screen then we can install apps exactly, if not very similar, to how we are installing them now (without having to click "install to home screen"). Finally adding one extra step to the app install process will not remove the cloud platform we have created, our Bitcoin wallet, the hardware access or the notification features. Our store is intended to be a multi-platform app store just as much as it is an iOS app store that allows for Bitcoin usage. 
Apple's own documentation states that, "A web application is designed to look and behave in a way similar to a native application." Although we are taking our implementation a few steps further then the average "web application," in the end we "could" revert back to such a state and maintain our platform. Side loading apps on Android are nowhere near as elegant as our iOS install process. This has not stopped third party app stores from existing on Android and we believe the same will hold true for iOS in the absolute worst case. 
One more thing worth noting is that back in 2010 Steve Jobs stated the following in his essay "Thoughts on Flash": "New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind." (
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:38:50
The following permissions are disabled:
  Device Name,
  Serial Number,
  Installed Apps,
  Capacity and space available
We keep the following: 
  Phone Number,
  Model Name and Number,
  iOS Version Number
Q1. Why do you need my phone number?
A1. We use your carriers email-to-sms capability to provide devs with the ability to use our api to send you push notifications. The developers themselves do not gain access to your number and we will write a privacy policy stating that this is the only reason we want your number. If there is an outcry against us grabbing your number we will remove this feature or provide an opt-out feature.
Q2. Model Number why?
A2. If we know your device model we can make sure a proper version of the app you download is installed, this make the developers job easier and therefore significantly improves the user experience. Remember we are all about write once ship everywhere (that doesn't mean it was fun for us to code, if your a dev you will love us).
Q3. iOS version why?
A3. iOS 7.0 likes to break your phone. iOS 7.1 is kick ass, iOS 5 and 6 are kick ass. iOS 7 sucks and because of this we have to change the payload we deliver to guarantee a great user experience.
We are currently being externally audited and will be available to demo at Inside Bitcoin tomorrow and Tuesday in New York. You can find us in Toronto in the coming weeks as well! So come say hello!
This isn't easily replicated because you must sign an agreement with Apple saying you want do exactly what we did in order to gain access to this particular protocol. Also the one they provide for their enterprise customers works on mac servers only. I reverse engineered the protocol last summer and it works on linux, allowing us to scale significantly more then one can with an Apple. We reverse engineered it blindly, we ported it to linux and ours is simply better. We also reverse engineered iCloud (you'll like the enhancements / how do the words free and cross platform sound).
Also you almost got it all right but you still are way off on how we install apps ;) When I said this has never been done before I wasn't kidding.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:17:52
they will comply, I can become quite irritating when I need to be. They are better off leaving this alone, but if they don't I still have some tricks up my sleeve.
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:20:21
Windows Phone is a lot of fun, I love that the software by design makes no two the same! It simply lacks content, which isn't a problem in a cross-platform app store. Saves developer's time and provides users with the same apps from anywhere. Currently saving our extra bitcoins to buy one for development, very interested in supporting Cortana :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:54:13
In the future we are entertaining the idea of reimplementing the entire app store as a part of the blockchain. We are not exactly sure how we would do this yet but it is definitely an idea we have been throwing around.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:15:02
Adobe has some pretty amazing stuff out right now, I would really like to partner with them in the future when we start developing you guys an online SDK
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:53:31
Yes and no. These are not like the "web apps" offered through safari. HTML5 is used to render the visuals but the backend is in C. Using protocols intended for enterprise (that they can't take away) we are able to provide access to the hardware, we also have a working version of iCloud. Geolocation, gyroscope, notifications all work as well.
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:16:02
Speaking of Napster! We were initially going to call it Appster in honor of Napster ;)
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:26:47
and also with you
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:07:13
you are correct. Simply put Apple will try and fail because I have been thinking about this for a VERY long time.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:16:06
Hard to shut down, backup plans make shutting this version down pointless because we will use one of two other methods we already have working to guarantee the apps you paid for are still available. The days of their BS are over.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:58:31
we posted an address up on  We really appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:16:31
I really hope I can make your day soon :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:01:23
Thank you! And you are free to ask, I'm waiting on my coding partner to return in order to implement that code. He is in charge of front end development (I'm backend) and I don't want to throw him off! It's affecting my project but Computer Scientist professors tend to be lenient with deadlines if other software is involved :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:44:35
I agree with you own that but we have neutered it to simply function as a store.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:51:06
Agreed. We have been in contact with lawyers for the past two months discussing potential scenarios such as this.
@_date: 2014-04-05 08:01:07
In the future, yes we will publish the details behind our method. We are in the process of filling patents for them at the moment is why I have not gone into more details. On the paying for apps deal, currently we do not have an apps for sale. Also paying for a jailbroken app comes usually comes with the promise that you won't be able to update your phone. Currently we work on every iOS version and always have. I can make you that promise, other then that all I can do is tell you that to the best of my ability I have spent a very long time making sure I avoided "exploits" and jailbreak related things. The code is legal.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:41:11
Would allowing an app on the store that sells drugs put me in a situation where I could face prosecution?
If the answer to this is yes, then my answer to it being allowed in is no.
If the answer to this is no, then my answer to this being allowed in is yes.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:43:52
Thanks for the kind words, we think so too! I use to work for Apple, was even flown out to the mothership in Cupertino. As a part of training we learned about all of the iOS protocols. After I quit I had the idea for a multi-platform store and by knowing everything that was legally possible on the iPhone I was able to figure out how to install apps without having to install apps ;) It took nine months of work and wasn't originally intended for Bitcoin, but after they removed Blockchain from the App Store it seemed like a perfect fit!
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:48:26
we are currently working with a trusted third party to audit our wallet software and plan on releasing soon but not until it is 100% secure.
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:54:12
no problem!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:03:44
This is correct.
Developers will write ONCE and work on iOS, Android and Windows (phone and tablets).
Users will buy ONCE and have their software on all platforms.
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:21:56
yes they can! We are currently reaching out to the major players. We wanted to finish Android support and document the API before contacting them so as to not peak their interest and make them wait.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:08:51
I would do both right now but I am writing a "hand-written recursive descent parser" for class that is due at midnight. Afterwards though I'll modify it to work via a link and then get started on a dogecoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:00:38
We believe that no matter what the existence of BitStore will definitely force industry wide change in the long run.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:50:39
yBitcoin just vouched for us.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:02:32
We were featured on page three of this months issue of yBitcoin ( and their founder has used our store. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:19:08
Apple cannot remove this, I can assure you of that.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:59:17
Ideally by Monday we will be using Pebble Watches as a wallet and Google Glass as a way to scan QR codes from them.
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:40:42
Thanks! As soon as my partner arrives to take the reigns I'll be sure to do all four of those in a row!
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:00:29
No problem!
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:57:41
we just finished the wallet today as an app for the app store but if you'd like I can provide you with a link later tonight (in the early AM) that would allow you to "Add to Home Screen" on iOS.
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:09:23
I was reconfiguring our servers post-heartbleed and then got on an international flight. The website should be up and running now!

Appster is feeling pretty sexy.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:11:59
They cannot, we are actually not breaking any current policies. The certificates are not generated by them. Email tyler and we will get you setup to develop asap. He's out right now but will be back in the morning!
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:32:30

Bitcoin only for now, dev fees have not been decided yet (as of now no), if we do implement them they will be NO WHERE near 30%. Ask away :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:58:22
Thank you very much! :) I was a bit confused as to what that meant!
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:01:03
:) if your a developer please email tyler He should be available tomorrow but I imagine he will have a lot of emails that need responses.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:08:22
Would be interesting to see what they sue me for... Would be quite an embarrassing case for them to lose don't you think?
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:21:13
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:06:14
thanks! The ability to say that is why we spent so much time building a cross platform store :D Write once in any language you like, distribute to everyone, everywhere (and pay with anything)!
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:30:12
I'll definitely give it a shot. Shouldn't be terribly hard. Plus we need one for the store at launch.  is where we are taking emails for early access to the app store by the way.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:51:57
thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:22:44
Please sign up for the beta at  and I will personally get back to you in the not to distant future.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:57:52
Not HTML5 apps in the same sense as the "add to home screen apps," not native binaries like the ones created in Xcode.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:39:02

@_date: 2014-04-05 04:40:57
Haha that doesn't sound terrible! We plan on adding Bitcoin QR codes for pebble watches from our wallet app this weekend. We have a lot in store for you guys ;)
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:49:21
1000% no. That wouldn't have taken 9 months of work, it would have taken 9 hours.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:01:11
some already are ;)
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:13:26
I'd write a jailbreak in that case.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:40:42
we reverse engineered our end of the protocol without signing an agreement with them and use self signed certificates.
Also we are not using the method mentioned int hat article. No one has done this before.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:22:05
One implementation uses MDM ;) but we are not installing Enterprise apps that would have a limit of 200 and break Apples policies. We have two other implementations already coded btw the way. They do not use MDM.
