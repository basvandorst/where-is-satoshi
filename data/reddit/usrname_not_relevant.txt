Crypto "gold" is Monero.

Bitcoin will never swallow up XMRs use case though, and that's okay.  They will make different engineering choices.  Bitcoin will never become private by default and always have an open ledger.  These are design choices to fill different needs/visions.

Yes we do different by opinion, but I don't think by that much.  My point is that those who truly care about or have a large need case for privacy will use the best tools available to them.  Bitcoin's first mover advantage will mean very little to them.  This will likely be Monero, and that's still okay for Bitcoin.  It is not a zero sum game.

Monero cat shows his face.

You're a dumb ass.  
The fact that you say that tells me you're most likely white trash.  Trying to associate yourself with the accomplishment of others in you're 'race', because you yourself have done very little.

You completely misread my post.  I understand that there have been many great advances in recent years.  I was merely giving a hypothetical situation.

Eventually if technology stayed stagnant in coins, we might.  Right now investors are betting that Bitcoin can catch up technologically.

Honest question, I know that BTC has carried the cart for cryptocurrency thus far, but why do you choose BTC or BCH going forward as opposed to an alt built upon arguably superior core technology?  Is it name and brand recognition that you think is still needed for further adoption of cryptocurrency?

Buddy, whether or not you know it you are white trash.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:30:47
For Bitcoin, yes.  For others cryptocurrencies, no.

What coins are you in if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:36:05
Great discussion.  If you would like to talk more, feel free to pm me.  I could share thoughts on this space all day.

Great response, a lot of it I can agree with.  What do you think about coins that are potentially fundamentally different from BTC though, such as Monero.  I was surprised not to see it on your short list honestly, given that you seem to place heavy value on decentralization and community.  Do you have issue with blockchain privacy or fungible currency?

MasterCard already has marketshare too, but we all know how that is likely to end.  The cold truth is that until Bitcoin upgrades its technology so that it is at least on par with the other contenders in the market, it will be vulnerable to losing it's spot.

For a period the market may become destabilized.  ETH did not delete 300m coins, a poorly written smart contract did, but I understand the sentiment.  Honestly, in a year or so I would say Monero, they currently have some of the largest fees, but their fees are inversely proportionate to the block size, which scales dynamically.  So expect a significant reduction as adoption increases.  They can accomplish significant on chain scaling with this, although they would still likely need off chain scaling given their increased tx size due to their robust privacy features.  Until they adopt a solution for this, I see them as a  or at  player given that their niche, privacy, is such a strong use case and they are by far the leaders technologically in that area.  As far as  maybe etheruem, maybe something else.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:28:07
To be honest I need to do more research on etheruem.  Most of my interests have been on BTC, LTC, and XMR.  Personally, I see XMR as the closest thing you can get in crypto to a sure bet at this point.  Their technology, community, and use case are outstanding.  They lead the privacy coin space in all three areas from what I can tell.  If you believe in cryptocurrency's coming mass adoption (which we all do), and if you believe that Monero will be the leading privacy coin in the future (which I personally do), then you arrive to the conclusion that Monero's market cap will be in the trillions of dollars one day.  I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.

Right, but given that this is on r/all, many reading this do not know the differences between cryptocurrencies.

That was the worst argument against having a private police force that I have ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't even think of a worse one if I tried.
