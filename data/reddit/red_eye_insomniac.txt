The problem with making an assumption based on Moore's law these days is that we don't know if we've hit the Power Wall, effectively ending Moore's Law as a statement of truth. AMD and Intel have both stated recently that 20nm Architecture will be the end, no mas, that's the power wall.  Now of course they've thought that we've reached the end of Moore's Law before, but development shows real signs of slowing down. If Moore's Law was still in effect, the transition to 20nm silicon would have taken half the time it has taken.
Just food for thought.

The Government likes to ban a lot of people from doing a lot of things, especially things they can't control. It never quite works out for them. All they succeed in doing is to create a thriving black market they can't tax at all. So really they just wind up fucking themselves over (which is fine with me, fuck em').

I would encourage you to pay off your debt before using your new found money to assume more. A mortgage is a liability, not an asset.
Without any loan payments or credit cards, you might be amazed how quickly you will be able to save enough money to buy a place for cash. That place will be yours free and clear. Even if something catistrophic happens, no bank will be able to come along and seize it, taking away everything you've worked so hard to build.

Never ever ever store Bitcoins in any sizable amount in an online wallet. You are essentially trusting that website to hold onto your private key for you. If you want to keep a larger amount ( more than 1 BTC) in savings learn how to use a paper wallet. Those are as safe as they come.
If you want to buy Bitcoins:
1)The most reliable way would be to do so through some exchange, but the Mt. Gox queue is over 15,000 so it might be a few weeks.
2)You can try [Coinbase]( But you'd be lucky if you got some there, they only sell a set amount every 24 hours.
3)You should try [localbitcoins]( I personally have never used it, but I've read good reports from other redditors. That might be the easiest way you can get some now, while you wait for an exchange to verify you.

There are some major problems with our education system, I agree. The biggest problem I see is that most people don't have the life experience necessary to make an informed decision about what they want to borrow money to study and build a skill set when they are 18. I definately did not. Borrowing $30-50k to become an enigineer is not a bad investment, but too many people wind up with 100k in student debt and a BS in psychology. We need to do a better job preparing our young people to make that decision.
And I'm not going to be like my parents. If my kid thinks he needs to take a year between college and highschool to do some soul searching, (as I wanted to do, but my parents made it clear that was unacceptable), that's fine with me.
Also, now that I'm debt free I'm going to start saving to ensure that my child never has to borrow a single penny to pay for their education.

You're experiencing artifacts because you have your GPU under 100% load and you gave your miner high priority (-f10 lower number means higher priority). It's nothing to worry about as long as your temperatures are steady. If you want to eliminate artifacts while you're using the computer give your miner a lower priority ( I can't give an exact number, but start around 100 and increase in increments of 100 until you're happy) When you aren't using your computer set the priority high again because lowering the priority of your miner will affect your hash rate.

While I agree that I don't feel we need a nod from the government to do what we're doing, I completely disagree that this is any kind of end.

Paypal does not support the sale of Bitcoin in any way, and have gone as far as cancelling transactions they know are related to its distribution. As such, no exchanges are supported by paypal.

There are plenty of ways to keep yourself anonymous while using Bitcoins. Blockchain.info offers a coin tumbling service, which while not fool proof can greatly increase you anonymity. If you tumble your coins and frequently generate new addresses within your wallet you're being a lot more anonymous than a lot of coin users.


You can buy bitcoins off of a trusted seller on localbitcoins. This would not involve a transaction fee, but the seller will likely have his own markup.


A satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC. This is the smallest denomination of BTC currently recognized by the BTC software.


If they are pricing their goods in Fiat then yes, they will probably adjust the price based on the current exchange rate. Current online Bitcoin marketplaces usually price things in fiat, then update the price in Bitcoin on some sort of regular basis. 


That's how a deflationary currency works. I just think of it as the opposite of buying things in fiat. If I pay $3/gallon at noon then by 1pm the U.S. dollar has devalued and lost purchasing power. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:21:38
You can't argue that Bitcoin is a currency without acknowledging that it IS an investment. A currency is a method of transferring and storing wealth. If I live in Brazil and use some of my Reals to buy US dollars, I'm investing in the dollar because I believe the Dollar will hold it's value better than the Real (this is of course a horrible investment, but I'm using it as an example to make a point. Fiat is Fiat, just to a varying degree of uselessness).

How very nihilistic of you. While it's a very compelling argument something tells me Mr. Court System (a.k.a the supreme douches) would disagree with you. Bitcoin has a value because a group of people have come to a consensus of what it is worth based on their own subjective opinion. This is the nature of a free market. Because Bitcoin has a valuation which can be determined in reference to other fiat currencies (based on the aforementioned consensus) they would say "Yes you have received a monetary gain and you owe us taxes on that".

3)Massive buy wall appears at 92.5

You've already proved that you are not capable of responsibly or successfully making money off of day trading. You blew your half of the inheritance, so you had better stop now and give what is left to your sister. I could give two shits if you run yourself into finacial ruin, but blowing your sisters share of the inheritance is probably the most dickish thing I have ever seen. Pull your head out of your ass and do the right thing.

IF BFL ever ships *cough* you would be Hashing at about half the rate of a Jalapeño. If you're not paying for electricity, it wouldn't hurt to do so. But realize that mining 24/7 will put a hell of a load on those GPUs. You will probably find yourself below the average on the mean-time to failure on those. If you don't care about that, go for it.
Also note: If this is in a dorm room at university or the like, there have been people who have put themselves into the hospital from heat stroke because of the Thermal Dissipation of their mining equipment. Be careful.

False, anti-competitive business practices create a closed market, and thus do not allow a free market to thrive. Do not confuse Libertarianism with complete Anarcho-Capitalism. Anti-trust protections are one of the VERY VERY FEW examples of freedom enhancing laws (as opposed to freedom restricting laws).

Simple fact:
If the government is having trouble convincing a large number of people that they need to pay taxes to cover the services they offer, then its obvious that they need to rethink the type/quantity of services they are offering. If they have to threaten a significant portion of tax payers with jail time so that they can continue to offer more services, they have outlived their usefulness.

Running Bitcoin-QT with port 8333 open on you firewall allows your computer to act as Bitcoin node. While this a generous act giving back to the community, it is not necessary in order to create or recieve transactions on the network. Clients such as electrum allow you to have a fully functional wallet without downloading the entire blockchain. As the size of the network grows, clients such as these will become much more important to facilitate the average persons interaction with Bitcoin. The number of computers acting as full nodes will be few compared to today, but will be adequate in number to run the network.

Person asks this question a month ago = Very in depth detailed answer that is about a solid paragraph or two
Person asks this question a week ago = Two maybe three sentence answer to the question, then refering the OP to the FAQ
Person asks this question today = Two words
Person asks this question a week from now = &lt;BANNED&gt;

The early adopters assumed a majority of the risk. I invested $100 back when Bitcoin was worth almost nothing. At that point it was entirely possible that bitcoin could collapse and I could never see that money ever again. However because I was willing to assume that risk I contributed to the future success of the currency and helped bring it into wider adoption. Because I assumed risk, I am now being compensated. As Bitcoin grows, I have incentive to sell and diversify my investment. Bitcoin WILL distribute to more hands. If you don't believe this, you don't believe in free markets, so off to some collectivist society with you then.

Negative, bitcoins are infinitely divisible. If people hoarded coins to the point where there was only 1BTC in true circulation that would be plenty. In other words it is impossible to manipulate the system that way.

This. It was designed to create scarcity. When the first satoshi was created, it theoretically had a paper value of zero. The slow release system was designed so that:
1)Very very early adopters could give coins in existence more perceived value.
2)These early adopters would have a reason to mine and support the network.
3)The value would be more stable as the network grew.
