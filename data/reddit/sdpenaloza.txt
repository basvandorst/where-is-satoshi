Welcome :D Recently bought my 1st coin too =),  I know the feeling lol.

It was really meant for tipping and as you said micro-transactions.   Attempting to introduce inflation to keep the value at a stable level that would allow for adoption for small transactions (every day purchases).
As you can imagine the balance is pretty difficult and since its a small enough community it teeters very often between a balance of rewards for the miners and the want to remain a smaller denomination.
Why smaller denomination? because it gives the sense of allowing people to give anything they can than feeling there is a minimum amount to give without feeling obligated.  dogecoin was trying to be the like button with some monetary value involved.
The hardcap and softcap debate can be debated till both sides faces go blue though.  If your aiming for value growth hardcap is definitely something to strive for, if you go softcap your really aiming for a self perpetuating stability (but that's pretty hard to do as we see even with FIAT)

 ya and apparently took the money and ran too... at least according to this post...
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:06:24
as has mentioned it could actually effect an account of any age if there was a transaction during the window of time the vulnerability was running around.
I'd just move btc to a more secure alternative because its still unknown how widely this security fallout can reach.

Or see it as currency so we can pay taxes like any other currency with out having to log capital gains on my coffee I bought this morning... Its not tax evasion its called trying to see bitcoin and all crypto as a currency whether old money likes it or not.

yup =/  as soon as they started ignoring any updates in "negotiations" for zenpool I started liquidating my whole stock of zens and primes (was one of the people who exchanged zencloud hosted equipment for hashlets so didn't loose anything).
Hashcoin just made me make it even more pressing to get out quickly.
After seeing people getting stuck on manual approval for withdrawls I was like "oh boy"  only thing i learnt from what people are saying which disappeared quickly was to withdrawl less than 10 BTC a day to avoid triggering manual review (since manual review could take days to approve unless you find a support rep that actually is helpful).
Its part of the reason i think people are still so cult like in the forums some are genuinely in denial, some are trying to appease GAW so they don't happen to "fall through the cracks" on withdrawl approval. -_-
Tickets for manual withdraw are resolved but almost like its random...and the higher your withdraw request it seems the harder it is to get it out of zencloud also it seems the more you cause a problem the more it seems your push back on the list... (usually with an apology and then saying we will look into it then support goes *poof*)
That was my personal experience for gaw before hashcoin was completely announced. (pre-anouncement of hashcoin)

Cloud mining in general isn't ridiculous, the problem is that cloud mining is very easy to scam as there are very few ways to confirm that there are actual machines mining.
Sure you can have a picture (but is it really theirs or even mining for your account).
Sure they can have receipts investing into datacenters and mining equipment but again is it actually mining for the customers. 
Could show hashing power in a pool that shows the cloud mining provider mining, but then again is that really mining customers coins.
And ultimately how old is the company...cloud mining is very new so there isn't a long term security of it being around.
Sadly, all these bad actors will just hurt cloud mining as a whole (just as much as failed exchanges has hurt cryptocurrency exchanges).
I believe cloud mining can be possible but its gonna be hard to filter the bad guys from genuine legitimate companies.  (only one I can think of that I would trust is CEX.io and you are pretty much paying them to mine bitcoins....)

At this point realizing transactions causes this issue (if there was a transaction during the time window) and it could lead to generating new addresses with the same problem, its best to move all your bitcoins from BCI. (the process for asking for password and identifier through email to recover funds from an effected account just makes me wonder if BCI still hasnt consider their security practices)

You do look at the background of everyone on the thread which already shows you have dedication to this community.  I'd say toss your hat in the ring, couldn't hurt.

maybe putting that set up in a datacenter would be one way....
in a more realistic sense though, fire suppression system (more info here:  and some means to make sure the rigs weren't overloading existing electrical infrastructure.
on the highest level anyways (you could do a whole class on proper white papers to get to running a properly certified data center lol &gt;.&lt;) 
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:21:34
I wouldn't doubt that BCI themselves might consider a rebranding after this or at least a closer look at their security operations.
Johoe definely saved many people, and that was purely by luck that Johoe didn't have malicious intent.  Only time will tell but you can already see many many people are screaming for alternatives which I doubt BCI can ignore in the long run.

Paypal is known to always side with the customer they will just chargeback and take the bitcoin and the money they paid ya.

I believe mostly spotty usb cable,  the one I received worked for the most part granted 1 occasion my computer wouldn't recognize the trezor.  In the end getting good micro-usb to USB cable is very easy and cheap so if there is any issue with trezor not responding to the computer would assume the cable is at fault.

It should be only addresses that were generated about a week ago according to this post by BCI:




would use caution with BCI though and wouldn't hold all your bitcoins in BCI just because it seems BCI has questionable security practices. 
If you want to remain using BCI its at a risk and would recommend at least using 2FA if not done so already.  (would recommend a multisig wallet, cold storage or hardware wallet option though)
Edit: has mentioned that transactions as well during that time window can effect your account, I missed that fact, I'd move your bitcoin to a safer alternative ASAP.  BCI has basically been using questionable security procedures as of late.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:19:13
Even if paypal did I'd stay with coinbase, paypal has taken such a anti-crypto stance for so long they probably freeze your account for taking 1/100 of a bitcoin =P.
I can't wait for stripe though =)
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:17:33
Its true there is a very high chance of scamming in cloud mining due to the idea that its almost impossible to prove legitimacy (besides just not folding for a long period of time)  it is possible.  CEX.IO has proven it can be possible to have a legitimate cloud mining service.  
ROI is a completely different topic though and it is very hard to make a profit off cloud mining.
In terms of the article though, since the target of the article is for people getting into bitcoin or cryptocurrency they would need guidance that doesn't lead them to potential scams or potential avoidable high risks (besides obvious price movements).  First impression is important and being scammed right off the bat isn't going to help bitcoin or the crypto community.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:28:38
People want to win and will sometimes past reasoning to get there.  In the end people want to believe and hope, and hope is really hard for people to give up on,  specially if a community is all positive about it.

The .com herd was a notorious case study of the herd behavior (which lead to the dot-com bubble), if interested.

Man completely missed the part of a transaction in that time period can always make the wallet vulnerable... good catch.  Ya very strong recommendation now to just move away from BCI this is before seeing this morning.
- BCI is asking for identifier and password through e-mail instead of secured form (could make customers phising targets or have their e-mail intercepted and have their BTC claimed by someone else)
- and this  which could be even more cause of concern for how far reaching this security fallout could of gotten...

Which I forwarded to after realization of two same topic subreddits existed
I publicly admitted I trade in dogecoin and bitcoin (along with vertcoin),  I don't see how this is relevant however as I don't antagonize bitcoin members.  All coins co-exist for a purpose is my belief

Ah the snowden approach, pretty much yup I agree here lol.

Johoe is a white hat hacker that is known for saving hundreds of BTC after a lapse of security for blockchain.info's wallets (he returned it to blockchain to give back to the people who would have lost it otherwise, saved blockchain from having to reimburse the lost BTC out of pocket).
From what i can see in bitcoin talk since that event johoe is still able to sweep from blockchain accounts who are using "reused R values (reused random values)" which have known private keys to the public. (**edit2**: Johoe: **I can assure you that there were no massive new weak signatures appearing.   Instead I managed to analyze the broken RNG and produced the same "random" numbers again.**)
Basically safest bet is to move your BTC to cold storage or multisig wallets (greenaddress.it) or even hardware wallets (trezor).
Also...Johoe is a BTC hero ;).
Edit2: Thanks !  :  from johoe

Hello, Would be interested in this position.  Besides the requirements mentioned anything else required?
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:15:37
At the moment i believe he mentioned that it is already known and he was actively scanning because it was common knowledge (that if they are reusing values there is a potential to find out private keys)  To date not sure if any BTC is lost (to a black hat), but anyone who could be effected supposely was contacted via account note from BCI. (BCI i believe figured the time window when it was using reused values to generate private keys).
In the end of the day I am with ya though and would recommend to move to safer alternatives.  (even if this problem is corrected, there is a cause of concern how this situation happen in the first place)
Always people looking for easy money,  so its best to assume that if there is a vulnerability out there there are people trying to figure a way to exploit it or waiting for someone or some service to forget to cover it. (cat and mouse game is 24/7)

Considering they convinced alot of the hashlet owners to get Hashpoints (Used to buy hashcoins) instead of their BTC payouts for 2 weeks I think GAW is making alot from it...
it is considered a "great opportunity" for zencloud customers *facepalm*

Its that time of the week again?
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:46:41
After this week i wouldnt say pick up the pitchforks against blockchain.info, but definitely would put my money elsewhere. Trezor is my number one bet but as mentioned there are alternatives.
Greenaddress.it is pretty good at least for more moderate usage (multisig and oppertunity to use watch only accounts). 
As mentioned there are other hardware wallet options ( Ledger wallet).
I feel at this point blockchain wallets should be short term or pocket change wallets at least till they prove that they are making an effort to improve their security.

yup its understandable that a password would be needed considering how their system is set up.  However the means for asking for the password in many ways baffles security oriented people (as it should).
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:50:48
True :( with the latest news of BCI asking for passwords via email it definely feels that BCI still hasn't embraced a secure policy even after this public event (which could very well been a long occuring issue)
