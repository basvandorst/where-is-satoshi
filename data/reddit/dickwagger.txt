I’m in the negotiation phase of selling one of my properties for bitcoin. I have been told about the $10k a day limit but was also told something about both parties going through someone like Genesis (if I recall correctly) to help aid in expediting the sell and the coin to fiat process. Are you familiar with this? It’s a multimillion dollar deal and my plan is to keep much of it in bitcoin.But I also want to exchange it to USD to make improvements to my other properties. 
Thanks for any help/suggestions

Have you dealt with them? A previous comment of mine was along the lines of I am in the process of selling a property for bitcoin. It’s a multimillion dollar deal and someone mentioned Gemini and that they can handle something like that. 
If you aren’t familiar with transactions like these (and then exchanging the btc to fiat asap) do you know anybody that has?

I am in the negotiation stage of selling a property of mine for bitcoin. I would then like to liquidate (monetize??) some of the bitcoins to make improvements to my other properties.
How difficult/easy of a process is it? How long does it take?
Anyone here have any experience similar to this? 
Thanks much in advance for your input/help.

Ok, thanks much!

Is it plausible for a country to completely adopt crypto as its currency? Let's say a major G8 country does this and if my country wants to trade with them we would have to accept this mode of transaction, no? I know my Cup O' Innocence runneth over but it's a serious question because no matter what anyone says, the world economy is going more and more toward crypto.

Ok thanks. That makes sense.

I am currently selling a property of mine for bitcoin. I’m very new to this but my money manager isn’t. How is your process going? I want to cash out on some of the bitcoin and make improvements on another property but I am wholly ignorant on the monetization of bitcoin. How fast is the process, etc.?
Thank you very much for any info/help.

Wait, so if I ask you to put my $100 in your safe, and you charge me $1 a month for services, are you saying that the $100 is now your's? I don't understand your logic. 
Banks constantly abuse and push the limits all the time.

What does anonymous coin do, what is it, and where to get it? I am so very ignorant on this subject so please forgive me. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with links or something so I could read up on it. Thank you very much in advance.

Thank you for responding. This property is located on the lake by the Panama Canal and another property on the Carribean. Do you think these properties would be attractive enough to owners of Bitcoin? They are completely titled with almost 100 year old titles.

Edit: After successfully selling the properties for Bitcoin, would it be very difficult to exchange Bitcoin for US Dollars? How long would it take?
Thanks much

Well, of course they will succeed. It sucks that this is the case. This interference is one of the main reasons why a "black market" happens with many products (imo). However, I think this currency and its type will always be one or two steps ahead of any real interference. The mechanism by which it is traded is just too difficult to totally control.

Being very ignorant in the subject of crypto currencies (sp), once the world is all digital won't it be easier to manipulate? Sorry for the stupid question. Very new to this.

"...Almost every day for five years, they used a private electronic chat room to manipulate the exchange rate between euros and dollars using coded language to conceal their collusion..."
They got a $5b slap on the wrist penalty. If anybody tried to do this they'd in jail. And you know things haven't gotten any more honest and transparent there.
