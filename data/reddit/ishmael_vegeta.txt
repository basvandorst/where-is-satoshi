the fact that this nonsense is upvoted speaks volumes about the users of this sub.
the upside is all of the idiots in the market means it is easier to make money.

investors and traders are not so dumb as people on think they are.
if there is a huge premium between bitcoin and a correlated etf, people will arb out the difference. this will mean the ETF can affect bitcoin.
all that matters is the correlation. whether it is based on futures settled in cash or not is not that relevant. the bitcoin futures could be settled in cattle and it would still affect the underlying.

they are a bunch of lunatics.
minke whales are not even threatened or endangered. 
they endanger sailors lives by nearly killing everyone by crashing into other ships.
They should all be in prison.
Attacking vessels at sea is called piracy.
anyway they have failed in their goal because they decided to stop going after japanese ships after japan made new laws classify them as terrorists and threatened to send military vessels to escort the whalers.
id like to see them attack a destroyer, then they can swim with the fish on the bottom of the ocean.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:18:39
no, because no one is going to sell you 1 billion worth of btc futures without having hedged with close to 1 billion worth of btc.
otherwise it would be so easily to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:22:40
they are pirates

The CME makes money on transaction fees. they would not be losing money on shorts.

spend your money on a business instead.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:21
people will arbitrage between spot and the futures if the premium is sufficient. the net effect is definitely not "0".
the futures have no liquidity and the margin is like 30%. theres only 700 contracts traded a day. that is why they are not affecting the price.
Do you think derivatives dont affect the underlying price or something?

high bandwidth sure.
don't forget that shipping a 1 TB harddrive across the country in 2 days is pretty high bandwidth. ~20MB/s

why are you owed internet access for making a poor decision on choosing where to live?
Can I live in the middle of the ocean and complain that there are no services there? well, yes I can, but not many will feel sorry for me and I do not represent enough of the market to make it worthwhile for companies to expand to there.
I will go farther and say that you aren't owed internet access at all. The reason you can get it is because some group of people decided that they would be happy to provide it to you and many others for a fee.
This is what I meant by ISPs being treated like individuals. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:19:45
The ISP is doing what almost anyone would do, it has little choice in the matter. In fact if they didn't charge as much as they could, I would consider them stupid. The ones who take most of the blame are the hypocrites, imbeciles, and liars, the buffoons in power who cannot leave one thing untainted from their touch. It is for your safety of course.

@_date: 2015-01-18 22:08:59
yes, but this seems like a parasite for BTC.
a separate blockchain would be better no? although it requires incentive, but I'm not sure so much is needed. The currency would not need to have much store of value in order to be useful.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:05:31
opportunity cost brah
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:43:46
there could be blocks and a certain number of transactions included in each block. the transaction fee must be high enough in order for your transaction to be included. This will reduce spam.
something like that I imagine would work. Doing this on the bitcoin blockchain would raise transaction fees and I'm not sure is really beneficial. though I may be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:25:06

anyway im pretty sure he either lost reserves or never had them or both. or was subject to some outside hacker/attacker.
i doubt he stole the coins, he just doesn't fit the bill.
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:32:46
i would say it is voluntary.

sell $1000 worth and keep the rest. that way you wont feel so bad if the price crashes more.

@_date: 2015-01-06 09:25:54
this only works because the tumblers are not very sophisticated.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:57:29
this is why you lose all your money.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:31:23
yes, don't start a bitcoin service the day it crashes.
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:11:15
you shouldn't support net neutrality regardless.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:37:37
yes, there is no place for government. government is inefficient and only rules by force.
ISPs should be free to charge whatever prices they wish for whatever they want. The problem is government the whole way down, the reason there are so few ISPs is because the government grants a monopoly to companies.
There is no difference between an ISP and an individual.
Net neutrality will be one more useless regulation that only serves to keep the big boys in power and prevent competition from arising.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:18:59
I thought this was Ross's statement for a second, god damn that would have been hilarious.

i don't think you understand, we are fanatics. you have to be a crazy libertarian to do this and this is why crazy libertarians will rule the world.
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:25:21
it would make a difference, but I don't think it would be life changing. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:14:03
no and it's for the same reason that socialism is dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:17:53
god, I haven't thought of that. that's a great way to view it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:44:50
im sorry you need the government to tell you how to behave
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:10:31
those who downvote are the same ones who will complain when only a few % own bitcoins when the price is higher.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:38:35

i would also give almost anything to go back in time and short Enron
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:41:56
yes that is what im talking about. the only thing you should expect to get. and i expect that enjoyment does not increase linearly as you buy more.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:43:50
no i probably wouldnt buy it. for example you'd be better off gambling at the casino.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:13:23


lol no. not even close.
the only reason to play is if you get value out of buying the ticket. but i wouldnt encourage dumb hopes like that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:18:11
once CME futures are released you could buy/sell futures.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:57
its going to affect demand, because people will buy the coin to offset the futures.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:48
lol, only to noobs who dont trade futures.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:54
ive never heard of anybody trading nasdaq futures. people are mixing up the stock exchange and futures exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:36
lol rekt
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:34:36
people were killed because that was the status quo back then.
anyway, if you want to get in this pissing game, governments have killed far more.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:42:46
it absolutely affects btc.
when people buy contracts they short sell bitcoin to hedge and so on.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:44:51
no this is not how it works.
if there is a  difference between futures and spot price people will buy/sell the future and buy/sell the coin.
the prices will be kept in line to a degree depending on the interest rate and other fundamental factors.
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:48:17
Lol. Democracy

you are dumb
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:18:25


its dumb socialist crap peddled by google and netflix in order to further their agendas. dont be so naive.
companies should be free to discriminate traffic all they want. otherwise you are going to end up with inefficient systems. if they violate an agreement with you then sue them. 
this is all besides the point that ISPs do not have any interest in blocking bitcoin traffic and it would not be feasible anyway if precautionary measures were taken.

@_date: 2015-10-24 03:43:32
they cannot break any reasonable encryption scheme through bruteforce.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:27:19
lol, this is not brute forcing an encrypted device.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:07:53
the same is happening in the US.

yea i didnt read the article
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:04:07
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:12:46
i dont care about what people generally do. they still cant crack anything decent. and they are mad.
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:53:11


they cannot.
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:56:59
it will take like 5 minutes to patch that. lol.
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:51:04
you are a joke.
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:55:06
so the problem is credit cards?
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:25:00
What if you just bend space?
Anyway I would never make such an absolute claim like that.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:10:24
bitcoin will destroy the state in time to set him free!
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:39:27
it's really just a protocol.
that code on there is mostly for the desktop application.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:58:08
I consider it more ethical to launder money than not. Taxes contribute towards the existence of the state.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:49:31
i wish i could tweet stupid shit and have millions of people gobble it up like it is gospel.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:08:09
i hope to break your law every chance I get.
eat shit and die.
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:51:04
it's slowly happening.
valve is supporting it and Unreal 4 has support and I think some big EA or Ubisoft game had linux support, maybe metro 2033. Anyway, it is much better than it used to be.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:52:59
yea and i have a 100 BTC bounty if you can break RSA...
anyway it will likely be a side channel attack. I expect they expect the same.
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:51:33
yes, so?
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:53:09
just tell them to use bitcoin for their hidden funds. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:46:30
it stopped dealer to customer violence.
@_date: 2015-02-09 07:31:57
yes, but my point is that in this battle, bitcoin is beating out credit cards.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:05:57
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:37:25
