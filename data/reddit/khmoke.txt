Bitcoin can replace gold as a store of value, but nothing can replace bitcoin. That's because bitcoin is technically superior to gold, but I lack the ability to apply that argument iteratively. QED

It's certainly implied by your post, what was a store of value before bitcoin? How did bitcoin become a store of value in the first place without destroying the value of gold according to your logic? Or conversely, why can't there be other crypto with a higher market cap than bitcoin (which would make them "top dog")?

Why not adopt the ETH PoW algorithm?
It seems to be ASIC resistant and real world tested.

What I've gathered from reading is that bitcoin is a good store of value. It was never meant for things like buying coffee among other things that people might find useful.  
Bitcoin has value because it is the first currency with limited supply and out of the control of central banks and governments. You're supposed to hold your bitcoin until we reach an ancap utopia. Once there we won't have these silly divisions in the bitcoin community. Our private child armies will have long since wiped out the big blockers and other alt coin pumpers. Think about it, what are they going to do? No private security company would ever accept an alt coin as payment.

Did the ETF get approved?
Is the scaling debate over? who won?

As a neutral observer who doesn't own or mine bitcoin, though I used to do both, this sub looks like it's leading the effort to derail bitcoin and pump alts. 
I come here for the comedy, like I enjoy watching the 49ers play football since they fired Harbaugh. It's funny watching clueless people destroy a good thing with an awesome combination of ego, arrogance, and hubris.

I made a good chunk in 2013/2014, but I got rich from the ETH pre-sale.

Dagger-Hashimoto is ASIC resistant and seems to be working pretty well for ETH:
As it's already being used in the real world maybe BTC can adopt it.

Not on this sub. Good luck finding an impartial source.

There is no miner shortage. The miners create blocks, however the blocks are only 1Mb, so once it's full, that's it, you have to wait 10 minutes to put more transactions on the next block. To process more transactions you either need to increase the blocksize or reduce the time between blocks. This involves trade offs I won't get into here due to the number of toxic people involved with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:31:05
It's bizarre, almost as if people are incorporating some sort of future expectations of their value into their calculus. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:08:39
bitcoin as a whole produces 1 block of 1Mb every 10 minutes. that is the same whether there are only 1 or 1,000,000 miners. Each miner can choose which transactions to include, but they can only include 1Mb. And only 1 block from among all of the miners candidate blocks is accepted as the next block in the bitcoin blockchain. 
So no, 5,000 transactions takes the same amount of time to process on the bitcoin blockchain regardless of the number of miners. There is no parallel processing as each miner is computing roughly the same thing and only 1 candidate block is accepted each 10 minutes.

&lt; 1% BTC, 1% DASH, and 99% ETH. 
I didn't plan this allocation, ETH just went up a shitload and I never sold. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:10:08
Could, but won't. Bitcoin development is stalled. I don't enjoy watching it either. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:12:05
Amount of value paid to miners. 5 eth every few seconds is more money than the BTC block reward in 10 minutes.

I split my bitcoin 50/50 with ETH back at the ETH presale in 2014. My 20 BTC has doubled in value since then which is great. My 40,000 ETH that i purchased for 20 BTC has made me a multimillionaire.

I'm looking forward to switching over to RSK. I made a fortune in ETH, so I'll be one of the few who will be able to afford the transaction fees of running smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin has brand recognition, new users will tend to start there. The altcoin pump is coming from long time bitcoin holders who are hedging or exiting completely because of the scaling issues. 
Another contributing factor is that higher fees make some bitcoin uneconomical to move to an exchange to sell, so supply is slightly reduced.

I think Roger Ver is a saint for sticking around this toxic community as long as he has. I would have left long ago... wait, check that, I did leave long ago.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:10:09
Good luck getting those coins off the exchange. What do you suppose the recommended fee will be to be in one of 4 blocks per day?
One coin will still be useful for DNM purchases. That one will be valuable.

Things do seem to go easier when you have a Linus Torvalds type leading your open source project.

Which half is bitcoin?

How do you calculate this premium?
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:59:28
Or it means they prefer EC, but prefer even more to not get DDOS'd by core supporters.
