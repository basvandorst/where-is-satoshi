So every item will cost at least 1$...?

 But what if your usd/eur wallet is 0,00 and everything is in BTC? I would not know how CB would be able to reimburse you if they would tank? And if they could, what value would that be?

What if:
A very large number of coinbase users decide to cash out? Woule this be the end of the service (like a bank run?) Or does it have the funds to cover every customer's balance? (Trying to understand the risks)

what are the delivery times for such cards (belgium)?

After some investigation, it looks like its almost impossible to do it quickly. Most sites are overloaded with accounts.
But I just want to pay anounymous with a credit card. I’ve done it years ago!!

I took the plunge. You should see an order for 25€ worth of LTC... :-)
In all the excitement I forget the amount of LTC would be credited to the wallet. What exchange rate are you using?

So if you are all into crypto's, what then? This would be Billions?

The BTC cards starts from 108$ which is above the amount I want to gift. Interesting concept though, how's that working out for you :)?

This was my initial idea. I'm in the process completing my profile on GDAX, but I'm trying already for a week.
So wondering if there are services where I can just directly can buy BTC onto my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:58:30
That's what I suspected, so you're facing the same problem as everybody else who tries to gift BTC :)
Another questions: how do you asure the customer that you don't hold the private keys for the wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:56:29
You can only generate a QR code to request a certain amount. If you're willling to scan it, I'd be fine with that :p

Haha, nono I didn't know Peter before this interview on DataDash ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:35:01
Did not know that. Just thought he has some good points.

Interesting to hear what people think on his take on bitcoin! 
Allthough I'm really excited about bitcoin I found this video extremely interesting and very down to earth. 
Peter is very pleasently to listen to and I must say everything he said made a lot of sense.. Allthough it is not what I want to hear (hodling :-))
