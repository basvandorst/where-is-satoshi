Remember that the strength of Bitcoin is in the protocol not the state of a single client.
To answer just a few:
This is a peer to peer app handling financial transactions against a portable database format. If there weren't a ton of critical sections you should be worried.
Also, OO is not the be all end all of software development.
If you want to look at a more documented and OO approach check out bitcoinj.

Lets see if I can get them all:
*So i can replace the wallet.dat on any pc with my backed up wallet and my balance will show?*
Yes. You should stop bitcoin first though.
*Right now my client shows no balance, what is the best way to transfer funds from my backed up wallet to my client for immediate use?*
If you have a wallet with no money in it and a backed up one that does you should probably just use the wallet you backed up instead.
If you want to transfer money from the old wallet to the new wallet you can write down the address from the new wallet then backup/copy it somewhere. Launch bitcoin with your old wallet and send to the address you wrote down. Then back them both up.
*Can I continue to create new wallet files, back them up, and each will function like a seperate account that i can load into a client every time?*
Yes, just make sure you don't lose track of everything juggling all these wallets. If all you are after is different accounts you can do this with one wallet. Each can contain thousands of addresses and accounts. You can even label them right through the software.
Let me know if that didn't clear it up for you.

Banning and tracing would be two different things.
A newly mined block or newly generated transaction have to originate somewhere. Once they are published to the generator's peers each peer forwards this package on to its peers, etc, until it traverses the entire network. 
In theory you could trace the origin of a transaction or block but you would have to be listening to every node on the network simultaneously to find the first to send.
Blocking would be much easier with the current protocol. Nothing is encrypted and there are only a handful of well defined message formats. If you got every ISP to inspect every packet for bitcoin traffic and drop it you could stop the network. 
The developers would quickly implement ssl and port randomization to get around this.

Encrypting your hard drive won't do much to protect your bitcoin.
Your computer has to be running for the most likely theft scenario which is a virus/network intrusion.

It's just as secure. It does contribute less to the network since you can't verify transactions other than your own but as a non mining node it doesn't matter that much anyway.
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:50:20
There is no compression.
There are a few ways to deal with the size of the block chain... which is several hundred MB at the moment.
The first is transaction pruning. Simply put, once the output of a transaction is spent there is no need for it to be stored or referenced ever again. This frees up enormous amounts of space. It is currently not a feature of the main client because it hasn't become an issue yet.
The second is to operate in simple verification mode ala bitcoinj.
In this mode you only need to store the 80 byte block header which works out to roughly 4.5 MB per year. This means that even if the network was cranking out gigs of transactions per hour you would only need to store 80 bytes every ten minutes.

Most miners use their GPUs and point them toward a mining pool. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:16:49
Bitcoinj runs in simple mode but it is just an api around which other apps can be built. I'd hazard a guess that you will see a full client running in simple mode in less than three months.
@_date: 2011-06-18 00:37:33
There are a bunch of reasons why a transaction won't show up immediately.
One is that it looks like spam. Did you receive a small amount of coin then turn right around and send it again without a transaction fee?
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:14:28
Generating with a CPU will not work any more. It is so unlikely that you would be able to generate a block with a CPU that the option is being removed in the new version of the software.
Mining has moved on to specialized farms of GPUs running in pools sucking down incredible amounts of power.
If you would like to see how long it would take to generate a single block with your CPU you can use this calculator. 
Enter the number of khashes your client is reporting.
If you believe the value of bitcoin is going to rise it is probably a better choice to just buy them.
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:11:27
Not even close.
Paypal will notify you that someone has sent you money relatively quickly. 
How long does it take before that transaction is final and irrevocable? A month, two months, six months? You can pay me with a credit card I'm in the same boat. Sure, the system will say you've paid me but I have no guarantee you won't turn around and charge back as soon as you walk out the door.
Bitcoin transactions propagate extremely fast. I've never had to wait more than a second. This is the equivalent of someone handing me their credit card and it getting approved for the transaction. On average it will be in a block in 5 minutes and the transaction is final (apart from chain reorgs). I don't think there is a financial system on earth that completes faster than that.
@_date: 2011-06-07 22:44:32
Your machine only needs to keep the 80 byte block header if it has no transactions relevant to you. This works out to a constant 4.5 MB per year even with thousands of transactions a minute.

There are a bunch of people waiting to arbitrage between mtgox and tradehill.

The IRC nodes have nothing to do with transactions.
IRC was just the first method used for a new install to find other network nodes. If your client uses IRC bootstrapping it logs in to  with an encoded nick. The nick consists of your ip address, port, and checksum.
By listing the users in the channel your client can decode these names to find other users. 
Unfortunately the IRC channel got overloaded so now the client uses  The client is moving away from IRC and toward DNS peer discovery at the moment.
After you bootstrap to the network transactions are just passed from node to node; they were never sent over IRC.

Your attitude is down right atrocious and reflects poorly on the community, especially those of us who have been around a while.
The problem with a pure livecd is storing the block chain. I certainly wouldn't want to download the whole thing every time I wanted to send a transaction. You are also suggesting people create a new livecd every time an update gets released. Not going to happen.
Keeping the block chain plus the wallet on a stick would work for now but then you are stuck with a livecd + flash drive. Too cumbersome. Also, you will eventually run into storage limits.
You could run the whole thing persistent on a flash drive but then you are right back where you started with any vulnerability getting persisted right back to disk.

The receiving party doesn't have to acknowledge the transaction at all. All bitcoin transactions are one way.
For example, I have a key that has never touched network that sits offline in a secure location that I send money to all the time.
I can check the balance at blockexplorer.com without risking the private key.
Just to be clear: you do not need to run bitcoin at all to receive transactions.
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:41:36
I love your edit!
The funny thing is how many posts by the "deserves what they get" crowd display a basic misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. If they did they would just suggest people generate transactions offline.... which is totally possible though not in the client right now.
Luckily the core devs do not share the attitudes of teen and twenty somethings stuck in their 
parent's basements.
Wallet encryption is coming. Bitcoin just got too much attention too fast.
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:06:34
Agreed. 
This is why I won't personally worry about storing the whole chain until it becomes prohibitively expensive.

Lets say I place cups face down in a room. Under one of them I place a ball.
I tell you that every time you find a ball under a cup I will pay you a dollar. I know that it takes you 1 second to check each cup. I only want to pay you for every 5 minutes you work so I place 600 cups. (On average you have to check half the cups.) Also, I'm not going to watch you do this. Not watching you is the important part.
For a day or so you set about dutifully checking the cups. Sometimes you find the ball in the first few cups. Sometimes its in the last few. I keep a running average of how often I pay you and it still averages out to 5 minutes.
One day you get smart and get a friend to come help you. Now you can check the cups twice as fast and get paid twice as often. I'm not watching so you think there's no way I'll find out. However, since I'm tracking how often I pay you I notice I'm starting to give you a dollar every two and half minutes. 
I don't know whether you have gotten twice as fast at checking cups maybe you have a friend helping, or even two friends who both work half as fast as you do. 
I only want to pay you every 5 minutes but now I'm running out of money twice as fast as I should be. 
I fix this by putting out 1200 cups next time you walk in to the room. Now you all have to work just as hard to get the same payout as before. 
Add more people and I'll just keep adding cups.
The number of cups in this scenario is the difficulty factor.

About the 100 transaction thing:
When you spend money you are really spending the output of other transactions. Each can only be spent once.
Lets say your key can spend the following transaction outputs and their associated values:
TA: 0.50
TB: 0.50
TC: 0.50
TD: 0.50
If you want to spend 1.20 you need to spend three of these completely so you generate a transaction that bundles up TA, TB, and TC. The transaction will have two outputs: one for 1.20 to the address you entered and 0.30 to another key that you own.
In the initial releases this key was generated on the fly and saved to your wallet. Back then if you deleted your wallet right after this transaction and restored a backup the key that your "change" was sent to would not exist. This is why it is suggested to back up your wallet after every transaction.
In later releases the wallet pregenerates 100 keys although there was a bug with this as indicated in the posts you linked. The goal was that the change would be sent back to one of these pregenerated keys that probably exist in your backup already. IMO its still a good idea to back up your wallet after every transaction.
@_date: 2011-06-10 18:33:46
When you a hash a block you don't hash over the entire thing you only hash over an 80 byte header that is derived from the rest of the data. 
The pooling server creates a block which pays an address it has control over 50 bitcoins. However, it does not distribute the entire block to the mining clients... only the header. When a client has a successful hash it then passes back the nonce that created it and it is then inserted into the block and pushed out. 
Having tracked the proportion of work each client mined the server then divides the 50 bitcoins proportionally between the contributors accounts at a later date.
The mining pool does know which client solved the hash, however, this information just trivia and does not effect the payouts proportionate to the number of hashes contributed.

Confirmations and the block chain are only there to solve one problem: double spends.
When someone floats a transaction on the network you will see it immediately. The software also verifies the transaction as valid immediately or it would be rejected out of hand. If someone sends you a transaction and you have no reason to believe they are trying to do an immediate double spend then the transaction is rock solid and there is no need to wait for confirmations.

I don't think there are problems with the model just with the maturity of the main client.
As a matter of fact there are possibilities that alleviate some of these issues such as transactions that require two keys.
People have been complaining for a long time about storing keys in plain text and I think its a shame that it has't been addressed yet. People retort that a key logger will defeat this but IMO that is an order of magnitude less likely of an attack than finding a stray wallet backup.

Bitcoin keys don't have balances, they allow you to "unlock" the output of previous transactions. 
If someone sends your address (Addr1) some bitcoin somewhere in the block chain there is a transaction with an output your key can unlock. Lets say Addr1 can unlock TXOutA and TXOutA has a value of 1.00.
When you want to spend some of that 1.00 you send it as the input to a new transaction (TXB). 
The catch is you have to spend the whole 1.00 since you can only spend an output once. If you were sending 0.70 to AddrB your transaction has two outputs: TXOutB.1 for 0.70 and TXOutB.2 for 0.30. TXOutB.2 would be locked to some other key you own or even right back to the key that sent it.
Now that TXOutA is spent it can be pruned from the block chain and the storage space reclaimed. It never needs to be referenced again. You'd want to wait a while though in case there is a chain reorg.
You can also run in simple verification mode which is just as secure and only stores the 80 byte block headers and transactions relevant to you. This works out to ~4.5 MB a year even at millions of transactions a minute.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:38:50
I resent this.
@_date: 2011-06-13 11:32:43
It could be. 
This is how it works:
As each block comes in the transactions it contains are scanned for outputs that target one of the keys you own. If none are found it tosses all but the 80 byte header. The header itself contains enough information to verify its validity as proof of work and its place in the chain. If a transaction in the block applies to one of your keys it is placed in your wallet so it can be spent at a later time.
One of the downsides to simple mode is adding a key you have previously used after downloading the block chain. If you generate a new key you can be sure that no transactions have occurred that target it.
 However, if you import a key that you had backed up somewhere there is no way to go back through the chain locally and find its "balance" since you have thrown all the transaction info out. In the full client you can do a rescan to have it go back through and check all transactions. To find an old key's balance you would need to re-download the block chain.
Its not a bad trade off and there are ways around it if there is a full node you trust.
Its important to note that even in simple mode you explicitly do not trust the network just as in full mode. The 80 bytes is sufficient to protect yourself from a single node trying to lie to you.
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:07:20
You're right. Misread it.
@_date: 2011-06-18 00:11:33
The only thing a block is for is to prevent double spends. As soon as a transaction hits the network you are capable of verifying the owner sent you money and has the funds to back it. The only threat at this point is that there is a duplicate transaction out there that hasn't propagated to you. 
If you have no reason to suspect this than proceed depending on the size of the transaction.
There is no system financial system that completes faster than bitcoin. And by complete I mean final and irrevocable. Even stock market trades get reversed sometimes. When you cash a check I believe it can be reversed something like six months later and we all know the problems with credit cards.

@_date: 2011-06-17 12:07:48
You are correct that this will work.
As a matter of fact you don't even need to use bitcoin to generate the key as they are plain old elliptic curve keys. There are some scripts floating around somewhere that will do it in python or bash without ever touching bitcoin. They even apply the base58 and checksum to the public key for the funny looking address.

There is a big difference in what is necessary to get access to files on a computer and executing code on said computer.
I wouldn't put it past someone to exploit a hole in something to gain access to the linux machine I'm typing this from. I would be impressed if they managed to get a key logger on here.
A misapplied right on a file is enough to allow access to a wallet in another users directory. Getting a key logger installed without admin rights is another trick entirely.

Unless you are a miner you don't need the ledger to tell if someone is double spending. The block header is good enough after it has been built upon by a few other blocks. 
Here's a hypothetical that might explain it better.  If Y is the number of blocks at which you think an attacker could not reverse the block chain then lets say block X contains what you consider to be a double spend.
The rest of the network (51+%) doesn't however so it keeps building on the block you think is incorrect. At X+Y it doesn't matter what you think. The network has declared it not a double spend.
 Perhaps it was and it was the copy you have of the tx that was declared a double spend. It doesn't matter though. If you treat it differently you will end up forking to your own chain which will just end up with nothing you do being thought of as valid by the rest of the network.
@_date: 2011-06-12 15:07:55
You can do this with about 5 minutes of work on the source code.
All you have to do is change the genesis block and the port.
As a matter of fact its already been done. Its called the bitcoin Testnet.
You can use your CPU to mine on Testnet and generate ~200 coins today. Nobody values them though because there is relatively little computing power behind the network. If even a fraction of one of the pools turned there attention to Testnet it could reek all sorts of havoc: rolled back transactions, double spending, etc. Sometimes people do turn their GPU miners on Testnet and thats exactly what happens.
Because of the lack of stability of the network no one values the testnet coins. This is exactly the problem any new implementation would face. You need a critical mass of computing power securing the network before you have any value... but you need value to gain a critical mass of computing power.
Any new implementation would need to be valued on a new set of rules. Namecoin is one example of how this can be accomplished.

10 minutes was picked because that was the estimated worst case propagation time in a very large network. Since the chains stack on top of each other you can't pick a value so low that they couldn't propagate before the next one is solved.
Imagine if you could solve one every 5 seconds. Block solving would cluster in one piece of the network (the fastest) and never leave. Miners in slower parts of the network wouldn't have a a shot because the next block would be solved before they even saw the new one.
