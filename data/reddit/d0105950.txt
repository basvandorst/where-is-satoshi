Contrary to you, I got PayPal scammed (internationally, actually) and just called the police in Canada. Got my money right back after daddy found out. It just took a while.

As believing of a person as I am, I'm going to have to go with hindsight bias here. There's just such little chance of anyone (not calling you specifically out) thinking, "Huh. Maybe this guy will put malware on this site."

Interesting development.
I've been playing Devil's Advocate, mainly because I believe you're innocent. Changing the source code page is pretty much going above and beyond for not knowing this new owner was a, well, royal cunt.
Thanks for your website, it's a pretty fun one.

Let me continue.
You sell your moderately successful website, ListenToBitcoin. You're known on the reddit community as the owner. Be completely honest, would you put something on the website that says "Under New Management" or something?
In hindsight, it's a great idea, right? But you probably wouldn't think of it in the first place, because you wouldn't expect this guy to use your site to infect computers with malware.

Let me play Devil's Advocate here. What if you had a mildly successful website and someone offers to buy it for an amount of money that you like based on the site's popularity, and you sold it. Then he puts malware on the site. How is that your fault?
