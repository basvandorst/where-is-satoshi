I've been saying this for the longest time. The only real practical use I see for Bitcoin is transactions with no paper trail...you know like the reason Bitcoin got popular in the first place. Something the layman would never need to do.

People treat Bitcoin as a stock and not a currency. And then they get mad and say "it's not a stock!".

I would be willing to put money on the fact that most people who go about and scream HODL also have less than $1000 in bitcoin. There are people out there who actually put serious money into it, not just $100 and a dream.

That's why I said "stock". Most people don't understand Bitcoin and just see it as an investment. My 70 year old grandma has money in Bitcoin and she has no clue what it is other than its a high risk investment with a very good ROI. People talk about how much BTC is going up, but not about its purpose, or its use, or its origin.

Sorry if this didn't make any sense lol. 
That's what I was curious about. I changed it just to be safe because I'm a huge bitch when it comes to stuff like this. Thanks for the reply!

Online poker isn't illegal in my state, it's just that I don't want to give a bunch of random Argentinians my SSN. Is there any downside though to transferring with coin base besides the coins being able to be traced back to me?

Well no shit...People see that a "stock" has raised over 2000% in a year. Of course they're curious. Ask them if they know what the purpose of bitcoin is, or how it originated. Chances are they have no clue what it is other than it's something that randomly went up in price.

You watch Rick and Morty, so I trust you know what you're talking about when it comes to how banks work.

It's people trying to convince themselves that their decisions weren't wrong.

This is what confuses me the most. People who were into BTC before the blowup(drugs, online poker, other DNM purchases) did way more for bitcoin than all these idiots going HODL XD. BTC isn't a stock or share, it's a currency. People need to stop treating it as such and actual use it for it's intention.
If people actually used BTC rather than just sitting on it, maybe the value wouldn't be so swing-y and we would see a consistent increase in price rather than these giant swings going up and down.

The stupidity in this argument is astounding.

You bring up very good points that I never thought about. When I first heard about bitcoin I was like 13 or 14, and at that time it wasn't big at all and it was worth cents/maybe a dollar and the only thing I knew about it was it was mainly used for deep web purchases. Move forward four years I had bought some for that purpose, but never really saw the use outside of it being an anonymous currency.
Now I can really understand why BTC being banned in China is such a big deal as you say. I was assuming your average BTC investor/user was someone in their late 20s/early 30s who looked up the price and threw some money into it, not someone struggling to get by in china/africa who wanted a secure way to store their money. Interesting insight on the currency and I appreciate the reply.

? I really hope what you meant to say was "You can't perform better by saying 'oh wow I've been so unlucky, I'm sure to be lucky this hand!'". If that's not what you meant then you are completely ignorant to poker. Literally the only way to improve at poker is by looking at mistakes you made in previous hands and trying to work them out of your game.

Explain to me how it's not like a stock? Who is actively spending bitcoin as a form of payment? Bitcoin WAS a currency and then it went mainstream and people thought they could get rich if they put their life savings into it. Bitcoin is being treated as an investment, not a currency. People treat stocks as an investment, not a currency. The only difference is there is no business backing bitcoin and it's price is totally up to those who are willing to buy it/take it as payment.

I had no clue that existed. That's way more stores than I would have expected. I wonder how long it will be until bigger online stores will start taking it like Amazon, or bigger corporations like McDonalds.

But there's no discussion in reading an article.

People are delusional if they think BTC will hit 250k. The hype for it is already dying down now that the price is more stable than it's been for the last year or so. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:21:54
Yeah, but that was most likely because of China getting into BTC. It crashed right back down after silkroad got shutdown/seized and all the Chinese whales pulled out. I love bitcoin, but people seem to forget the only use this currency had since it’s creation was illegal/Gray area internet transactions. Why is it going to go to 250K? People are putting money into bitcoin when they don’t understand it. 
I have been using bitcoin for a long time. Just because some dude has money doesn’t make him knowledgeable about bitcoin. He made a good investment which may as well have been gambling. That doesn’t make him knowledgeable. I can go put $200 into some random penny stock. If that stock shoots up to $25 a share, I got lucky. I’m not an expert on the stock market.

BTC was floating around the 100-400 range for years. It wasn't stable, but it wasn't unstable either.
