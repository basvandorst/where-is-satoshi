considering the fact that I just joined not too long ago. I don't see myself getting wealthy because of bitcoin, that's why I am in college.

When I try to buy on the app have a $40 limit. That's absurdly low.

The halving will probably not affect the price much since most people expect the halving to cause the price rise and have already factored that in. 
I think the price will drop after the halving and then continue to slowly rise for the however long.

A wallet is where you store bitcoin. You can't buy bitcoin from a wallet. You can buy them from an exchange like Coinbase and Circle but these services usually require a photo ID. Most exchange provide you with a wallet on the website although it's wise to move your bitcoin off of the exchange website to a wallet that you own.

Maybe, but only if the world adopts bitcoin as it's primary currency. Which isn't going to happen for a long time, if ever.

Your text is pretty ambiguous. What is he doing on his phone? Watching the bitcoin price? What is he asking you for more money? Is it to buy bitcoin? Please clarify.

That's day trading. The general consensus is that you should only day trade if you are experienced at it as it can be very risky. People usually advocate for long term holding of bitcoin rather than day trading. However, I can relate because just like you I think that day trading bitcoin can be very fun but I would suggest that if you really want to day trade bitcoin, stick with low amount for now. You may only be making $1 at a time but at least you are gaining experience and it's better than risking more and end up losing it.

I've heard this before "the difference will be minuscule" and yeah it's true in a sense. But if I expect bitcoin to go up 100x in the future and I want to invest a specific amount of money, then if the price hypothetically increase 100 fold, a $1 difference in price means a $100 difference in profit in the future.

I wouldn't give up. If you are logged into any accounts on the laptop, keep spamming them with reward offers like another user said. Also, watch for you laptop being sold on craigslist or local trader websites. There is one popular in my area called NextechClassifieds. There is also usually a local Buy/Sell/Trade facebook group for each town. Check the trader facebook group for you town and the ones surrounding. 
If you have the serial number or can get the mac address of the laptop from your router maybe the manufacturer can track it. Just make sure you get the mac address soon because my router only saves them for 48 hours then deletes. 
Sorry for your loss and good luck.

Those places are the easiest and most user friendly I would say. 
Circle is instant with higher limits but coinbase lets you use paypal I believe. I'd check both out.
