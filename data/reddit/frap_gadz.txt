From what I've heard the drug markets are really unhappy about what's happened to bitcoin. It's almost becoming useless as a currency, I'm sure they'll be moving on to another lesser known crypto soon just so they can get faster and cheaper transactions again.

If some of the speculations about the balance of the Bitfinex/Tether secret account and potential fractional reserve status of USDT comes true then people are going to get burnt.

Has the issue about the audits been resolved?
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:39:50
Which is worrying, the audit issue really needs to be addressed.
As far as we know they could be insolvent and not have the reserves for USDT. If that was revealed there would be a run on USDT and it would quickly become apparent it is worthless, the whole thing would implode. 
Worse still this could send shockwaves through the rest of the market.

[BoE is actively researching cryptocurrency and blockchain tech]( Although afaik the UK commercial banking sector is not happy about that and has been working against any plans for a BoE backed cryptocurrency.

Is this due to day traders?

This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S! ��������

lol I hope this is a joke.
If that is true then it's beyond thrifty, that's cheap. If I owned a restaurant and a customer *demanded* that shit I'd tell them there will be a charge for storing the bottle for 24 hours.

Yeah, this deal appears good, but you can buy a terraced house in Stoke-On-Trent or Liverpool for like £50-80k in similar areas and these £1 tinned up houses will probably need at least that much capital to bring them up to standard. Lots of them have no roofs (all the lead was ripped off) and have been sitting empty for almost 20 years, the areas they're located in have been almost abandoned. The councils are offloading all their ex-Pathfinder houses since the program was scrapped and getting private people to fix them up. Often these same councils put covenants on the reselling of the properties so you can't recoup any gains, just saying this is not quite the deal it appears.

Fucking A, stocks and bonds are shite at the moment. My portfolio looks fucked, the standout holding which is still performing is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:21:38
The opposite position applies for the bears though, if they're not all out by now.

With the low tx fees and increasing SegWit support is it worth moving BTC from P2SH to Bech32 addresses?
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:07:42
Thanks, if the transaction fee difference between P2SH and Bech32 is likely to remain low then I might just wait untill it's fully adopted.

3 days untill payday, the price will probably skyrocket once I have some spare fiat.
