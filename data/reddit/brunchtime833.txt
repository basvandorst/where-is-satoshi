I dunno man first of all i'm glad they err on the side of caution, and i don't know if i'd really say they're "in trouble" based on this :3

Reading this I'm 99% sure that you're bullshitting.  Interesting read, but VERY hard to believe.  Sorry if I'm wrong here.
Anyway, you get

I think it's also worth noting that one of Schiff's companies (Euro-Pacific Bank) is a payment processor.  You deposit money that's tied to gold and silver, and get a debit card you can use, and when you spend money, they liquidate the gold for you. (for a heinous fee, something like $5000 minimum transaction and a &gt;1% fee just on the transaction)  Not only does bitcoin compete with gold itself, but a frictionless nonfiat payment network competes directly with EuroPac.

Interesting.  Thanks for your replies :)
I won't claim to be at all educated on the interworkings of dark wallet, but even if it works perfectly and is untraceable, i'd imagine it will be a tiny minority who choose to use it.  AND it seems possible that those tools would be made illegal in a post-btc society. (maybe not the right term but you know what i mean)
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:42:48
I agree with everything you say here. I think it's a threat and an opportunity, indeed, but I think they're smart enough to manage the threats.
Worst case, they're hoarding reasonably traceable gold at $1/oz, I'd call that more opportunity than threat
@_date: 2015-01-25 11:14:28
maybe people aren't excited about it ???

ok I think i gotta learn more about stealth addresses because I don't quite understand this
gotta lift now tho bbiab
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:32:31
Reading about stealth addresses now.  My understanding of tumblers is that they make tracking harder, but far from impossible.

I hear you on this but: 
1. The most commonly stated speculation is that SHA-2x algs might be cracked by NSA.  Obviously nobody can confirm/deny this but the fact that nobody in the global community has exposed it suggests to me that there's probably not an easy backdoor but idk
2. Who's to say that they haven't been working on cracking it since inventing sha-x in 2001?  Why don't they have a head start on ASIC development?  And if they control the hashrate, don't they have more power to change up the protocol?  And change the restrictions on supply?
The elusive "they" have controlled money for a long time, why wouldn't they have a plan for the future of money?  I think bitcoin's idealism is inspiring, but a little too storybook great... The bank bailout headline put into the genesis block?  I want to believe, but I also think it's our job to question everything. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:00:42
Yeah i know monero and I know it's the only branch of.... whatever that one stealth coin is.... that's taking off at all.  Really interesting the way it works, quite cool when i heard about it, now i've forgotten it :(
in the end though, nothing's going to be more private than me putting paper in my friend's hand.  
and EVEN if someone could adopt monero or a tor-like technology for FULL anonymity, i'd imagine most people wouldn't!  Still say 80% of the ledger is there for the reading, there's likely lots of information that could be gleaned by keen eyes
Ok man its leg day peace outtie :*
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:43:45
i think monero's cool and might be good for the ol' black market but i doubt it'll ever be huge :/
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:46:50
Hah idk man i'd imagine they get some nice puppets on the tv and say "terror terror drugs children" and then basically (barring a religious objection) they do whatever they want, say, blacklist all addresses linked to anonymity services
I'm sure it's obvious that I'm just spitballing here but I do think it's funny how people are convinced of the limpid goodness of bitcoin.  Like i said, i respect btc's values at its surface BUT it also seems like it could easily be co-opted for the purposes of tyranny.

one time i had issues iwth the coinbase mobile app, i accidentally sold 4 coins whe nI meant to sell two by double tapping a button with fat, twitchy fingers, their support never got back to me, ever ever, it's funny because i still think they'r ethe best hope for bitcoin despite how shady and bad that sorta stuff is
anyway my story peace, please upvote this to publicly pressure them to make things right

Are you a friendless twentysomething in an ocean of malaise?  Do you laugh at people's jokes out of a spineless sense of obligation, rather than finding humor in them?  Do you treat Stefan Molyneux's word as law?
Bitcoin.  Molyneux.  Ancap.  Won't you?
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:23:05
Am I the only one who's not bothered by this?  It's 2015, anyone who expects anonymity through a computer is pretty silly
countdown to someone trying to sell me monero, yeah it's cool and prolly has serious implications for dnms, no i don't really want any
