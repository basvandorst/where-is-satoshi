This are facts. There is no line to be read between. Stop being a twat. If you want to prove this statements wrong, by all means try. 
Again, it takes an idiot to not understand why pointing out a bot made prices rise does not imply price rising is now impossible. Your inaptitude at basic logic does not imply others are making undue assumptions. It just you being an idiot.

bit coin is, according to him, 5% of their profit. 10% of 5% is 0.5%. Even if they lose ALL of it, it won't affect much.

what kind of retard goes from "no upward manipulation of price currently exist" = "no price increase is possible"?
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:26:39
stupid r/bitcoin-ers.

if you can't understand why logic is independent of source, then you're too stupid for me to waste time over. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:36:45
based on the numbers he gave here and in previous interviews, that seems unlikely. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:20:25


1) they don't. Not even close. going from 11-13m baseline to 19m peak is hardly doubling. 
2) sales doubling, or even 3x for 2 month does not result in anything close to having 70% of all sales for the year within those months. You need those 2 months to have 10 plus times the average of the other 10.


i find this doubtful. Either you are nothing like overstock or you're exaggerating. like I said, You need to be doing 10 times your normal volume for each of those 2 months. You might as well as just do business for those 2 months. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:30:38


And how is this remotely close to 70% of all year being in in Q4? 
You guys have 50% in the first 8+ months. for 70% of all sales to be in Q4, you need to only have done &lt;30% or 1.8mil.
For your store, you only need 3x (200% extra) the average sale of Q1-3 in Q4. For (70% of total in Q4) scenario, Q4 needs to make 7x (600% extra) that. 
Look at the graph he provided. Unique visits peaked at just 150% of baseline and *2 of the months above baseline were in Q1.* Do each visitor buy more during xmas/BF? sure. Do they buy that much more? Doubtful. 
Alternatively, **go read the financials of ANY retail company**, the numbers are very clear on how absurd it is.

black friday and xmas is huge, but it does not account for 75% (or 50% etc) of all profits or revenues. Not even close.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:28:35
Then the same becomes true for criminal activities.

Which part of **go read the financials of ANY retail company** can you not understand? Are you so feeble minded that you need me to link you the financial statement of walmart/staples/target? You can't find them on your own? 
Edit: this is me, pitying the idiot.

You know how long this shit took me to find? *30 seconds*. Man, am I glad to have a functioning brain, it must really suck to lack the brain cells to do a simple google search. 
Now fuck off and stop announcing your ignorance to the world.

Frankly, you don't even need to understand economics to see how stupid the premise is. Simple logic should have made clear the false equivalent at work. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:06:02
wtf are you talking about?
M = 1000
MM = 1000x1000
how is 300k 3MM? this is basic roman numerals.

pointing out empirical impossibility of data provided is trolling because it doesn't fit the narrative you want to believe in? 
bitcoin cult much? 
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:29:14
His history doesn't matter, he is pointing out empirical facts. The fact that he is anti-bitcoin is irrelevant. even the fact that he might be a troll looking for a rise out of you is irrelevant. Unless he is lying or misrepresenting thing, his words stands on their own merit. 


which part of his post isn't thoughtful analysis enough for you? Nothing he said is wrong, all are backed by math + basic fundamentals of the retail business, the numbers make no sense and a CEO talking about "analyst expects X EPS" is entirely baffling. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:40:56
3MM is 3 million. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:41:39


not according to the graph he gave. 
For this to be remotely true, 4th quarter months need to sell at least 5x the average sales of other months. That is just not the case. 


Except that truism is entirely false. It's simply a common misconception. Ask anyone familiar with retail and they will laugh at that. Look up financials for any single retail store, if this were true they would consistently be making losses from Q1-3, then a insane profit Q4. this is not happening
As I mentioned elsewhere, that explanation for the name is a RP move implemented decades after the name was already in widespread use. It simply referred to the pedestrian congestion. Retailer groups just wanted to make it sound more appealing and remove the negative connotations. They failed to change the name because of how ingrained it is, so they made up an alt explanation.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:39:28
no one talks business days when you're a retailer. brick and mortar or online. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:15:26


no, it was called that because of the increased pedestrian load during that day.
the alternative explanation for the name only came 20 years after it was in use, in large part as a PR push to remove the negative connotation of the name.
the idea that those days/month is solely responsible for pulling a store from red to black is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:45:24


No. Facts matter, logic matter, what he said in the past have no baring on how accurate his words are. 


yes, so? Anyone who isn't pro bitcoin 100% of the time is a troll? This is why this sub is such a echo chamber of ignorance. 


yes, because anyone upvoting shit like "Gas was $1.40/L last week. Now it's up 10% to $1.54. It's too volatile for anyone to actually buy or use." are idiotics.
