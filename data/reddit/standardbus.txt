That has been (accidentally?) confirmed many times from the CEO himself on Twitter.
Coinbase success is to find in ease to use interface and fast buy options.
The solution is using other valid options to buy and sell BTC in FIAT as Gemini or the Ardorgate. Please try them and you will not return to Coinbase again.

That one I'm selling is made intentionally as compact as possible, I'm really glad that you thought that it was only a single piece :)

So why are you reading and replying?

No, all pieces are sold separately, I've written the code that's running on the esp8266 and I build them using many pieces, but maybe someone sell some kits that already have the screen built in (I don't know if this kind of kit exists, sincerely)

I really want to make it with an e-ink display (as other projects) but are really expensive, oled screens were cheaper and easier to use for this first try.

Not yet, but it comes in a plastic box as a protection. Not really a case, but a case can be made out from the plastic box itself.

In fact I used the ESP-12E module, that's based on the ESP8266 chip

It needs only a wifi network to comunicate with internet, it is completely standalone, no computer needed. It has a single button to change all the configurations (short press: skip option, change coin. long press: confirm).
If you keep active the tethering on your smartphone, it works anywhere and you can carry it around.
Maybe in the future I'll develop a bluetooth or a BLE version if there is enough interest.
It uses an ESP8266 as a core module, that's a low power 32 bit processor with very limited capabilities but more than enough to work as a ticker. The same configuration can be used for lots of other applications.
The ESP8266 is a very versatile core, ideal for many projects.

I've implemented inside the menu the brightness level selection. This reduce the burn-in, characteristic of the OLED panels.
Low brightness guarantee a longer life for the screen.

It is completely standalone. It gets all the data to show from the web, not from a pc. As I already said, it only needs a wifi connection.
