If transactions are moved to the LN, and the block rewards have declined to very low amounts, doesn't that result in the same situation as your first paragraph? 


The idea behind larger blocks is that a massive number of transactions paying a tiny fee will be able to sustain a mining network.

It makes a lot more sense than saying "per transaction," because each transaction will be variable based on how many inputs and outputs it has. Measuring per kilobyte is a much more consistent metric.

Baidu, which some people describe as "The Google of China" due to it's massive catalog of services and it's ubiquity (although being entirely separate from the company Google), had one service, a DDoS protection shield called JiaSuLe that accepted bitcoin for a short time.
The inside scoop says that the decision to implement bitcoin support was that it was the decision of someone working at JiaSuLe (which, while owned by Baidu, still remains somewhat autonomous), without seeking approval from higher ups at Baidu first.

Okay, sure, if you are hiring super-top-of-the-line poached from Google engineers. Let's take a look at the team of four who are getting paid $25k A MONTH, **EACH** to "build new forum software" (that's three years in the works, mind you.)
Theymos continually insists that these master builders are the best that money could buy, he would never do such things as funneling money into his friend group.
Let's take a look at Theymos' proud A-Team of coders: 
Whoa, hey, what's this? No contact info? No portfolio? Something fishy is going on. The only two links on the webpage are to a github page and a twitter profile. [The twitter profile]( curiously enough, only has 46 followers. For these guys to be commanding $300k/year salaries, they would have to be at the top of their field, right? Wouldn't that come with more uh, social standing and observable networking/references?
Let's take a look at the guys behind Slickage. I found them through [the github page](
 - This guy's only credentials are a bachelor's degree and a consultant position at "eWorldES," a Honolulu-based "enterprise solutions" firm that boasts such prestigious clients as The Honolulu Advertiser and Catholic Charities Honolulu. Remember guys, this guy gets paid $300k a year.
 This guy, who is currently earning his bachelors degree at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. [His personal website]( makes no mention of Slickage anywhere. I'm sure he writes great code for $300k a year, but I wonder why one of his most popular github repositories is of a Java implementation of the game Hangman. 
Next up, we have "SomeoneWeird"  He seems to have a bit more experience and [more followers on Twitter]( but still, no mention of Slickage anywhere.
The last guy, "WangBus"  actually *does* mention Slickage on his page, but nothing stands out to me to indicate that this guy is somehow a top-coder. Also lives in Manoa, Hawaii.
[In an AMA that theymos did one year ago]( he wrote:


Information on Theymos' real identity is difficult to come by, I was unable to find out where in the United States he resides. What do you want to bet that he lives in Manoa Valley, Hawaii?
Are we really to believe that these four not-particularly-remarkable guys in their early twenties, one not even out of college, and only one of the four apparently even employed at "Slickage", are each contributing enough to command a $300k/year paycheck?
Let's also remember that Theymos has been collecting these donations "to improve the forums" basically since the forum first began. At this point, the forum coffers hold millions of dollars worth of bitcoin, all controlled by this single unaccountable twenty-one year old, while the forum has **never** received an upgrade or a facelift, and has in fact been compromised by hackers *several* times in the last couple of years.
Theymos, please answer some questions: 
*  Where did you learn about Slickage?
*  What specific criteria made you decide to choose Slickage over others?
*  Which other firms did you pass on during the decision making process?
*  What price did Slickage quote you? What prices did the firms you passed on quote?
*  Could you provide information on how many BTC you currently hold on behalf of bitcointalk, and how much you have ever earned from bitcointalk?
*  Can you please show examples at any time during history in which you have demonstrated transparency in the use of these funds and the decision making process? ("But it's on the blockchain!" -- yeah, I mean account for where money is coming from and going to.)
*  In the sidebar of this very subreddit, it says that you have spent 10.35799117 BTC on advertising. Where was this spent? What community input went into the decision of where to send these funds?
*I am expecting that if Theymos answers these questions at all, assuming he does not delete this thread, the answers he provides will be just as vague and dodgy as his answers in the past. Please, can we stop accepting "just be patient, it's in the works" answers and hold this guy accountable for once?*

You have to renounce your citizenship at a US embassy or consulate. If you do not hold a second citizenship, the moment you have renounced you are now a stateless person, and, being on US territory (in the embassy or consulate), it is now the duty of the US gov't to deport you back to the United States where they will hold you in indefinite detention.

Would it be possible to have an autonomous lottery? Users send btc to an address, every satoshi is one entry, the program uses a pre-determined block (say, every 1,000 blocks a drawing occurs) hash to determine a winner out of all the addresses that sent coin. Payout is made automatically, everything is transparent, provably fair, and pseudonymous, and there's no middle-man. Something like this would eliminate many of the downsides to a traditional lottery, as well as having the unique feature of being a global lottery that anyone can participate in. And it can't be shut down.

Thank you for answering my questions. This clears some things up. Theymos, I don't believe that you are malicious, but I do think that you are being foolish and irresponsible by paying Slickage $100k a month for this software. I'm sure they are fine developers, but they are very painfully obviously not worth $100k a month.
As you wrote above:


You're absolutely right. You haven't broken any laws, and it really is up to you how to spend the funds. I think the reason people are upset is because it seems like the funds are being mismanaged... bleeding out $100k to this average team of coders (again, I'm sure they're fine at what they do but they aren't worth $100k/mo.) just seems like an irresponsible use of the money. 
You could easily hire a comparable, if not superior team, for perhaps one quarter of what you are paying them. And then **you could spend $75k a month on doing things to promote bitcoin!** Imagine the contests, ads, etc that could be created.
For $75k, you could have a professional quality television ad made (I know Vice does "branded content" and would do a 30-second commercial spot for around $20-30k) and run it in tons of local markets. I think something like this would be a much more appealing use of the funds to all involved. Better forum software is a minor upgrade, promoting bitcoin to the masses is priceless. You could also use that money to hire SEVERAL full-time core developers that don't answer to the foundation. (Just a note, your 22 year old developers in Hawaii are making almost twice as much as Gavin Andresen... that does not make any sense.)
I'm glad the community is having this dialogue. Since the original donated value was only in the hundreds of dollars, and has inflated to such large numbers, maybe we could have more community involvement and use that money for some really cool stuff?
edit: &gt;**If you want to influence how the forum is run, then you need to reach out to me and give me convincing advice.** I am very very busy, and I don't have experience in a lot of this stuff. I rely a lot on advisors.

Really excellent post, eof, thank you. You just gave me a healthy dose of perspective. I would not enjoy being in his position, people are going to bitch no matter what he does with the money. 1000 bits private
That this is true doesn't make the fact at hand any less absurd, I just hope the money could be put to better use. There's $1.5 mil sitting in a community pot, and many of us in this subreddit believe that will be worth many times more in the not too distant future. Here is a lot of money which, being community funds with no concrete purpose (yes, okay, forum maintenance, but let's admit that no webforum needs a multi-million development fund), could be applied to the sorts of projects that have a hard time getting funded for lack of profitability but which benefit all of us and bitcoin as a whole.
I don't think Theymos is an asshole, he's been a great steward to the community for many years. My only gripe is that we, the bitcoin community, have this golden opportunity in front of us and are watching it go to waste. Theymos, would you be agreeable to having a community discussion about how to better use [these funds]( Epochtalk doesn't even need to be scrapped, I think it's just *really* hard to justify the money that is being spent on this one single project, when so many talented people and their awesome, helpful projects that no investor will touch or that no one has a profit motive for have an extremely difficult time getting funded.
I think best course of action is to have it sit and grow with a certain percentage being withdrawn each year to go towards projects -- including epoch, but hopefully others as well. That way, shit gets funded, no one bitches the money isn't being used, and we can't say that the money is being squandered on a single project at a questionable price. Done.

At the time donations were solicited, the money was only worth a few hundred or a couple thousand dollars, earmarked for forum upgrades. Owing to the meteoric price rise of bitcoin, it's now worth in the seven figures.
Yeah, I get that the money was originally donated for forum upgrades, but does a web discussion forum really need millions of dollars in upgrades? No, it really does not. That money can be put to far better uses (and a portion of it could still be used to hire developers to continue making forum improvements).

I first met Wojciech at an Inside Bitcoins conference a few months ago, where he showed me the prototype of this wallet. I thought it was a really cool project and told him I'd help get the word out. I'm linking him to this thread so he can answer questions.
Over the past few months, we've been talking and I've been helping him to figure out the best way to crowdfund this project. We initially looked at Lighthouse but were worried that there were not enough people using it to successfully complete the crowdfund. Eventually it was settled that it would be hosted on Indiegogo, but you can also contribute with bitcoin through a link on the site, using Mycelium Gear. The crowdfunding page is here:

Here's a comment by ([context]( in another thread on this sub:
Not only that! From what I can tell, Gavin is suggesting allowing the max block size to double every 2 years starting at ~16.8MB (anticipating continued advances in technology) until ~~2025~~ 2035, where the max block size will be capped at  **16 GB**.
This is 16,000 times larger than the current limit of 1 MB. Today's block size limit allows for a theoretical transaction rate of 7 tx/s, so theoretically (assuming average tx size stays the same) the network could *theoretically* be capable of handling **~110,000 tx/s** by 2035. There may be other limitations here with bandwidth and CPU speed, but I don't know enough to estimate the impact of that.
To put this in perspective, I'll quote the [Bitcoin Wiki](
&amp;gt; Visa: 47,000 tx/s (Peak)
&amp;gt; Paypal: 115 tx/s (Average)
Of course the features of the protocol will change before 2035 and I'm sure Bitcoin will look a lot different by then, so this is just an over-simplified, although interesting back of the envelope calculation.
Edit: Thanks for the clarifications. I misread some details. It looks like the chart stops at 2025, that was my oversight.

Common sociopathic trait.
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:54:40
An exchange allows you to trade on margin as a show of faith that you are good for the money. So if you are trading on 10x leverage, you can buy 1 BTC worth of contracts (exposing yourself to the price fluctuations of one bitcoin) using only 0.1 BTC.
If the price drops by 10%, you no longer have enough money to cover the trade, so you are margin called and your position is closed. You can also add money to your margin to increase the amount that the price may swing without getting margin called.
If the price rises by 10%, someone else who entered into the futures trade with you, on the opposite side (i.e., they bought a short and you bought a long), gets margin called and you collect the money. However, your contract is then sold to someone else so you may continue making money past the 10% on the upside.
This is my rudimentary understanding of it. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm sure with this becoming such a spectacle, other companies in the space could step up to the plate to make up for lost funds, especially at Moe's behest.
But instead what's happening is a *bitcoin* conference is getting plastered with ads for a known scam. I like the idea of letting Garza speak, it'll be a shitshow no doubt, but to *still*, after all this, pretend as though PayCoin may be legitimate is pretty disingenuous. Having their logo all over the place not only looks incredibly bad on the part of the organizers, but it's also lending Josh Garza the precious legitimacy that he so craves, and he will just use it to further pump his scam and steal people's money.

I think very few people are claiming that allowing Garza to speak is dangerous. The bigger issue is that Paycoin is the premier sponsor of the event, and their logo will be plastered all over everything. Garza doesn't even need to show, just having pictures of his logo all over the conference is good enough for him to say, "see? We're legitimate! Give us your money!" for a while longer.
A commentor upstream had a great suggestion: allow Garza to speak, but refund the money and remove his logos.
Mr. Levin, I understand these things operate on a small margin and that your hands may be tied as far as not being able to refuse the money now. But I believe where there's a will there's a way, and especially for what's becoming so high profile a case, I'm sure other companies in the space would be willing to step up to the plate and sponsor the conference instead of Paycoin.
Your whole "middle of the road" thing is almost admirable, but really to me, and many others it seems, you're just throwing your hands in the air and pulling the ol' "teach the controversy" schtick, which is really just a sneaky way of lending legitimacy to something that, frankly, deserves no respect at all.

Moe allowing Paybase to continue to be a sponsor, and Garza not addressing an audience on stage in an open, unscripted Q&amp;A, is actually the worst possible outcome, imo.

Most people in here believe that BTC is an idea that will succeed on it's own technological merits.
Paycoin marks believe the promises of a "CEO" (strangely the only face of the company, just as with other charismatic scammers in the past), that his mysterious and unnamed investors, who gave him 100 million dollars (which would make Paycoin the most well funded company in digital currencies - Bullshit) will buy up all the paycoins, that they conveniently sold you, for 20 dollars each.

You've got the right idea. I've visited a couple of large mining farms in China. Miners here are able to negotiate rates with the power provider. Residential electricity use is typically 8 US cents per KwH (at least in Beijing, where I live), but I know that bigger miners do not pay so much.
That said, their electricity is still not free, and it would be a stretch to say government officials are in on the mining.

How do you know the price is not being manipulated downwards? Anyone buying serious amounts of BTC is doing so on OTC markets, not on exchanges. I can go buy 10,000 BTC for $300 each, dump them all at once to drop the price and incite panic, causing further drops, then I hit up all the OTC brokers I know and buy up all their bitcoins at $200 each. 
If I had tens of millions of dollars and wanted to acquire some serious BTC on the cheap, this is how I'd do it.
Another theory is that unscrupulous exchanges with futures trading can buy short contracts with non-existent BTC, and cause everyone with a long position to get margin called (and know exactly how much it will net in advance, since they have full access to the order book and you don't). The traders are none the wiser, as far as they know they just made an incorrect trade, and the exchange receives enough real BTC to cover the fake BTC they bought contracts with.
There's bitcoin's value, and bitcoin's price. The price, as you said, "goes sideways, down, with very brief pumps so traders can profit." Bitcoin's value, on the other hand, I only see increasing every single day. Every day its utility increases, more people take it seriously (Coinbase's latest investors are a perfect example, or Microsoft). Price is down 80% over the last year, but for me, right now, bitcoin is more valuable than it's ever been before.

This assumes the price of coins on the old chain does not go down at all.
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:36:57


The linked article makes a pretty strong case for why this scenario is unlikely to happen. 40 minute block times are survivable, you are correct, but this presupposes that 25% of hashrate and a significant number of users will be willing to put up with a handicapped network for 8 weeks until the next difficulty retarget. 
It also supposes that the price of coins on the 25% chain will remain the same or be worth even more than the coins of the pre-fork chain. Markets can move fast, when they want to. Considering that the security, confirmation times, and transaction processing capabilities will all be significantly hindered, I think it's unlikely the coins on this fork will not be worth less than they were before. 
Miners, being rational creatures who seek profit and try to avoid losses, will be highly incentivized throughout the entire process to switch to the more profitable of the two chains. Because a fork will only happen with a big majority of miners *actively* voting for the fork, while the dissenters are more passive abstentions, it looks unlikely that miners would move back to the minority chain UNLESS the profit motive was there. There's a strong incentive for miners to move to the chain with the most hashpower, and a strong disincentive for miners to move to the weaker of the two chains.

This logic fails because it would also imply previous changes made to Bitcoin made it "no longer bitcoin," therefore we are all just using an altcoin right now that happens to go by the name Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-11-21 12:51:48


That's incorrect. BU has a built in mechanism for nodes to follow the blockchain with the most proof-of-work. Users can set their "accepted depth" (AD, the number of blocks another chain must be ahead of the current chain before your node 'reluctantly' switches to the longer one) according to individual preference: if one always wants to follow 1MB blocks and does not care about proof of work, they can set their excessive blocksize (EB) to 1MB and their AD to infinity, and they will always have 1MB blocks regardless of what the rest of the network does. Obviously doing so is not likely to be the most profitable, but it might appeal to some block size purists.
A more rational approach would be to set your EB as your vote for block size, but to set AD to 3 or 4 blocks. You vote, and have your say, but if the majority of the network ends up mining blocks that are larger than your vote, once your node recognizes that this has happened (ie, when the other chain is longer by 3 or 4 blocks), it 'reluctantly' accepts this as the most valid chain by Nakamoto consensus.
There's nothing social about it, it's a market based approach. Everyone can see what the EB and AD values for other miners are, so if 80% of the network signals that they won't accept blocks larger than 2MB, then a miner would be stupid and wasting money to produce a block that they know will not be accepted by 80% of the network. Maybe they get lucky and one of the 20% miners finds it, but unless the 20% miners manage to find their next 3 or 4 blocks faster than the 80% of the miners find their next 3 or 4 blocks, then it is futile. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:52:37
If BTC is 99.999% decentralized and secure, and increasing blocksize (aka throughput) to 8MB results in 99.997% decentralization and security, would you say that's an acceptable trade-off?
See here for research that actually demonstrates increasing the block size results in no significant loss of "decentralization" (which is actually kind of a dumb word to be talking about since no one has offered any methods of defining or measuring it):

No, the rate at which they are produced is halved every four years. In 2016, it will be 1800 BTC per day. In 2020, 900. By 2040, ~99.9% of all bitcoins will have been mined, and the rest will slowly trickle for the next one hundred years, at which point no new bitcoins will be created.


50% of the USD supply is owned by fifty people. 


Yeah, gold is pretty ridiculous, who would ever store value in something that can be lost and not replaced?

Lol, thats not how bitcoin works. IIRC, most of satoshi's coins are held in addresses with 50btc each, from the original mining rewards. You would have to have one super computer (many orders of magnitude more powerful than anything that exists today) working away for *millions* of years to crack just *one* of those addresses.
There's an address with 111,111btc in it, which would make a better target, but pretty sure that address doesn't belong to satoshi.

Sure, they don't demonize it, but merely reporting on it **does not** imply their support.

Fantastic article! If you ever have any questions about the bitcoin happenings in Beijing, feel free to get in touch.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:16:19
English speaker in China here, just woke up! To answer your question in the OP, I think real-world Bitcoin use is even less prevalent here than it is in many American cities. In Beijing, we only have two brick and mortar establishments that accept bitcoin. In Shanghai, there are none so far, as far as I'm aware. 
As far as online commercial adoption goes, it's getting more and more steam. Lots more native Chinese tech companies are starting to take notice, like guokr.com (online courses), 35.com (domain registrar), and Baidu JiaSuLe (DDoS protection). One of my favorite local sites is  which lets people pay their phone bill with bitcoin! I haven't used fiat money to pay my phone bill in several months because of this site.
Currently most of the Chinese interest in bitcoin is coming from speculative investors, but there's also a ton of people working hard on the ground to push it's commercial acceptance. Keep in mind that up until about 6 months ago, there were *no* merchants accepting bitcoin in China (unless you count bitcoin companies like Avalon). The pace is picking up, I expect that in a year we'll have a lot more commercial uses of bitcoin in China.

I think he's talking about the Wheel of Trust browser extension, which rates links as green (trustworthy), orange, or red (untrustworthy). Looks like the Adzerk network that reddit uses is ranked as orange.

Hong Kong is not under rule of the CPC. What the mainland government thinks is irrelevant here.

I think it's already been hit :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:06:13
AFAIK no such thing exists in China yet. I've got a few merchants here to agree to accept bitcoin through Bitpay or Coinbase, only to discover that their banks (even HK accounts) are not supported. 
Big ol' niche waiting to be filled.

Bitcoin users in China have been able to pay our phone bills  with bitcoin for some time now (including china telecom), although its through a third party: 
E: also i understood that it was a joke, i just like telling people about this awesome site. I've been paying my phone bills with btc exclusively for about 3 or 4 months now.

Yeah, I can! There actually aren't that many currently, but the community in Beijing is pretty active and we're working on getting more places to accept it.

Not sure if you are aware, but we have pretty frequent bitcoin activities in Beijing. Drop me a line at beijingbitcoins and I'll invite you to some events! We have a pub quiz team that meets weekly at Lush, and once in a while meet up at 2nd Place for drinks. Every other month or so we'll have a larger meetup held at The Garage Cafe. Both 2nd Place and The Garage Cafe accept bitcoin as payment.

They don't "regularly" run documentaries, they ran one documentary which was fair and objective (but not praising it), and they've done a couple other minor reports on it... Like news in any other country.

I know the reporter who worked on the 30-minute CCTV documentary that everyone knows about and I asked her about this. The government can veto a topic if they don't want it to be reported on, but otherwise the news agencies are given free reign to report on the news. All it means is that the government does not view bitcoin as a threat at this point, but it also does not imply their support.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:56:01
I paid a friend $500 in bitcoin for some web dev services she provided. After cashing out a few hundred for rent, and buying a new SSD on bitcoinstore.com, she has $700 left over :)

This is a bar in the student district of Wudaokou, called Second Place. It's pretty tiny, but the drinks and atmosphere are excellent (the pictures don't do it justice, lol).
I've been talking to the owner about accepting bitcoin for months and he never seemed very interested, but the other day I came in for a beer and he told me he wants to start accepting BTC payments! So I just got him set up with his first bitcoin wallet to start using it.
If anyone is in Beijing, the address is: 
Haidian District, Wudaokou, Huaqing Jia Yuan, Bldg  1602c. 
and in Chinese: 北京市 海淀区 五道口 华清嘉园 7号楼1602c
You can show them your support on facebook, too! 
edit: if you're in Beijing, we're going to have a little get together at this bar this friday at 7pm! Hope to see you there.

The Chinese government typically takes a hands-off stance until they have reason to do otherwise. Wait until bitcoin starts gaining more traction here and see how they react before you jump to judgements about what it means that they aren't coming down on bitcoin right now.

Because many chinese words use the same sound as other words, many times the words have extra meaning. Quick example:  a popular video website, is pronounced *wu liu*, which sounds a lot like *wu liao*, the word for "bored". Another example is  pronounced like "coolio".

And then a year later it goes through another hype cycle and goes up to $10,000 and everyone who felt bad about buying at "the peak" and then panic selling when they saw it's value go down a bit will feel silly.

I use 1Password too. You can't have it auto-fill with the plug-in, but you can still save your password in the program with a name like "Blockchain". A bit more of a hassle to have to open 1Password, enter master password, copy paste wallet password -- but whatever it takes to keep your coins safe, right?

I worked with  for a while. We were the first online merchant in China accepting BTC. We've only ever done two BTC sales so far, but even today a good chunk of the site's traffic comes from old articles about us accepting bitcoin (unfortunately most of that traffic is not in the target demographic of people living in China!).
One of the two BTC sales we did was a Chinese university student living in the UK. She was writing her masters thesis on bitcoin and bought some pollution masks to have sent to her parents in Beijing. She used bitcoin transactionally as part of her research. I thought that was pretty cool :)

When I first got in about a year ago, when bitcoins were sub-$20, I felt like I was "late" as well. However, I think everyone who starts buying bitcoin now is still a super-early adopter.

It's definitely getting faster. Near future I expect a lot more businesses will start accepting it.

Already I'm noticing more and more people will have at least heard of bitcoin. I love asking Chinese people about it, and in the last couple weeks I've had a few people who don't use it but who have responded that they've heard of it and know what it is. And unlike most western people, they don't bring up money laundering or drugs, haha.

If it's really worth it to you you can fly to China and open a bank account. Foreigners are allowed to open them with just a passport.
