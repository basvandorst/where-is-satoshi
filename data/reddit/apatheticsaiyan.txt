Egotistical arrogance has played a part in banking for far too long.

So you're saying Bitcoin is da wae
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:10:00
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:19:22
You need taxes for those things? Private examples don't exist?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:14:02
I don't feel compelled to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:04:19
They're welcome to attack me physically if they want
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:54:50
That's way too complicated.
It my mind it is either $matter = true or $matter = false.
If $matter == false then //ignore end if

If you were the last human standing would you not matter?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:44:38
I am doing what I can to actively change it.
I'm not in the military and I discourage all from enlisting.
But, people like the taste of blood so who's to blame them?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:56:03
in regards to your metaphor
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:22:19
I'm not trying to avoid taxes I want a system that doesn't rely on taxes. No offense but the Federal Reserve is a bunch of monkeys jerking off to themselves in a mirror.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:55:25
Know a path I can walk?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:44:59
You seem upset, is this an emotional debate for you?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:35:15
then I have no motivation to earn should I not control what I earn
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:43:17
I would try but I'm pretty certain someone else would try to stop me first. Again, others  involving themselves in my life.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:09:58
It's all about scope. Zooming in and out. There is no correct magnification level but understand the further you zoom out the more that black and white will bleed together.

Kenny is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Kenny! Bitcoin is alive!!!

I should be allowed to choose where every cent I earn goes.

You got your reaction already what more do you want?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:06:15
That's the goal

So you think USD&gt;BTC then?

At a technical level I really like Doge.
Otherwise, I still like doge.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:33:45
I paid my taxes. I just don't support the united states government or any other government for that matter.
Humans are not meant to rule over other humans. And our democracy has been proven to be false.
Seriously, america is one big pyramid scheme and you're too dense to see that.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:23:55
Other than the internet connection you did not describe me.
Also, when are we going to just have wifi everywhere? Isn't there already tech developed for that? Why aren't taxes going into providing wifi for everyone?
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:12:14
This has been a sensible thread about crypto tech. Where am I? What is happening?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:15:42
I don't trust it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:03:49
I disagree. Gray is made up of black and white. Just because it looks gray doesn't mean it is.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:41:01
Why should I have to change when it's the system that is broken?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:53:56
I agree I should leave
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:35:01
You keep approaching this from a 'you' mentality.
I'm just entertaining multiple trains of thought.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:17:58
We are all full of shit
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:01:08
Um do you post just for reactions?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:40:32
I always hated the argument of calling someone a hypocrite. As if single entity's actions have any real effect on an unbiased topic in a vacuum.
I know it's hard, myself included, but this language of I/me/self needs to evolve into  a more rounded us/we
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:55:51
I'm not trying to go anywhere
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:58:27
Probably just taking one step at a time and focusing on features by level of request

And just because you're being a dick.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:19:32
As per this conversation I'm trying to see what gray is made out of.
I believe it's black and white.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:07:47
Ehhhh then I'm slave to a passport. I don't think you understand the word freedom
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:07:19
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:35:59
Or if digitally literate human beings botch the vote regardless of my participation. It's rigged and you don't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:57:59
Would you rather me attack someone?
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:31:03
It never makes it to that if statement if it's grey.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:30:23
Do you think Bitcoin is going to die again soon?

Front page of reddit? But this is social media really all we are doing here is up voting and down voting anyways. Honestly I feel my opinion has far more value on Reddit than it does to the government

Look at us talking and shit

Why are you talking about beef?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:02:35
Calling someone is a form of attack. Do not call me.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:59:04
It's all in good fun anyways. Social media isn't a serious platform anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:04:26
Bitcoin has always been popular, you've just never been cool. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:06:16
I contacted my state senator one time and got nothing but automated responses.
My voice has been silenced and my vote is meaningless.

Hey, you're starting to learn. Nice.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:13:30
Taxes? You mean theft?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:23:22
Or I could just not participate and focus on changing things for the better instead of being a content and mindless cog in the machine.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:08:05
they tell me actually
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:25:09
I love it
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:18:48
Let me answer that question with another question, should you spend money on things you don't want to? For example, I know the united states spends about 70% of it's money on war. I do not support war or even the development of war-technology.
That being said, I strongly feel like the government is taking my value away from me and applying it towards murder. I do not condone that.
So yes, probably an idiot because I value human life.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:39:25
Why are you trying to fight stupid? Let stupid die.
