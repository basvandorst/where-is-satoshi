Super effective advertising.  I'll be in the market for a new CC payment processor since the Google API I'm using is going away.
Saw this post, looked up the website, and was actually sold until I saw "a PayPal company."  PayPal has enough horror stories from merchants that I'd never use *anything* from them.  Nice try, though.

Yeah, but why would merchants want to integrate any payment API from google?  They've already deprecated their web payment API *twice*.  Engineering time is expensive, companies don't want to spend it on an integration that will only last a year.

It was a zero day, you may have been compromised a few days ago and not detected it right away.  That infected AdobeUpdater.exe is mighty suspicious...

I am an online merchant who has received several requests to support BitCoin purchases.  However, I am concerned about correctly handling local/state sales tax.
* Are bitcoin transactions subject to sales tax for sales made within my local state transactions (FYI I have only established nexus in Washington state &amp; sell only digital goods)?
* How do I declare these sales at tax time?
* Do you know of any bitcoin processors that can calculate tax rates for me?
* Does the situation differ if I direct withdraw to USD nightly versus hold on to the coins long term?
Thanks, maybe your answers will get folks one more place to spend bitcoins one day ;)

Good advice, thanks!

There's a new Flash zero-day floating around.  Maybe you got it that way?  
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:22:12
Excellent, I will look into it

That's pretty cool, but it doesn't look like it does any automatic sales tax calculation unfortunately.  Google Checkout does a pretty cool thing where you can specify which states to collect sales tax in, and it automatically figures out the appropriate local rates.  I wish one of the bitcoin processors offered a similar service! :)

Thanks; can you confirm barfor's comment that you can handle sales tax calculation?

FYI, I submitted my link and payment and I haven't seen it show up on your site yet, although there have been 13 confirmations.  Is something broken?
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:26:23
Good point.  Are there stats anywhere of how many users are on each platform?  I guess that'd be hard to determine though.

Cool; like you say, it'll probably not be the main payment method in the game, but I want to offer it as an experiment and see if people will use it ;)
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:31:02
Thanks.  Yeah, I agree having a couple of the big merchants on board is a good sign

Your game looks cool, I will have to play it later!  :)  Mine is 8BitMMO
