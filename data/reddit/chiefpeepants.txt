Spend it on paper before it ever hits your bank.  
If you're having trouble reducing your spending, some common money wasters include: tobacco products, illegal drugs, alcohol (or drinking anything but water unless medically necessary), eating out, excessive cell/data/cable packages, unnecessary or inappropriate insurance coverage, and shopping as a hobby or out of boredom - including buying things "because it's a good deal".
Also, if it isn't clear, FORGET about bitcoin for now.  You don't even have the basics covered, yet; it's irresponsible to bet with money you don't have.

...and with prices since Dec 2017

"Personal projections" mean nothing - ignore them all.  NO ONE knows what prices will be, EVER.  Don't buy BTC (or any crypto) with money that you can't afford to lose.  
Also, don't go into this thinking you can day-trade like you can with the stock market; the last couple days have shown us the significant challenges with that for the average person.
A study once showed that the Fidelity customers who made the most money were those who FORGOT THEY HAD ACCOUNTS.  Set it and forget it - it's stressful and emotional to micromanage.  Don't waste your life freaking out about making a few extra arbitrary-buying-power-units.

Rule of thumb for investing/trading (not just BTC): if the deal going south would give you a heart attack, YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE DEAL.

Have you started with the sticky on the front page of this reddit?  It has great links to lots of educational materials on BitCoin.  I think you're right to try to educate yourself as much as possible on the topic.

...USD and all fiat... you're confusing the poor bastards who don't get the joke.

I think you mean "bet".
If you can't pay with cash, you can't afford the risk.  Seriously, don't.

You're gonna love this: that's what Warren Buffet tells people to do in the stock market.

Well at least you know to downvote everyone you disagree with, like a true master of reddit.
