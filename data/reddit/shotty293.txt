How is this related to /bitcoin?
Or is this a fiat vs btc thing?

Fuck off man....some think it will go below, others say stay the same, most think it will bounce back above 11K...everyone has their own predictions but it doesn't mean we need to troll them! Futures are currently speculating 10200 as a floor.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:29:23
What?? I paid about $100 for my Trezor. Where are you seeing this?
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:53:23
As the other guy said, there goes your insecurity...obviously you care about looks more than this guy. Maybe he likes the way his nose looks. Maybe he has better ways to spend hit bitcoin profits.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:10:39
Hah same here!
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:09:15


Uhh, what? This is incorrect. Ltc has it's own blockchain buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:30:53
95% here unfortunately don't care about the tech more than they do the quick rich scheme...we all know the truth and it's SAD!

Ok, buddy. You have a good day...try not to be so angry and oversensitive. Things will look up.

@_date: 2018-01-13 15:45:31

I finally got to my wife. She's been annoyed with me talking bitcoin to her ever since I bought in at 1200. I showed her my account yesterday and she finally caved in. Wrote me a check for 5K to invest in coin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:48:24
This is not true. I transferred BTC from Coinbase to Gdax (free) but was then charged a fee when transferred to Bitstamp.

There is as much division between BTC-BCH as there are in the US with Dems-Reps!

What I stated above was not personal, that's why I said "people" are hating because....
And no, I wouldn't be pissed about XRP for two reasons:
1) XRP has no quarrels with any other coin as BTC and Bcash do. There's a lot of division between the latter.
2) I finally bought some XRP yesterday right before it started to go up....so, I'm happy!

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:49
People are hating on Coinbase because they dropped Bcash on everyone essentially without notice. Just ahead of it dropping, the price of BCH shot up leaving many to believe there was some insider trading going on between their employees and Bcash proponents. Basically, people believe Coinbase was in on the pump.
EDIT: Also need to add that Coinbase initially did not allow selling, just buying of Bcash. GDAX also left some buying at $9500 before closing it off to do their fake "investigation" to any insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:58
Do you mean Coinbase??

@_date: 2018-05-23 16:15:12
Really? Held since $100? I strongly doubt that...if it's true, you would have seen way bigger losses in the past and sold out a long time ago. Just hold it and forget about it for a couple more months.

@_date: 2018-05-04 15:49:11
Probably....they don't need to buy a whole btc, just fractions.

I have a Trezor and am very satisfied with the product and service. Sure, there was a period where they were having issues with their beta wallet for bitcoin cash but they handled it calmly and assured their customers.
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:41:34
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:52:38
Have you looked it up yet? Maybe there's some news on it right now.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:54:23

Ok, come back to me when BCH has it's security issues straightened out.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:11:42
Transactions will need to go through a series of confirmations. This used to take up to hours with legacy BTC but now after SegWit, it doesn't take nearly as long. If you're using your BTC to buy something from a business, they take the risk of unconfirmed transactions so you can get your bought product/service immediately. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:30:02
What advice are you looking for on transferring? It's pretty straightforward....and yes, there will be a transaction fee.
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:21:41
I know..
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:24:02
Have you ever heard of "ELI5"?? That is what the elevator analogy is for.....obviously you don't know much about blockchain tech so he's trying to explain the fees involved between "legacy" transactions and Segwit as if you were a 5 year old. Please do some research instead of coming back here asking the same questions over and over again.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:14:57
Who cares....its a false coin
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:17:34
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:19:09
Yep, Coinbase has done a horrible job in the communication department. Obviously we all know how bad their support group is but they need to do a better job giving us all a heads up on their future plans. I've already removed all my Btc from their exchange because of the mistrust.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:36
So many lazy asses here lately asking how to get in....shit, do some research yourself!
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:48:13
I only hope 4 years from now I and others like myself here are financially free due to our BTC (and other great coins like LTC) investments.

You might want to google to see what an average transaction time would take. If you're looking to "day trade", you'll want to look into other exchanges like Gdax (owned by Coinbase), Bitfinex, etc.

If btc starts trending upwards past 10K then I plan on buying more. Otherwise, I'm holding what I have until a floor is established. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:04:30
Coinbase is a decent one for newbies. You can keep your coin on it but it's not the best idea. Better keep your private keys somewhere safe or save them on Breadwallet or similar app. Long term hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger Nano is good. My Trezor allows you to hold BTC, ether, ltc, and bcash.

Coinbase is an exhange so you don't have control of your private key(s). If something happens to Coinbase, you can lose it all!

@_date: 2017-10-03 01:08:55
They specifically told users that they wont support BCH on their exchange before the fork happened. If you didnt get the memo before then, then you are SOL.  You were to remove your BTC off CB and into a wallet. Private keys are what you need to access BCH.

@_date: 2017-05-05 16:27:37
Why would you send overseas? You could open up a Coinbase account and safely buy from there. If you're making your transaction through your bank, it will take about 7-10 days before you actually get your BTC but will hold at the same value as when you bought it.
