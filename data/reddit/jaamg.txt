I think it's pretty clear that global blockchain adoption can not happen at least in a decade or two. But why would it need to? There are cases when using blockchain makes sense and there are cases when other methods makes sense. If all transactions that happen in Xapo's, Coinbase's, Changetip's etc. databases would take place in blockchain, Mike Hearn's Crash Landing scenario would already have happened 
Those companies (Xapo, Coinbase, Changetip...) don't use their own databases because of blockchain's capacity limitations or because they shun blockchain. They use their own databases because it is more convenient in their case. They can for example store cold wallet in a secure place and only move "database-bitcoins" when transactions happen between the accounts that they control. Only when transactions go in and out of their system they broadcast it to blockchain.

"Building blockchain on first usage" is another way of saying "building full Bitcoin transaction history". Doesn't really matter what the max block size is or if there even is one, you must download every bitcoin transaction that has ever happened.
I agree that the user experience could be better than starting by downloading hundreds of gigabytes of data, but if the case is there are hundreds of gigabytes of transaction history, then so be it. I see limiting blockchain transaction capacity in the name of user experience when setting up full node as a horrible idea. SPV client is also always an option.

How is it deflationary and looses value at the same time?
@_date: 2016-01-07 06:29:10
Of course. I'm not denying this. Inflation is not "blanket treatment" pushing the prices up uniformly. It's all about who gets to spend the newly printed money first and for what. Those people are the gainers and what they buy with it is likely to gain in value first. See, for example, ever growing financial services sector &amp; housing bubble.
Edit: like I said:




@_date: 2016-03-29 20:03:30
This question could probably be answered from two points of view: technical and ["crypto-economic"]( Technically it's about the rules by which nodes are configured to drop txs from their mempools. Crypto-economically it's about how blocks being full might affect user behavior. I'll focus on the crypto-economic side of it.
Mempool continuosly rising would be another way to say that the "last person in line" gets continuosly pushed further back. By paying higher fee he would push someone else further back and so on. Continuously rising mempool means that "the last person" never gets his tx confirmed so I don't think it's realistic that the mempool continuously rises in size -- this, like I said, from the crypto-economic point of view.
In any case it becomes a decision about "how much are you willing to pay to get your tx through in x blocks of time". If you pay p1 you have 50% chance for the next block, if you pay p2 you have 50% chance for the next 2 blocks and so on. The shape of this function is very steep: Paying some reasonable amount gets your tx confirmed in some reasonable time. Paying less than that pushes the waiting time estimate towards infinity very quickly (assuming the blocks are full). There's only so many txs that can get written in blockchain per time t. If there's 101 txs and only room for 100, one of them is going to be pushed out. Paying more pushes someone else out and so on.
So it becomes a decision about "how much are you willing to pay to get the Blockchain confirmation for your tx in some 'reasonable time'". You check what the "current price estimate for 'reasonable time'" is and either pay that or use some other method, such as altcoin, visa, cash, offchain...
Just my 2 cents.

It's not irrelevant at all that the unit of account loses its value. In fact it's very relevant. When unit of account loses its value assets measured in that unit of account appear to gain in value.

Nobody knows whether it is going to make economical sense to shop online with Bitcoin in the future or not, but the decision is going to be the same: "how much are you willing to pay to get confirmation in 'reasonable time'". The answer to that question is at the same time answer to whether it makes economical sense to do it or not.
With LN, you must first open a payment channel (make a blockchain tx), so you once again must decide whether it makes economic sense or not, but after the channel is open, you can make multiple txs via it without making further blockchain txs, besides the one closing the channel. I really don't know enough about LN to answer the rest of questions, sorry.

Exactly. Just like just said, the owner of a sizable share of coca-cola is high net worth regardless of QE. Coca cola is still worth the same measured in any other unit of account besides the QE'd currency which lost its value (while making the money issuing machine rich) in the process. That coca cola measured in the QE'd currency is now worth more than before is not because coca cola has risen in value, but because the QE'd currency has lost its value.

@_date: 2016-01-06 17:48:11
Printing money does not effect the net worth of a person measured in the named currency. His net worth measured in the original unit of accunt will stay the same. However, printing money will *decrease* his net worth measured in some other unit of account, because money loses its value when more is being issued (inflation).
But this all has very little to do with what was my original point. The original point was that new money is issued via complex mechanisms which allow people being part of these complex mechanisms to grow their net worth. You see, the process needs many central bankers, regulators, quantitative analysts etc. They all get their cut just being part of the money-issuing process. If some of them are corrupt, they get even bigger share and so on. Like said:


These are the very people who benefit from the money printing process. But it's a zero sum game: while there are couple of million people benefitting, there are couple of billion people who lose in the money issuing process.

True, referencing to triangle inequality here is a bit of an abstraction. There are mechanisms how Bitcoin can make bank account -&gt; bank account transfers more efficient. In fact, many banks are currently figuring out how it's done, because their competitors are too.
As a regular joe, however, I would wait that the competition forces banks to make bank account -&gt; bank account cheaper. In the mean time, instead of trying to benefit from blockchain in bank account -&gt; bank account transfers by yourself, I'd recommend to:

Oh but they can. Bitcoin is something that is useful and scarce so it can be used as a store of value. You can "use" it just by holding it.


A cynical person might indeed say that it's just a greater fool scheme, but they would not take into account that Bitcoin is more than just buying and selling worthless tokens. Bitcoins have value because to be able to transact in Bitcoin network, you have to own some bitcoins. If you want to transact and don't own any, you have to acquire some -&gt; a demand for bitcoins is created.


Like I said, this knowledge is dispersed among the people. Each individual has their own reasons to buy, sell or hodl. Someone buys because they need btc and other wants to speculate that price rises. Someone sells because they need dollars and other because they speculate that price drops. Someone holds because they think it's a convenient way to store their wealth and someone perhaps because they are too lazy to switch into some other asset class.

People don't agree about the max block size because everyone looks at Bitcoin from individual point of view, with emphasis on different dynamics of the system. People have their own visions, their individual "models for Bitcoin" in their mind. There should be lots of debating and lots of sharing thoughts, but as long as any significant opposition exists - as long as large number of people still see the change being bad for "their Bitcoin model" - the fork should not happen. It's a [coordination game]( If the fork needs to be done, it will eventually get enough support. While the support is not there, "no fork" is dominant strategy for everyone.

Yea, I expressed myself imprecisely. Orderbooks of course only reveal vague information and it's impossible to know the exact shapes of supply and demand curves. Only market participants have the exact knowledge about their personal supply and demand preferences and there is no way to plot the aggregate of that information.
It's of course also possible that orderbooks contain fake information: Somebody might have put up a fake wall to manipulate a market etc...

Do you agree: interest rates now are close to 0 which effectively means it does not cost him anything to owe that money now. Do you agree: if he thinks that in the future he has better dollar-denominated salary than today, or if he thinks he can invest profitably, then he should wait with the payments today, enjoy for near 0 interest rates, and pay the loan off in the future when he has more dollars available?

Low interest rates are low interest rates. Deflation is deflation.

Stochastical nature of the block-finding process makes Bitcoin an impractical payment protocol anyway. It doesn't increase usability that much if the wait time estimate gets down from 0-30 mins to 0-3 mins. Moreover, it's not guaranteed that the tx even fits to the next block. It's better if we (the ecosystem) focus on building a separate payment layer(s) which enable truly instant and secure payments that later get settled by the base protocol.
In the short run, while Bitcoin itself *is* still used as a payment protocol, merchants can of course accept 0-conf txs at their risk, which seems to be ok in many use cases at least for now. In the longer run, Bitcoin should be a settlement layer, and for a settlement layer it doesn't matter whether one must wait 1 minute or 1 hour for confirmation.

Bitcoins are unit of account in a decentralized book keeping system which is also called Bitcoin. They are numbers in a public ledger called blockchain.
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:00:54
The result would be jammed blockchain. For example, giving 1mBTC to 10M people would take several days to confirm with the processing speed of 1MB/10min. Giving it to 100M people would take several weeks. When the people started to redeem their coins it would again take several days/weeks, and this time even longer since it's now many single txs instead of few big ones (with many outputs). And all this considering there's nobody else making txs which is far from true; blocks are already close to full.
"The poor" would never be able to spend their 1mBTC outputs because they did not have enough money for the fee.

Yes, I'm not that worried. It's obvious that most transactions related to this news will only happen in Xapo or Taringa database and not in blockchain.

I used to try to explain as much as possible but have nowadays started to keep it as short as possible. I might actually just say something like "it's magic internet money" or "it's kind of a payment system and native internet money at the same time". If they want to know more they ask specific questions or maybe google about it later.
It seems that the system as a whole is so complex that for quite some time answers to previous questions only raise more questions. This of course isn't bad, but helps to keep the conversation in track that another person is interested in or has previous knowledge.
Unless I know the person is tech savvy I try to keep the conversation in "technology and the whole nascent ecosystem is still very young and it's still hard to say how it all will evolve - it's kind of like the internet in the 1990's".
If I know that the person has knowledge about the related subjects I might bring up themes such as:
* How the monetary policy is different from fiat currencies
* How the payment system is different from centralized services (Paypal, banks, etc)
* How the blockchain works
* What are the common misconceptions
* What are the possible future developments (DAOs, smart contracts, etc)

Let's say I'm buying a laptop which costs $500 and I'm paying with Bitcoin. Let's assume two cases with different btc prices:
Case1, 1 btc = $250: Laptop costs 2 btc and I need to make 1 transaction to buy it.
Case2, 1 btc = $500: Laptop costs 1 btc and I need to make 1 transaction to buy it.
Number of transactions in both cases was 1 (regardless of the btc price). But if transaction volume is measured in btc, then in case 1 there is twice as much volume.

I'm not saying that there is high demand for bitcoin, nor am I saying that supply is not restricted. What I'm saying is that current market circumstances allow high premiums, although I also think that percentages in OP were exaggerated or outdated.
I'm implying that possibility to ask high premiums (make profit) likely draws new suppliers to the market. New suppliers means more competition and more competition means premiums getting smaller and generally better services. It's already happening. Look how many new exchanges and brokers are constantly popping up all around the world. It was only 2 years ago when one single exchange had like 80% global market share.

It's important that Bitcoin maintains its censorship resisting properties. What it takes for it to be censorship resistant depends on what is technologically possible and also on other circumstances.

Sorry, I edited the previous message and you probably missed my question to you:
Prove me why would somebody make "an expensive" tx on the bitcoin blockchain while they can make "a cheap" tx on some other blockchain/PayPal/Credit Card?
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:28:46
Here's how I see it. Cryptocurrency derives its value from the fact that it can be used as an electronic p2p cash. It can be used as a censorship resistant, programmable vehicle to transfer value from an entity A to entity B over the internet. (Because of this property it can also be used as a store of value.)
When an entity A seeks for an option to transfer value to an entity B over the internet they have a number of options to pick from. They can choose between Bitcoin, Litecoin, PayPal, wire etc and each option has its pluses and minuses.
My hypothesis is this: If two of the vehicles are otherwise identical, but one has cheaper txs, it will eventually surpass the one with more expensive txs. No matter how great the network effect, the users will switch to the cheaper alternative user by user, use case by use case. Eventually the system with cheaper txs is going to have the majority of the users, and thus, the network effect. I expect this to happen especially if the two options are two forks of the current Bitcoin blockchain, one with "small max block size" and the other with "big max block size".

In the case of Bitcoin the maximal revenue is not obtained when the plane is optimally sized but when the maximum number of paying passengers are onboard. You are implicating that in the case of a small plane the cabin crew would only let in those who pay the most so you probably are aware that they have an option to pick in the passengers they want. Currently airline companies actually tend to let in also those who don't pay. Maybe they do it for marketing purposes so future flights would have significantly more passengers and because there is no extra cost (neither for the airline company nor the other passengers), thus free rider problem nonexistent.
In the case of Bitcoin there should be seats for as many passengers as is technically possible because the airliner has the possibility to choose the passengers and because the operating cost of the flight is always the same not depending e.g. on the capacity or utiliztion rate of the plane.

I was previously commenting about raising the 1MB block size and still would not like to speculate what should be done after several years. I'm thinking if the described issue some day manifests, mandatory minimum transaction fee, for example, would be vastly superior compared to artificially scarce transactions. If the adoption really explodes, perhaps 1 satoshi is just fine minimum fee some day and nothing needs to be done.
Artificially limiting the supply of "transaction slots" would do horrible things for the usability of Bitcoin. Supply would always be fairly constant, but demand would still greatly vary depending on the day, time of the year, and also by who knows what kind of future SatoshiDices or new ways of using sidechains. Predicting the clearing times and needed fees would be terrible burden for transactors and mining revenues would become highly volatile. There would be constant political issues about increasing/decreasing the block size. Blocks would always need to be close to full and during quiet seasons there would be the same "securing the network issue" enhanced with artificially limited block sizes with less transaction fees in them. High seasons with expensive transactions could throw some transactors out of the system.
I know it's good to look into future but with 1MB blocks and difficulty in da moon I think the relevant issue today is raising the max block size and not talk about limiting it in the name of network security.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:08:50
Every time someone rationalizes arbitrary block size limit by economics, stating that transactions must be scarce so that fees get higher, it makes me think: would these same people suggest that an airline company should only sell 10% of the available seats so people would pay more of them.

I wonder why these people throw hypotethical future problem on the table and argue it should be solved now instead of in the future when there's more information available for the decision making - for example information on whether there even is problem or not. I wonder why they see limiting block size as a better solution than for example setting a mandatory minimum fee.
I wonder why they think we shouldn't raise the max block size now when 1) Limit is clearly becoming a problem 2) Network security clearly isn't a problem - not now and not in a foreseeable future 3) Hitting into artificial max block size limit creates a whole new bundle of problems as I described in my previous message. 4) It is likely that limiting block size wouldn't even fix the original problem but could actually make it worse.
I wonder who are these people. I've encountered some uninformed ex-miners who have been put out of business by raising difficulty. They think that more transaction fees would make mining profitable for them again whereas it would only raise difficulty even further.
I'm picturing a future scenario (in maybe 2030's) with billions of transactions a day with fees equivalent to maybe $0.01. I don't see future for Bitcoin as a private swift-like network between few centralized conglomerates who offer financial services for individuals and who try to balance the supply and demand for "transaction slots". It looks too much like central banks controlling interest rates and such. It will be too fragile system for everybody, including the conglomerates.

Your BTC in this case is worth what BitPay says it's worth. Doesn't matter from where you initiate the payment. So basically yes, if BitPay's exchange rate is $550 then that's the exchange rate you get even if you send the payment from an exchange where the current market price is $530.

It's a cool idea. Interesting to see whether the market thinks that loading physical coin with freshly mined btc gives it some extra novelty value.
There's also decreasing number of possibilities to make these.

So you're implying it will cost less in terms of BTC?

We are waiting that the invisible hand of the market tells us what to do in regards with the scaling. There are many clever insights and justified arguments, but also lots of unnecessary noise.
Those, who can envision what the invisible hand is going to do, can leverage their insights by positioning themselves well in the emergent ecosystem.

I think they have little to offer to the existing Bitcoin community right from the bat. Most BTC traders already have their familiar go-to-places who have won their trust in a period of time.
But on the other hand I'd assume there are many btc curious people in FinFX's existing customer base. For those people FinFX is that familiar go-to-place while bitcoin world might look like a scary place with all kinds of Mt.Goxes and other bad press. This is why I find it odd that they decided to create separate FinCCX instead of simply adding BTC to their existing platform.

You didn't read his comment. What matters is ones personal ability to run a node if they wish to do so.
Do you think that the brand named businesses don't have the ability to run nodes and that is the reason why they don't do so? Do you think they would run the nodes if we force lower max block size than what it is now? How much do you think we should lower the max block size to get the businesses run their own nodes?

No, you can't say that function A is greater than function B.

Ok, thanks for the answer and good luck!

No, but there will be as a result of extremely loose monetary policy and QE.

I'd say that one lesson to be learned is that one should never hard fork when there are 0 technological benefits from doing so. Ethereum now has 2 technologically identical branches. It's now only about how Ether is distributed among users. Great opportunity for any non-ETH-users trying to buy themselves in cheaply. Game theoretical catastrophe for the existing ETH users.

Because there are so many people who don't want to use Coinbase and who want to share it with the rest of us.

That's pure speculation one way or the other. The market knowledge is dispersed among the market participants. No way to know the aggregate of that information. We will see which fork the market prefers and miners will follow.

IDK, if everybody thinks like you, then it's all about who thought about buying now first.

Great to see he's well.

And what did u/Essexal say again?
Edit: For example, it makes sense to say: Demand(p) &gt; Supply(p), when p &lt; p_equilibrium, where p_equilibrium is the equilibrium price, but 'Demand &gt; Supply' says nothing.

Oh yeah, that's absolutely possible. Traders trying to benefit from pumps'n'dumps, Bitcoin maximalists stirring the soup further and so on. Interesting times.
