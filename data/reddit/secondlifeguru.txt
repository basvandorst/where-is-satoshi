We stayed away from Linden Dollars, it cost real money to obtain them.  A small community of some of the better builders colluded to come up with some ideas on what would be good units of value, that is easily exchangeable. One of the other big builders stumbled across BTC(who I have lost contact with), is who started the fad/trend back then.  I wonder to this day whatever happened with him.

After I gave up secondlife, I gave up on bitcoin. 
Hobbies come, and hobbies go, and it it left the grey matter of my mind, and never thought about it since then.
Yes I was enthusiastic about it, but only as electronic trading cards, is how I viewed bitcoin....  I knew that once I posted this thread, there would be support, and there would be people questioning it.
I looked into what would be a good social media method of asking this question, and decided Reddit would be it.  Now that I have seen what this community has grown into, I have respect for everyone involved.  My mind is blown when I read articles about VC being poured into firms over the next 5-8 years, and the predicted statistics in terms of how much is being invested into disruptive companies within "cryptospace".  
In second life, which was, and is still a close nit community, we have always debated about easy ways to exchange units of value, that is not money, and  late 2009 is when it really took off.  I could of participated in the end of 2009, and would of had probably even more now, but don't.
I'll keep everyone informed on what is going to come out over the next few weeks.
