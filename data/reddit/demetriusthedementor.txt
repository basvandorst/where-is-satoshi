Damn how much is that in btc

That's not true. Cryptocurrency is much more efficient than traditional banking systems at moving value from one place to another. The IoT will benefit tremendously from cryptocurrencies and I think that's where most of the value will be realized, so long as we can get to that state of interdependence without running into the pitfalls that can occur naturally without (or even with!) a human intermediary.

That's what I think is going to happen again. A large dump before a massive bull run. I'll think of it as a buy event.
