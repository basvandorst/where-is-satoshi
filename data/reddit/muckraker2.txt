i get asked that a lot by people. they want to know if they have to buy a whole bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2013-08-11 06:52:42
I suppose...but I think it has to do with specs and the such too. So if you're implementing a new smartphone for example, you could go to the ISO body and look up specs on how to make an HDMI connector for it.
At least that's my understanding of what it was intended for.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:53:22
it doesn't do anything when i open it.

Gotta love the New Hampshire plate:
"Live free or die - BITCOIN"
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:38:34
actually china and japan both hold around $2 trillion each. Its a lot, but not quite as much as I thought given all the hype about it.
@_date: 2013-09-17 08:19:05
yeah. i'm confused. the merchants would all still have to be willing to accept bitcoin.
This just sounds like a plugin or something like the btc: uri scheme.
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:30:08
brilliant. we need a decentralized tumbler!
@_date: 2013-05-16 09:01:30
a p2p exchange is what is needed.
@_date: 2013-10-29 05:40:22
no such app in appstore.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:40:13
...aaand its gone again.
@_date: 2013-10-15 07:24:23
Recurring payments. Seems the one thing Bitcoin protocol forgot to support.
@_date: 2013-08-11 06:02:25
I guess. I don't know what the fee is. But some things are good to have agreement on, like plugs.
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:25:50
I get this type of response a lot from people. Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, Bitcoin is for drug dealers.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:08:02
I went to their web site looking for their "open source monetary system"...just found some bullshit 'paid membership' site.

It looks like this is just a front-end for an already existing email server? Too bad, I tried installing an email server on my debian box once or twice. It was a total bitch and I eventually gave up on it.

You bring up an interesting angle. What if the real DPR new SR was compromised or simply wanted to retire -- and being the criminal mastermind he is, framed this dude.

the bitcointalk.org compromise landed me with a hacked pinterest account. They are checking usernames/passwords on popular sites from the bitcointalk.org forum.

i think you done fucked up just now.
@_date: 2013-09-18 03:56:34
i guess you're asking complete strangers to find bugs and hoping they actually report it rather than post it on a hacker forum.

That being said, I bought mine on coinbase and moved them to my private wallet on my computer using MultiBit.

@_date: 2013-10-18 08:10:27
no, they would need access to the email account. if they have that, all bets are off. they are fucked and there's not much i can do about it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:11:08
they will control who has access to them. Its already happening.

@_date: 2013-10-18 04:27:02
i've been using bitcoin about 6 months. what exactly is false about the "no fees" "anonymous" "easy" "instant"? Seems to be pretty true to me, except the anonymous part maybe, but its a lot more difficult to track you than your credit card. 5 cents is a lot less than credit card fees or wiring. and it is nearly instant.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:17:40
i agree.
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:53:56
"bit" or "coin" is the new "e".
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:31:46
how about an encrypted backup. produces a .zip file with everything encrypted that you can just put somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:44:39
well that's not good. how do you know it wasn't a one-time password?
Did they just send you the password that you changed it to? Or did they send you a random new one.
When I coded a password reset, I sent out a random one-time password that expired.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:41:01
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:24:42
oh yeah. i'm sure that's all i need to do. its not like our government will overstep its authority or anything.
@_date: 2013-09-18 04:57:33
maybe but that means changing code...so what is it they are really testing if its not ever going to production that way?
I think it could work...the bugcrowd FAQ says that usually bugs are reported more than once, and get fixed, so exploits are closed anyway, and the hacker looses out on getting the bounty.
I just don't know if the bug/exploit list is publicly available to other users. That would be bad, imo.
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:22:37
HTML5 File api and localStorage. definitely works in FF. Just not IE9 (for File API).

i don't use google authenticator because there was a bug with it that allowed wallets to be emptied.
I don't encrypt because I'm afraid i"ll be unable to decrypt it.
I back up remotely and password protect my wallet with a memorable password. I'm sure I'll get downvoted, but there is security and then there is stupidity. I'm not paranoid enough to think I need a 32 character password only to forget it a few days later.
Of course I don't use windows...so I'm pretty safe compared to everyone who does.
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:30:56
yeah. they just say "debt is good".

@_date: 2013-10-18 06:40:23
seriously. what's the total VC percentage in Bitcoin? .00001?
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:22:37

You can get phished by your bank just as easily as you can a Bitcoin exchange.

I'm surprised the porn industry hasn't jumped all over Bitcoin.
Coinbase already supports recurring payments...which was the one thing I read kept them from adopting it.
@_date: 2013-09-17 08:16:46

Yes. Although it makes me wonder when we'll start seeing Bitcoin around town and on TV.

is it logarithmic scale? That doesn't look like the bubble I saw back in April.
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:11:37
The only concern I heard was what if the transfer fails after paying.
Maybe you can set a cookie or something in localStorage, so when they come back, if they already paid, they can re-download.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:21:31
this is true.
@_date: 2013-08-10 08:02:35
This is good news. .. more mainstream adoption.

Out of curiosity, which anagram solver did you use online? I've been looking for a good one.

If the Bit doesn't fit, you must acquit!
@_date: 2013-09-13 05:47:49
Its' a .US domain. so I'm guessing no. Plus, US is all that matters now.

I don't think individual freedom is a communist idea.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:57:23
ok, so i just looked, its been a year -- this is how SO recommended I do it:
on a reset request, I email out a one-time link, which when clicked triggers a temporary password to be emailed to the email address on file. it requires they have access to the email account in order to lockout a user.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:06:20
you used a pen? you were doing it wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:35:22

haha. did you just edit? i must be confused.
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:24:27
is there any legal risk selling Bitcoin to someone in person?
What if they turn around and hire a hitman with the money, the trail leads straight to you.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:14:06
it would be if there was a actually a way for John-Q public to buy and sell them. I still think that's a year or two off. But when that happens, expect it to skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-08-08 04:56:34
I shared your site with a few people today. Keep it up.
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:39:25
That would be very bad. Copyright laws are not good for people who download.

I don't get it. How does it handle recurring payments?
@_date: 2013-09-17 08:25:55
wtf? you didn't get a tip?

This looks interesting, but the admin panel is not free....do they have a basic panel that is free and open source?
edit: i just checked, it has virtually no features, and they pay admin panel is *way* too expensive for a single user.

so its not a recent photo.
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:30:36
i gotcha. i don't know how easy you would get our money back from a bank if you were phished...but you're right. With Bitcoin there is zero chance of it happening. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 05:17:33
they do have some sort of rating system too. which i guess helps.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:53:05


Sounds like they are slamming Bitcoin a little there.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:07:01
was it a one-time password?

Tell that to the US government.
@_date: 2013-09-18 03:15:47
what's bugcrowd?
@_date: 2013-08-12 08:09:17
multiple domains and emails for example was something I consider a basic necessity.
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:35:15

tumbling system?
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:25:31
no, but it allows you to host hidden services and has yet to be compromised.
