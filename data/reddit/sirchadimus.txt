You need to educate yourself more on what you are investing in. Do you believe in the future and technology of BTC? If so, hold. There will be MUCH MUCH larger swings in the future up AND down, so if that is outside your risk tolerance level, you should take your money and run. Look at the charts for BTC this year alone.

just decide if you are gonna be a long term investor or a day trader. personally I wait for the dips and buy. there are always peaks and valleys.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:34
Remember everyone. HODL strong, buy the dips. Don't FOMO, don't FUD. Be strong brothers.

You tried buying anything with gold lately? lmfao. See yourself out.

Going all in on any 1 thing is just irresponsible and stupid. Diversification is a good thing.
Don't drink the Kool-Aid.

I've heard breadwallet is good, but I'm not on iOS, maybe another user can chime in. You want a wallet with seed ownership, meaning your key is on your phone, and you have access to the seed key and not the app/web.

How does Electrum compare to Jaxx for a wallet?

And you didn't see this scam a mile away? I first saw this shit a couple of years ago and laughed. Use your common sense guys.

Would I be better off using Coinomi instead of Mycellium from the start then? There are literally dozens of wallets, it's a bit overwelming knowing which to choose.

First thing to do is to not leave any currency on an exchange like Coinbase. You want to own your keys. This means a secure wallet. Hardware Wallets are the best, but cost money. There are other secure wallets such as Mycellium (Android) or Electrum (desktop), with different benefits and drawbacks. Do some research, read everything, don't listen to any 1 person.

If I sell 1 BTC for $8000, then buy B2X after the fork at $2000 per, I would have 4 B2X, as opposed to having 1 B2X. 
This was my friend's argument, I guess assuming that since B2X has the support of the Chinese mining pools it will flourish. Also assuming BTC will fall after/before the fork because people are moving to B2X.

You know BTC is accepted as Legal tender in Japan, right? And at many many other places, including Steam, Overstock, etc..

Mycelium doesnt seem to have any info online. Everyone says it's a 
 long established, open source, good wallet, but I don't see much support.

They are if you care about centralization.

He doesn't have to buy a hardware wallet, but a mobile or desktop wallet with seed key ownership is a much better and safer option and doesn't cost him anything.
The bitcoins you have on Coinbase are not FDIC insured. Only your dollar balance with them is. The FDIC is not insuring your bitcoins. Even if they were insuring your bitcoins, you would have to trust them to actually keep their promise to make you whole. They could break their promise. This is called counterparty risk.

I didn't buy before the fork, I actually bought BTC at an ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:29:59
If you don't own your keys, you don't own your coins. Exchanges are risky.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:22:19
Can't buy, says BTC,ETH,LTC all unavailable.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:41:43
Doesn't B2X have the support of all the miners tho? Wouldn't that lean towards B2X having the higher value?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:07:57
So, does that mean if I put my BTC in Mycellium, I would need to use another wallet that supports B2x, plug in my hash code to get the forked (b2x) coins?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:57
They are still down...

What is a 15.x node?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:15:49
Don't look at it.
