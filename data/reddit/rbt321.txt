My limited experience with Bitcoin is that you can't do it with it either. Verification that the transaction was not fraudulent seemed to take hours. Various email money transfer technologies (I.e. Interac e-Transfer) complete and verified in 20 to 30 minutes.
The verification delay makes it challenging to offer downloadable content of any significant value with Bitcoin (I have some content priced in the hundreds of dollars); the fee structure makes the verification risk worth while for the cheap stuff.

Then your not allowing a long enough time line. I guarantee Bitcoin will go bust. I don't know if it will be in 6 months or 6 centuries, but it will have zero value; just like every other currency, company, country, etc. They're all temporary.

What makes you believe this doesn't happen at underground casinos?
Certainly in vegas of the past it was common to change the odds for certain guests.

Interac e-Transfers work essentially like a money order (funds are verified and extracted immediately into escrow by issuing bank) except instead of a piece of paper being exchanged it is an email+secret known by the sender/recipient.
I need to rely on the issuing bank and central agency (Interac handles nearly all debit card purchases in Canada) not committing fraud (both are highly regulated and insured); no trust is necessary for the person who is receiving the product. The person getting the product is the one who would get the benefit of small-scale fraud.
Since it's a money order equivalent, it is not reversible once completed. A court could confiscate and order the return of the funds but the transaction itself cannot be reversed; this would be a new transaction.
Much of Europe has a similar mechanism which they've used to eliminate personal cheques; I'm not familiar with the internal details of it though whether it's like a money order with escrow/trust or like a cheque with a clearance period.

What fundamentals are you using to determine $200 is a good price? Your statement reads like your buying a lucky lottery ticket because of an unusually large pot.
You might be right but I'd place my bets on it creating a Bull Trap between $120 and $130 USD (based on previous major trend line) before settling there.

With any luck, he's advising to cash-out the original investment guaranteeing a worst-case of break-even.
Paper profits can disappear far faster than they were created; particularly when the investment is entirely speculative.
