Authy.app is the worst fucking idea ever invented. 2FA tokens are suppose to be offline not backed up by another hipster startup. Use google authenticator or any other app with the same spec that does not use the net.

Why do people use this joke coin?
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:53:23
This user you are talking to is a Coinbase shill, check his history.

Gee, I will repeat here too.

Legislation is great for incumbents.

"How" indeed.
Still waiting for an answer.

Canada represent! Wow, more and more cool companies opening here.

Just use services by companies that are **not MSB** and have nothing to gain or interest in legislation by not dealing with fiat. Some examples: [Blockchain.info]( [CoinKite.com]( GreenAddress, etc... 
There are two major issues, first MSBs must comply or risk losing their licenses, second it's very common for licenses businesses to try to pull the ladder from under the upcoming companies by asking for more legislation.

You are insane, the two things are opposites.

They also keep a backup key, so what's the point? They have 2 of 3.

The biggest challenge is funding development. Until we find a better model than donations and people start being willing to pay instead of being the product to advertisers we wont see better decentralized solutions.

Coinkite multi-signature is quite good, they let you create the [private keys offline](

They still know who you are and track you, they are a MSB and respond to Fintrac.
There is **no privacy with Coinbase.**
PLEASE READ this open letter

What is a BIP32 wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:33:51
Being paranoid about my devices is not for me. Just the fact that you are exposing the private key on your device to print the paper wallet is already a major issue. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:07:52
I can see now why its useful for a company to use that, how would that benefit the average user?

He was also trolling on hackerne.ws, same pitch.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:34:56
Whats wrong with paying for services? 
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:39:04
Probably ironic because it's impossible to do that with bitcoin.

I'm not jumping to conclusions, simply stating that i'm tried of dealing with security myself. That's all.

Yes a read the wiki, but it's over my head. 
Could someone explain in layman terms?
