If there was equality in mining, I would agree. That might have been the case a few years ago. It may have been Satoshi's ideal. But now, you cannot just create money -- it costs more to mine than you get from it, for the average person. It seems like a handful of entities control all the hashpower and a handful of others control what happens with your Bitcoin (exchanges, wallets/quasi bank account, retailers). Perhaps these entities are better than central banks, but it seems like in every monetary system - even Bitcoin - the power becomes concentrated in the hands of the few. Forgive me for being skeptical; I love Bitcoin, but we can't pretend it's some ideal system when it seems limited so far.

If such a thing were functional, it could have an important role. This controversy the past year has split the community. A good organization of leaders that were chosen by the users could help chart the best direction that makes bitcoin strongest and try to achieve consensus rather than division. Unfortunately, hashpower is all that counts now.

What's the value of the Internet? Of the energy grid? Hard to value, as these are systems of infrastructure that drive much more. The people who own Bitcoin, which essentially acts as public shares in a public system, have set its market cap at around $4 billion at present. Then again, the market cap is a bit fictional, since a trader with a big chunk could leverage the market relatively easily and then buy it up more cheaply. You could add in the mining rigs and mining energy costs, I suppose. Somewhere in there would be its value.

@_date: 2015-04-23 15:38:41
That is weirdly terrific, actually. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:41:51
You are right that CMC just reports and that it shouldn't choose. However, in these still-early days of crypto, that's really where a lot of people discover coins. So if a coin is not listed there, then it really doesn't have much following. If cryptos were more popular and widely used, then CMC would not have such a large influence by merely listing them, so my speculation about future corporate coins is just that...speculation.

As far as I know, eBay is the primary market for these. Track some of the listings and watch what they actually sell for. If it's a bit inflated, that should be a good thing for you as a potential seller. Aside from eBay, maybe try Craigslist or attend some local meetup in your area?

It depends on your belief of how a breakdown in order would come about.

Yeah, I sure wouldn't invest in bonds, either. But I thought the rest of his post was good food for thought. You obviously are a thinking person, but there are plenty of bitcoin and crypto people who are a bit too knee-jerk when it comes to economics. I'm betting few people read beyond the 'negative interest rate' headline. The concept of putting money into circulation is not a bad one to consider, when you see the forest for the trees, though it should not be at the expense of some form of savings and appreciation.

Sure, you can keep moving the decimal point. But that's being pessimistic about a lack of BTC demand. If it's that poor, then BTC is in trouble anyway. And that hasn't been the track record of other recent halvings; Litecoin's probably provides the closest recent example. In the end, though, we won't really know until after the fact.

Hate to say it, but you just described BitShares pretty well. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin; Satoshi himself admitted it wasn't designed to be used for instant transactions, etc. If you use Bitcoin in combination with BitUSD through the BitShares decentralized exchange, as Roger Ver indicated in a recent video, you can have scalability, instant transactions, zero volatility, and keep your Bitcoin.

I'm not banking on an increase, but I think it's the most likely scenario. If you're right, and the price doesn't go up, then the decreased reward will make mining less profitable. For how long do people want to dig holes and fill them in?

The price will have to increase. The economics of mining depends on it. Without mining, Bitcoin will go the way of Alta Vista. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 02:45:08
This is classic supply and demand and it works both ways. If there are fewer BTC (supply) and they are truly useful (demand), then they certainly will rise in price. The market should respond; that's ECON 101. Mining certainly follows the price, but if everybody turns off their rigs because suddenly the hardware and energy costs outweigh the returns, then you've got major scarcity problems and a resulting price increase. I don't think BTC will disappear, so the only real market alternative is higher BTC prices, at least until there is a balance point. For sake of miners and BTC's ongoing viability, that balance point will need to be higher to enable any mining.  
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:52:09

Traders have to measure its weight in something, otherwise it has no value. They could use gold or some other fiat. Maybe someday, these all will be priced in crypto.

That's big indictment of Stellar in this article:
"This is clearly the end of the line for Stellar. I mean, they’re not admitting that, but I mean, my God, you might as well be running a currency on an Excel spreadsheet. Stellar is now counterparty to a currency. And it’s a very weak counterparty. If Stellar Development Corp goes out of business, holders have nothing. Compare that to ripple or Bitcoin—if there was no Ripple Labs, ripple the currency would still exist, just like Bitcoin. The new proposed Stellar protocol defeats the whole purpose of distributing protocol and they’ve had to stop that because their consensus was broken. They’re trying to pin this on Ripple but from where I sit, Ripple has never been more stable. They’ve never been doing more transactions and have something like 90 people on the team. I suspect Jed probably broke something about a month ago, but make no mistake—this is a catastrophe for them. This idea that Jed is gonna invent a new consensus system in a couple of months and their phony 4 million accounts will just sit there and wait …”
“At its core, Stellar is no longer a cryptocurrency. It’s a token form counterparty, and what is the risk of that counterparty? They don’t disclose how much money they make. I mean that’s why the SEC exists, right? So not only can you not rely on transactions of any kind going through because, as the sole validator, Stellar is the entire arbitrator of that, you’re holding assets that used to be a digital asset that is now a digital liability. That’s a fundamental change, especially ironic coming from Jed, the purist libertarian. Now he runs a sort of unregistered central issuer of liability. It’s really stunning.”

It does look pretty nasty. Being publicly traded, it is subject to some SEC regulation, and so they won't necessarily get away with the Wild West antics we've seen in the cryptosphere. But that also means they need to be more careful. There are ways to pump that are legal, but plenty of penny stocks have had government problems for playing fast and loose.

So Bitcoin's volatility problems can be solved by hedging with BitUSD. Wallet on the way. Very cool!

Bitcoin's volatility issues have been solved, once and for all!

For some of us, it does. But when 99.99% of everything we need is denominated in fiat, we still care whether Bitcoin is worth $1 or $1000.

The volatility issue is overblown. With BitPay or Coinbase, etc., one can cash out every day into fiat. Better yet, as you've indicated, there are other cryptos and services that allow someone to hedge the price without going back into actual fiat.

It is getting pretty old to see this same picture on something like 1/10th of all postings (slight exaggeration, but not by much).
