Nice ad, perhaps a little bit too long for my liking if I had to criticize.
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:50:25
I've used multiple Australian exchanges and your experience is not going to be that different than what yours was at the others. They will all ask for ID, none of them let you buy bitcoin with Credit cards yet and they will all ask you to verify ownership of bank accounts. 
None of this was surprising to me as I play at a lot of Australian bookmakers where the processes share a lot of similarities but I can understand how someone who does not and thinks it will be super easy to buy and sell bitcoin in seconds as the advertising likes to imply may be mislead.
I've had good experiences with both Coinjar and btcmarkets(they both let you verify identity electronically and quickly) and while I have an account with Igot I am yet to buy or sell there. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:32:32
I also watched this and while most of the piece centered around the silk road and inaccurately reported details relating to Ross Ulbricht I agree that some people watching will be intrigued and introduced to bitcoin as a result of the segment. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:22:38
Well within the confines of using a web-based wallet you are doing basically everything you can within reason. The only other thing I would suggest if you are super paranoid is to only log into your wallet on a separate computer that has a trusted linux OS installed on it.
The more secure thing would be to generate a paper wallet offline though and send the majority of your coins there and leave a small amount in your blockchain wallet for spending/general transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-09 02:05:04
This is what the OP is referring to: 
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:48:02
But by that bitcoin being essentially lost the number of total bitcoins available reduces and increases the value of your holdings.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:27:07
Surprised that you listed Coinjar as a wallet and not an exchange, I would put it in both or if I could only put it in one I would bit it under exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:44:32
Glad you finally got your coins.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:19:44
Every single transaction ever made is public, you can easily find out how much bitcoin each address possesses and which address they have sent bitcoin to and from which addresses they have received bitcoin but that does not necessarily mean you know who owns each address.
So bitcoin is not anonymous but if you don't associate yourself publicly with your address I will never know it belongs to you. So bitcoin can be fairly anonymous if you take precautions and tools like Darkwallet are being worked on to provide greater anonymity. 
But anyone describing bitcoin as being "so anonymous" is wrong at this point in time.

I like Peter but once again he fails to acknowledge that bitcoin's strength is its decentralization, transparency, convenience, low fees and speed. 
No one is trying to argue with Peter that digital ones and zeros alone are more valuable than a big chunk of a precious metal yet this is how he reacts in each of these videos/debates.

I know exactly how you feel. I find it very difficult to walk away from a sports bet with a loss and my instinct is to bet to gain back the losses. You simply have to find something else to divert your attention away from the impulse and that impulse to regain lost funds will subside. If you can learn the dangers of problem gambling by losing some video game gold you will be doing better than the vast majority of gamblers. 
Read the horror stories ferretinjapan posted and don't think that they only happen to other people. Gambling can be an extremely slippery slope and instead of dwelling on what minor losses you may have incurred you should focus on what major losses you haven't. So many problem gamblers would love a reset of their lives back to the point in which you find yourself battling the first impulses.

Move your mouse around for the sake of randomness. When that is done, click on paper wallet. Print out paper wallet(s). Send bitcoin to the address on the paper wallet. Check that the bitcoin has been recieved by the paper wallet by looking at the paper wallet's address on blockchain.info/blockr.io etc. Give paper wallet to friend.

As someone pointed out Coinbase is not a true web wallet but if you are not going to use bitcoin for "illegal" things then it would probably be fine and depending on where you live it could be your best choice for buying bitcoin.
I would personally use a blockchain.info wallet though as you are in control of your private key and the signup process is a lot faster and less intrusive as blockchain.info is not a bitcoin seller.
This is all preference though and honestly any wallet listed [here]( is a good bet.

I'm not sure I'm interpreting this proposal correctly but I just don't think there would be enough interest for something like this at this point in time from either the general public or bitcoin enthusiasts. 
The largest MMA promotion, UFC would not just let fans pick matchups and if they did it would only be in very rare situations. There is a ranking system in the UFC and no one approaching a title shot wants the public to decide they have to fight some guy ranked 25th in the division or something. 
That leaves the lesser MMA promotions and they are just struggling to get enough people to watch/buy tickets let alone partake in bitcoin voting systems. 
I just don't feel there would be enough demand to make something like this worthwhile at this point.

Yeah, it seems at this point that despite any potential advertised perks when it comes to igot you are better off going with btcmarkets or coinjar when it comes to online buying and selling.
You probably saw [this]( post a little while ago as I did and since then I have been pretty wary of them. This being said, I decided I would finally verify my account with them and see how a deposit and purchase would go. I uploaded the exact documents they asked for only for one of them to be rejected. I made a support ticket asking why it was rejected and only got a copy/paste response. I uploaded the same set of documents again and then for whatever reason they decided not to reject them this time and I could move onto the next phase of the verification (The deposit). No apology or admittance of error rubbed me the wrong way and while this is nothing compared to your story or the story of others it is enough to make me not want to bother any further with them at this point in time.

Because the idea of paying $100+ or whatever they cost to secure coins is silly when I can do the same thing with literally a pen and paper. Don't get me wrong, Trezor is great for a lot of people and I am glad it solves a problem for them but I don't see myself needing one anytime soon.
When people pop up with these stories saying they lost 40 coins or they lost 20 coins or whatever amount you never hear them say that they made a paper wallet, sent the coins there and suddenly they are gone. They always tend to be wanting to trust third parties with large sums of bitcoin out of laziness. 
As many have recommended before, place the majority of your coins in cold storage and leave a small amount in web/mobile wallets for everyday spending.

It is easy to conclude the decision not to continue gambling would be the right one when you find yourself in a 200, 500, 10000 dollar hole. The challenge you face currently is making the right move using only the hindsight of others. If you were to put $50 in satoshidice and gamble it you are obviously statistically likely to lose. What do you do then, throw in $100 to try and get it back, start betting in bigger increments? What do you do when you lose that $100 and you are further blinded by rage and frustration. 
I've been in these situations and all I can really say is take it from someone who has made the wrong decision more than once to consider yourself lucky and just focus on other things in life. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:14:10
