FWIW -- I'm definitely not the competition. I'm someone who's reluctant to post under his/her regular name because I'm afraid of tangling with (possible) bots.
Is the fanbase being rallied to pummel *this* post with downvotes?

Seriously? I make a comment linking to a [post questioning]( whether or not the massive upvoting of "dentist accepting bitcoin" is natural, and the comment gets downvoted to oblivion (minus 7) within 10 minutes?
News of how a single dentist accepts bitcoin must be really, *really* important.

For further context, yesterday, this is posted:
**Square Market now accepts Bitcoins**
Which is a link to a post on [engadget.com]( for chrissakes, and it only gets 17 upvotes. 
But some dentist accepting bitcoin? Posted on the coinkite blog? ZOMG! ZOMG! 65 upvotes &amp; counting.

**ZOMG! Must upvote!** This is AMAZING! Or, this is just [totally unnatural upvoting](

Okay 5 upvotes for this post in about 90 seconds. Just waiting for the downvoting "troops" to be mobilized like they were for [my post two weeks ago]( on this same topic.

I have absolutely *nothing* against coinkite, but I find it more than a little unnerving at how coinkite-related posts seem to be nearly 100% successful at finding their way to the front page.
If they're positive.
