FYI, half of the mine is part of the 100/500TH mine (more info can be found at picostocks.com)

There were some inaccuracies, but overall a pretty good discussion and explanation for new people.

It's about scale. As a single entity, you'd need to source megawatts of power and space. If you sell machines, you distribute that to your customers. IMO it's a lot easier to sell machines than to build/find infrastructure for all the chips you can produce. An ASIC company can also do both...sell and mine.

Any feedback? 
At least tell me the UI is horrible and the pages are filled with walls of text. :)

heh, who would have thought? esports appears to be an up and coming sector...amazon bought twitch.tv for ~$1B =P
I actually find watching some esports more entertaining than watching regular pro sports.

I noticed you uploaded two videos. I released the tamer of the two =P Plus, there are some copyright issues on your longer video...maybe you previously uploaded it (youtube didn't allow monetization of the video).
anyway thanks for the trial!

i don't think it's bitcoin, but being a bitcoiner it was definitely one of the first things that crossed my mind. regardless, it'll be interesting to see what new payment method they'll be supporting.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:45:22
I think all the steps I listed make it seem more complicated than it really is. Really, you just tweet to create a bounty then upload your video if the bounty gets funded. thanks for the feedback tho!
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:26:35
After you DM your code, goto the claimbounty page. e.g.  then enter you code

that's actually my rig...not the OPs.
the rig is under an awning and covered with cardboard (to an extent), so rain shouldn't be a problem unless there is some crazy wind.

Compare these logs with Nefario's comments from this video:

that's right. the BFL single is doing about 768MH/s (supposed to do ~832MH/s). The phone has 2 cores and does ~250KH/s each.

stop being an ass, youaresatoshi.
it'd be unethical for them NOT to test their machines on main net. how can you sell/release a product that hasn't been thoroughly tested in it's REAL operating environment?
as a customer...i damn well expect functional testing to occur on main net. they don't need to run THashes on main net, but a couple of real machines being tested as they are going to be used is definitely required.

FYI, I developed a service that can be used for something I called Challenge Funding.  Essentially, the community can challenge someone to create a video for bitcoin. The community crowdfunds the bounty and it is up to the challengee whether or not to accept. The video can be whatever the challenger wants (e.g. Ice Bucket challenge or whatever). Coindeo (me) will validate the video and release the funds if the criteria for the challenge is met. If the challengee doesn't accept then funds are refunded (if refund address is provided) after 2 weeks.

Not exactly what you're looking for but I'm currently testing a platform that can be used to tip/fund content creators for videos.

For those that don't know, these are ASICS (55/65nm).
These two groups will be using the chips:

mtgox loves these swing days. the higher the volume the higher they make in fees. it's a mtgox feature (for them to make them more $)!

Great, US based exchange. Deposits through Dwolla are usually pretty quick.
No verification is needed unless you want to transfer more than $1000 a day. If you deposit more than $1000, they'll roll the balance over to the next day, but this might take a while. 
I *believe* they manually confirm deposits and withdrawls, so deposits and withdrawls are processed during "business hours".
Dwolla Deposits: Monday to Friday 9 AM - 9 PM, Weekends 10 AM - 4 PM
Dwolla Withdrawals: Monday to Friday 9 AM - 9 PM, Weekends 10 AM - 4 PM
ACH/Wire Withdrawals: Processed Monday to Friday at 2 PM
Paper Deposits: Credited on weekdays at 6 PM
Paper Withdrawals: Mailed out every Tuesday and Friday at 2 PM
I've always wondered why they don't advertise more since they have such a mature platform...I'm thinking they want to stay under the radar.

cool.

Omg. I'm dying. That's some funny shit.

you don't even need a proxy to bet. all you do is send btc to an address. the website is just for looks and stats.

not sure what other kind of graphs you're looking for.
there are some charts in their business plan: 
note: their assumptions were made based on a BTC price of **$17**.
