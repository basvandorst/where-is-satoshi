I just watched this episode.  I was surprised to see the joke.  It felt vindicating to me; it wasn't a joke towards Bitcoin, but a joke including Bitcoin.  
Every day it feels like Bitcoin is becoming more and more accepted.
Maybe our peers and seniors don't get it; but the next generation and the next... They won't have the bias or lack of tech knowledge that currently exists among the majority of adults today.

I enjoyed reading the article.  It breaks down a lot of the tech jargon that makes it difficult to talk about Bitcoin to the layman.

It hit me really hard when I saw the headline just now.  Thank you for this well written piece.  We lost a very significant person.

I just finished watching the episode.  I thought it was amazing! They brought back paintball and made it interesting again!
I thought it was a pretty funny line about Bitcoin.
As painful as it is to use, it's worth putting up with Yahoo to watch the new episodes of Community.

Here's another question; why is someone who sells DIY alarm systems and monitoring services using different dark markets or why someone who sells DIY alarm systems would be interested in dark markets?

I don't trade; but it's interesting to read solid explanations for the terms I see around here and r/bitcoinmarkets a lot.
Thank you for providing some well written and important information to the sub, fucknozzle.
