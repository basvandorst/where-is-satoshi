It is now subsidised by mining reward of new coins creation

When you get a court order you'll have to refund the money even if they were paid via Bitcoin. Court is also a kind of 3rd party, just more expensive.

There are many problems with Paypal, I am far from seeing it as ideal platform, it was just surprised me that the transaction cost in Bitcoin so much more expensive across the board.

There are also many dodgy merchants around hence Paypal looks safer for customers as well as credit cards.
What I think however it is that side of story is different from transaction time.

Not sure that I follow you
The logic of calculation is pretty simple - total money earned by miners / number of transactions.
People from Blockchain.info use the same logic.
The same logic is used to calculate Paypal part

Paypal doesn't print money, it is the job of central banks and I haven't heard they give away that printed money for free to Paypal. 
But more important that if you think about miners motivation, you find that with reduction of miner reward in new coins direct transaction fees paid by customers will increase. They are already higher than $2 (around $8) now.

Appreciate your attention.
I compared money miners earned with money Paypal earned, not the money merchant spent, you haven't check the facts carefully. It is exactly apples with apples.
Average transaction cost now with Bitcoin is around $40 (it was $14 end of Q2), from there transaction fee is ~20%, so close to $8.
I think that quite well understand what is transaction time, in both cases I treat is as a time when the network/platform confirms the transaction validity. With Bitcoin it is when it is included in the blockchain (accepted into a mined block and added to the public ledger) , with Paypal it is when Paypal confirms the transaction (transaction is included in Paypal centralised ledger).

With Paypal I would call it as a risk to be reversed, not confirmation.
I think it is a different thing.
Even with Bitcoin if you are a merchant you may have to issue refund. Say you sold a product that fell apart the next day your customer got it. 
The difference is that with Bitcoin it will be a new transaction, not refund as a part of the same transaction.
