That's what I have been saying and saying and saying.  It creates payment hubs that will be intermediated by BANKS.  And bitcoin people that sell out to this deserve the nothing they will be left with.  These payment hubs can use any underlying asset class.  So this really has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all.  EXCEPT THAT (ALMOST) EVERYONE WORKING AT CORE WORKS AT BLOCKSTEAM THE COMPANY MAKING THE LIGHTNING NETWORK A GIGANTIC AND TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  So they have an interest in shutting down the network, and that's what they are doing and almost zero people get at all what is going on.

Yes, but don't let that confuse you.  I would rate Matonis as working for the wrong side, but that doesn't make him wrong in his statements about LN creating banking cartels that could blockade payments.  I see Mike Hearn as generally advancing the interests of bitcoin, though a few years back he did do something that could have been considered an attack on fungibility.  Best to decide all these things on the merits.

Maybe you should be worried about it destroying the monetary applications.  Hubs will be invariably run by larger entities namely Banks.  They are trying to say they can do it without hubs but that appears unlikely and has not been solved yet.  In any case six of the very top coders work for blockstream, when in fact, those people should be nowhere near bitcoin code.  If they were it should be in a clearly recognized blockstream unit that would be considered an unlikely competing alternative.

Let's see it's a decentralized autonomous network and a board with no money and 5 people votes out 2 people.  Think about it!! You might as well say they decided to split from you! and that you are the foundation.  So just come up with a plan like you say you want and start raising money.  First step, it should be the Foundations position that anyone working at Blockstream should not work at Core.

Your a troll that wants to run a Blockstream Hub stop following me.  Banks are stuck with reversible transactions, that may or may not benefit them, but bitcoin has transactions that are final not reversed.  Banks don't like that because it reduces fees below the costs for banks to do business so they lose out.  So Todd is offering to hobble bitcoin so that transactions will have similar costs.  Todd likely cannot do it with Core code just yet, but he can try to force people onto LN where transactions can be made that require refunds and you will be forced to use those types of transactions.  
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:28:21
But ripple would allow any currency as settlement, and so would  LN.  So bitcoin becomes totally unnecessary.  Ripple requires IOUs and gateways read BANKs.  So LN puts your money in banks or what's called 'hubs', complete with cartels, and blockades.  What kind of solution is this?  And they plan to do it with what they call soft forks.  So you can't refuse your node just runs whatever they put in.

Quick Answers:
1.  Why only central bankers can use LN?  Firstly not necessarily only central bankers.  Answer: Because it requires Hubs or pots of bitcoins on the block chain.  Think about it, if transactions with bitcoins have been successfully bottle-necked by unnecessary unreasonable restrictions on block size then you can't send by definition.  So your money has to be sitting in a HUB.  But bitcoin is no more relevant to that HUB than anything else!  Even if the hub is  based on bitcoin payments it is still a BANKER solution.  They can print and blockade funds.
2.  Why it could use another payment system like Visa?  Well the LN doesn't care they are a BANK they can use any currency.  They Should even use their own tokens instead!  And they might.

Look at the employee list at Blockstream team, Look at who wrote the Blockstream side chain white paper.  Then look at the Core coders list.  Consider the interests of Blockstream to hobble and force transactions off the bitcoin network and onto their future Lightning Network.  Then you will understand what is going on.  Consider Peter Todds classic Double Spend vector attack against bitcoin RBF, his bizarre statements about banks not liking irreversible transactions, Core actions to allow miners to just turn transactions off and Core refusal to increase block size along with key media outlets calling this negligence a 'debate'.

Lighting doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin.  They can collateralize it with any underlying payment.  Bitcoin is out of the loop Central Bankers and printing is in.

Beg to differ.  Hard forks are good and though possibly contentious not necessarily a threat at all.  Key is requiring a clear majority of blocks mined and then advance notice of the fork.  What is a Gigantic and Existential Threat to bitcoin is the soft forks of Core that require ZERO consensus.  RBF was one such soft fork.  No debate no consensus just put in by Core.  These soft forks allow a group of coders (supported mostly by one corporate entity with interests potentially at odds to the benefit of the network) to do mega harm.  I didn't say they are deliberately trying to harm the network, though I wouldn't rule that out as a tenable theory.  Our concern should be about the soft forks that are occurring with little  debate and totally without consensus.  But I don't see you asking for a truce on these issues.  And it's not really a truce saying go ahead and let Core deliberately and again without consensus insert the tentacle of the LN directly into the Core code which is in fact what they are doing and that does include the block size limit, in fact that's what this is really about a deliberate plan supported by propaganda and lies to restrict the block size so as to force transactions off the network.  And we are supposed to make a truce on your terms of allowing that to continue?  Do you have a plan to force Core to put in a can kick blocksize increase?  Why don't you say something like: "the conflict of interest of Core coders getting 2/3 of their funding from Blockstream is totally unacceptable and those coders should recuse themselves voluntarily from working on this project, or if they do work on it then that should be at Blockstream and they can submit their code for review to other coders who have no such conflict of interest."

Yes, don't ban people who have substantive things to say and who do so respectfully.  Then do ban people who make personal attacks and who divert issues.  Then the question of or desire to view banned posts would be far less relevant.  (so I think I am on topic)  Don't define XT as an alt coin when it means bitcoin will be bottle-necked with small blocks.  Do allow the important people who have had their posts banned here to come back and post those topics about block size etc.  Do change your mod team.  Here is good advice: get some mods who believe in things like reasonably sized blocks.  Who oppose things like RBF, who realize CORE should be called Blockstream Core.  Then maybe eventually the community would begin to trust you somewhat again.  When you say you ban trolls I wonder was it some who have argued on topic substantively for things like block size increases, against RBF, against Blockstream Core?

See this:
In some cases the LN requires MORE bitcoin transactions, 
it also arguably requires hubs that will be run by large financial institutions.  Core coders have a classic conflict of interest because most of their funding comes from blockstream, and they appear to be acting on this conflict of interest.  
LN is analogous to a vine overlaid on bitcoin what we can think of as a tree.  Things like RBF are like roots which allow the vine to connect into the core of the tree.  We see LN is a parasitical infestation.  Sorry to spoil your illusions of riches that all those banker controlled hubs were going to bring.  LN can use any asset class as the initial input (read it can infest more than one tree, just as vines often do spreading across one tree top to another.

The only problem with bip101 is that miners, possibly for good reason, don't like being locked into future rather extravagant block sizes of 8GB.  All this is unnecessary and needs to be taken out of bip101, but sadly I think the momentum there is to resist change.  It is sad because the automatic increases are not needed or possibly anticipated correctly at this point.  In fact there may be other solutions.  On another note someone made a comment about hating Blockstream Core coders whom many of them work for Blockstream which has an interest in bottlenecking the network so transactions can be moved off.  I don't like bad people who act on conflicts of interest, but I don't bother with making assumptions.  My view would simply be that they should be no where near the code or the debate.  They have a irreconcilable conflict of interest, and we all know how careful they are about doing things like increasing block size so where is the care?

Sorry I get a bit wound up sometimes.  Anyway, the problem would be you would have nodes collecting taxes based on ownership of 'shares' which would be somewhat centralizing.  You would be one small step from also printing new coins which just gets back to the system we are getting away from.  We talk a lot about what is  going to support nodes.  I think it really won't take that much maybe less than a penny a transaction, especially as we move forward and find new ways to make blocks smaller, and as storage increases.  We also  have pruning which reduces the size of blocks.  So it's much easier to just put in a tiny fee.  Yes, people will try to centralize bitcoin, that's sort of what Core is doing with LN they want to put big companies in charge of wallets and payment hubs.  We always have to resist the centralizing factors or lose  what bitcoin is about.

Even if Core couldn't do it now without a hard fork they would need one eventually.  When they make the next hard fork they will change the code so they can do more than ever with soft forks including make more coins if they wanted to yet.  FYI soft forks are passive aggressive and require no consensus except that of whoever has commit permissions at Core.  Soft forks are dangerous because they can change a lot about bitcoin and you have to run it if you have a node.  Hard forks if done by requiring 80 percent or more adoption first obviously require consensus they are safer and less likely to fundamentally alter bitcoin.  And FYI in case you didn't  know Core is run by people who love soft forks.

Because you could fund LN with Gold, Fedcoin, LiteCoin, and basically **Any** Asset Class.  So LN becomes another payment scheme, like say for example Ripple of which there are many disturbing similarities such as centralized companies that plan to make money off the said network.  So Is LN any different than any other alt coin in respect to it being a **replacement** of bitcoin?  LN is sold as a supplement that will enrich bitcoin holders but that is a total lie.  Just like the total lie that bitcoin cannot be scaled.  The bitcoin holders that support a centralized paradigm in order to get perceived riches will get only their coins replaced by another system.

Is bitcoin in competition with other currencies to be the currency that is used?  Where do the Core coders get their money?  Does money affect human behavior?  Are conflicts of interest generally accepted in other fields? Disciplines?  What is the reason we do not accept conflicts of interest?  Can they be dangerous?  Lead to problems?

Once all the coins are mined and the block rewards finish very small transaction fees can be used to support nodes.  One of the key ideas about bitcoin that you may be missing is that it is decentralized.  If you like central governments that promise to do things for people you may have trouble recognizing the value of these decentralized systems.  So anyway no there can be no central node, and forced taxes on ownership of coins is a terrible idea.  Luckily it is unlikely to ever happen or if it did people would just use some other coin.

I am quite well aware of the fact that there are other implementations.  I was really making an argument about decentralization and how the existence of a single monopolistic implementation goes against that principle.  We think of miners but rarely do we consider other important centralizing factors such as Core.  So my whole point was really about using other implementations.  Certainly I do not deny they exist.  I am arguing that it is a really bad idea that one implementation Core is run on 90% of the nodes.  It's a fair argument not a rant, but make up your own mind.

It would be compatible with any block chain there can be no doubt of that.  There is nothing special about the bitcoin say versus the Litecoin block chain that makes LN incompatible with Litecoin.  That could be deliberately built in, but rather they would likely allow it to work with any block chain.  Furthermore bankers are working on dollar block chains, and assets can be put into block chains.  The most likely ultimate scenario would be linking LN to a dollar block chain rendering bitcoin obsolete unnecessary and useless as transactions if it were used by any significant percent of people would cost too much due to their block size bottleneck.

I have not yet formed an opinion on these CT transactions and what it means.  First evidence points to the possibility that this could be a good thing.  That said it is important to NOT just assume things coming from Core are good.  Things that change the nature of bitcoin transactions should be looked at very carefully.  The problem is most of us are not coders or even if we can code we may not understand this area of coding.  A bit of skepticism about what Core is up to is a totally healthy thing even if that group was not compromised by a conflict of interest (which it is) because most of their money comes from Blockstream a private company that has a financial interest in LN.  I am just explaining a bit the reason for my initial skepticism.

But that they are not deliberately circlejerking, trying to cause cognitive distress, trying to instigate disruptions, or making personal attacks.   People who don't do those things should be free to have any view.  But this is worse than you think: (At least some of) The mods are also trolls.  The problem here is not so easily fixed.  Maybe we need to find the non troll mods maybe the original ones and ask: How did the troll ones get in?  Is it impossible to remove them?

let me add:  I found a quote at brainy qoutes:
"By a continuing process of inflation, government can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.  John Maynard Keynes" unbelievable what a criminal.   How does the media worship people like this? 
Next, a third reason it fails:  It's like taking a bucket, putting it in a lake, filling it with water, walking to the other side, msnbc watching with cameras, and pouring it back in saying your raising the water level.  (You see you have to take money out of the economy to put it back in)  Plus most of the money is wasted, the most inefficient people on the planet use it to enrich themselves, and the percent that goes back in the lake is less than they took out.

Even that theory is rubbish.  No offense I know your just quoting the theory.  All ecosystems need boom and bust and gentle up and down cycles.  It is economically necessary.  Every natural system has cycles and they serve a purpose.  Women have cycles.  Seasons, Ice Ages, All natural systems.  Only moronic keynesian's can't see that.

Best to get the truth out before something worse happens.  I pointed out Jeff's fallacies (mostly ad hominem reasoning)  in another post and got nothing but downvotes, though pretty sure I analyzed it correctly.  Maybe I shouldn't complain about that as it is typical sometimes the best posts are down voted more.  But maybe some don't want to deal with the real issues.  And reflecting on it if we don't want a centralized foundation the LEAST we would require is that they be transparent.  Lack of transparency would be the first mega concern we should have and that is what Oliver was concerned about, along with centralization of development solely controlled by the foundation.

Sure, yes, of course, I agree, but one thing this has to do with regulations, and they can and will try to do the same to bitcoin.

If you start taking them out they will disappear.  My opinion is it won't take several mods that long.  There is probably less than 50 really serious trolls and most of them are not going to make their accounts over every day.  If they do ban them again.  Look online there are lots of good resources about the techniques they use such as personal attack, or the straw man fallacy.  They also attack personally the bitcoin community.

I read Gavin's post, and it looks like it may not have gone as well as expected.  I think the problem with the foundation is that no one has a clear structured vision of how things should be organized.  
We can immediately throw out the centralized model as that is total failure.    In the case of decentralized models, even totally decentralized models, we have to figure out how to do that which is not easy.  Most likely some form of nodal federation is going to be necessary.  The political organization should reflect the nature of the network.    
Clearly the Foundation should not control the coders or the standards.  That needs to be written into any foundation that expects to receive funding.  What the foundation should do is represent the community.  If the community is split then the foundation should represent that the community is split.  There should be clear limitations placed on what the foundation can and cannot do.  What the foundation cannot do should be the task of other organizations such as an independent standards committee or an independent group of developers.  
Let's just say we have a tripartate distribution of powers.  Each branch should itself be a nodal federation where no central node has any more power than simply representing the community.  So in each case we have a distributed network of responsibilities that is similar in structure to the bitcoin network itself.
This respects the nature of the network, prevents the emergence of central control points that are MEGA network vulnerabilities, and leaves power in the hands of a distributed network, while at the same time vesting power to act in the hands of central nodes that have the power to act, but only to the extent that they represent the community.  If any central node ever took an action that did not represent the larger community then they would lose funding and simply not be followed, possibly what might happen to the current Bitcoin foundation.  But we would be lucky if some more sinister group did not step in and fund them which is why their powers need to be limited in the first place.  
All this is admittedly generalities but it is these that need to be debated until the specifics are generated.   Clearly the current structure is inadequate.

Most of the world uses some form of credits to buy phone minutes.  A slight discount for bitcoin users would create a massive incentive towards global adoption.  Especially when you consider the income in some countries is very low.  So paying some small fraction of their phone bills if they used bitcoins would cause them all to adopt overnight with the right app.  Just brainstorming :)  and sorry i didn't mean to be saying you must do this or that just a suggestion.

The USD is guaranteed to always go to zero.  The half life of USD value must be around 20-30 years.  Volatility is not bad compared to absolute 100% guaranteed depreciation to zero.  But, as everyone remarks bitcoin is still just starting out.  It is amazing how the msm can't appreciate that fact.  Someone should check and see if they say the same about small cap companies as if they are to have intrinsic and forever volatile valuations.  xyz small cap has an intrinsic problem it's valuation is volatile.  We don't want xyz small cap getting bigger its valuation is volatile.   xyz small cap keeps increasing in value owning shares is deflationary...

Actually, in my view, this was good news.  They really (appear) to be doing exactly what is needed to gain back trust.  They are going to separate into three corporations: the first focused on the community and promotion, the second core development and finally standards.  This should do a lot to reduce concerns, and it should help to prevent an over centralized organisation.  We need these organisations and constant vigilance is required to make sure the represent the community.

I am new to this measure, but a quick reading indicates that this thread is a total misrepresentation of the facts.  Firstly, the notice states: 
"I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order."
That means there is no such list it is created instantly along with the confiscation of funds if I am reading correctly.  Next, the list is potentially general enough to include anyone.  For example simply having:
"private financial gain"
is enough to get you on this list.  
Again this whole topic is new for me, and I just downloaded the pdf:
So when  paleh0rse  says:
"For starters, it's NOT a secret list; and, as of today, Snowden is NOT on it."
That's just how trolls lie, because yes it  really isn't a secret list it's just the next person whose assets they seize.  It is a list created on the fly at their whim with zero due process.  We need to smarten up, but half those agreeing are trolls too.

I think established interests are concerned about the disruptive effects of bitcoin.  But they want to use the technology for their own purposes.  Hence IBM is investing 3 billion in doing this.  Most likely they will centralize it, print it, and do whatever it takes to make it the system people use.  Their system will have similar disadvantages to the old one, but that does not mean it won't succeed.  Money is very important to the established classes.  Us bitcoiners generally have zero clue what we are up against.  We are naive, idealistic and generally clueless about what they will do to subvert this technology.  The topic here is about how they use words to confound most people, and successfully so.

You misread.  I said I don't believe that's what he had in mind.  He knew what he was up to.  Yes, you quoted the theory correctly.  I was not debating that.  Your missing the first point which is he knew what he was doing and it had little to do with his farcical theory.  I mentioned I had read some quote recently where he admitted it. 
Next you go the long way around to say the theory would be good but doesn't work in practice.  Well we disagree half way.  I think it wouldn't be good and it doesn't work in practice.  
And just to recap we have two reasons it doesn't work:
1.  It opposes natural cycles which are necessary.
2.  It leads to infinite printing which leads to serfdom.

let's see what they do.  I think it may evolve to a simple system of global trading in any asset and the assets can be converted to local currency instantly.  I am not sure there is ever a need for a non asset backed currency in this ultimate system.  Imagine a global trading platform.  Converting to local currency is same as selling and buying say Euro.  Then making a purchase is same as withdrawing from your account.  They just don't want to allow this or they could already do it, but bitcoin may force them.  On the other hand if they refuse to do this bitcoin wins.

Fallacy begging the question.  Of course we agree on what current governments do.  I am aware they assign citizenship / don't allow non citizens within their territories except under circumstances they define.  I am trying to tell you about a new paradigm.  And your wrong there are countries (you surely won't recognize them that do not force citizenship)  Part of this involves changing your idea of what a country is from some tyrannical regime that says you must be a citizen to reside within a given territory to ones where citizenship is voluntary.  I told you it is a paradigm shift.  You cant say citizenship is involuntary **because that's how it works** at least not when someone is saying consider this other way.  To not make the fallacy you have to justify the way it currently works versus the new paradigm.  
"Most micronations can't even get up enough cash"
No one ever said any are successful yet.  
"This is why Civil wars start."
Now your blaming civil wars on micronations but that's not a correct view.  By definition of what I said above they, depending on which one, may not force anyone to be a citizen.  Anyway  really you make a big mistake here as wars are the paradigm of the sort of countries you support: Political operations that fight over territories.  Look at history.

A federation of foundations, where if any centralized foundation exists it's powers are strictly limited.  Then multiple standards organizations who operate independently of the foundations, along with developers who again operate independently.  A separation and limitation of powers model.  A community where each organization carries out it's tasks.  If any particular component gets hijacked it need be no more than a single node entity that can be replaced.  Also the centralized foundation if it exists should have no powers over the local foundations, especially funding.

No comments, let me start by saying I think this if true is a step in the right direction.  A distribution and separation of powers is very important.  Promotion, education and community development are very appropriate foundation tasks.  Core development should be left to another group, and standards yet another separate entity.  Even at that we may not want to look at a single foundation model.  Perhaps a distributed 'nodal' federation of foundations would be best.

I hope so but they are betting 3 billion your wrong.  They can premine it and they don't need to mine anyway just clear transactions, same as bitcoin after it gets to 21 million.  I think that wouldn't require more than a few in house servers.  They can charge a minimal transaction fee to offset costs.  The blockchain does not have to be non centralized, nor is mining necessary or bitcoin won't work either when it gets to 21 million.  It can run on 100 nodes say all located  in house.  That said I am hoping that their systems will run amuk and miss some benefits of bitcoin.  I think this could go either way.  Edit I add: They may be looking at tokens backed by Fiat.  Transactions will always appear in the national currency.  JP Morgan also saying they are interested int the 'technology'.  The sharks are circling.

I can say it looked really positive when the foundation announced separate corporations for promotion, core development, and standards.  That was enough for me to not worry about the details of the politics.  I think there is serious work to be done and want to see that happen. 
I don't know the details but he can position himself as he wants he still has to follow process to get the position.  I think he was more interested in core development anyway.

Not when it is done as a form of disruption.  When people disrupt they try to stop free speech from occurring.  They make emotional attacks, try to get the community fighting, and generally derail the issues.  Their actions can prevent free speech from occurring and quite successfully I might add.  There is nothing about a private conversation where trolls are not invited that violates free speech.  In fact if the trolls did not make such personal attacks or use such degenerate disingenuous methods I personally wouldn't mind them.  But even then there is a place for people with like views to talk together without such bother and that has zero to do with censorship.

Here's the deal.  Bitcoin is no fees because transactions are irreversible, which is a better system, but requires a community to record businesses that are frauds.  For now Paypal does that which is what costs 3%.  If you want no fees you have to keep track of what businesses are scams yourself.  Also, the government should prosecute theft, and fraud, but well your tax dollars go to big corporations and bureaucrats instead.  So again bitcoin is a better system but we require a community to do what government doesn't and what paypal charges 3% to do.

According to this page it can be used to encrypt data:
but it doesn't decrypt it.  So I see it may not count as encryption as it does not decrypt data.  On the question of an inverse function I had researched that and what I said was correct:  You cannot prove there is no inverse function.  That has been proven.  I can find the link if you want.  But there may be collisions more than one input leading to the same answer.  I am beginner here.  So what I was saying is that it is conceivable that the nsa has the inverse function.  Not saying they do, or that anyone does.  Edit: I am aware if two inputs lead to the same answer then the inverse would not exactly be a function unless it was multi valued.  And that's as far as I know.
Here is the qoute maybe you understand more than me:
"It is unclear whether one-way functions can actually exist. Right now, we have many functions that no one knows how to invert; but this does not mean that they are impossible to invert, in a mathematical sense. Note, though, that it is not proven that one-way functions cannot exist, so hope remains. Some people suspect that whether one-way functions may exist or not could be one of these irksome mathematical assertions which can be neither proven nor disproved (Gödel's theorem proves that such things must exist). But there is no proof of that either.
Therefore, there is no proof that any given hash function is really resistant to preimages."
It came from here:
Edit add quote and edit I should rather say it has not been proven there is no inverse

Basically everything Oliver said still stands.  Now the foundation wants to attack Oliver personally,  or make a big deal about his lack of perfect wording.  
I think the foundation should fess up a bit better and agree to some serious limitations on their powers.  Then they need to go to the community show what they have done about our concerns, regain some trust, and finally get some funding for their operations, which might include funding for developers, but there should be a strict separation of powers and the foundation should not control standards and developers that's preposterous.

I think there should be a separate standards committee.  Because of the problem of the foundation being a centralized and corruptible control point we do not want standards to depend on the foundation.  We don't want to put all that power in any single organization.  Therefore, we need an independent standards organisation.  To your question: they should not have direct control over the standards body, they might bring attention to some issue, but standards should be able to ignore them.  For that reason funding should not go through the foundation and then to standards it should be separate.

"Paypal plans to integrate Bitcoin
Paypal had already announced the end of September last year, now it's official: the company will offer its online retailers to integrate Bitcoin as payment. This has now explained in a note to the US Securities and Exchange Commission Paypal.
Paypal integrated Bitcoin.
(Source Bitcoin:  aztekphoto via Shutterstock)
Paypal wants his online retailers give the opportunity to the digital currency Bitcoin to accept as payment. That is to emerge from a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, Paypal plans thanks to the integration of Braintree its customers the integration of digital currencies such as Bitcoin allow.
Paypal and ebay disconnect at the end of the year
In addition to the integration of Bitcoin is clear from the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the exact time of separation from ebay and Paypal out: According to the two companies intend to officially separate from each end of the year.
The integration of Bitcoin about Braintree, Paypal announced the company in September of last year, but now it's official. The word Bitcoin falls in the submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Paypal only the first place, but it should be clear that Paypal will integrate the digital currency in the future.
First, no trans cation charges for Bitcoin
Braintree is working with the Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase and online retailers to allow easy integration of Bitcoin in your own online store. Customers should have the ability to pay of all devices via Bitcoin without having to convert first Bitcoin separately.
Media reports  , according to Braintree, which is still in beta, require no transaction fees for the integration of Bitcoin, at least until a million dollars in sales were achieved via Bitcoin. How much are the transaction fees will be then, is not known.

Based on reading a few of your comments I am guessing you are being sarcastic.  I doesn't matter, I generally avoid getting personal anyway as that is the troll approach.  I suppose the trolls, and some mods, would like to see the legitimate comments disappear altogether, but that would not be the purpose.

You don't even know what you are talking about or replying to.  Bitcoin Technology is used to refer to the block chain usually in cases where it is not the Bitcoin blockchain but some other one.  It is a new meme, a way to get around Bitcoins disruptive attributes.  I do not usually like the way the term is used, especially when it confounds people who think they are still talking about Bitcoin, which is why they do it.
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:37:35
Exactly, This is saying no monetary transactions should be private, a basic and gigantic violation of human rights.
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:06:41
Actually disagreement is really not the criterion of being a troll.  In my mind it is those that are deceptively advocating another position.  For example, if mods down vote good posts or delete them while upvoting bad ones.  Were there only disagreements here I think there would be no need to start a private forum.  But it is more than disagreements there are those that use degenerate techniques of derailing the issues.  That is a real problem.  They attack personally, they try to make fun other others, they call names, they are the mods, they are the dominant faction in r/bitcoin we are not talking about a small problem here.  And let me add when someone goes to r/bitcoin the expect to arrive at a legitimate bitcoin forum not some troll dominated farce.

I don't think this divided the bitcoin community at all.  I think the non community stepped in and controlled this with things like censorship.  What's going on with Bitcoin Core is a joke,  They are absolute imbeciles if they really believe larger blocks are not necessary.  Sorry it is not a 'debate' that is the first lie.  People are leaving the bitcoin network for alts because transactions are not clearing.  You don't build a bridge that breaks when the load is NORMAL.  There is no debate to be had.  There are only trolls and money blocking what was the only rational choice from the beginning.  So you might as well ask:  "What is the next thing we can do to try and STOP Bitcoin and how will we manipulate the bitcoin community most effectively?"
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:04:04
I can tell you all the answer to all this nonsense.  The instant they start making personal attacks.  That exact instant they are banned.  They use lots of techniques and they work in brigades.  You don't ban people for their views you ban them for using trolling techniques such as pretending to hold some view they don't, or general disruption techniques.  Just ban that immediately.  And I do not believe for one second the mods can't do that.  They just don't do that.

We might want to get somewhat concerned that the foundation has zero money assuming that's true.  If they have not had the interests of our community in mind that would also be a problem.  Even as Bitcoin is decentralized we need a foundation to represent our interests and to be involved in (different from totally controlling) maintaining and improving code.  There is a point of excessive anarchistic tendency that could destroy our own ability to move forward.  Yes, centralization of the foundation power and the fact that the foundation becomes a control point of those with interests counter to Bitcoin is a big problem.  But we need to address these issues and not sit on our hands.  As Bitcoin price is low the problems of funding become a greater issue, but now is the time for the non-centralized members of the community to get involved.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:59:44
Actually I agree with that.  Let's take one example standards.  The foundation should not control that.  There should be a separate standards body, or as you say many.  Next, developers that should also not be directly under their control.  But if I am being voted down because I suggest we need a foundation, then I am not sure that is quite rational.  Ideally, everything is 100% decentralized, but in reality the code has to be maintained and developed, according to standards.  It is hard to totally decentralize that process.  So I am arguing for a limitation of powers and separation of powers model.  I think total destruction of THE foundation would be contrary to the interests of Bitcoin.  I have no problem with competing foundations.  If powers are limited they would all carry out the same functions.  You could even have a federation of foundations and they would elect again a representative body.

Local Bitcoins used to send instantly.  This issue like many requires some technical knowledge but double spend is one of the classic attack vectors and it was just enabled by core: they are vandals.  They are enabling this highly dubious stuff while at the same time refusing to increase block size even a modest amount, leading to a currently bottle-necked network.  
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:36:09
Just realize that the whole concept of this being any legitimate debate is a lie.  The network is working at a petahash or some number beyond imagination.  The blockchain is 20 GB almost fits on my old usb flash drive.  This is a false debate.  The purpose of it is to bottleneck the bitcoin network and it is working.  No engineer designs anything to be at MAX load under normal conditions.  If you want to know who is bought look at who is trying to prevent the network from being able to handle transactions.  Furthermore new technologies such as thin blocks will reduce size eventually anyway.  This is a made up debate.  The Bitcoin Core programmers have been bought and have verifiable conflicts of interest.  This whole thing is a great example of what we are up against going forward.  Think about it they are saying 4 lanes of cars should be required to drive on a one lane dirt road and people think that is some sort of reasonable debate? If we are as stupid as sheep we are not going to be successful here.

@_date: 2015-11-26 16:26:53
No, in fact keeping blocks small centralizes the network.  The reason is because not all transactions fit.  In this scenario fees go upwards to any number.  That then leads to the need for off chain transactions -- the Lightning Network.  This is based on the idea of creating 'pots' of bitcoins on the blockchain.  What it means is you cannot send bitcoins for small transactions but must instead use a centralized BANK.  There are other reasons that small blocks centralize the network.  Even Jon Matonis appears to admit that small blocks could lead to banking cartels that blockade transactions.  The project you refer is not allowed to be mentioned on this subreddit so I won't talk about it, except to say it's the opposite of what you say.

"how can one determine what works if there's no experimentation outside Bitcoin"
Experiment, I said to experiment, there are plenty, to many, alts already, but you don't need a new coin because you want to do something, adding the new coin makes the original experiment an excuse for a pump and dump.  I am saying don't use your experiment as an excuse to own the internet.  
"I don't even know where to start with this. "Everyone is a scammer, only use Bitcoin, prove yourself, also here's my coin""
Your right you didn't know where to start.  Libertasia is not a coin, When I said use Bitcoin I meant in your project.  I have another comment saying people can use other coins or build on other coins too.  Your changing meanings and misinterpreting.  In fact you took my words and changed them around and put quotes: are you CNN or MSNBC?  Read my post again slowly.  I am saying:  If you have some great idea, most likely, it does not require a new coin. People who say they need new coins for their ideas have historically been scammers.  I am speaking from experience, they want to own the internet with their idea when it could instead be built using Bitcoins.  
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:15:53
We are going to need some model and organized manner of maintaining and advancing Bitcoin code.  The more that can be decentralized the better, but there are still going to actually have to be programmers working on this.  For example, the code only supports 7 transactions a second which we are rapidly approaching.  I suggest we proceed by looking for solutions.  For now, Gavin is doing a good job, but we do need some understood process that ensures that the developers represent the interests of the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:28:37
The power of the foundation has to be limited.  Oliver does not want to see them control both standards and code development.  (If I am getting this correct)  That makes sense to me also like separation of powers.  We should look at a separation of powers and limitation of powers model.

Well, I don't believe that they said that.  Please link it.  Mike Hearn has apparently nearly perfected small blocks which reduce block size by a factor of about 10.  So I really don't see him working towards the data center outcome.  I have read several posts by Gavin Andreson all arguing for practical increases in block size that would all be able to be run on standard systems.  He even does the calculations to show it.  So what you say about them is either untrue or most likely out of context.  Even were it true it would be irrelevant to the question.  That is the question of block size is decided on the merits of the issue.  For those who don't understand the lightning network I just want to point out that if the bitcoin network is bottlnecked successfully by Core then transaction costs will prohibit transactions.  This means you cannot send bitcoin when you want period the use of any other network then requires your money to be stored in a 'pot' of coins on the blockchain -- A BANK.  Bankers and big companies love the lightning network.  Edit: Take out a sentence

Paid my last purchase with Bitcoin.  Much more convenient than Paypal.  It's just a matter of time before others figure that out.  The downside is that regulations have made the process of obtaining Bitcoins a bit inconvenient for some.  Bitcoin is better money, but there is a chance government issued digital currencies may compete with it.  Basically we are going to be using blockchain digital currencies.  Let's not be too harsh on those who would prefer those currencies to be decentralized rather than government issued and controlled.

"If bitcoin was seen as a threat to anyone in washington, then it would be swiftly quashed. There wouldn't be bitcoin." 
You statement is false.  In Washington they generally regulate things to bring them under control or to eliminate any percieved threats.  They almost never react in sudden manners that would appear wrongful.  They can achieve their ends through things like regulations.  Either you are part of their process (a troll) or have a complete misunderstanding of how it operates.  But taking your statement as true literally leads to the conclusion that we already exist in complete fascism.  (If they can just destroy things at will without any concern of legality)  That is a striking conspiracy theory, or is it another conspiracy theory that is already true?

Ivanraszl makes a misguided comment.  Adoption has strictly to do with convenience.  Most people are selfish jellyfish in nearly all their behaviors.  They will adopt the moment adoption is the most convenient action.  Now, it is still to hard to obtain coins, then a wallet, and then to use the coins: they don't even know where.  
When the wallet is preloaded on their device, they can add coins with one click, and spend with one scan, then they would adopt.  I Almost forgot, there needs to be something they want to buy, and some moronic selfish discount giving them any advantage relative to the other jellyfish.  That would be the final push point to move the jellyfish to action.  It has nearly nothing to do with some other misguided supposedly moral concern that some early adopting 'hoarder' is getting too rich.

Imagine now when before you receive any Bitcoins you have to route them through a central authority that says they are not stolen.  We would be back to a system worse than cash.  Imagine now your coins you received 2 years ago turned out to be stolen.  Authorities can easily intimidate exchanges to lock funds.  They can precipitate these events and shut down exchanges.

Basically the 'Core' fork is refusing to scale bitcoin.  They pretend to be proceeding carefully whilst they do all manner of irresponsible things such as allow coders with MEGA conflicts of interest to commit dubious code that might even be deliberate vandalism.

I think this got confused at first as people were reacting.  I was more concerned that authorities had inspired this freeze.

You like to attack others personally.  You have a problem.  Your argument that they would destroy bitcoin if they wanted is a staw man fallacy.  Your also making the fallacy of changing the topic into trading which was not part of my comment.  Calling things names like "stupid conspiracy theories" is also a fallacy.  Finally your position that it is absurd that anyone would try to control Bitcoin say for example Bankers, the FED, or say for example the UK with its new regulations --your position is the absurd one.

At this point I mostly want to clarify that I was not attacking BTC-e.  I was more concerned if central authorities had encouraged or compelled them to lock withdrawals.  BTC-e is another matter.  Acting on their own they are free to take into account their legitimate business interests.  They should also promote the interests of the community including the fungibility of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is as fungible as we make it.  We could destroy the network tomorrow if we all agreed to make every transaction subject to some central clearinghouse test of 'tainted coins'.  So therefore I do think we all have some duty to promote a fungible currency.  No freedom is impinged.  I am not asking the state to do this although perhaps it could actually make a ruling that cryptocurrencies like cash are indeed fungible in the sense of the 1700 Scotland case.  That might not be a bad idea.  It just says a coin legitimately transferred to you is now your coin not someone else s it may have been stolen from 20 transactions ago.  If you don't accept this view you won't have a currency.  And again all the trolls who hate bitcoin quickly jumped on this promoting the idea of denying fungibility.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:28:02
That's not a bad idea, prevents you blaming yourself for any hindsight decisions that appear to have been wrong or emotional.  I suggest sell on an exponential function that gradually decreases so you always have more to sell.  (Just sell say 1/50 of your remaining coins each year)

"There is no central authority though."
Yes, there is it calls the exchange and says you have tainted coins you better freeze all withdrawals.
If you start checking transactions for tainted coins you immediately destroy the fungibility of all transactions, and now require a central authority to authorize and clear any transaction.  This would be worse than Paypal and would destroy the network almost immediately.  Consider being an exchange under these conditions or having you money locked at an exchange.

Agreed, regulation and tracking would be the certain end of Bitcoin as a distributed decentralized system.  Regulations actually benefit the elites not those who they supposedly protect.  The reason the financial system is controlled by banking syndicates is exactly regulations.  Here is a key to understanding: Regulations promise one thing: safety, or consumer protection, but they are the mechanism to allow another thing: centralized corporate monopolistic banker syndicates.  Lack of privacy is the beginning step of any regulatory regime.  
Money controls media, politics, and society.  By decentralizing money and hence changing the incentive structure on the creation of monetary controls Bitcoin brings power back to the individual.

Let me add: If you don't want to use bitcoin then use darkcoin, but the hallmark of a scam it that you try to put your own coin on top of your project.

But you commit a direct fallacy because I am not suggesting to make blocks that large.  Right now the entire block chain is about 48GB which very easily fits on a hard drive.  The network is just about at maximum and is currently meaning right now being bottlenecked deliberately and knowingly by the core coders.  Whilst the commit other highly dubious code some say could be vandalism.  They have a conflict of interest and stand to gain if transactions are forced off chain.  Even Jon Matonis admits this could lead to cartels of banks the exact opposite of what bitcoin is supposed to be.  What is being argued for is a reasonable increase in block size.  Yes, it is true at either extreme centralization occurs.

Awesome summary!  And I can reduce it more: If you can't acquire title through a thief all notes are absolutely useless.  Hence we have bona fide acquisition.  And the same needs to apply to Bitcoin here here!  And then as far a BTC-e as long as their client could show bona fide aquistion of funds there was no reason to freeze anything unless a court order indicated that the funds belonged to the thief himself case resolved!

Shutting down this exchange from withdrawals is an attack on every bitcoin transaction that occurs anywhere.  It is an attack on all exchanges as now you will think again before opening an exchange account.  What if one of your coins is tainted somehow?  This is a direct attack on the network and Bitcoin fungibility.  This attack is tantamount to economic terrorism.  And for no reason, there is no possibility of returning coins to anyone.  Mostly trolls who want to destroy the network are here disrupting and supporting this.

Big topic and if I interpret you correctly we most likely disagree.  I think regulations will either (A) end the currency and adoption or (B) destroy it as a peer to peer distributed currency.  I can only say my position is somewhat consistent with the decentralized view of what Bitcoin is about.  I would say join ripple or paypal if you like regulations, but don't destroy bitcoin which was founded on principles of peer to peer, privacy, and freedom from centralized regulations.

Mistaken assumption that BTC-e acts voluntarily.  All it takes is one call from authorities and you think they are going to release the funds?  In China? get real.
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:52:08
Several misleading things in this:
1.  "One thing for certain is there will only ever be 100 Billion ripple XRP in existence, and that is hardcoded." 
Ripple is centralized that means 'hard coding' is irrelevant.  They can change the code at their discretion and print, print, print.  Ripple Labs issued themselves 80 billion XRP.
2.  "Ripple and Bitcoin actually meld well together"  
This whole topic came up because they are quoted as saying Bitcoin is not necessary.  
3.  "Users have control of their secret key"
This is highly misleading as your funds are at Ripple Labs on their computer, and in theory can be created, destroyed, locked, or manipulated at their convenience.  
4.  "Like bitcoin, the native ripple (xrp) currency has no counterparty risk"  
Again misleading.  You are in fact subject to the IOU of your gateway.  They do not 'back' that IOU.  Which could be a central bank IOU or a failed gateway.  
5.  "Ripple is open-source"  
They control the code, it runs on their central computers.
Ripple is a scam.  Everything about it always turns out to be a lie or propaganda.  If it succeeds it will be the worst case scenario of a unitary central bank with absolute power to do anything. We want decentralized systems that's what Bitcoin is all about.  Ripple is a scam to install a centralized model, they mislead every millimeter of the way.
I will just add this without editing the above: It turns out 'validating servers' vote on the future of the Ripple network.  Most likely they would be run by bankers, corporations, and syndicates.  Ripple users would be forced to accept the choices of the validating servers.  Of note, recently the Ripple network shut itself down.

In that you may be right, if this can happen it will, if it does happen bitcoin will be replaced.  It appears by your reasoning a currency will only succeed if transactions are fungible and that apparently requires that they be anonymous and not traceable.  Otherwise there is a centralized attack mechanism.  A peer to peer network cannot depend on a central clearing authority that certifies coins as not being tainted.  Let me go on to say we are witnessing the discovery by authorities of an attack vector against the bitcoin network.  This attack vector appears to be working successfully.  Maybe this vector is limited only to exchanges?  But any Bitcoins can now be considered possibly tainted.
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:27:23
okay if we go this route get ready for central authorities to mark EVERY transaction as acceptable or not.  Then get ready to run the address of anyone sending coins through a central authority before you dare to accept them.  This destroys fungibility and would make Bitcoin a centralized network.

Just a further warning to all:  Account(s) are being locked for "inactivity" that were not even inactive.  Additionally, they claim that their multibit flagged "non standard and should not be trusted" transactions are due to the malleability attack, but others can send coins without these errors.  This message must have a specific reason, as in some script or transaction setting as mentioned here already (not just "due to the malleability attack")  It is highly advised to get your funds out.

Kind of odd how paid shills and trolls come here to argue that there is no such thing as paid shills and trolls.  One also wonders what motivates the minds of such people and what is their IQ.  Are they low IQ but using highly researched propaganda techniques under the advice of central controllers?  Many are better at simply avoiding them, but then we must be careful to not set off their alarm systems.  I suppose as they get stupider and we get smarter that might be a good approach.

Your saying its nonsensical to consider the possibility that there are operations that may be carried out to control Bitcoin?  In fact it is a totally reasonable hypothesis.

Yes, good article but George makes a bit of a fallacy himself.  Pointing out that fiat currency is not backed by anything proves what?  Only that fiat currency sucks,  not that the 'no backing' criticism of Bitcoin is wrong.  
For my own point of view I would say Bitcoin not being backed adds to its ability to remain decentralized, and that makes Bitcoin more resilient to centralized attacks.  If Bitcoin were backed by Gold reserves they would be somewhere, and then well we know what governments do.

Thanks for your well reasoned response saving me the trouble.  All these problems are used as a pretext for regulations, but the regulations only increase the problems.  Once the regulations are in place they do little to solve the problems that were offered as pretexts.  Perhaps a good example is GMO corn in the US.  The corn itself is a pesticide, read that again, it is called BT corn, and causes severe health issues, but the corporate syndicate is in bed with the regulators.  Meanwhile the regulators go after the non gmo crops and farmers...

BTC should be free to do as it chooses: no one is saying that authorities should force BTC to accept any coins.

Even as a private entity they cannot act arbitrarily and deny customers expected services.  That said they are free to make their own policies.  Customers should move their funds elsewhere if BTC-e does not respect fungiblity.  
Was this an attack on fungibility?  I think it depends on more details.  Several cases present themselves:  Were authorities involved?  Were these the funds of the actual culprits?  Did BTC-e plan to return funds to anyone?  How many innocent accounts were locked?  What was the expected benefit?  What is their policy as to accepting coins?  In these details we can see if BTC-e and or the authorities respect fungibility.

Absolutely!  Bitcoin decentralizes money and the monopolization of monetary controls by central authorities has a profound impact on politics.  Getting really philosophical: Nature has been designed to work on many levels.  Molecules formed out of the primordial chaos, but only because nature was specially designed to create them and only because they were specially designed to work.  What if the molecular angles differed only slightly?  Nothing would work.  Well, Bitcoin is the same it was waiting for us to discover and use it.  Sorry for the short explanation that maybe needs more development.

On Wednesday afternoon the price of one Bitcoin (BTC) was $145.70 on Mt Gox, one of the largest exchanges for the currency.
After the news that Ross Ulbricht had been arrested and the Silk Road site seized, the exchange rate plummeted to a low of $109.76, before recovering to $124.00 late on Thursday."

This is an attack on the fungibility of Bitcoin.  Authorities can create dark markets, bust them, send the coins to exchanges, and in short order take down the entire ecosystem with this 'fungibility attack'.  They can threaten exchanges to lock coins.  Encourage the building of dark markets that they really control.  I know some refuse to believe these sorts of things would be done, but they have historic precedent, this is how our governments operate.  They don't even have to do everything, they can encourage others at each point.  Sadly I think the Bitcoin community though getting libertarian principle is a bit short on understanding the full scale of what we are up against.

Why compare these events at all, as if there is a comparison between Bitcoin and Bernie Madoff?  Why not compare the FED theft every year due to printing with Bernie Madoff, then there would be an accurate analogy as both are Ponzi Schemes.  Bitcoin is not any such scheme it is a technology.  Not clear that you intended this meaning, but people consistently confuse Bitcoin technology with what people do, its like blaming hydrogen for the Hindenburg.  People are unable to separate the Bitcoin protocol from what other third party entities do.  They consistently think Bitcoin is a business with a central location and that any Bitcoin Fraud is perpetrated by this Bitcoin business.  The mainstream media either through ignorance or deliberately consistently makes these errors, but here we should not.  Perhaps this is not your meaning but we should be careful in our comparisons.  Then look at the con4coin post who takes the mismeaning I am referring to and says we are "desperate".  Look at the fallacies your post has encouraged.

Good advice on sending to another address.  Far as the "non standard and should not be trusted transactions"  I think it is very concerning.  It could have to do with scripts that they are deliberately adding to their transactions.  I said "could".  I do not know the exact reason.  So the reasons are not known but some possibilities are a bit concerning.  I'll go further and say it does not seem like multibit should accept these nor should the miners put them into blocks.  But I am a bit of a purist and believe in simple systems.  Who wants to have to accept a transaction that "should not be trusted"?  What would the market value of that transaction be as a percent of the original bitcoin value?  I be at least a bit less.  So in that sense they really are not paying the full value of what they are supposed to.

Once I sold coffee to my asshole workmates.

Let me elaborate my other comment as I think some are not quite getting it.  I don't think Buffet likes or dislikes Bitcoin.  Nor do I think that affected his comments about it as an investment.  I do think his opinion of it as an investment should be respected.  Reason: He is a successful investor and would not likely make a deliberate incorrect prediction.  That does not mean I like him or approve of him, or that I don't.  I do think he had inside information that made him confident when he said "Stay away from Bitcoin in 2015".  It is a fact that Bitcoin faces "opposition" and only a complete idiot would assume that opposition was completely disorganized and unplanned.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the opposition is organized and planned, and I think Buffet had some information about that as he likely would.  It is a reasonable hypothesis given his position in the Banking industry as mentioned in the original comment.  Therefore, that may explain his comment, and his comment should be taken seriously.

I had a small profit about equal to the overhead of running the business maybe say $0.15 per day.  It was even selfish in the sense that I wanted to cover my inconvenience.  Net inconvenience it was not a profit and ended up as a net loss due to the insult.  With hindsight it might have been better to sell at EXACTLY cost, but then I may not have bothered like everyone else.  I offer the following outlandish claim:  I could have sold at ANY price, whatever price I thought maximized my interests, and and people should have thanked me for making the option available, [as long as I forced no one to buy]  If the price was ridiculously high and yet people still were buying someone else could have undercut me, and I should have thanked him for taking over the chore.

Let me offer the contrarian hypothesis that I thought you were making:  Bitcoin is a Trojan horse invented by the NSA, and implemented by the core globalists as part of their vision of a one world digital currency.  They will control the foundation, centralize the nodes, and lift the printing cap.  All in the name of things like "preventing terrorism".  It will be SO EASY for them to do these things.  They will gain complete control of the entire block chain and it's ledger controlling exactly who has how much money.    They are confident they will have their one world digital currency.  They will control it to their ends, they already are.  For now they have been trying to delay the next bubble and successfully so.  They want to see more 'Know Your Customer' and all that before it goes mainstream.
We can only hope for a miscalculation on their part.  The unlikely possibility of an inherent decentralizing force put by God into the technology that drives an entire decentralized ecosystem that opposes their one world tyranny.

To answer the question partially:  A country could easily buy up 50% of Bitcoins market cap.  Then declare it the official currency.  This would drive price up rapidly correspondingly enriching such country who could then put the entire initial investment into Gold and still hold most of the Bitcoins they bought.  Transaction fees would allow for a controlled ramp up of transactions.

Correct it may be a discovered weakness,  that said, I am not sure we need to give up at the start of this issue, if we had lost already the trolls would not bother to be out in force.  Therefore there may be some reason to get people to see the importance of maintaining fungibility and not giving it up.  There may be a partial defense which would begin by not arguing in favor of closing down exchanges so you can donate money to authorities who plan to return it to no one.

None of them do anything or offer anything really significant that Bitcoin doesn't, or couldn't with minor improvements.  (I borrowed some words)  I am all for experimentation, but then there is no reason to not use Bitcoin as the base currency, if something is missing they can build on top of it, and if it works it can be later introduced into the blockchain.  But that is not what people do they all want to be the owner of the next internet currency, everyone wants to own the internet.  It is fucking pathetic.

This gets at 'control point theory'.  With these three easily controlled from behind the scenes Bitcoin can be upgraded in ways you or I might not especially like.
