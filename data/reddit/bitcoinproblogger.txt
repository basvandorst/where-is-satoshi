I'm under the impression that I have to play catchup - the mechanics aren't so clear. Do I have to download the game? Do I have to finish for instance level 1, 2, 3 - (which are already solved by somebody else) before I can get to level 4?

John McAfee is a has been who has made far too many mistakes in life. He's now in crypto to recoup all his losses from his misadventures.

Yep, I checked too. Apparently the .5 BTC was spread out. Feels like I can't join in the fun anymore. The monetary incentive really motivates

Trying 
1. Stegoseed: 04:35 05/20 
u/cryptogreetings used a phrase that reminded me of a reddit post "in plain sight"
""This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto's famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work."

**Bitcoin education literally changed my life.**
Through a friend I met on twitter who taught me everything I know about bitcoin, I was able to turn my life around. 
As funny as it may sound, because of Bitcoin I became an obsessed self learner. It taught me about the **Unholy Trinity** (taxes, inflation and interest rates). It taught me about libertarian economics and the importance of freedom in the financial sphere. It gave me a very tiny glimpse of how the world's elites control the money flow through a system of financial slavery through the corrupt banking system. 
Because of Bitcoin I saw that it's not just a technology about money, it is an economic revolution. While it may have its quirks, failings and its share of problems (the same symptoms apply in the world of fiat), these in all gave me the impetus to learn from my mistakes. 
* HODL'ing (or "Saving money") was a virtue that's never been in my financial plans. Because of Bitcoin I was forced to save whenever prices dipped!
* FOMO and FUD - are two things that are always at play and not just in Bitcoin, it governs even life itself and I can see it in everything including in the political sphere. Because of these two, I've learned to stare the storms of life with a slightly calmer demeanor. 
* Cryptography and puzzles. Life itself is a puzzle as we have seen in the mapping of the human genome. Before I got into Bitcoin, I always saw cryptography simply as a means for spy agencies like the CIA or the NSA to have a secure way of transmitting or storing information. I've never thought that cryptography could be so important in the world of finance. 
* I've learned how to sift through the good and the bad. There are many problems in crypto (as in real life), but I see the overall cryptosphere as a giant petri dish of economics and trust or the lack thereof. 
I work for a small bitcoin startup called  where I've written close to 30 articles on various topics pertaining to cryptocurrencies, from decentralized exchanges, chart patterns (I used to call them Bitcoin chicken entrail reading), various platforms and more. As I progress I believe I would be delving on harder topics as my employers would require. 
Maybe someday something great will come out of this.

I honestly appreciate the feedback, I will relay the information to my employer. 
May we know how we can improve and what topics should we focus on. 
My own personal opinion about the site, first of my boss is a cryptocurrency whale, a trader. Therefore there's an element of truth to your claim - The instructions given to me were to 'profile' the top 50 coins on coinmarketcap.com among many other things. 
I believe that there's room for improvement in anything and that includes Bitcoin itself. Depending on whose side of the debate you're on, you may see Bitcoin (the technology) as having two major sides, it's either a currency or a store of value. And yes, it could be more as we realize that Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum because he wanted to have a free hand in the development of other features that could have been a part of Bitcoin itself but was shunned because of different visions. 
As it is, I have penned many courses pertaining to Bitcoin itself, that I'm sure you would come to appreciate: 
**Bitcoin and Blockchain Patents**
**Introduction to Bitcoin Mining**
**Blockchain and Real Estate**
**Introduction to Decentralized Exchanges**
**Colored Coins**
**7 Cryptocurrency Programming Languages**
There's more I'm sure, hidden beneath the pile of altcoins, hahaha.
