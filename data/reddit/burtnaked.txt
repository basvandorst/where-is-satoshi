have you ever even looked at or any of the related subreddits? i was just wondering what you are basing your opinion of Ð being a pump and dump and all that
im sure ill get called a dogetard or retard for asking but i would really like to know if you have even looked at the other side of the coin as it were

moolah.io has been working on  releasing digipay.io and they said something about having physical debit cards that would be linked to your moolah account that you could use at any debit machine and they would auto convert whichever coin of choice to fiat to charge you
i think its at least a month away though :S

or instead of selling any of the dogecoins i have mined i bought a game with some Ð tipped some people and just held the rest
besides that was one event involving that wolong character and the dump never really happened.....   
that was just another attempt to do something negative to doge which was turned around by the community

this is true but it usually takes 3 or 4 times hearing about something before someone finally checks it out so repetition is key
