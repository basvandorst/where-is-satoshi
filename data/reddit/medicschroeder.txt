Why?  There is no way for someone to access my account.  I also wanted to show that I’m putting my faith and value into the coin.

I have what’s shown in Coinbase and a majority in a cold wallet
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:20:03
Coinbase.  It’s what got me started about 3 years ago and I haven’t had any issues with it, so I like it.

Okay, relax, I was simply saying that I don’t believe someone can access my account based off of a picture.  But totally related, good job.

Thanks!  I guess I’ll just remove the picture entirely

*sigh* fair enough, edited since you guys have made me slightly more paranoid

I don’t have anything to gain by showing what I have invested.  I more so wanted to show faith and give a short story that I’ve been holding for about 3 years now.  I just see SO many people losing their minds the second it peaks about 9K and the second it drops a few hundred.  I guess my point was that minor corrections really aren’t a big deal.

As I said above, fair enough.  I colored the picture a bit since I’m a bit more paranoid now.  *what if?*

It’s actually 420bitcoin69, but kudos for being close!
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:03:12
Umm, I don’t know, I have a lot of faith in bitcoin and I’m not really hurting for the money I have invested.  I honestly don’t have a sellout date or price in mind!

I edited out the trailing numbers, someone said posting the exact number is bad ����‍♂️
