I couldn't login to my account once and it took them 5 days to finally follow up and fix the issue. I was bugging them about everyday about it. They did credit me $30, however, I guess since I was a little huffy with them. Coinbase, if you're reading this, hire more customer service reps!!

I have a question! I was a moderator for a certain Canadian bitcoin prediction market website. I set up "propositions" by which I received a cut of the commission for every successful "proposition" that I created. How would I file the gainings from the commission? I also won some of the propositions. How would that be filed? Or am I crazy to file it? I understand the legality of the bitcoin earnings on a foreign bitcoin prediction market is a little murky. Any insight would be great. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:09:18
Thanks for the reply. So I'll cut to the chase. The earnings might be illegal. How would I file it? Can't I file illegal income without disclosing how I earned it? What form would I use and does the IRS care if it's illegal?
