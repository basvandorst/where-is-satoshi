Hi all, 
We want to wish you all the best for the New Year, which inarguably has started pretty well for the Bitcoin community!  Also, we would like to thank you very much for the interest shown in this research study, and express our gratitude to all those who have taken part in the study.
We will soon close all surveys and start with the analysis to meet the publishing deadline for Q1 2017. In this context, we would like to encourage all cryptocurrency organisations as well as individual miners who haven't participated yet to consider completing the survey that applies best to their activities. An increased sample size will undoubtedly contribute to the findings being more relevant and insightful.
Thank you very much!
P.S. We would also like to thank the r/bitcoin moderators for making this topic a sticky post/announcement without prior request from our side - this has helped a lot to increase participation. Thank you!

Hi, that's weird because the link is working fine with all browsers that I've tried. 
All surveys are directed at companies and organisations, with the exception of the mining survey which is also open to every individual involved in some way in mining :)

Hi, all links should normally be working fine, may I ask which survey you tried to access?

Hi, thank you for mentioning your concerns. All surveys with the exception of the mining survey are directed at organisations (e.g., companies, non-profits, etc.) who naturally want (in most cases need) to get exposure and increase awareness of their activities and services, so we tend to believe that this should not be a big issue.

Hi, yes we use a double approach: for each survey, we first compile a list of companies/projects that we think fit best to each survey, and send them a personal invitation, followed by the release of a public link that anyone can access.
