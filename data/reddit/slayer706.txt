This isn't KYC/AML. Banks and credit card companies usually cover fraudulent transactions. They see strange transactions from a foreign country, so they assume someone stole OP's card. They don't want to be liable for those transactions, so they lock the account.

I started posting there because all of the bad financial advice I saw in this sub.
Sorry guys, but here are some hard truths:
* Bitcoin is not a replacement for a traditional retirement account like a 401k or an IRA.
* Bitcoin is not safer than the US Dollar.
* Bitcoin should not be a significant percentage of your net worth, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck.
* People who have lost too much money in Bitcoin should get out now, not keep hodling or buying cheaper coins to lower their cost basis.
* A diversified portfolio is not one consisting entirely of cryptocurrencies and precious metals.
* Not everyone who thinks negatively about investing in Bitcoin is stupid or "doesn't understand the technology".
* Bitcoin is not gold, the internet, or the printing press.
Feel free to copy and paste that into the sidebar. It could save you guys from having to post the suicide hotline thread again.

Limiting antibiotics is the only thing that has kept them effective for so long. It has slowed down super bugs. It has saved countless lives.

I don't see your point. Pain killers are necessary, and I don't think pharmaceutical companies are making them addictive by design.
So we need pain killers, and we need pharmaceutical companies to make the pain killers. What we don't need are people abusing the pain killers. So we put the pain killers behind a counter and require people to have a valid medical reason in order to obtain them. What's the problem with that?
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:13:54


No one dies from accidental overdoses?
EDIT - And how are addicts created? By taking the drugs and developing a dependence. Is it harder to get ahold of the drugs initially if they are behind a pharmacy counter and require a doctor's prescription?
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:10:25
And if prescriptions weren't required, it would look like this:
Step 1: Decide you need a prescription-level pain killer because you're depressed or your wrist is sore.
Step 2: Buy pain killers.
Step 3: Become addicted.
Step 4: Buy more pain killers.
Step 5: OD.
The point being, pharmacies and doctors attempt to limit exposure to these addictive substances to people who actually need them. It's not 100% effective, but I think it's better than having everything be OTC.

The rise of antibiotic resistant germs is all the evidence I need.
Bacteria evolve to resist antibiotics if they are exposed to them, that's irrefutable science.
Without restrictions on antibiotics, bacteria are exposed to them needlessly and resistant strains evolve and spread.
There's a reason these third world countries are incubating resistant strains, and it's because antibiotics are easily obtained without prescriptions there.


If you want to die of a scraped knee, that's your decision. Get a cut and don't take antibiotics. The rest of society would like to live past the age of 12, so leave our lifesaving drugs alone.
This is "tragedy of the commons". Individuals ruin a good thing for everybody because they are too stupid and selfish. It's a very good use case for government intervention. Vaccinations are another good example.

Hitler got pretty far. In fact, if he hadn't reneged on his deal with Russia he might have succeeded.


I don't see how you're going to do that. For most people, the advantages of living in a society that's governed are so much greater than living in anarchy.
Take me for example. I've got police forces that protect me. I've got an army defending my country's borders. I've got access to a social safety net if I lose my job or my health fails.

What a bunch of crap. You know you can rotate antibiotics right? Once bacteria become immune to one, you can stop using it for a while and the bacteria will stop selecting for resistance to it. Eventually it will become effective again.
Of course, you're only able to do this if distribution of antibiotics are restricted. If you just toss all of them on the shelf and let the average person decide which ones to use, bacteria will evolve resistance to all of them at once.


Having no antibiotics is no different than having bugs that are immune to all known antibiotics. Either way, people will be dying from scraped knees.

Unless they don't become addicts in the first place because they don't accidently self-medicate with an addictive substance.
"My arm really hurts, I don't think regular Tylenol is going to cut it. Hey, this bottle of Hydrocodone says it's for really serious pain! I will give that a try. It says it's extremely addictive, but I doubt that will be a problem for me."


They should be difficult to obtain for people that don't need them. And for the people that do need them, I don't think it's too much to ask that they visit a doctor first to make sure.

Best thing you can do is just put it in the bank or an index fund and continue living as if you didn't have the money. Maybe spend a little on a nice family dinner and a vacation, but keep the rest for emergencies. Then you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes from having financial security. And then $50k would no longer be a life changing amount of money for you, because you would already have it.
Lots of problems could happen with your plan. You could lose your job. You could become injured or disabled, and unable to work for several months. You could be unable to make the mortgage payments. The house could have some huge problem that costs thousands to repair. How do you deal with those problems with no huge savings? Go into debt. Eventually you're selling the house, probably at a loss, to pay off your debts and you are back to where you started. This is why lots of lottery winners go broke.

The people who own bitcoin can devalue it overnight by dumping large amounts on the market. I think you guys call them "bearwhales".


People have their bitcoin stolen every day.


The value of bitcoin is contingent on human whim, so it doesn't offer much protection against that.
I think you guys worry a lot more about your wealth randomly decreasing by 20% overnight than I do with my USD.

Securing a paper wallet is less complicated, but it's still more than most people are capable of dealing with. People are not good at coming up with secure passphrases, making redundant copies, or geo-replication.


The effect is the same. The average person doesn't care why their money lost 20% of its value overnight, they only care about the fact that it did.


Not an individual, but the collective whim of bitcoin owners.






No, I get your point. I just think it's silly to say "Bitcoin is safer than fiat because a government can't devalue it!" when its price fluctuates rapidly due to speculation and manipulation.
It's a point for you for not having to worry about the whims of the government affecting your wealth, but it's also a point against you because you have to worry about the whims of everyone else on the planet affecting your wealth.
Not sure what this is supposed to mean. In the past month alone, the price has gone up more than 20% and has almost dropped back down 20% since the peak. You guys have to worry about huge price swings far more than USD holders, especially since 99.99% of goods aren't priced in bitcoin.

3. To ensure anonymity, meet the seller late at night in a deserted place. A dark alley or abandoned parking garage are perfect, if available.
4. Go alone and do not tell any of your friends or family where you are going. It's the only way to maintain anonymity.
5. Bring a large tarp, roll of duct tape, bone saw, shovel, lighter, and a can of gasoline to make disposing of your corpse easier for the seller after he murders you and steals your money.

Yeah, because it does not make sense to allow potential criminals to dispose of evidence before their trial.
If you're in possession of a duffel bag full of cash after a bank robbery that you're suspected of being involved in, that duffel bag of cash is evidence.
If you're in possession of a bloody knife after a murder, that knife is evidence. You shouldn't be able to sell it or give it to a friend so that they can throw it into a river for you.

I guess you view due process as a formality on the road to the divinely ordained punishment of those who do evil!


The money was earned from a criminal act, as evidenced by the holy blockchain. You don't get to keep the profits from your criminal enterprises.
Let me ask you something... Why do we lock people up before they are convicted of a crime? We take people who are presumed innocent and lock them in a cage for days to even months before they are proven guilty in court. By your logic, shouldn't we let these people walk free until they are convicted?

Cryptocurrencies have a 100% failure rate. Fact.
If you exclude the cryptocurrencies which are still being actively used (like bitcoin, litecoin, and dogecoin) and look solely at the ones that no one uses anymore (like Flappy and NDL), it becomes obvious that 100% of cryptocurrencies fall into disuse.

There was a chat transcript between Ross and someone else, where Ross says he's going to allow a vendor to sell cyanide:


























So there, now you have proof that poisons were sold there. You also have proof that Ross was aware of it and allowed it to happen.

If they have enough evidence to get a warrant for your arrest, then yes the money should be considered evidence and seized.


Why would it be crazy? Sounds like a great idea to me.
You get arrested for robbing a bank, but you gift all of the stolen money to your immediate family before your arrest. During your trial they use it for all kinds of stuff like rent payments, vacations, food, services, college tuition, etc. Several months later, you're found guilty. What's the state supposed to do then? Go to all of your family members and try to sue them for the stolen money that they've already spent?
How would you feel if a criminal stole your car and the police allowed him to gift the car to his family while he was awaiting trial? Or if they allowed him to sell it for cash to fund his defense? After all, it's his car until he is found guilty of stealing it...


Well that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? To me, Ross is way worse than a bank robber.
A bank's money is insured, so it's really not a big loss if they lose a few thousand dollars. Ross made money by facilitating the anonymous sale of drugs, stolen property, weapons, poisons, etc. Even ignoring his attempts to have people murdered, I think his crimes had a lot more potential to do harm to society than a bank robbery.

1. Your sources are shit. The fact that these were the "top 2 google searches" just demonstrates that no reputable sources are making this ridiculous claim.
2. If "all paper money systems failed" as your first link says, then why are there still paper money systems? Obviously some of them haven't failed yet.

I bet it's even worse. I bet he made drip coffee out of the office coffee pot using office supplied sugar and creamer, and he was charging per cup for his labor.
He probably stood next to the coffee pot all morning and blocked co-workers from getting any unless they paid him for starting the pot.
I cringe just thinking about it.

That was just one of the guys he tried to have killed. There was another guy who allegedly lived with three roommates. When the guy pretending to be Hell's Angels said it would be easier to kill all of them instead of just one, Ross went with that idea. Killing three people he didn't even know just to get to one guy.

He sent Charlie a bunch of physical Casascius coins with the understanding that he would be paid once Charlie sold them. Charlie sold them and failed to pay in full. started a thread on bitcointalk about it and Charlie admitted to not paying in full. Charlie claimed that he hadn't sold them all yet. After many pages, Charlie eventually set up a payment plan where he promised to pay a certain amount per week with interest. After that, he never sent anything and stopped replying in the thread.
Also of note is that somewhere in that thread someone asked Charlie why he couldn't just send the remaining Casascius coins back to bracek, and Charlie shot down that idea by saying it would be faster for him to sell them and make payments instead.
EDIT - Here's the thread so you can read it yourself. I've linked the post where Charlie promised to pay interest and then stopped responding:

So if I am caught red handed after a bank robbery with a duffel bag full of cash, that money is mine until I am guilty and I am allowed to give it away or spend it before my trial?
No, the police will (legally and rightfully) seize that cash.

Or maybe someone is lying about their property or body being damaged, taken, or threatened... Or they are mistaken about who did it?


Why is it another thing? Assets can be hidden away just as easily as people can run off. Arguably more easily with an asset like bitcoin.
I doubt the feds would have been able to seize as many bitcoins as they did if they had waited until the trial was over to do it. Ross could have given anyone the information about the wallets and the funds could have been transferred somewhere else. The government is supposed to sit back and do nothing as millions of dollars in ill-gotten money is hidden away under their noses?
If that was the rule, white collar crime would be far more profitable. Just have all your assets transferred somewhere overseas while your lawyer delays the trial as long as possible.

The point of his post seems to be that accessing his Chase account makes him angry partly because "there's always some annoying step that needs to be completed". But the only reason he has to go through that is because he can't remember his username/password.
It would be like me complaining about how annoying bitcoin is because I have to jackhammer through ten feet of concrete to access my paper wallets. Is it bitcoin's fault that I made things so difficult for myself?

For any reasonable person, this sets off a few red flags...
1. If the coin is worth so much, why doesn't he sell it to the coin shop himself? Is he lying about its value? Is it fake? Is it stolen?
2. Why does he have a microphone and camera? Is this one of those stupid YouTube pranks? Is he doing an investigation into people buying stolen property on street corners?

I believe the government gave all the drug vendors and buyers a chance to claim some of the coins. For some reason none of them did though...

That guy just brute forces wallet passwords. OP needs a professional data recovery service. The computer shop I used to work at used  and they helped a few people, though none of the customers we had used RAID 0 SSDs.
These services are pretty expensive though. The cheapest I've seen them recover data from a dead HDD was a few hundred bucks, so OP's situation could easily cost quadruple that. For $20k+ of data it is probably worth it though.
