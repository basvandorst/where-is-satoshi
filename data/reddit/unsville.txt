Shill much?

Is Craig Satoshi?

Hum, sounds a lot like Blockstream and Lightning?
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:46:22
This is a great idea and I would do the same if it was legal where I live. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 02:24:43
Yeah, maybe when you work for it

No we do not welcome them with open arms. 
I personally do not subscribe to the atrocities that Socialism leads to, and what those people are doing is just exactly what I do not want to see. We do not need anarchists in the world, and their conversion proves that.
This comes from a person whose country abolished a long lasting dictatorship with flowers on the military guns. Some people called us pussies for that, but at least my country and values emerged stronger than ever.

Ah, ok, good for you. Will not argue that, comedy can be found everywhere, it’s all in the state state of mind of the beholder ��

Hum, what is the relation between BitcoinSV and the flat earth theory? I genuinely seem to be missing your point.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:10:51
He is not lying.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:49:52
Oh, finally someone actually recognises he has a law degree. Slowly but surely the narrative is changing.

Right. And looking at your spelling, I assume you are not, right? ;)
Point is, that's a kinda stupid reason to 'blame' and distrust someone.
P.S. You all can downvote me to the ground, it won't change reality. It just goes to show the unjustified hatred for a character that is really pushing Bitcoin forward like you will, probably, never find in this subreddit. Open your minds people, it won't hurt you.

Yes, this message is legit. 
Craig is just stating what he believes to be facts. He will not, alone, destroy BTC. What he describes is that other people already did when implementing SegWit, but most can not see it. He did not implement SegWit as you can see on the non modified Bitcoin versions, v0.0.1 if you believe he is Satoshi or BSV if you believe he is not Satoshi. In the end, protocol wise, they will be the same.
Related to “pushing” bitcoin forward, I was most definitely not referring to destroying BTC. By pushing Bitcoin forward I refer to all the work enabled by an unbounded Bitcoin. Important to note, unbounded != unlimited. A great example of this is the work released just today on tokens on top of Bitcoin. The work that some really wanted to have done a handful of years ago but were shutoff because of the network limits that BTC has. This is not opinion, it is a fact.
I am not arguing what is better and what’s not, I’m not arguing what is gonna happen or not. I am just saying that progress is being made on other chains, both on BCH and BSV and unfortunately, for me as well, BTC seems to be going nowhere. Bitcoin Wednesday in Amsterdam (a meetup group) tried to use Lightning for ticketing their next event. It did not work out in the end, not sure about why, but the fact is that I could not pay with Lightning. If they open their minds and give a shot to something like Handcash (a non custodial BitcoinSV wallet), it will work. That’s the most important, that it just works! Bitcoin just works even if you were told otherwise. 
If you really have an open mind and wouldn’t mind trying a simple iOS/Android app, please install Handcash and share with me privately your handle. I will send you several times a few cents to illustrate to you personally what is Bitcoin. You can always uninstall the app later, no problem. 
Actually, this offer is also valid to anyone who sees this message. I will send Bitcoin instantly to every single handle that lands on my DM inbox. Let’s see how many of the 1M subset that sees this message are really open minded people.

What if he actually was the main responsible for the Satoshi Nakamoto alias? 
Would you be willing to give up a bit of your privacy on what could become a libellous petition? 
Not saying it is, or that it will, but if the probability is not 0, chances are that it could become one.
