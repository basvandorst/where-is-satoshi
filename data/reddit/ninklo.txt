Wait how did you buy on silkroad without using crypto?
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:45:54
Well doesn't




because how can you exchange things if you don't own them?

Just give up man, it's impossible to reason with libertarians. It's like debating a creationist, you'll never actually win the debate no matter how right you are.
@_date: 2014-08-06 01:49:50
This place is overrun by libertarians. Give the debate up now, there's no way to knock sense into libertarians.

He entrusted his wealth to others and they screwed him out of it. How does that make him feel?
In the same manner, his sister entrusted her wealth to him (well, technically his parents entrusted his sister's wealth to hium, I guess) and he screwed her out of it. How does that make her feel? He probably doesn't care.

I think that digital currencies are too useful to not eventually make it into the mainstream in one form or another. Though Bitcoin might not be that form, and of course it'd be nice for such currencies to gain mainstream acceptance sooner rather than later.

Wait what did McAfee do?

Note the username, sounds like a trump supporter. Don't waste your time on him.

I find it quite humbling that Satoshi published the paper anonymously. Like, he could become so famous right now and be forever known as the inventor of future digital currency.

Amazing doge! Much amazed. Can I have some too?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:25:25
I feel horrible for laughing at this.

My bad, thought you were kingofthejaffacakes.
He said,


[According to Wikipedia]( fiat is


So now have I finally pointed to something he said that's correct?
Thanks so much for all the uncalled for insults, by the way. They really contribute to the discussion.

They've been sitting in my account for four months now, so not newly minted at all. I've tried changing the server to electrum.be, but still no luck.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:40:44
Okay cool, thanks for the info! Do you know approximately how long it will take?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:33:46
I doubt this dipshit even realizes what 299314 is trying to say.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:35:49
So the bitcoins were in your Coinbase account, and you tried to transfer them out, but they're still "pending"? Good to know, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:22:26
Care to point me to specific comments? I haven't seen anything incorrect from him, whereas you said


Which isn't the definition of "fiat." Sorry.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:00:03
Thanks, Electrum crashed. I started it again, changed servers one more time, and it finally worked.

The original RSA algorithm is spoiled? I thought it was just Dual_EC_DRBG

Each confirmation takes 10 minutes on average (this is by design; the difficulty adjusts up/down so that the 10-minute thing stays true).
So 6 confirmations = 60 minutes = 1 hour, on average.




This contradicts your earlier point about Bitcoin appreciating in value. If Bitcoin appreciates in value (deflation), then prices will fall.

Interesting. I don't see my transaction (f7a2e7dae9755d019a5aae3ab5437bdb9536a34fcd7e3a355188818688e20b4b) in that list, and the unconfirmed ones at the bottom are from December 2012? :O
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:41:21
No worries man, these tips are getting expensive :O Thank you so much!
And thanks again for the information! I got it figured out and finally managed to send my friend 0.002 BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:55:13
Excellent, thanks for the info, and the tip!
@_date: 2013-03-17 21:05:12
All of that is possible right now, except for perhaps "how you wouldn't need to go to the store to shop for grocieries" (though Amazon can deliver some foodstuffs too)... what is meant by it not being very evenly distributed?
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:09:00
Aww. Apparently there's also a $0.10 minimum tip amount.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:38:35
Fuuuuuck man... I really, really fucking hope this guy is just trolling and so no actual records exist of something like this happening.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:36:57
He didn't "decide" what the definition of fiat is. Look it up on wikipedia. He's right.
