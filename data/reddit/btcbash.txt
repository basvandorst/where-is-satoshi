I don't think so I have been using other wallets on my mobile without any issue. If it was compromised wondering why it took 7 hrs to empty my wallet?

I had to transfer it to someone and was in a hurry so missed to research before transferring to blockchain.info. Paid the price :(

I used web browser to open account also got mail confirmation from blockchain.info and within an hour I did TXN also can see it my account on blockchain.info, if it's phissing why it took 7 hrs to get hold of my wallet?

Actually i was mining bitcoin and altcoins on 2013  but due to mtgox collapse I suffered heavy loss and sold all my Bitcoins for 400 dollars at that time and stayed away from bitcoin for a while, I decided to come back on last quarter so purchased the bitcoin from my savings amount and on 2013 blockchain.info had a good reputation and reliable I believed it still had so transferred it straight away in order to re pay some debt
