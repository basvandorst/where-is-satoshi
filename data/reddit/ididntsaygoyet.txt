So, banks.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:23:51
Right?? And people complain when I deliver delicious cold pizza.. three hours late. I don't know what the problem is.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:18:14
I'm so excited in this technology and the possibilities. Great post.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:18:22
The news would be all over this shit.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:25:47
That's funny. My weed dealer accepts Bitcoin (online form) and I would _never_ use that for drugs (for reasons of hodling).
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:48:26
Well put. Sorry for the name calling, but I hope you understand by from the info I have, this could've been avoided. I would've treated those sexy coins much, much better ;)
It's just frustrating reading these stories. But I guess it's good for the audience, showing what _not_ to do. Lol
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:21:20
Just throw hard drives. They hurt more than paper ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:21
Let me rephrase. I helped them invest through my verified accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:57
I've invested my friend's money and they're all down around -20%. I invested at $300, still up 6,000%, just hodling away :)

��.. On the first K of bitcoin, Satoshi gave to mee.. ��
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:51:52
Malaka! *That means thanks, right?*
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:41:20
You're not wrong, but wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:03:15
Are you fucked? If you had 1 million+, there's no fucking way you could accidentally do anything to it, unless you didn't understand the technology or how it worked.
Glad you're getting some sort of money out of it though.. through bullshit interviews, media attention, or whatnot..
And if this is real, and you truly are the idiot that accidentally throws out millions, well, sucks for you. Go get 'er. I'd love to hear about your trash adventures and what you find.
Edit: and you're into Bcash? This story just keeps getting more stupid lol
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:32:13
It's funny that this is actually possible now..
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:00:50
edit: I was so wrong..  but now I get it. The previous rules remain haha..
here's a real answer to your block:




@_date: 2015-05-23 15:10:13
solution is also 32 :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:50:41
ohhhh i get it now...
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:32:10
How many times would this need to happen until the value of all alts is zero? This is suicide for miners.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:04:47
edited! woo!  thanks for the lesson :)
someone use my blockchain, dammit! Don't leave me hanging! :p
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:01:08
There's no more ways that I know of to call a slice of pizza..
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:05:44
Whisky is the only way to spell it (source: am Canadian and HODLING).
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:12:43




Is it cheating if I go ahead and use someone's unverified block?
I'm using guosim's block 8 solution (edit: which is now verified, woot)
@_date: 2016-03-29 07:06:22
We used to have a boardgame café, but they've stopped accepting bitcoin due to lack of people using it.
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:02:08
Would I be a fool to believe you guys? Because i really don't want to do the math on this..
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:42:16
Wrote that comment before even thinking about it, but you're right! :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:31:00
Up'ing the difficulty just made finding a solution that much more satisfying. Still waiting on a Block 10, people!
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:06:17
He laughed. I laughed. It was a good joke :)
The app doesn't let you add them.
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:04:09
Yeah, because misspelling almost every single word is professional and trustworthy..
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:16:13
I'd disagree. It doesn't *have* to be cheaper or easier. It's just a different kind of workflow.
Instead of dealing with reels and having your 2nd AC load, you have him dealing with cards and DIT instead. Although I'd say it is easier for post, as well as dailies, if everything goes perfectly smoothly.
Edit: forgot I was in r/bitcoin, haha sorry. HODL!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:42:43
My guess is about, or just under 10%. RIP :(
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:09:33
I use both. Both suck for stuff. Both are awesome for other stuff. World Peace solved.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:20:19
Why are your winnings taxed in the US? That's dumb.
@_date: 2016-11-09 06:09:36
Trying to buy bitcoin but my two step is screwing me :(
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:39:08
Thanks for promoting bitcoin!
But sorry for your loss, both in bitcoin, and government, if he wins.
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:24:32
I guess people will find that out themselves after buying a tiny amount in BTC for test transfers. At least this'll get them through the door to a new world.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:53:34
Every single time I sold a bit, bitcoin went up a huge percentage, making me feel terrible lol.
Never sell (unless necessary)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:28:59
This is what is interesting. Does the limit of coins actually give it value because they're literally rare? Or is it going to have the opposite effect..
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:32:27
r/bitcoinca is a sub that may interest you!
I use Quadriga, but, the fastest way to buy is to go to a Bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:14:42
I haven't taken it yet, so I'm not technically a customer. I'd be taking it 3-4 times/week if I could pay with BTC (I don't have a credit card).
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:08:44
This reply answered exactly zero of his questions..
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:12:38
I don't have a CC (which is used to disallow multiple accounts/ratings), so I can't yet use the service. With Bitcoin, registering a specific wallet would allow me to use Uber, which would allow at least two more customers :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:40
The price went down a certain percentage... Then went back up... Then down... Up.... Down...
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:23:34
I probably should have looked into it a bit more.. Thanks mate!
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:08:48
That's fair. You've shown proof of your idiocy, he might as well show you his proof of wealth.
It's people like you that make winning with Bitcoin that much sweeter.
@_date: 2015-08-05 01:04:51
YES! That is awesome!
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:32:45
Lol. Immediately went Aussie while reading that
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:41:28
He made a newb mistake and is being rewarded for it? Wut?
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:00:52
You fucked up.
Moving on..
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:34:59
Our DDoS will blot out the sun!..
..Then we shall fight on Reddit.
@_date: 2016-10-06 09:32:35
Hey that one works!
@_date: 2015-11-11 18:25:10
If you buy 3 btc, you'll have 3 btc. That's what matters right now.
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:25:23
14 billion?! That means everyone could only have max 0.0015 BTC split between them. I'm not giving ANYONE my fucking coins. Get away, future China.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:56:44
He bought it for 10,000 BTC?!?  Omg. What a sacrifice to make to get the ball rolling, but damn, that's a **$22,420,000 USD** pizza right now lol
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:00:04
I sold some coin ( USD) to pay for tax on time, but if I knew it'd be hitting $2300 USD, shortly after, I would have never touched my stash and found other means (though other means may not even exist, and Bitcoin probably saved my life).
@_date: 2016-05-31 05:24:07
And governments are opposed to this? This makes their job easy!
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:50:27
So in a sense, theoretically, there'd be no point in trading between the two.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:51:41
Bitcoin on Mars, as it's main currency. Now *that* would be pretty epic.
I'm hodling until we become multi planetary...
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:56:15
The cinematography is amazing! The acting is fantastic. The themes are real. In my opinion, this is a great show and I'm highly enjoying it.
I'm also Canadian though, so we may be more open to certain ideas.. though if you want to get technical, that part, for me, showed how far he's willing to go to get *ahead*....  I'll show myself out.
You fucked up by not watching further.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:21:53
That means I can put bitcoins into PayPal, and pay for Über! Amazing
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:04:39
My issue is that it keeps making me verify my device almost once per day.. whyyyy
@_date: 2016-10-04 11:15:06
Ahh! I can't see any of those symbols!!  Bahh
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:40:54
That's almost $7m CAD today lol
