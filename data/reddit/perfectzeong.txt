I just dont get the thinking, unless the plan is to try and force as many people to accept bitcoin as he can to achieve mass adoption. But its adding a lot of unnecessary steps versus just paying in euros. He gets paid, he then buys bitcoin,  then sends the bitcoin out to pay for his stuff which all takes time and energy that the people who receive it have to then convert it back into a useful currency.

So why not just pay all your expenses in the currency that's available to you and then save the rest as bitcoin? It feels like you're adding a huge step in the middle for no reason if all that money is going out anyway.

Yeah I bet the browns are going to go 16 and 0 this year. It's not a good bet but I'm making it.

I feel like you're in sleep on mattress full of money levels of paranoid at that point, if you're guarding your private keys. I probably cant discourage that because I'm sure you're going to do what you do. But I dont think it's a very prudent idea and I feel like theres a good reason we dont do that anymore.
Yeah the only reason I could really surmise is to try and increase other peoples use of the currency but it still feels like a lot of extra steps are being taken here for no discernable benefit.

The people who are imagining these magical lambos for doing nothing arent usually the most prudent of investors.

The fact that you don't know if a line of credit is in fact a line of credit whether or not there is a physical card issued for it means you should in no way shape or form open a bank.

And if he complies with the fbi,  then why would anyone want to give him their business?
