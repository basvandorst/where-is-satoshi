Are you familiar with how inflation works and how money is created in our monetary system?
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:39:33
Great. So do you acknowledge the basic fact that money enters into the system in a discriminatory way and disproportionately benefits some at the expense of many? 
Money is created directly into the coffers of private banks via bond purchases of the federal reserve. Those private banks then have full discretion as to whom they open lines of credit. In the vast majority of cases, these include multi-million dollars lines of credit with corporations and wealthy individuals. The average person has no such capacity to borrow to such an extreme extent. The interest alone would crush the average person's fixed costs of living. End result? Everyone is affected by inflation, but some disproportionately benefit from the created money, while others only get hit by the negatives. Do you acknowledge this?

Thank you. I read the above comment and had the exact same thought. 
What's the harm in the occasional credit expenditure on a luxury item? The harm is the simple fact that the *majority* of the world's population doesn't have access to something so luxurious as a credit card and must work long hours in grueling conditions with minuscule pay just to feed themselves and their family. Your guilty pleasure expenses are another person's entire food budget.
Economics is a zero sum game. The entire credit producing monstrosity that we call central banking affects the prices of goods at a *global* scale. The frivolous waste of the American lifestyle (caused by the ridiculous credit incentives) is the starvation of thousands globally.

Most of Bitcoin's use is as a store of value, like gold. Use as a convenient payment mechanism comes with products like the lightning network.
Intrinsic value is an outdated and meaningless understanding of market valuation. Because nothing is intrinsic. All markets are subjectively based on supply and demand of the good. Gold, and everything else, has no value without someone to value it. Value is, itself, an abstract and subjective concept that exists in the minds of humans. Money is simply recorded value. That's it.

Nah. Any legislation will be multiple steps behind criminal activity. Legislation will completely fail at every turn.

Hit one crypto with legal limitations and you've just created incentive to make 5 more, with even more privacy. It's, literally, a waste of effort. Government couldn't prevent crime with cash, and they can't prevent it with crypto. It's laughable how out of touch legislators and the general public are with the situation. 
You would, literally, have to threaten jail time against those who don't disclose their crypto to the government. And even then, you're not going to catch the criminals who know what they're doing.

Not a leap. Economic waste occurs when resources are wasted on frivolous and unimportant entertainment + pleasure. Resources that could be better spent in capital investment. Spent on improving *real* things. And being that the USD is the world reserve currency, it's *pretty damn significant* when the Fed specifically targets a wildy expansionary monetary policy (via endless credit induced by low fixed interest rates). This DIRECTLY affects the price of goods GLOBALLY. Most USD is used OUTSIDE of the United States. Quite literally, our largest export is U.S. dollars. We get the world's stuff. They get increasingly worthless paper. The connection between the American standard of living and global economic prices is direct and absolute. No leap required.

Nothing has intrinsic worth. Everything has relative and subjective worth. Gold has value to the extent that it serves industrial purposes and its capacity to serve as a immutable and limited standard for recording value. If cryptos prove to be a better standard for storing value, then cryptos will be relatively BETTER than gold at storing value. Intrinsic value is meaningless. 
Cockroaches are intrinsically valuable as a food, but are relatively worthless by comparison to other foods. But if you're stranded in a cave and the only food around you in cockroaches, then cockroaches become incredibly valuable as food. Its all about context.


This is very different from fiat currency. An IOU for a specified amount of gold is not the same as a piece of paper with a completely indeterminate value and no guarantee of worth. 


Yes it does. The value is the capacity to trade and create more net wealth as a result. Without currency, there would be less wealth. Currency has value to the extent of the wealth it creates. If a currency is so poorly managed such that it rapidly loses its purchasing power, then its desired use (value) will cease to exist. Value is merely another word for supply and *demand*.

1) The American living standard (which presumes these frivolous expenditures not available to most of the planet) is heavily reliant on a system of ever expanding credit. 2) Credit expansion increases the supply of USD. 3) Increase in the money supply induces inflation. 4) Inflation of USD effects global prices on food and energy. 5) People struggling to afford basic necessities, especially those barely getting by, are effected by these prices. 6) Some of those people (and there are a LOT of them) *starve to death*.
This is a Cold. Hard. FACT. And remember, the USD is manipulated by the Federal Reserve. Interest rates are kept artificially low to allow for unatturally easy access to credit. Credit which, again, sustains a large portion of the average American's lifestyle.
American entitlement is astronomical. The American government and banks are financially raping the world and STILL Americans proclaim to be victims.

See, but you're even wrong about Bitcoin being able to drop to zero. It certainly can. Intrinsic value is absolutely meaningless when determining what someone will pay for a good. Sunk cost fallacy. If there is no demand, it is worth 0. Very simple.
You think Bitcoin will correct to $1,000 because of some arbitrary intrinsic value. Meaningless. That's not what determines "true" value.  Bitcoin just went through a 45% correction and you, apparently, don't consider that significant. Probably because it's "still above its intrinsic value". That's irrelevant. What it currently provides is storing value. That's it.

Some significant amount of goods. Obviously we can't use today's measurement in dollars. But, considering the significant increases in efficiency, I would imagine that a single ounce of gold purchased you quite a lot in the ancient world. Also considering the fact that a significant amount of gold has been mined since then. Point being, fiat is reliant on responsible monetary controls. Something that, when subject to political pressure, doesn't exactly work. Gold supply is significantly more fixed. It also serves many other purposes that make it a good money. That's why it has always stored value.

It absolutely does. Its a global market. It competes with currency used to purchase it.


It is beyond comprehensible how wrong that is. The HISTORY of human civilization was built on deflationary currencies (gold/silver). Why do we need excessive credit in the first place? Because prices are high. Why are prices high and continuing to rise? BECAUSE OF INFLATION AND EASY ACCESS TO DEBT. One generation ago you could pay your way through college on a part time job. Now you need to go into crippling debt to get a degree that *might* be worth the spending. Credit works *just fine* in a deflationary system. It merely requires a floating and not a *fixed* interest rate like we have now. An interest rate, by the way, that is *SHOCKINGLY* low and has left the economy in a dangerous corner. One more recession and we can easily see *negative* interest rates like in Japan and parts of Europe. This is an absolutely UNSUSTAINABLE system and it boggles my mind that people can't see that simple fact.


Wrong. False. It merely requires that the potential spending/investment COMPETE with your currency. People will still invest. People will still buy products. But they will only spend handsomely on WORTHWHILE investments and not on any *frivolous* product that comes along.
And I just *KNOW* you're going to bring up the "inflation prevents hoarding" horseshit, so take a look at this graph. It charts the velocity of money in the economy. Velocity measures the rate at which dollars are spent and circulate through the system. The higher the velocity, the more spending. The lower the velocity, the more hoarding. Take a look.

No. The federal reserve 100% caused the financial crisis. You only think they "fixed it" because they've merely kicked the can down the road, once again. How? By keeping the interest rate absurdly low for much too long. Our entire banking system has become dependant on cheap access to money. When the interest rate is suppressed, banks tend to make more bad loans in attempts to find more ROI. Entire industries arise which are dependent on cheap access to money.
In 2006, the Fed attempted to increase the interest rate and the economy, which had been built on bad loans, reacted by experiencing withdrawal systems in 2008. Instead of letting the economy go through a needed recovery cycle, we're back to incredible levels of irresponsible debt, both private and public, caused by near ZERO interest rates and by astronomical levels of currency creation. The only thing the Fed fixed is the illusion that the economy and banking system is healthy. One more recession and the Fed will "fix" the economy by pushing rates into the negatives. This is a perpetual downward spiral of denial economics.

I agree that gold standard currencies have volatility and I agree that they have their own problems. But to say that gold is a "bad" currency when it has been used as one for thousands of years is kind of an exaggeration. Gold is bad when you're a government that needs to keep funding programs which no longer have a source for that funding. 
The Athenians debased their currency to fight the Spartans. The Romans debased their currency to fund wars and social programs. The Chinese had a currency collapse due to rampant counterfeiting. The Germans printed their currency into oblivion to pay for war reparations. Our currency has been created into the trillions and it is very unlikely that the Fed will ever actually undergo a QT. The political climate is such that we will never cut spending and will only keep going into more debt, so we're always going to need more money.
My argument isn't that a fixed supply currency is perfect, my argument is that a fixed supply currency inevitably re-emerges as a baseline currency when hyperinflation destroys fiat currencies. Something that nobody thinks will happen because *this time* we've got the whole thing figured out. *This time* our central banking system will be able to anticipate and prevent any and all outcomes
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:35
What's your definition of currency? The definition I'm most familiar with is quite broad. And Bitcoin satisfies the basic requirements.
??? Hyperdeflation occurs when the currency drastically increases in value. If Bitcoin goes through hyperdeflation, it increases in value. That makes it a good store of value. How did you come to the conclusion that hyperdeflation is bad for storing value?
But I agree that Bitcoin is not an optimal currency for everyday transaction. It serves better as a savings account or in its use of transferring large amounts of value. The transaction fees and wait times still significantly outcompete the entire wire transfer system. Another crypto could easily be created that better satisfies everyday use and has an inflationary base.

Any spending can help the GDP numbers go up. The GDP is not the economy. It is a measurement tool. Tomorrow the government can spend 4 trillion dollars on building barbie doll factories and employ millions of workers making barbie dolls. GDP will go up and unemployment will go down. But... Nobody needs the barbie dolls, so these factories will require a CONTINUOUS injection of money in order to stay afloat. That's not healthy and sustainable economic development. You now have to figure out a way to come up with 4 Trillion a year to maintain the GDP numbers you created with your barbie doll stimulus. They won't just stay there naturally.

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:49:30
I'm comparing it to all currencies with a fiat monetary base. A central bank backing isn't really relevant because the issue is the valuation and supply of a currency. Not the issuer. Government or central bank, it doesn't really matter. And, historically, 99% of all fiat currencies ever issued have failed. Central bank or no. The Weimar Republic's central bank hyperinflated the value of the German Mark. Result was a collapse of the currency and economic disaster.
Now, again, the monetary system of today, for the entire globe, has only existed on a fiat standard for 46 years. I didn't say Fiat currencies immediately collapse. They have, without fail, collapsed none the less. The British Pound has been going on for quite a while, but only in name really. Backed by Stirling Silver for most of its existence and altered a number of times in the 20th century.
The Romans managed to debase their currency and "print" copper denarius after previously using pure gold for over a hundred years before it collapsed. But it did collapse, yet the value of gold itself has remain since the Egyptian times. I would argue that we're operating on a relatively short timescale because of the signifcantly increased speed at which we conduct our economic business. 
Entities like the Fed can, and certainly do, induce a "controlled rate" of inflation in our fiat currency. Something many economists would say is healthy. What the fed cannot do, however, is *prevent* massive hyperinflation. Once a currency goes down that path, it's pretty much done for. Well. I guess you could technically prevent hyperinflation. But you would have to "destroy" circulating currency. Something that, ultimately, requires a loss of wealth on someone's behalf. Something that the Fed or any other central bank is ever likely to do. A QT of the Fed balance sheet would simply undue the 2008 "fix" and would certainly cause another recession.

99% of fiat currencies, ever created, have collapsed. That's just a historical fact. Fiat, meaning, mandated by government "fiat" only with no precious metal or commodity backing.
And yes. The globe has been operating under a fiat monetary system for ONLY 46 years. We're living in a completely experimental system. Literally never seen before in history. USD was backed by gold prior to 1971 while most world currencies were backed by the USD. This was called the Breton Woods system. Prior to that, many world currencies were, themselves, backed by gold. Being backed by gold is an important factor for a currency. It prevents excessive currency creation. Remember when I said 99% of fiat currencies have collapsed? Yea... mostly because of excessive currency creation...

Perpetual inflation is only good for the economy insofar as it encourages spending to pump GDP numbers. But it DOESN'T gaurantee any economic development. It DOESN'T prevent wasteful, frivolous spending. When money is deflationary, your spending and investment habits actually have to compete for the use of your dollars. Deflation will naturally occur when there is too much spending and too many wasteful investments. People will hold onto their dollars until an investment comes along that actually outperforms your dollar! See, nobody is looking at this problem in the correct way. Is hoarding *always* bad? No. Is spending *always* good? No. It DEPENDS on the contextual needs of the economy at any given time. That's why we used to see natural inflationary and deflationary cycles. Deflation isn't the problem. Its the corrective SYMPTOM of a mis-allocated economy. You can't cure the problem by suppressing the symptom.

Yep. Prices would fall due to efficiencies. Absolutely. But that just frees up capital to be used in other areas, which, utimately causes a net neutral price inflation/deflation. Look at any CPI chart prior to 1913 in the United States. The U.S. experienced the industrial revolution and yet there was completely stagnant inflation on a year to year average. Why? Fixed money supply on the original gold standard. The increased purchasing power afforded due to industrial revolution inefficiencies were instead invested in whole new industries. The economy expanded to meet the demand created by the newly afforded purchasing power.

You can take BTC loans on exchange websites if you *really* want to, but it would be foolish to do anything with the loan except for use in trading. Bitcoin is way too volatile. And why is it volatile? Because it has not seen mass adoption. I can explain further if you find this concept difficult to understand, but its very straightforward.


Just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is mined at a slow rate, which decreases year to year. Bitcoin is *ultimately* deflationary in that there will no longer be Bitcoin to mine in hundreds of years. *JUST LIKE GOLD*. There is a *fixed* supply of gold on the planet to mine, despite our year to year accumulation of it. You're confusing concepts.


You're just wrong. Just flat out wrong. Spending per student has been going up for decades. Why do you feel the need to make up statistics?


Spending has *ABSOLUTELY NOT* increased. Velocity of money plummeted after 2008 and is STILL at record lows. It is 100%, irrefutably wrong to say that the rate of spending has increased. You merely *think* that spending has increased because prices are somewhat stable. No. Less people are spending, but more spending of created currency is being done. These are two very different concepts.
Velocity of money directly measures the rate at which Americans spend the their money. You're just so wrong.


You worship at the altars of the Almighty GDP and Unemployment rate. You're a blind acolyte to these measurements. So long as those two figures are up, everything is fine! Don't mind the crippled real wage earnings. Don't mind the cripplesd labor force participation rate. Don't mind the record high retirement age. Don't mind the record high amount of part-time jobs and proliferation of underemployment. Don't mind the record high household debt! Don't mind the record high corporate debt! Don't mind the frighteningly low interest rate! Don't mind the crippled bond yields! Don't mind  the astronomical rate at which currency is being created! Don't mind! Don't pay attention! None of it matters! 
The *ONLY* thing that matters is the GDP and Unemployment rate! Because those are the only two statistics that could possibly measure the health of the economy, and history shows us that once GDP and unemployment are well and good, they NEVER go back down! It's just endless happiness and prosperity forever!

Additionally, every single dollar created to patch up the banking system when it leaks results in a devaluation of the wealth of everyone else. And it occurs without any election or vote people the people it affects.

Now you're just being petty and arrogant. I don't think Bitcoin is valuable "soley because of its limited supply". That's an absolute bastardization of everything I've said. Bitcoin is valuable because it has a variety of unique uses as a financial instrument *and* it is limited in supply.

What I'm worried about isn't more printing, actually. I'm worried about all the money that was ALREADY printed. I believe the inflation hasn't fully hit yet. Actually, I think we've "exported" our inflation, in a sense. Where? To the Middle East and any country that deals in USD/oil. More than HALF of all USD is outside the United States. Used for settlement of sale and purchse of oil and energy. USD is pegged to oil sales in agreements like OPEC. This creates significant demand for USD, so USD printed here flows outside the country. Is it a coincidence that many major middle eastern countries, who oil deal in USD, suffered major inflation directly after the Fed's 2008-2012 dollar pumping frenzy? The Arab spring largely arose due to skyrocketing housing and food prices. I think I know where USD inflation went...
The the question is, what happens when the USD is unpegged from oil? Where is all that USD going to go? Perhaps the only place left that requires its acceptance as legal tender by law...

Libertarians also don't want massive tax incentives and subsidies. Like the billions of dollars pumped into oil, and the billions pumped into big pharma, and the billions pumped into the banking sphere. Highest expenditures on medical care on the planet, yet one of the lowest qualities of care in the West. Trickle-down is a ridiculous concept when you ALSO live in a system which redistributes wealth back up stream, mostly via taxes on the poor and middle class.
You can *scream* at the top of your lungs for higher taxes day after day and it won't do anything to help the average American. Why? Because the people who distribute the tax money are paid by the people who already have the money. The system, at its core, is corrupt. Superficial changes like higher taxes will do nothing.

Yes it has. Just broaden the time scale. It has gone down 60% from peak to valley multiple times over the course of a few years. The S&amp;P has an absurdly high market cap, so I measure it in years, not months.

No. You completely missed the entire point of my post. Fiat currencies have no fixed supply. Gold does. Bitcoin was designed to have a gaurenteed, fixed supply.

An interest rate of 1.5% is now considered HIGH in the Central banking sphere. That is ABSURD. There is, literally, nowhere left for rates to go but negative! Just one more recession and the whole scheme is fucked! The crash was and is coming regardless of Bitcoin. At least now there exists an easily accessible alternative for the average person to purchase when the crash comes! Because there sure isn't enough physical gold for the average Joe to just purchase at a moments notice.

If you think velocity of money is a "useless" metric, then you're just flat out ignorant. Velocity of money is the ENTIRE REASON the Fed claims to lower interest rates and create monetized debt. If this seems "useless" to you, then you're just flat out *ignorant* and not worth talking to.

And the ones who do will get burned, and the one's who don't won't. It's a trivial difference to accept the real thing from the IOU, but the consequences are not trivial. And learning this will stick with merchants.


Who cares? If you have a bunch of Bitcoin, what's the difficulty of acquiring Bitcoin IOUs? Just do it before you need to pay out your taxes each year.


Ah. Faith and patriotism in the, oh so just, war. I hope you realize this  also applies in the opposite direction. Those who explicitly *don't* want to support the war now *know* they merely need to accept Bitcoin instead of those IOUs. *Not* supporting the war becomes a *feature* of only accepting Bitcoin. One I would wholeheartedly, and enthusiastically use.
You're comparing a time like WW2 where a significant number of Americans actually believed in the war. Today? Utterly laughable to propose the same sentiments regarding Iraq and Afghanistan.


Not a valid comparison. Because gold wasn't a valid alternative to the USD IOUs, but Bitcoin itself *IS* a valid alternative to Bitcoin IOUs.
Furthermore, the patriotism of today is not that of yesterday. Very poor assessment of American sentiment and opinion regarding wars. American patriotism is at all time lows.

(An excess of hoarding, not less, and more debt than ever before)
I'm really not interested in spending the time explaining why these are wrong, and they are, so I'll just say this.
If you're so sure that the current monetary system is superior, then you'd have no problem with an alternative one! Because it could never out compete or succeed anyway. So again.

Bitcoin rose by 2000%, but it also has an extremely small market exposure. Bitcoin is barely 5% the market cap of gold and there is way less Bitcoin then there is Gold. 
Gold rose from $35 to $800 after the gold standard ended. Does that make it a poor store of value? It had to catch up to the incredibly inflationary dollar. It did so again in the late 2000s. Now it's stable. Bitcoin is simply catching up, just like gold.
Yes. I understand why there exists a target inflation of 2%. It's to prevent a liquidity trap. Thing is, just because the target is 2%, doesn't mean the target will be successfully hit, nor does it mean anyone knows WHEN the inflation will hit or in WHICH markets the inflation will hit. Look at the CPI. A massive scattershot of different inflationary evaluations depending on the product/commodity.

You own x% of the evaluation. You don't own the hard assets in the company. If a company's stock crashes, and the company has to declare bankruptcy, the creditors get their money first. Shareholders?

If a country wants to go to war (The United States), they will actually have to pay for it up front, or find someone to lend them the money. They won't be able to simply spend the money into existence, and tax the population by inflation later.

And here's the tricky part. How are you going to enforce convertibility back into Bitcoin? Are you going to force all merchants to accept the IOUs? Are you going to actually pay out those IOUs for real Bitcoin? Seems like its much harder than it was for paper currency under the gold standard. The gold standard shenanigans only worked because you could issue an IOU (military scrip) for what was also an IOU (dollars which promised gold). Why would anyone that isn't desperate accept an IOU instead of actual Bitcoin? What's the excuse for not transferring the Bitcoin itself?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:49:57
It's both. Prior to 1971, forex trading didn't actually exist. Every currency was tied to the USD and the USD was tied to gold. This made it such that your dollars constituted an investment in gold. Well, ignoring the fact that the government fractionalized the dollar from gold starting in 1913. Dollars were the currency, and gold was the store of value backing it.
You could also have a system whereby a commodity like oil backs the currency. So long as oil is useful, so too will be the currency. Now, I can see why many people might ask "what backs Bitcoin?" The answer is more abstract. The security of the system, unique capacity to exchange across borders with ease, and the gaurentee of a fixed supply backs Bitcoin.

It's a unit of account. Check.
It is an medium of exchange not only because it *can* be used to buy and sell gooss, but because it *is* used to buy and sell goods. Check.
It's a store of value because, over long periods of time, the value put into it either persists, or goes up. This is due to its ultimately limited supply in addition to its unique usecases. (Bitcoin is currently slightly inflationary by the way, but will become deflationary). Check.
Where's the issue? The definition is pretty easy to satisfy because it uses words like *can*. The very first sentence also specifically says *can be anything that*.

Is that why corporations are doing record amounts of stock buybacks to inflate their stock values without having actually done much capital investment? You know, stock buybacks which used to be *illegal* for a corporation to do for *this very reason*.


No. *This* economy is heavily dependent on consumer spending. Not *every* economy is. The economy doesn't *need* to be dependent. Just an assertion. And fails to address the type of consumer spending. Consumers buy necessities *and* completely worthless garbage.


This is another vague blanket assertion. What *kind* of consumer spending? Spending on food? Spending on necessities? Or spending on worthless crap? Because there is arguably *waaaaay* too much of the last one.
And again. This completely fails to address why massive amounts of debt are necessary for consumer spending. 


Fuck you. People who can't have a normal conversation quickly resort to petty and completely unproductive labels. I don't "hate" debt and believe its a fucking "conspiracy".

Because once you spent your holdings, the only way to get more it to work for it, or make good investments that help the economy.


If we ever reach the point where Bitcoin is the predominant monetary standard of the globe, this will have little to no value. Fiat is only valuable and can only be perpetually created (and still maintain its value) because everyone is forced to use it. In a world where there exists a hard money like Bitcoin, attempts to print more fiat to buy Bitcoin will just destroy the value of that fiat even more, and raise the value of Bitcoin even more.

You're an arrogant individual. Actually read what I wrote. The Fed has not done QT to any significant impact. They attempted to do so in 2006, by a few percentage points, but were forced to push rates to zero in 2008 and astronomically expand their balance sheet. The Fed can only pull the lever in one direction without crashing the economy. Rate increases of 0.25% increments over a period of 10 years don't count. The rates are nowhere near normalized. Nowhere near healthy. If a recession occurs, the Fed will be forced to push the FFR into negatives. And again, if the Fed actually does begin normalizing rates, the economy will absolutely go into a recession. The current economy is sustained on access to cheap debt. To deny this is to fundamentally misunderstand how the interest rate and access to debt affect the economy.

Instability in terms of price in USD. Perfectly stable in terms of monetary policy and supply. Different perception, different purpose. But this is not an inherent property. Just like with any asset class, more adoption = less volatility. The dollar isn't volatile because its "controlled". It's not volatile because it is a behemoth of an asset class. Small fluctuations barely budge the overwhelming larger pool of dollars that are used. If Bitcoin ever achieves such a status, it won't be volatile either.


It can't. Because Bitcoin itself must be the valuable token. A block-chain has no security if it represents some other entity. It must, itself, be the value. Bitcoin serves best to replace the base level of the monetary system. To act as the ultimate unit of account for settlement.
I highly recommend a book called "The Bitcoin Standard". It spells out, in detail what the use case is for Bitcoin and how it will struggle to ever achieve success as the front facing payment mechanism for small transactions. It's not designed for that. It's designed for incredible security in international payment settlement, and intra-bank (or node) settlements. But not for everyday purchases.

That's a really shitty comparison. Because Nazis aren't the only alternative to Communists. There are plenty of other political ideologies. Just like there are other alternatives to central banking.
But, one of the main problems of central banking is that you are forced to use it. You are *not permitted* to use an alternative. But Bitcoin can not be suppressed so easily, unlike many other alternatives to central banking. More choice and opportunity is a good thing. That's the difference.

The issue isn't traditional banking. The issue is central banking and monetary policy. Just because you are free to use "any currency" doesn't mean you are free to use any monetary base. Because all global fiat is effectively tied to the same interest rate schedule. The Fed and ECB act and the central banks of the world follow.
In reality, you are only free to use a particular type of currency. One which is inextricably tied to the decisions of a small group of politically biased individuals. You are not free to use an alternate monetary policy. Until Bitcoin. More choice and opportunity is good.

You can argue as to why Venezuela printed way too much Bolivars. You can make justifications based on external pressures. But you cannot blame a local currencies' hyperinflation based on the actions of a foreign actor.

Having a goal and having unintended consequences are not mutually exclusive. Inciting inflation when the economy is under EXTREME deflationary pressure does not fix the underlying problems in the economy. It merely skews our measurements and makes the economy appear healthy. That's it. Real wages, stagnant. Private debt, record highs. Public debt, record highs. Labor force participation rate, stagnant at lows since 2008. Retirement age, record highs. Savings, record lows. Corporate debt, record highs. Heed my words. This next financial crisis will be worse than the Great Depression.


We're in that situation today, but ten times worse. Nothing has changed since 2008. The Fed, and understand what I'm saying here. The Fed Kicked. The. Can. Down. The. Road. They did not solve the problem. We are due for another financial collapse. And this time, the Fed won't be able to kick the can any further. The interest rate is near zero%

No. Printing more doesn't change the demand. It changes the supply. All fiats are printing at relatively similar rates. That's why exchange rates don't vary too much. Printing simply causes mass price inflation. It doesn't cause stability. Not at all. Widespread adoption and use cause stability.

No. I'm talking about merchants back in the home state. Not merchant's on the bases. Because those base merchants still must supply their goods using government funds.

This would have to be paid out in Bitcoin because why would a non-military merchant accept an IOU instead of real Bitcoin?


Cool. So the government is forced to raise the Bitcoin somehow. They can't just create it. The government can't spend Bitcoin it doesn't have (with IOUs) because they must convert those IOUs back into Bitcoin after the fact, otherwise those holding IOUs will get burned.

You can't make humans immune to corruption, but at least you can make the foundational measurement of human labor more or less immune. If the only way to acquire Bitcoin is to earn it, then labor is much more difficult to exploit. Money becomes a true measurement of human labour, and not an extraction-based, warped measurement.

Volatility as measured in comparison to the dollar's current price. But that's the wrong measurement. Bitcoin has the foundational principles that make it good money, because it is utterly fixed in its supply and the dollar very much isn't. And because Bitcoin is an international medium of exchange, is secure, liquid, and inerdadicable so long as there exists an Internet, it is good money.
These qualities make it one of the hardest, yet easily transferred forms of money to ever exist. Harder than gold, as liquid as digital USD. Short term volatilty of the trading ratio is irrelevant. 
So long as Gresham's law of money applies, we will see bad money drive out good money. The good money is hoarded, and the bad money is used in circulation. We will see that bad money circulates until it's collapse as a money entirely (as so many do) and what is the end result? Economies are forced to use good money that has been hoarded all this time. (Thiers' Law). People are forced to use good money either because there is a loss of trust in the forms of bad money of the time, or by virtue of there being no other alternative. 
It happens, and has happened, countless times in history. There is a reason that gold as money (hint: gold standard where gold is the money, something else is the currency) has returned again and again and again for literally *thousands* of years. It's just Gresham's law (and Thiers' law) at work. And just because we're in the 21st century doesn't mean those laws of economics have been repealed.
TL;DR Bitcoin isn't a good currency yet because of volatilty, but it is a good *money* right now because of its inherent properties. Just as gold is volatile, but is still very good money.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:13:23
Every single hyperinflation is preceded by a deflation. Literally every single one. Look at velocity of money. It's an ignored indicator, but it's extremely important. When velocity of money goes down, deflation of prices occurs, regardless of the money supply. Velocity is at lows since 2008. If velocity were to return pre-2008 levels, hyperinflation would ABSOLUTELY occur. What might cause an increase in money velocity? Why, a deflationary economic crash which creates prices reasonable enough for the economy to start spending again. 
So the pattern goes threat of deflation -&gt; money supply expansion -&gt; inflation of prices -&gt; inability to spend at higher prices (mind you real wages have been stagnant for 40 years.) -&gt; drop in velocity of money -&gt; threat of deflation. And then rinse and repeat this cycle UNTIL the deflationary pressure is too powerful in which we proceed to the next pattern.
Unavoidable deflationary crash of market prices -&gt; increase in spending velocity to eat up those prices -&gt; inflation which matches the now massively expanded money supply at previous velocity levels (hyperinflation) -&gt; Game Over.

If the Fed plans to cause 2% inflation, it doesn't mean then will succeed. They cannot control the time or place in which price inflation occurs. An example. Say tommorow the USD is no longer used in global oil sale. Now a significant portion of USD is no longer needed in global markets. The Fed can't prevent that USD from being spent in the U.S. Que hyperinflation. And again, the Fed can't control which goods inflate and which goods do not. It's not necessarily universal. See the CPI spread.
The price of gold spiked to 800 in a matter of a few years after the price was no longer fixed by the government. It fell to 400 and later spiked again to 1800. Gold is seeing an upward trend, volitility or not. Bitcoin's growth isn't dissimilar.

The difference with crypto is that it does not need government issuance and support to be successful. It is decentralized. Governed by voluntary, international concencous. Collapse of any particular government does not necessarily destroy the currency.


Absolutely. But a cryptocurrency will be used. It serves a new and unique use never before seen in finance/economics. A use which is in demand. Whether or not Bitcoin will be the "winner" is a mystery. I personally don't think it will succeed in relation to other cryptos in the long term, but it will probably lead the charge for the foreseeable future in bringing crypto mainstream.

I just told you. The interest rate is frighteningly low. Another recession and it won't have anywhere left to go! The outstanding debt is frighteningly high. Unemployment is down, but real wage incomes are ALSO DOWN. The labor force participation rate is ALSO DOWN. The retirement age is UP. Employment doesn't mean much when more people drop out of the labor force and the remaining jobs are lower quality. You're intensely focused on a few golden teeth in a mouth full of rotten ones.

Notice how these core needs are becoming MORE expensive and not less? I see that as incredibly unhealthy. Too many resources have been redirected to worthless things. So, I agree. Artificial demand has been created. But you're not looking at the root problem here. WHAT enables "artificial demand" for worthless spending to exist in the first place? Easy access to interest free money. If people feel like they're secure in their core needs, they will naturally spend the excess on frivolous want. If you perpetually warp the economy to such a degree that it *appears* that core needs are forever provided for, you've destroyed the corrective mechanism that lets people know its time to STOP frivolous spending and START reinvesting in those core needs. Recession and deflation are *WARNING* signs that we ought to re-allocate our resources for long term provision of these core needs. It's BAD that consumerist crap is easy to purchase. It's BAD that we expend way too much entertainment, but that its cheap to do so. Because it is BAD that so much production has become entrenched and focused on providing these frivolous things. Again, the fact that core needs are rising in price while everything else is decreasing in price is EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. We need to allow the economy to re-allocate resources to solidify the foundation, or when resources become scarce, it will become a much more painful process.

For, literally, millennia economics have gone through natural inflationary and deflationary monetary cycles. Used based on commodities like gold and silver.
2) Bitcoin is deflationary. 
Bitcoin is voluntary. Bitcoin is border less. Bitcoin is divisible. Bitcoin has organic, natural growth. And, most importantly, Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently satisfying a MUCH NEEDED need for deflation in this system. Gresham's Law of good money predicts and has predicted economic events such as this. The global monetary system is changing, with the consent of government or without it.

This is a toothless argument. Loans for BTC aren't available not because of its deflationary properties. They are not available because BTC has not acquired widespread adoption. Widespread adoption -&gt; reduced volatility -&gt; use in its capacity as a loaning vehicle. You have no argument.


Gold has been fiat and it has not been fiat. It's a purely semantic distinction. Irrelevant to what makes gold a persistent money. The reason it has continuously been used to back currency is that is has *limited supply*. It is *BECAUSE* it is a deflationary asset. That *IS* the reason it has persisted for the entirety of human civilization and why it *STILL* holds value today. Gold is not currently fiat, *yet it still has value*. And as the value of fiat currencies continue to fall, the value of gold *continues to rise* in relation. Gold is fixed in value.


This is incredibly basic economics. Access to debt leads to an inflation of prices in the market of which the debt is purposed. Student loans are the *perfect* example. As access to debt has risen, so to has tuition. Prices match demand and supply of currency. 
What happened to the housing market when banks were handing out bad loans like candy prior to 2008? Easy money for housing *DIRECTLY* resulted in overvalued housing prices. Bad loans collapse -&gt; collapse in the price of the asset (homes) purchased with those loans. We *already* went through a premium case study. This is *basic* supply and demand.
Again, it is an *incredibly* basic concept. The fact that you consider this Nobel worthy is *astonishing*.


It this a patent admission that Keynesian economics is *wrong*? That we are *still* in a financial crisis and that the money creation did nothing to fix it? Do you not understand how you've essentially admitted that inflation and money creation has *failed* to revitalize the economy and increase spending? That is has merely inflated the *PRICE* of assets, distorting our economic measurements, and has done nothing to benefit the *real* economy? Seriously. You ought to consider what you've just said here. Because it *EXACTLY* showcases the massive problem in our current monetary system.

Cool. And the suckers who fall for it will get burned and it will be a tough sell for the nation the next go around. See, this worked for gold because there is a legitimate argument to be made regarding actual delivery or lack of holding of the physical gold. But with Bitcoin, that argument is significantly weaker. Will a merchant accept the "IOU"? Instead of the actual Bitcoin? Why would or should they? Save an oppressive governmental force requiring them to. Is that something all governments of the world will be able to enforce forever?
Why, exactly, would someone accept an IOU in the same regard as actually delivery of the Bitcoin unless they are desperate and will take any form of income?

Much less likely to recover the data. So the whole EMP threat isn't really a big deal for Bitcoin. Because our current system of 90% digital fiat is actually LESS resistant to it.

The base layer of reserve settlement is at the central bank. Not in everyday cash transactions.


How do you think Forex works? You ought to brush up your knowledge on how the banking system functions. You're right that its not many individual transactions, but they do perform final settlement for billions upon billions of dollars in value. You need to understand how the current banking system works before you can understand how Bitcoin stands to replace the base layer portion of it.


Nope. Because each bank would need to issue its own token. Blockchain is virtually non-functional without a token to incentive miners. No incentive for miners = no security. Banks would need to run an incredibly expensive blockchain on their own decentralized computing network at a massive loss without issuing a token. A non-token based block-chain isn't even close to being as secure as a token based, decentralized blockchain. 
And regardless, different banks with completely different tokens is non-feasible. There would need to be an exchange rate between Citibank tokens and Wells Fargo token.

Not based off what you've said thus far. Because there is a middleman entity under the gold standard. The USD. The US dollars are also IOUs, but merchants accept them. Bitcoin isn't an IOU. Why would a merchant accept an IOU instead of Bitcoin? What's the excuse when Bitcoin, itself, is easily delivered? There is a reason to accept USD IOUs instead of gold. Because its impractical to ship and store gold safely. But why would the suppliers accept IOUs instead of Bitcoin? You haven't answered this question.

You're ignoring your own definition. The one you previously lambasted me for, apparently, not adhering to. It says *can* be used as a medium of exchange. Not that it *always must be* usable. Gold can and has been used for literally millenia as a medium of exchange. There is a BRICS agreement in the works *right now* that would use gold as the basis of trade between the BRICS countries instead of the USD.
The yearly high for gold in 1980 was $850 and then it went down to $400, just like I mentioned. It was $35 in 1971 and $44 in 1972. Nothing I said is inaccurate. You're simply not attempting to understand what I'm writing and are instead choosing to toss ad hominems for not discernible reason.

They can be inferred. Because the phrase "bring peace and prosperity" doesn't necessarily mean absolute utopia and world peace. It just means bring peace and prosperity.

The truly amazing thing about commodity backed currencies, like gold, is that short periods of inflation and deflation are entirely natural. Look at any graph that tracks the rate of inflation in a gold backed currency over a long period of time. It resembles a mathematical (sine) wave balanced around a net Zero rate. Truly amazing.
Taken from:
Take note of the years when inflation is particularly high like the 1860s. Wars where massive amounts of debt is created (money created). And, of course, take note when the US begins to depeg the USD from the dollar in 1913 and fully abolished the gold standard in 1971.

If it worked, the country wouldn't be 22 trillion in debt with no hope of ever paying it back. Face it. You are talking about a short term outcome and completely ignoring any long term consequences. We've had fiat money since 1971 only. Fiat isn't a new invention either. It has been used for thousands of years and, guess what? It has collapsed and failed for thousands of years too. Not always immediately. Not always rapidly. But at a 99% rate of failure, fiat currencies cease to exist. Again. It's not that 99% of fiat currencies lose value. Its that 99% of fiat currencies *cease to exist*.

No. You don't need to trust that your software doesn't "have malware". Just check with your own eyes. Do you just "trust" that your basement isn't infected with vermin? That your home doesn't have termites? No. You check for yourself.


The tired and usual "deflation is bad, mkay". Explain *why* deflation is bad. Don't merely assert it. There is no good reason to presume this to be true. Who the hell thinks decreasing prices is a bad thing? More affordability across the board for those who save their earnings. It incentives responsible spending. Inflation incentives irresponsible spending and taking on massive amounts of debt. See literally every government and corporation. Debt-laded to such an extreme degree that any increase in interest rates will bankrupt millions.


Ever consider that our "current state of economics" is flawed, wrong, or unsustainable in some way? Ever consider that the "current" state does not equal the "future" state? Ever consider that "current" monetary system has only existed for 50 years, which is nothing by historical standards? Ever consider that hard monies with fixed supplies like gold have re-emerged as money constantly in economic history when other systems fail? 
Probably haven't. Because you immediately jumped to "deflation is just baaaaad, tho". 


Nope. Actually not true. Because in this system, the irresponsible decision makers are not accountable. Not a true credit system. Because someone else always has to take the hit for another's "bad credit". Was it the Venezuelan citizens or leadership that managed the economy irresponsibility? Is it the Venezuelan leadership or citizens that have to suffer the consequences?
Does the United States suffer the consequences of 21 Trillion dollars in debt? Does it suffer its bad credibility? Nope. It merely prints dollars and suppresses the interest rate so it doesn't have to! How convenient! Looks like the "credit" system is very amazingly good at shifting away responsibility!
What would  the the Venezuelan citizens have been better off owning? Something that requires no government or third party trust perhaps? Is it a coincidence that the demand for Bitcoin is dis-proportionally higher in Venezuela and Zimbabwe than other countries?

But here's the problem. The way in which we run our economy and monetary policy is, by historical standards, the alternative and *EXPERIMENTAL* theory. (By your terms, the "Socialism" theory). For the *VAST* majority of history, we've had commodity backed (gold and silver) currencies that coexist with century old, and even thousand years old, empires. Where do we see fiat based, high inflationary systems in history? Toward the END of an empire's lifespan. Never the beginning. This is VERY consistent if you study the history of money and monetary systems.
It's extremely important to understand that we've only been operating on our current monetary policy for 50 years. That's it. 50 years old. It's entirely experimental. 50 years is NOTHING by historical standards. Commodity backed moneys survive, and have survived, for literally thousands of years. THAT is the default economic doctrine.

It's an utterly false statement to say that inflation and deflation are "laws" that everyone must obey. Because it disproportionately advantages those who create debt or currency at the expense of everyone else. 
When money is created and used to purchase something, the inflationary effects of the money creation haven't yet applied to the thing of purchase. It takes time for inflation to spread throughout the economy. And so some are left with nothing but benefit from the inflation (currency creators and holders of debt) and everyone else is left with nothing but the detriment of higher prices. So no. YOU ARE FUCKING WRONG. It's EMBARRASSING that you keep asserting your same FALSE point.

Any community that exceeds a certain number of people is doomed to fail without using some form of money. It's just fact a confirmed by economists, historians, and anthropologists.

Collapsed? Hardly. Compared to the literal non-use of 99% of fiat currencies, gold is a resounding success story. A low in its universal usage isn't the same as a "collapse". We're talking about complete and utter failure versus a loss of dominance. Different standards of measurement.


Utterly false statement. Saying it "doesn't work as a medium of exchange" is just fucking wrong. Plenty of people still use and trade for value in gold. Just because it isn't common doesn't mean it has "failed". Stop projecting your bias as fact.
Gold is still actively traded and held by central banks around the globe. It is used in the ECB as a monetary peg.

The USD isn't tied to gold whatsoever as of 1971. It is based solely on faith in the US government. This is what makes it a "fiat" currency. It is declared valuable by government "fiat" or decree. The USD used to be a gold standard currency representing a certain amount of gold. You actually used to be able to redeem your dollars directly for gold.
One of the main reasons Bitcoin is popular is due to a distrust of fiat currencies. Fiat currencies have a high tendency to fail throughout history. 99% of all fiat currencies cease to exist and the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years. The USD is going strong at 47 years of life, but that's still a very short period of time compared to historical standards. Gold and silver have been valuable as money for over 2,000 years.

Fiat requires faith and belief for it to hold value. Something that does have intrinsic value has it because it is *inherently* useful and not merely because it is *believed* to be useful. Gold has been valuable, regardless of government decree, for literally thousands of years. Why? Because of its unique properties as a metal on the periodic table that are natural and permanent.

Lol. Look up "fractional reserve lending". The deposits are largely irrelevant to a bank's capacity to lend. It's actually frightening when you learn about it. 


Again, credit lending pretty much has nothing to do with deposits. The central banks can lend money with, literally, no deposits on their books. The private banks can lend credit on 10% or less of the deposited amount. And credit cards? Lol. That shit is lent with ZERO deposits backing it.

Natural cycles and systems are necessarily systems with various pressures in various directions caused by various factors. That's simply a given for any natural system. Economics is a natural system. Such systems will come to an equilibrium. When you choose to artificially intervene in the system to create an unnatural and artificial outcome (no more recessions) you will create an imbalance in the system that will destabilize the system until it finds the equilibrium once again, sometimes violently.


My argument is, there are *always* reasons that wealth will tend to pool in an economy. But there are also *always* reasons that wealth will tend to redistribute itself in the economy. If you choose to intervene such that one outcome is significantly favored over another, then *you are the cause of the disequilibrium*. At least in the short term.
Furthermore, the only causes that can be addressed by human intervention or "solved" by human intervention are the only causes that need be worried about. The capitalistic boom bust cycles isn't a problem that can be "solved". Busts are an inherent and necessary part of the system, or it is not capitalism. Trying to remove that function *will* create unstable disequilibrium. Because you are no longer operating under free market capitalism.

More-so because there is simply higher quantities of currency in the world and less so because bank's are actively selling off their gold.


While its true that the form of money has evolved over the years, the principles of what makes money good versus bad have not. Its for this reason that fiat currencies have a high tendency to fail as described in my previous comment. Fiat currencies fail because they rely on the perpetual lack of corruption on the part of a long series of politicians. Things like gold recede and re-emerge as dominant forms of money for the simple reason that it cannot be created out of thin air. Which is inconvenient for a group of corrupt politicians, but very convenient for a nation suffering from a failed fiat currency. And so there is a history of cycles in the type of money which is most dominant at any given time.
Bitcoin is more like gold in that it cannot be arbitrarily created by self-interested actors. It doesn't require the trust of politicians to exist.

Bernanke in his own writing has said that "helicopter bombs of money" is a valid solution if the economy tumbles into an unavoidable recession.

A loss in value isn't akin to a collapse. Because 99% of fiat currencies didn't just lose value. They CEASE to be valuable as money. Gold is still valuable as money.
You're conflating today's fiat with yesterday's fiat. Bad comparison and poor critical thinking. The gold held by central banks is *the same gold* that Egyptians used thousands of years ago. The fiat held in the central banks today has effectively only existed for 50 years when the Breton woods system ended. That's nothing by historical standards. And remember, 99% of fiat utterly fails and ceases to be valuable. Bad track record.
Obviously the ECB holds reserves of fiat. They are a central bank. But this doesn't support your point whatsoever. Gold is held for the explicit purpose of acting as a montary peg... for the fiat reserves. If we assume gold is "useless as money" then your effectively asserting that the ECB holds gold for no reason. And so they also hold reserves of fiat... for no reason.
Regardless. Gold is used in transactions outside of the central bank. Just not any you know of, because gold is private. Which is why people use it. So again.

$10 is always worth $10, but $10 does not always have the same value. That's your problem. The price of something measured in dollars isn't the same as that things value. Because the dollar could change, and does change, in value or it could lose all of its value, regardless of whether or not the United States government accepts it.
You fail to understand that the value of dollars are also based *primarily* on extrinsic value. Just like literally every fiat currency. Which is exactly why fiat currencies have a fluctuating exchange rate between eachother. This is not difficult to understand if you merely read the definition of "intrinsic". So much disinformation exists in the financial and economic world today that everyone seems to think the word "intrinsic" has been redefined. It hasn't. Just read the definition.

You fail, again, to account for factors such as the Fed's massive reduction of the money supply and for the fact that a significantly disproportionate amount of printed money found itself in the stock market during the roaring 20s. Levels of income and wealth inequality that were unheard of. Until today. 
See, the stock market bubble WAS the inflation. You just fail to recognize it as inflation. And when it collapsed, it collapsed such that it actually damaged not just the nominal valuations, but the underlying productivity of the economy. The bubble corrected downward and then overcorrected, causing an economic contraction. The gold standard HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. It was primarily caused by money supply manipulation. The lessen is, don't widly manipulate your currency in the first place. Not that the second, arguably corrective, manipulation somehow caused the first manipulation.
You say "don't elect policitians that will act with fiscal irresponsibility" as if that's just an easy problem to fix. I've got news for you.

Just a general, blanket assertion. Typical for you. Deflation would hurt *some* poor people in *some* contexts because *some* people would lose jobs. Just like *some* rich people would lose their jobs.
But do tell me, how does decreasing costs hurt the poor? How does increased affordability of everyday products hurt the poor? How does cheaper rents hurt the poor? In contrast to the decades long stagnation of real wages, how does fixed incomes with decreasing prices hurt the poor? 
The poor own zero assets (because they are poor) and so they gain *ZERO* benefit from inflation in the price increase of assets. The rich hoard assets more-so than they hoard currency. The rich have access to massive amounts of debt leverage that allow them to float excessive amounts of debt that depreciates via inflation, while simultaneously owning inflation appreciating assets. The rich *benefit* from inflation, for the most part. The poor don't. Perpetual inflation in contrast to *normal* cycles of inflation and deflation is a fallacious and extractionary policy. Which is exactly why we've reached pre-Depression era levels of wealth inequality. Hint, hint: The Federal Reserve and U.S. government went through an extraordinary inflation policy during WWI, which resulted in the roaring 20s.

Non-profit organizations aren't new. They aren't an invention and they most certainly cannot function without money. Guess what? Workers in non-profits STILL GET PAID. The organization simply doesn't turn a profit. Money is still 100% necessary. And this proves nothing about the large scale sustainability of communal living. Non-profits necessarily exist WITHIN a larger capitalistic structure that provides the legal precedent and LAWYERS to ENFORCE the non-profit. You're hyper delusional if you think what you're creating can be done without lawyers.
I'm interested to the extent that you can answer basic questions about your "invention" and so far you've utterly failed to provide anything that hasn't been said before. It's just a half-assed sales pitch at best to make you money.
Show me a single collaborative that doesn't rely on any other legal or economic structure to exist. You can't, because they always fail past a certain population size. You're doomed to living in a society that, at some level, relies on the use of money.

Central banks and institutions can guarantee the number of digits you own, but they ABSOLUTELY cannot guarantee the relative purchasing power of those digits. Because they will inevitably have to create more digits, increasing their supply, to bail out defaulting banks and corporations. Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Hyperinflation is another concern that banks simply cannot protect you from whatsoever. Because the currency, itself, is not fundamentally safe. No arbitrarily printable currency is.


Fiat currencies always have the risk of abuse and hyperinflation. Bitcoin is designed to avoid this risk.


You are. You're missing the fact that savings, in and of themselves, are a NECESSARY safeguard in a capitalistic system. Recessions and bust cycles are inevitable. Always have been and always will be. Savings provide a natural cushion and permit proper resource allocation in these times. Savings are the fat on a bear that hibernates for the unavoidable winter. If the bear chooses not to store any fat, and inside spends all its energy running around, having an excessive of cubs growing its "figurative economy" it will simply starve to death and die when the winter comes and all that growth will be entirely irrelevant. Because it wasn't growth that could last a winter.
Yes, lending out every ounce of your money creates growth for the economy. You are right. But you've failed to ask yourself a very important question. You have missed something. *How do you know if its sustainable growth?* *Are you sure perpetual growth is even possible given what we know of economic history?*

Gold miners are not alchemists. They cannot create it on a whim and they cannot (and have no incentive to) destroy it on a whim either. The Federal Reserve can create and destroy billions with a few keystrokes. To presume that such power cannot and will not be abused for political purposes is naive.


No it isn't. I think you misunderstand what money is on a philosophical and fundamental level. See, paper currency originally acted as a *redemption note*. A redemption note for your *actual money* which was gold and silver. 
Money is, very simply, a measurement of value. Currency manipulation occurs when you fiddle with the measurement. Manipulating the money supply because your country needs more money to fund a program (usually war) is the same thing as trying to build a chair that requires 4 feet of wood, but you don't have 4 ft of wood, so you redefine what 1 foot is. Doesn't change the fact that you still didn't have enough wood, so you have to take it from someone else to build your chair.
 A fixed, standardized measure of value is a good thing, not a bad thing. It allows for well defined standards that are not easily manipulated.
There is a reason why the metric system is the prevailing universal measurement standard in science.


The free floating fiat currency system is entirely experimental and has only existed for 47 years. That's nothing compared to long term economic cycles or the span of history. You don't need to find a currencies' true value if every country simply uses a standard unit of monetary measurement. Then the true measure of value is, very simply, the price of the good or service. Price is the relative measure of value. Money is the measurement system.
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:52:49
No. *But it is*. A natural capitalistic boom bust cycle accounts for situations where wealth tends to pool and concentrate in the hands of a small few. Why? Because the bust portion is a *necessary* function of the system. It redistributes wealth from inefficient industries and puts it back into the general economy. Artificially low interest rates and manipulated money supplies necessarily *destroy* that function for the perceived benefit of "fighting recessions".
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:51:03


The gold standard was suspended when significantly more money was printed than there existed gold in reserve. That was *before* the depression happened. That was *before* WWI. A deflationary crash is merely a corrective revaluation. Because dollars were being spent *as if* they were pegged to the value of gold, but *they most certainly were not* and so a crash occurred to *reflect the illusion of value*. 
The gold standard is entirely irrelevant to the issue. The real issue arises when a government chooses to spend money it does not have and also somehow manages to convince itself that it can completely avoid any negative consequences.
Get this basic fact straight before you even *consider* blaming the gold standard for the great depression.

The USD purchasing power didn't really need to be measured prior to the 1900s because it was tied on a 1:1 ratio with gold. So it's value didn't change much until the strict gold was slowly abandoned beginning in the early 1900s.
In the 20th century, the USD lost 95% of its purchasing power.

Aluminum, zinc, and lead are all durable, portable, and divisible. But they aren't very good forms of money, unlike gold. Do you know why?


I've explicitly differentiated between Bitcoin as a currency and a money multiple times now. Having "intrinsic value" isn't a quality of good money. Being useful as a store of value is.

That's a broad generalization that solves literally nothing relating to the problem before us. You've still utterly failed to demonstrate how a money can be "backed" by labor. Because not all doctor positions are the same difficulty, stress, education. And not all fry cooking positions are the same. Working conditions, location of restaurant, class of restaurant, duties and expectations, etc. Your units of "labor" would not be objective whatsoever. Because all labor is fundamentally different and cannot be arbitrarily granted a label like "doctor" labor.


Buddy. You're clueless. Completely clueless. What the fuck does this have to do with money. Guess what? In a clock in, clock out system, you are paid a wage. A wage paid in .... MONEY. It's circular NONSENSE to pay someone in units of money for their labor which is backed by labor. That's, literally, what you are proposing. You, very clearly, have no conceptual understanding of what money it. It is a *objective* measurement tool that *subjective* measurements are measured against. 
A money is an objective numerical value and labor is a subjective value measured against the objective. The measurement ends up in a salary or wage that prices in all of the factors such as risk, complexity, difficulty, education, etc. We already have a system where you can negotiate for a particular salary based on your specific work conditions that allow you to be paid a variable amount of money depending on your type of labor. Your solution is utter nonsense.

Because the term "intrinsic value" is broad. It doesn't specify the type of value. Using store of value merely narrows the definition. No rules are being "changed" here.

Value *is* rarity. Why do you think pieces of artwork are valuable? Why do you think pieces of art are used as money? Why do you think gold is used as money and not some other metal? Its because its is extremely rare. It's because its *difficult* to obtain. That's actually an INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT aspect of money. Yes rarity IS a necessary characteristic of good money, but its not the only one. 
The other traits are fungibility, divisibility, transportability, and durability. Without "rarity", the money cannot function as a store of value. Because things that aren't rare are much too easy to obtain and so much to easy to inflate the supply. Inflatable supply = poor store of value.

Are you sure about that? What's intrinsically valuable about a stock? A stock can be liquidated of value and you receive nothing if the company's equity gets wiped out. The stock is not the value itself. The stock is a representation of something else's value. And, worse yet, the stock can be *wrong* about that other thing's value. I'd say this is a bad example of intrinsic value.




These are much better. Notice the common sentiment. They have utilitarian value in and of themselves. Humans desire these things in and of themselves. Because without humans to value a thing, nothing has intrinsic value.


Did we agreed earlier that just because something is digital, doesn't mean it has no value? That it serves no utilitarian function?  Again. The key to something having intrinsic value isn't that it has tangible form. It's that it is useful and valuable to humans. Facebook has value. Twitter has value. But why? Because they are networks. Networks that connect humans and allow them to more easily communicate information. To communicate information with anyone in the world. That's a valuable tool. You might say communicating information is intrinsically valuable. 
So what is Bitcoin? It's also a network. But it's a network that doesn't just communicate information. It's a network that has the ability to communicate value itself. In a manner that was, literally, not possible just 10 years ago. It's the first digital asset that is fixed in supply. Which makes it the first digital asset that can be used, in and of itself, as a store of value. Someone can buy Bitcoin and be 100% confident that they have purchased an exclusive piece of a network that transmits value across the planet. And their purchase will not be invalidated by a sudden increase of supply. It will only ever be invalidated if there becomes a lack of demand.
Gold isn't a good store of value because it is shiny and you can make jewelry out of it. Gold is a good store of value because it is scare. That's *why* it is good money. Plenty of other metals satisfy the other criteria of money. But they have generally failed in use as money throughout history simply because they are much too plentiful. Diamonds are shiny too. Not really valuable. Because they can manufactured synthetically. They're just carbon.
Exclusive ownership of a thing is a requirement for something to be valuable. Real estate would have no value if land were not finite and exclusive. But it isn't. People Pay a lot of money for exclusive access to particular real estate in particular parts of any city. The exclusivity *IS* the source of its value. Exclusivity to a finite network *IS* valuable so long as that network is universally accepted and useful to its users. Facebook lives or dies with its users. Twitter lives or dies with its users. Real estate LIVES OR DIES with its occupants and neighbors. If nobody wants to live in a particular city, the value of the city's real estate GOES DOWN. Because a city is merely a network of human living space. It *always* comes back to human desirability. Something's intrinsic value is *always* predicated on whether or not other humans want it. Not sometimes. *Always*.

@_date: 2018-06-19 14:50:12


Why do you believe that?


Same with diamonds. Same with iron. Same with copper. Same with seashells. But it is *especially* valuable because you can use it for something that those other things aren't so good for. You can use it as good money. The monetary value of gold far exceeds its industrial value. Because money is a *necessary* tool for human civilization.


But there is a difference. Dollars can be no longer valuable due to more than mere perception. They can, and do, lose value due to an ever increasing supply. Gold and Bitcoin are much more fixed in their supply. And so they have better monetary value. Because a good money doesn't lose value simply because of its supply. It only ever loses value because of demand.


I'd say that the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is wild and undetermined, not that is has no intrinsic value. Its intrinsic value is whatever the price is at a given time. Because its value its the network and use of the network.

You don't really understand money. And I mean money, not currency. Gold is money. Bitcoin is money. These are things which are incredibly useful to act as global monetary standards.

Dollars were the currency prior to 1971. Gold was the money. These are not the same terms. The difference is what lies at the foundation of the system. And the foundations are significantly more important than people realize. Gold has monetary properties that dollars simply *cannot* have. And now that dollars are the money of choice, our monetary system is vulnerable to the same millenia old problems.
And just because Gold isn't in widespread use doesn't mean it isn't money. It maintains niche uses as a money. Because it has immutable monetary  characteristics that dollars *cannot* achieve.

No, actually, YOU ARE. Why is gold valuable? Limited supply? Wrong actually. It's because its very costly and difficult to increase the supply. If humans really wanted, they could dedicate trillions of dollars to producing spacecraft for the purpose of hunting down and mining gold from asteroids. Or simply dig deep enough into the earth to find the gold. But it's not worth the effort, because its too costly. Iron? Copper? Zinc? If the price goes up, watch countless mining companies triple their production. Not difficult to obtain, so not a good store of value.
See. What you don't understand is that a good money is valuable because it represents the only thing humans cannot create out of thin air. Time. Human time and effort to obtain something. Opportunity cost. *Proof of work*.

Keyword. Overvalued. It implies that the stock is not equal in value to the thing it is valuing. If the stock can have a separate value from the thing it represents, then it is not intrinsically value. Its value depends on something else's value. And, unfortunately, the measured value can be wrong for prolonged periods of time.


This is where you're stuck. Your stuck on something having intrinsic value because of tangibility. Stocks don't exist in any tangible form. But you see them as backed by something tangible (a company) and so you see how they are intrinsically valuable. If Bitcoin isn't intrinsically valuable, then neither are stocks. But intrinsic value is the value of a thing itself. Stocks are not valuable in and of themselves. Bitcoin has a better case. Because Bitcoin *is* the valuable network. Stocks *represent* something else that is valuable. But often not necessarily so.


Because more people value it. Because more people are using the network. The value of Bitcoin dumps when people no longer value it or use the network. It's value is the network and its use as an international money. Tokens are money. Money is a valuable tool necessary for civilization. Without money, civilization could not exist as it does today. What makes a blood vessel valuable to a liver cell, or a skin cell, or a brain cell? The blood vessel provides a network by which cells can transmit energy. 
Money is merely economic energy that transmits value. The value is another person's hard work and efforts. Things that have contributed to the overall economy. And in order to recognize a person's contributions to the economy, we give them a token (money). The token "stores" the value of that person's contribution to society. Tokens can be better at or worse than other tokens at storing this value (good and bad money). If you are given a token that increases in supply, you are losing the value of your previous work. Your work and efforts are, literally, degrading before you.

No. Like I said. Pull up any chart that tracks the dollar prior to 1913. Your characteristization is completely wrong.
EDIT: The dollar has been experiencing a century long period of high inflation compared to before the Fed. Booms and busts are not relevant to a currencies' management whatsoever. We've had plenty of booms and busts regardless of the dollar's rate of inflation. Not relevant. Booms and busts are an inherent part of capitalism itself.

Not quite. Prior to 1971, most of the world was under the Breton Woods system. In this system, the US dollar was pegged to gold and all other currencies were pegged to the US dollar.

I'm using a modified version of Aristotle's criteria. I should have explained myself further, but these 5 qualities are derived from Aristotle's 4. I listed them to you earlier.
Fungibility, divisibility, portability, durability, and store of value. 
Aristotle would say intrinsic value, but understand what intrinsic value is. Here's a definition: Intrinsically Valuable- should be valuable in of itself, and its value should be totally independent of any other object.
Valuable in and of itself. What makes something valuable? People want to use it and it's hard to obtain. So what makes Bitcoin valuable? It's a store of value. It's supply is fixed and it has the other categories of good money. That's its value. It's designed to be money and cannot be manipulated.

That's not correct. Hyperinflation is not the same as volitility. Volitility measures price stability and inflation measures sustained, general trends. Trends that are governed largely by money supply expansion. Bitcoin's increases and decreases are governed largely by demand, not supply. And so if you look at the long term and year to year trends, the trend is incredible deflation, not inflation.

Trillions of USD exists in foreign accounts used by foreign citizens. Trillions of USD will funnel back into the US when it not longer serves the global market. It is the only place that MUST accept USD by LAW. Result? Massive inflation in the United States. That's not a strength. Bitcoin is in a bubble because you believe it is.

In fact, there exists a strong argument that it is in the majority of the world's interest NOT to support the dollar. Realistically, most of the world deals in dollars due to threat of great military force. We have to remember that money and currency serves a global market. Mediums of exchange and stores of value are useful to all Humans. How does the USD appeal to and serve the global market for money better than Bitcoin, or gold for that matter?

Credit card and payday loans are not adequate sources of credit when trying to start a business.


High liquidity and ease of mitigating default doesn't affect the profitability of a risky loan. Risky loans might not be profitable at a 5% rate, but are at a 15%, or 20% rate. Just because large banks can better absorb losses doesn't make risky loans more or less profitable. And so, artificially low rates still prevent issuance of risky loans due to an inability to profit on the loan.


Lending Standards and caps set by the SBA are calculated using the LIBOR which, again, is affected by the the FFR and other central bank lending rates.

Your assumptions are fundementally flawed. The U.S. stock market is hardly an accurate reflection of the U.S. economy. Stocks are owned by an increasingly smaller portion of the population. Go check corporate debt, evaluations, and revenues. Sky high evaluations, sure, but also SKY HIGH debt and low revenues. Tell you think that's a "solid" metric to use for economic growth and development.
You acknowledge that a low interest rate encourages spending, but fail to mention that it discourages discrimination between types of investments. Furthermore, it disincentives hoarding when, maybe, you ought to hoard because you're surrounded by bad investments. There is no actual competition for loan money. See the record high household AND corporate debt. Want a loan? Have a near 0% return on investment? You get a loan! A floating interest rate is a NATURAL hedge against bad investments. It will NATURALLY go up when the economy is oversaturated with bad debt. Unfortunately, because the interest rate is now artificially fixed, the U.S. economy and government is now VERY saturated with debt and shows NO SIGN of paying the debts off. The Fed considers debt payments a form of "savings" for fuck's sake. Perpetual debt spending is unsustainable and is incredibly stupid.

Financial crisis can be shocking enough, but not so disastrous that an apocalyptic collapse of the economy occurs... That wasn't the case during the stock market crash of the late 20s and during the Great Depression. I don't think that will be the case during the next economic shock.
I'm not advocating an apocalyptic collapse of the economy. I'm merely acknowledging the fact that the United States probably won't forever be the dominant force in the world and that inflation of the likes seen during the 70s (gold standard ended in 1971...) or worse is not an *impossible* scenario. I've merely identified a few points of weakness in the monetary system. I've yet to be satisfied with an argument that actually addresses these points of weakness.


Yes... and so were computers in their early development. The average person was absolutely clueless and the computer was rendered for use by nerds only. I just don't see how the current status of crypto-clunkiness necessarily precludes it from being less clunky in the future... Plenty of companies have formed to solve this very problem. I'm assuming they will be successful in creating convenience of use. You assume they won't. That's fine, but I don't understand why.


Your first sentence explains my thoughts, exactly, as to why the second sentence should be of concern. Not irrational concern, but still. It's a serious issue to consider.


Japan, Korea, and China account for over 60% of crypto investments. Adoption of crypto by physical merchants is far ahead of the United States. Bitcoin doesn't need to be adopted in the United States to be widely successful.


I personally don't think Bitcoin will succeed as a currency. I think it will succeed as a money, store of value, like gold. Some other cryptos, on the other hand, are hand tailored to function as a currency and a currency alone.

The supply of the money directly effects it's value. Whether or not the average consumer understands this doesn't matter. If only it is understood that the value of their dollars keeps going down and the value of that magic Internet money keeps going up, especially during a hyperinflationary scenario, they will adopt it.


I understand they don't give a shit about these things. They will during a financial crisis or hyperflationary event. To say that the average person won't care about the value of their money during a crisis is to ignore actual history and what has actually happened in the recent past. Price of gold skyrocketed during and after the 2008 crisis. Shit happens. Fiat currencies lose value.


Why is that funny? It *can* be made theft proof. That doesn't mean everyone necessarily takes the precautions to do so. No other money even has the OPTION of being theft proof.


Currencies backed by gold, and not the state, have existed for millenia. And you say there is NO CHANCE we will EVER return to such a system? Seriously? Global fiat currency is very new. Only since 1971. Things like gold have been tested by time.


Not yet. It's also fairly straightforward and easy to use if you have a smartphone. Works just like Apple pay. Not difficult.


It's more useful... at the moment. It is untrue to say that it is *inherently* more useful. It is more useful at the moment because it is widely adopted. Given a scenario where Bitcoin sees mass adoption, it is difficult to argue that fiat money is *inherently* more useful because the entire use is derived from its current status of wide adoption. 99% of the fiat currencies that exist serve no use except as museum artifacts.


The most useful part of the technology is that it is decentralized. You can't "remove" that part of it, shove it into a government coin and make everything peachy. That's a fundemental misunderstanding of how a block chain works.


So what is real use to you?

Stock buybacks. They're a problem and they're inflating stock evaluations. This kind of shit used to be illegal in the 80s. Now its just a savvy financial "strategy". Also further limits access to stock shares for the average American.


Are we using today's definition of employment, or yesterday's? How about 4 years ago? See. You can SAY that we have record low employment, but that completely ignores the QUALITY of employment and how the rate is calculated in the first place. Now, apparently, we've decided a part-time job counts as "employed" where 2 part-time jobs worked by one person counts as 2 jobs. Oh, and those people who've been out of work so long that they've been discouraged? Yea. They don't count. And don't even get me started on the ever increasing retirement age and the increasing difficulty for young adults to enter the work force. The U.S. economy is NOT as healthy as it once was, and that is painfully obvious if you choose to pay attention to more that the oh so important stock market. Might as well use yacht sales as the metric for U.S. economic health.


Debt is voluntary? Have you seen to cost of tuition? I guess education is "voluntary", but then so is hiring anyone without a college education.


It is for corporations. Absurd amounts of debt. Easy, no hassle. But if you're an uneducated individual with no savings wishing to take out a loan to start a business? Nope. Fuck you. Please go into 80k+ debt for a education slip that allows you access to a corporate job, so you may have the PRIVILEGE of considering taking on ANOTHER loan to finally start your business.

Sure it does. Look at any inflation chart since USD was created. 
Oh, you mean it doesn't fluctuate day to day? That's because it is widely adopted. Any currency with mass adoption has low volatility. Bitcoin is nowhere near mass adoption. If it were to be adopted to the extend that USD currently is, it would no longer be volitile. Volitility is a property of % market adoption, not a property of the currency itself. So again I ask, what intrinsic charactistics does USD have that are superior to Bitcoin?

The value offered is a guarantee of limited supply, the capacity to transact across any border, and the ability to store it with no fear of its confiscation (with certain measures taken, Bitcoin is the only currency in existence that can be made 100% confiscation/theft proof). What other problems do you have with it?


Will it always be accepted everywhere? Doesn't this assume that the U.S. and the USD will remain, in perpetuity, the absolute dominating force of the world? Do you acknowledge that global acceptance of one fiat currency, right now, might not be the case in the future?


Is there a particular reason for this? Or is that just what you believe?


Which government? And why does it matter? Bitcoin is designed to function just fine without a government. Worst thing that can happen is that government can threatened to throw you in jail and kill you for using it instead of government money, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin NEEDS government to function.

The USD is important for the global economy, yes, in THEORY. But this is a theory tested since 1971. You have to understand that were living under a completely experimental, global monetary system.

Yes they do. When a corporation buys back their shares, what happens to the price of those shares? Do they go up or down? Are there more or less shares available for purchase? What if they buy back 90% of the shares? 99%? What access does the average American have?


That was obviously a joke.


Maybe I would. I could hand out multiple loans and secure profits by issuing the loans with . . . high interest rates! But I can't! I'm forced to prevent losses on defaults by only lending to certain kinds of people.


This isn't about "victim-hood" and "entitlement". Far from it. This is about economic liberty and the ARROGANT assumption that *you* and the government know what interest rates should be on loans that *I* wish to make and take. It's not good for the average American. It's not freedom.


Yea. I understand. That wasn't my point. Try and understand what I'm actually saying here. By mandating low interest rates, you have PRECLUDED large swaths of people from obtaining access to loans for the sole benefit of corporate quarterly earnings. You have created a LESS FREE society because I, as an investor, cannot grant risky loans at a high interest rate and those who need investment, but have no collateral, cannot freely and voluntarily take on high interest loans. THEREFORE, these people are PRECLUDED from starting a business on their own, in their own communities, and must, instead, go to a trade school OR go into debt for a university degree. I'm not for entitlement programs. I am for ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Something, apparently, more and more Americans couldn't give two shits about or flat out don't understand.

1. Bitcoin is unhackabke on a Hardwallet, in which case, it pretty much becomes a password protected version of physical gold. And it is completely unconfiscatable if you choose to memorize your key in your head. The only version of Bitcoin that remains subject to loss due to hacking is the kind you keep on an exchange or a software wallet making it no less vulnerable than the dollars in a bank account.
2. Bitcoin's intristic value is it's unique properties that no other currency or medium of exchange has. I've already listed them. You might say that "block chain" has those properties, but that ignores the fact that Bitcoin is JUST a block chain. That's literally what it is and all it is.
Gold has intrinsic value, but the values you listed are not relevant to the economic value of gold. Gold is valuable because it satisfies the properties of a good money. It also has fixed supply and is scarce. This has made it a good money to use as a global reserve standard for thousands of years. Not all metals are considered valuable as money, yet all also have intrinsic value. Some even have more when it comes to industrial use.
3. Coinbase accounts and other crypto exchange accounts have been increasing by the hundreds of thousands months to month.
As for your final comments, you're still missing the primary purpose of Bitcoin. Would it be bad for our tech of gold disappeared? Sure. Would it be bad for our tech if platinum disappeared? Yes, definitely. But what does that have to do with our monetary system? The monetary system governs our abstract evaluation of wealth. See, money and currency are not physical properties of the world. They are abstract, metaphysical constructs useful to humans when trying to exchange value and wealth. Literally ANYTHING can be money. Coconuts. Sea shells. Toys. All have been used as money at some time in history. All that was required was that people AGREE that it be money. And again, there are better and worse monies. Gold, for the longest time, served the purpose of money THE BEST. Bitcoin was designed, not be used in jewelry, not to be used for industrial purposes, not to be used for ANYTHING but for one purpose. Bitcoin was designed to be the BEST at being money.

What incentive does the majority of the globe have, other than the threat of force, to use U.S. dollars over Bitcoin? The market potential for Bitcoin IS its global capacity. It is transferable over any border, incredibly difficult to confiscate, controlled by no single authority, and protected by encrypted mathematics. What a perfect solution to an globe without an international government with the capacity to enforce an international currency! USD is only valuable so long as the U.S. dominates the planet. Is it really so hard to imagine that the U.S. won't someday be top dog? Scratch that, is it really so hard to imagine that the U.S. won't someday be SOOO OVERWHELMINGLY dominant such that it can enforce USD as the global currency?

You're missing a major factor of the use of gold. Yes, I absolutely agree that gold is very useful for industrial purposes. But so are many other metals. Gold is unique in that, for thousands of years, it has ALSO been the best at being a money. A significant portion of demand for gold is demand for it as a money. It is time tested and proven for thousands of years that it serves the purpose of being money very well both as a medium of exchange and as a economic scarce and fixed supply of value. Now. We have this new thing called Bitcoin, which aspires the be the BEST at being money. A money that now ALSO has much better properties than gold in use as a medium of exchange. We can argue over whether or not it has achieved its goal, but don't be confused by the fact that gold has uses other than money. That's irrelevant. Sea shells, coconuts, and bananas have all been money. They're not very good money, but those who used them as money didn't have anything better to work with. For millenium, gold has been the best money, so it has been used as money. What happens when we've discovered, or created, a better money?

But doesn't inflation redistribute wealth to those who already have assets, creating even more inequality? Billionaires don't have their money sitting idle in a bank. Their money sits in assets and investments. When inflation impacts the value of those assets and investments, the rich get richer. Poor people have few assets and no investments, so the when inflation occurs, the few dollars they save/earn as incone affords them less and less purchasing power, which allows them to purchase less and less assets. Am I missing something here?

I know for a fact that the average American doesn't. This is why I, unfortunately, think many will be caught off guard. They sure were during the 2008 crisis when convinced that home equity evaluations couldn't go down.




Why am I wrong? I gladly accept criticism.


What makes a corporation legitimate versus not? Why would you discount today's corporations investing in Bitcoin as "illegitimate"? If Amazon and Overstock.com accept Bitcoin as payment, will you call them illegitimate? I don't understand.


No it isn't. Because currency can also be money. The earliest civilizations didn't even coin their gold. They simply measured the gold by weight and conducted business that way. Because of this, the currency/money of gold was 100% interchangeable between different states and different civilizations. No need for a state backing. State-backing is not an inherent quality of currency.


Real money stores value regardless of fiat. Currency does not store value. Especially because it is subject to excess printing and hyperinflation. Check any chart of USD since its creation. Stagnant to nonexistant inflation while it is pegged to gold and then a rapid loss of value from 1913 to today as it was gradually phased off of gold. The USD has lost 95% of its purchasing power since it was created.


Has not =/= will not. But again, the USD has lost 95% of its purchasing power already. If a disruptive event occurs, such as the collapse of the oil-pegged petro dollar, you could easily see a hyper-inflationary event. To deny this possibility is to deny the fact that things change and it is to deny history. Greeks debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. Romans debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. The Wiemar republic debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. The United States has been debasing the USD for decades, but luckily it is enforced in its use in many international trade agreement. Hyperinflation has happened many times before. All of these aforementioned currencies began as pure gold standard pegs and gradually phased out into debased fiat currencies. (Copper coinage as an stand in for today's paper fiat because it has very large supply potential although not truly infinite like today's fiat).


That's what makes it subject to a hyper-inflationary disaster. I seriously suggest you research and understand the USD as the world's current reserve currency status. It is largely based on deals and trade agreements (OPEC as an example) which require the use of the US dollar in international trade and in the sale of natural resource commodities like oil. I will state it again because it is incredibly important. Trillions of USD exist outside of the US in foreign accounts. USD is used for the aforementioned purposes in international exchange. If this no longer becomes the case, then the dollar is in SERIOUS trouble of suffering hyperinflation. No longer needed for use in global exchange, these dollars will naturally find themselves being spent in the one place that requires their acceptance by LAW; the United States. Cue hyperinflation of goods and services in the United States due to a massive influx of USD supply. This is no joke. I'm not just trying to "hype" Bitcoin. I'm trying to find a solution to a very real problem that exists for the USD. And for many of the worlds fiat currencies for that matter.


Please do me a favor. Go back and re-read all of the responses you've made to my comments. Most of them boil down to something along the lines of "You're wrong, you're in denial, or you're stupid" without actually addressing the issue or point I was trying to make.

But the kind of "inflation" you are talking about is temporary and applies to SPECIFIC prices of SPECIFIC goods in SPECIFIC markets. Generalized inflation of goods, in relation to the currency itself, ONLY occurs when the currency is devalued because of money printing and debt monetization. When the federal reserve targets an inflation rate of 2% per year, they are talking about GENERALIZED inflation of the currency. Not demand pull and not cost push inflation.

Bitcoin is more like gold because of its fixed supply, but more practical than gold, because it is effortlessly divisible and easily transferable. Bitcoin has the beneficial properties of digital fiat, but also the economic properties of gold. 
So, point being, our current economic climate is unprecedented and has a high probability of defaulting back to a fixed money standard, like gold. 99% of fiat currencies have lost all of their value and things like gold have ALWAYS swooped in to take their place. Well, what happens when we now have a product that serves the same economic function as gold, but also contains the beneficial properties of fiat? A USD fiat standard can only exist so long as the U.S. government can enforce it. Once the enforcement capacity diminishes enough, say goodbye to the world reserve USD. So what takes its place? Another fiat like Yuan? Gold again? Or maybe digital gold?

Too bad, buying plastic shit and clothes for the sake of buying is unsustainable and wasteful. Once Americans finally realize they can't afford, nor do they need, an endless stream of dollar store garbage and a new wardrobe every season, they will adjust to a more sustainable way of life and choose to invest their money for much more productive purposes. Americans are addicted to consumerist CRAP. Quitting it cold turkey might be painful and there sure will be a lot of withdrawal symptoms, but its better and healthier in long run to quit now rather than later. 
This Keynesian idea that we ought to be in a perpetual state of spending mode, to the point where we need to go into OUTRAGEOUS DEBT to support it, is a false and ROTTEN ideology.

It's not that a hard wallet is, itself, unhackable. It's that a hard wallet is disconnected from the Internet and thus, like I've stated' conveys the same security risks as the storage of physical gold. The difference is, Bitcoin need not ever leave a secure location to be transfered. Transporting physical gold is incredibly risky.
Bitcoin is the only money/currency that can be rendered entirely unconfiscatable. It can cross any border at any time to any location. It is not subject to the control of a single authority. It is the only currency that is decentralized and not issued by a centralized government entity. It is the only currency that does not require a mandate for its use. It is immutable, and unalterable. It can only ever be forked into a new version and, if desired, the new version can be adopted en masse, or not, by its users.

The United States have to a large extent forced the world to conduct international trade in USD. But that won't always be so, and if you think it is, then you have much bleaker vision of the future than I


It's pretty simple. USDs are only valuable where the value can be enforced by law. If the rest of the world decides that they don't want to use USD anymore, then either the U.S. will have to go to war to enforce the use of the dollar or the USD will fade away in its international value.

There are rules and restrictions on lending. If I wish to issue business loans, I am subject to these rules. There are caps on business loan and interest rates. And they are very low, relative to historical rates.


No you can't.


Its a very simple concept. If risk cannot be mitigated via high interest, the loan will not be made. Similar concept with the minimum wage. If you cannot provide productive value at or above the minimum wage, then no job for you! Who will hire you? Witness the massive unemployment of our youth.

I take your point that having a variety of goods is a staple of a good economy, but I don't see why its necessarily healthy to have a variety of choice amongst assets which depreciate rapidly. Yes, a well-made winter coat is a necessary product. What about a coat purely designed to fit the current fashion trend? The value immediately depreciates upon purchase, not because it is functionally less valuable, but because it doesn't have the label of "new". It is now "used". Furthermore, its value rapidly depreciates with ever fluctuating fashion trends. A coat in style this year is old-fashioned a measly one year later! The value purchased for has completely evaporated! 
This kind of spending would not be possible during a recession. The rational person would focus a larger portion of their budget on necessary purchases, like food, which is why I don't see food retailers as being in any real danger. Demand for their product is inelastic. My problem isn't with variety of choice. My problem is with entirely frivolous spending (fashion as an example), not intended to further develop the wealth of the region. Especially when the assets previously relied on for income begin to, also, depreciate. In that circumstance, a recession is 100% necessary! Re-investment is development must occur to sustain the standard of living!

What, exactly, do you define as a "high interest rate"? Rates, across the board, are at historic lows.


I fully comprehend this. Pushing down the Federal Funds Rate also influences EVERY OTHER RATE. If banks have easy access to liquidity at a low rate, loans defaults become less risky. Losses can be recouped via access to cheap money. This, necessarily, creates systemic risk and, necessarily, affects the rates issued by all lending banks. If the Federal Funds Rate goes up, so will other rates. They are highly correlated.

While I acknowledge that rich regions don't immediately need development as much as poor regions do, I'm wondering what's the downside of a rich region in further investing and developing quality assets as a hedge against future depreciation of their current assets? What's the value of promoting frivolous spending in rich regions?


Retailers that we truly depend on have an inelastic demand for their products, so those retailers would survive a recession. I guess I'm arguing that not all of our current retailers are necessary (do we really need 50 kinds of clothes stores? Do we really need a Toys R' Us?) and a recession would reveal that fact by enforcing the effects of elastic demand upon those retailers which aren't necessary.

Whether or not I misrepresented your argument is irrelevant because the point of MY argument is that when USD no longer serves a global use, it will hyperinflate and another thing will take its place as reserve. Right now 50% of USD exists and is used OUTSIDE of the United States. Guess what happens when nobody decides to use it anymore? It gets spent, en masse, in the only place it's still accepted... Thhe United States. Guess what that does to U.S. prices? Hyperinflation. Your argument actually strengthens mine...

If that were true, the government wouldn't have to coerce people to spend by continuously lowering interest rates. There are SOME people who like to spend and some people who like to save. 


A problem only created because we've enabled these inefficient jobs to form in the first place. How? Debt spending and debt culture. We can give every single citizen in the United States a job that pays 100k tommorow! How you ask? The government will just go into 100 trillion in debt! Easy fix! But wait, what happens we it comes time to pay that debt? Guess we need to print money! But wait, if we print currency then the 100k paycheck becomes worthless due to extreme inflation! See the problem here? You cannot simply "fix" the economy by shifting a bunch of numbers around. Actual wealth and value CANNOT be generated out of thin air. Manipulating interest rates and going into debt are TEMPORARY, illusory fixes that WILL come back to haunt us. You CANNOT negotiate with math. 


Perfect example of what happens when you try to fudge the numbers. Look at what has happened to Japan's societal and cultural health. Massive reduction in the birthrate, yet Japanese people have some of the most brutal work hours on the planet. How could this be? Their currency and economy is so severely debased, that it has become unfeasible for massive portions of the Japanese population to marry and have a family. Every year the interest rates get lower and the country, literally, slips closer and closer into economic feudalism. Does that sound like a healthy society?

A sudden loss in their purchasing power is a *really* good reason.


You're thinking of volatility, not inflation. Inflation is gradual and permanent. It is caused by the expansion of the money supply. Volatility is different. Volatility is caused by day to day changes in the *demand* of a thing. Again, its the *supply* that causes inflation.


How can dollars be made immune to theft?


The point is, gold has always been the "money" and there has occasionally existed a respective "currency" to back that money. When gold was used as coinage, it was both the money and currency simultaneously. Now, we don't really even have money. We just have a bunch of fiat currencies.


You can transfer Bitcoin peer to peer, or directly to a store that accepts it either online or in person over your smartphone. I'm not disputing the fact that Bitcoin is *currently* in small scale use. That's not the issue here. The issue here in the potential use and whether or not it has inherently superior qualities to the current system. One of the main arguments against the internet in the early 90s was that is was "clunky" and that "nobody used it". Well. Things change. And they can change over the course of just a few decades. Or do you still believe we should use horses because there aren't enough paved roads around?


No. I just understand the definition of "inherently". If you're claiming that fiat currency is "inherently" more useful is to misunderstand the definition of "inherently". Otherwise, you could still, *inherently*, choose to use of the the thousands of deceased fiat currencies in your day to day transactions.


We don't currently use real money. We use fiat currency. Fiat currency has a tendency to become inflated into oblivion. If the U.S. government fails to maintain the monopolized use of the dollar in international oil and energy transactions, then the value of the dollar will take a big hit. A massive portion of U.S. currency exists in accounts or in cash outside of the United States. Mostly because it pegs the vast majority of oil and energy transactions. If the dollar falls out of the favor of the global energy market, all those dollars are going to be pumped back into the United States. Result? Hyperinflation. 


How is that an argument against my comments regarding decentralization? The more decentralized a block chain is, the more secure it becomes. That's the whole point of decentralization. If you follow the technical dispute concerning the block-size in the crypto community you will understand why decentralization is so important to the technology.

The current monetary structure that the ENTIRE world operates under has only existed since 1971. That's a VERY short period of time. And, by the way, this monetary system is completely experimental. It has never existed before in history, where nearly all international exchange is conducted in fiat and all currency are purely fiat, backed by nothing. There is absolutely no guaranteed that inflation will not spiral out of control. The Fed has publicity stated that they aren't completely sure how inflation works... Do you genuinely think they'll be able to manage a fiat currency that backs the near entirety of international trade without fail for the remainder of human existence? That's much less stable and predictable than you paint it out to be. A gold standard would be infinitely more predictable than this system, but I'm not advocating that. It just defeats the idea that this system is somehow maximally predictable.

You're very confused. Central banking didn't create an increase in relative purchasing power. Advancements in technology did. That's it.

Purchasing power in other realms hasn't change, or has even improved, because of technology advancements. That's it.

Yes. Contraction and growth. When people worry about a deflationary spiral, loss of jobs, and loss of spending, they are effectively worrying about a decline in GDP and employment. My point is, attempts to pump up the GDP so that it *never* declines actually stifle long term GDP growth. Because it incentives the creation of jobs which are non-wealth producing. An economy with declining GDP has high incentive to produce wealth-producing jobs and destroy non-wealth producing jobs.

Also, as Bitcoin see adoption, it's gains will necessarily level off. As with any adoption S growth curve. The massive gains in Bitcoin are not because it is deflationary per-se. They exist because it is seeing increasing adoption. A country that has full adoption of Bitcoin wouldn't see anything close to 1000% yearly gains. Gains would come at the very small rate of deflation. We're talking less than 1%, here (because of people fucking up and losing Bitcoin).

It is an inherent characteristic of capitalism. But so is the destruction of wealth. The Great Depression caused massive economic damage to many countries. But it also did something else. It created a MASSIVE redistribution of wealth.
When a monetary policy prints an infinite supply of money to maintain a perpetual inflation of existing asset prices, of existing equity values, of existing real-estate prices, you dump *even more* money into the hands of those who already have. You create *even more* wealth inequality. When the inequality becomes too great, the economy destabilizes and a massive corrective event occurs. That event was almost the 2008 crisis. But the Fed intervened, and the Fed delayed. 10 years later and debts are higher than ever. Wealth inequality is higher than ever. The savings of the average American are almost non-existent. The economy is *incredibly* sick.
Small forest fires are healthy for the ecology of a forest. Why? Because if too much brush builds up, when a fire inevitably and unavoidable DOES happen, the whole thing doesn't get destroyed in a disastrous inferno. Inflationary monetary policy isn't growth. It's just avoiding the inevitable.
A generation of boomers will be selling their homes to a generation of millennial who have nothing to their name but college loan debt. The economy is NOT STABLE. Pumping the economy with monetary quantitative easing is akin to giving a heroin addict a higher and higher dose to avoid the withdrawal symptoms. Guess what? Eventually the addict overdoses.

Adoption in terms of purchasers and users. The current use is, indeed, speculative investment and store of value. Grahams law explains the rise in Bitcoin rather well. I suggest you do some research on it.
I tried to explain the rate of deflation in my little ( ) comment. Basically, Bitcoin will be deflationary not because Bitcoin is designed to be actively destroyed, but because once Bitcoin reaches its fixed supply of 21 million, there will naturally be a loss in supply over time as people, unavoidably, make mistaken transactions resulting in "lost" Bitcoin. I'm merely estimating that if Bitcoin reaches widespread adoption, users and institutions will be very careful not to lose it and so there will be a very insignificant rate of deflation. Hence, 1% or less.
As it stands today, Bitcoin is actually inflationary, not deflationary. More Bitcoin is produced than previously existed in every new block. This will continue until Bitcoin hits it's max supply of 21 million in 2140.

The affects on China? Obviously a depression in America would have negative effects on China. How it that at all relevant to technology? Our lack of starvation today is based on technology. Not the fucking Fed. Growth and contraction cycles still happen despite the Keyensian magic, LIKE I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS ENTIRE TIME. See. This is the point. The central banks were created. The Fed was creates, yet how has the economy improved IN ANY WAY? You clamied the capitalist cycle of boom bust is somehow responsible for the starvation of peasants. No. Lack of technology was. We still have massive inequality and we STILL have cycles despite the failed Fed policies, except now our technology and accumulated wealth greatly reduce the starvation that had previously occured amongst "peasants".
I know exactly what the Fed does. They provide "access to credit". They buy up bad assets like defaulting loans and call it "quantitative easing". It's all jargon for the same consequences. Targeted inflation of prices and valuations with created money. Do you deny this? Do you deny that the fundamental goal is to provide access to credit?

Cycles of inequality are *a reality* . There is inequality in EVERY economic system that has EVER existed. Pretending that monetary manipulation does anything to fix it is the delusion. It merely pushes the destructive portion of the cycle off to a later date. When it is no longer avoidable. That, inherently, is what the Great Depression was. The Fed and government created excessive amounts of money for WWI spending. 
This led to the equities inflation of the roaring 20s when, mind you, inequality was at a peak. This was unsustainable and the market valuations came crashing down and exacerbated the destruction as the inflation spread into the wider economy. 
See. Growth and contraction cycles are NATURAL. The real crisis comes when arrogant, delusional fanatics believe they can create perpetual growth with something as simple minded as creating money out of thin air. For the entirety of Americans existence, there was not a "Great Depression" until central banking laid the ground work for one after its creation in 1913. Less people are starving NOT because of the guardian angel of central banking. Fuck No. We have advancements in technology and scientific discovery to thank for that.

Again, you're very confused here. You fail to see what *preceded* the lost decades.
As economist Paul Krugman explained, 




So the lost decades were not caused by deflation. Deflation was merely a *symptom* of rampant, uncontrolled inflation in the previous decades. When inflation is excessive, mal-investment is ALSO excessive and so the economy must spend a significant amount of down time to recover before it can proceed to *real* growth that creates *REAL* wealth. Simply put, massive inflationary cycles create a bunch of "hole-digging" jobs and very little wealth producing jobs.


Deflationary cycles isn't the same thing as a deflationary, or inflationary, currency. You can have inflationary currency where the economy is deflating and vice versa. I'm referring to the economy, not the currency here. It's about relative value. Deflationary currency merely induces less exaggerated inflationary cycles and therefore less exaggerated deflationary cycles.

But how? I know *our* economy would suffer in the short term, but how is deflation *necessarily* bad for an economy, say, starting from scratch?


Not necessarily. A deflationary spiral only occurs when an economy reaches insane levels of instability such that it must "spiral" downward until it hits a break-even point. But it always has an end-point. And many economists pose that small deflationary cycles are healthy in resting the economy and putting it on a better track for long term growth. For most of history, we saw a natural oscillation between inflationary and deflationary periods. Perpetual deflationary spirals didn't exist. It's only since governments and central banks began to pump the economy with excess money supply (usually to fund wars) that we would see a following deflationary "crash". 
It's like a kid who gets amped on sugar. They run around like a lunatic, screaming and laughing until they "crash" and need to rest for awhile. Deflationary spiral crashes only occur because the Fed is always pumping monetary sugar into the economies blood stream. The longer the economy goes without a correction, the bigger the impending crash.

The form in which this "more credit, less sound money" policy has been implemented changes over time and the one pulling the lever changes based on whomever happens to have money creation authority. That's it. It's very clear. 
You act dumbfounded when I metion basic Fed policy concepts and are confused when I associate them with other policies. Either you're trolling or you just don't get it. What is QE? It's the purchase of private assets by the Fed using entirely fabricated currency that, but for the purchases, would lose value on the open market. It is, very simply, money creation followed by targeted spending. It's warping free market assets valuations. That does literally nothing to cause growth. It merely delays loss of valuation in the hands of one person, to the detriment of another.

No, they actually don't. Because 62% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. The vast majority of wealth sits in the form of corporate debt and in foreign bank accounts. Paradise and Panama papers made this crystal clear. Hoarding is at ALL TIME HIGHS despite the inflationary currency. Because the money has simply concentrated in the hands of very few. This is an inevitable result of an inflationary system. The poor spend away their savings into the hands of the hyper rich. The hyper rich don't spend because, at some point, more wealth adds nothing to quality of life, so you hoard.


No. It's an economic problem. Perpetual inflation incentivizes this kind of behavior. More people would save if saving actually provided some benefit. The rate of savings was MUCH HIGHER when we had higher interest rates in previous decades.

Would a deflationary currency harm the United States economy? Sure would. 
Is it because deflationary currency is necessarily harmful? Nope! It's because the United States is addicted to FRIVOLOUS, WASTEFUL SPENDING. Our economy has become DEPENDENT on the waste. When you take away heroin from an addict, you're going to see withdrawal symptoms. But don't confuse the withdrawal symptoms with the harm.

But does it generate any real wealth? I can employ a man to dig holes all day and fill them back up. In fact. I could employ thousands of men to do this work. What wealth in generated with these jobs? You'd say the economy is improved because jobs were generated, but how is that fundamentally different from simply taking resources from one person to give to another? Jobs that ultimately produce worthless, consumer garbage do not contribute to the long term health of the economy.

It can print purchasing power... for itself. Why? Because inflation has a lag time. When money is created and pumped into the economy, there is a lag between its creation and the subsequent increase of prices. 
So anyone with the authority to print money can steal value up front, using the "current" purchasing power, and leave everyone else holding the currency to suffer the inflationary comsequnces.
It's literally broadscale theft of value. But because its so inocuous, most people don't notice the crime.

Only because we've built an economy on a foundation of quicksand which creates little long term growth and a lot of short term transfers of money. One hand to another, no wealth production. You're still confusing a symptom for a cause. I've explained this to you countless times.


You ignored my point. The economy is merely the financial health of a country's citizens. If the monetary policy incentives the poor to dump their paychecks into the hands of the rich, then there will be an inevitable wealth concentration. And the rich will hoard their mountains of wealth. That is exactly what has happened.

I, like you, was a skeptical observer on the sideline for quite a while until one of my good friends finally convinced me to sit down one weekend and learn as much as I can about not just Bitcoin, but the surrounding economic environment (The monetary system, central banking, the Fed, US National Debt, etc.) This convinced me that, depsite the crazies involved, Bitcoin is not just a sound investment, but a revolutionary technology which will change the world just as the internet did. It might not be adopted as quickly and it WILL NOT be accepted without a fight, but ultimately it will change how the human race handles banking and finance.

This is wrong. Money originated as commodity-money. Without government issuance. Throughout history, currencies that failed to back themselves with a commodity-money (like gold) hyper-inflated, and ceased to exist. Fiat currencies come and go by the century, but commodity-money has existed for thousands of years, government or not.


That's literally how ALL value works. It, literally, doesn't work any other way. Things only have value to the extent that other humans accept them. Case and point, does the Bolivar have value because the Venezuelan government says so or because people accept it? (hint: citizens don't want to accept it any more)

Ahh, and here is where you are quite wrong. You cannot equate these two actions as the "simple misuse" of government funds. To do so would be the true denial. The *true* foolishness. 
On the one hand, the misuse is depriving the government of, a conservative, $1.5 trillion in lost tax revenues. That's *MORE* than all student loan debts in the United States combined. Federal debts alone are only $800 billion. Worse yet, the $1.5 trillion lost is being used, instead, to lobby congress and fund entire political campaigns. These funds are used to employ government officials in banks which gamble with American's money. Conveniently, these loopholes never get fixed year to year. Conveniently, the corrupt bankers never go to jail, and yet more money is spent on their yearly bonuses. 
On the other, a kid uses his student loan money in an attempt to create a business, or generate *SOME* savings with the full intent to later pay back that loan. He does this in an environment where MILLIONS of students leave college and default on their loan payments because they CAN'T FIND WORK THAT GENERATES ENOUGH INCOME. At the very least, if a kid misuses their loan funds to generate money, rather than spend it on a degree that is (more often than not) worthless for finding a job, then that is a well-intentioned action. When a young college kid's only option to get a low interest business loan is to misuse college funds, while the hyper-wealthy have low interest, multi-million dollar lines of credit *handed* to them, you KNOW the system is inexorably rigged.
See, to forget that this is a system of cause and effect, where no one action is independent of another, is to *fundamentally* misunderstand the problem. To deny the incestuous relationship between the government, corporations, and banking institutions is to *fundamentally* misunderstand the problem. All of the corruption and "misuse" of funds committed on behalf of the hyper-wealthy directly impacts the kid borrowing for college and trying to find work.

No. I want consistency. If the government is going to back student loans, there needs to be accountability on behalf of the universities accepting that money. The universities shouldn't be able to spend all of this extra loan money on useless new buildings and sports amenities, but they do it anyway. So because the loans aren't regulated, we're in a situation that is WORSE and not better for students. The loans drive up the price of tuition, but little of that money actually goes into higher quality education. It, literally, would be better if government backed student loans didn't exist. Either give the loans and regulate universities or don't give them at all. Loans without regulation is the WORST of the three options.

False comparison. One is a comparison between itself, and the price of itself (Euro). The other is a comparison between a Bitcoin and its price in Euros. 
To say a euro today is a euro tomorrow is redundant. It's the same as saying a Bitcoin today is a Bitcoin tomorrow. If we're actually going to make a comparison, let's compare it to a third thing of value. A cup of coffee. The euro will predictably lose value, guaranteed. And at a rate where its value lost isn't met by an equal rise in fixed wages. Bitcoin seems more and more likely to predictably gain value. Because, fundamentally, one is inflationary and the other isn't.


Yea. Not always. Plenty of examples where inflation is neither predictable nor stable. We had high rates of inflation in the 70s (which coincidentally occurred after the USD de-pegged from gold) and inflation has *in many cases* been so high as to destroy currencies permanently. Happening right now in Venezuela, Turkey, and Iran. Happened many times before in the United States, Germany, China, etc. etc. etc. Not the best track record.

You seem to be conflating volatility with store of value. Gold has been volitile for the past five decades, yes but it was illegal to own gold in the early part of the 20th century and gold had to go through a large re-valuation after being divorced from the USD in 1971. Over time, the USD has reliably lost value compared to gold. Sure, the gold price is volatile, but it is very reliably appreciating in value over time compared to all fiat currency. If you bought gold 30 years ago, you'd have much more in USD today. If you buy gold now its very likely going to be worth more money in USD 30 years from now as well. I'd even bet on it. By buying gold... That's what I mean when I say a good store of value. It lasts over a long period of time. Can't really say the same for cash... Its actually guaranteed to lose value by at least 2% per year... That's the Federal Reserves explicit plan...
Also, in contrast to Gold, Treasury bond yields have been falling for 30 years straight...

No, you REALLY REALLY REALLY don't understand. Because yes, it isn't that simple, but it ABSOLUTELY works that way. You REALLY don't get it.
Low interest rate, inflationary policies affect loans such that a company can borrow money very easily and continuously use new loan money to pay for old interest. Inflation devalues the debt, and the cycles continues. And so, a company can *literally* be a net loss on the economy and yet survive *just fine*. This DOES happen, you just ASSUME it doesn't, because YOU DON'T GET IT. Interest rate policy and inflationary policy are inseparable. 


No. It. Wouldn't. Because you wouldn't make the investment. You simply wouldn't. A company can produce a return at a net economic loss and still return above inflationary rates to the investor. This can be done and is done *VERY EASILY*. I'm speaking in terms of returns *adjusted for inflation*.

False. The economy moves forward because of capital investment and innovation. Inflation doesn't necessarily encourage investment. Not at all. It encourages *spending*. Which isn't the same thing. You can spend every single penny of your paycheck on beer for the month and have zero saved, because there is no incentive to actually save that money. Non-existent interest savings rates = non-existent citizen savings. Which is exactly what we have in America.
And when an investment is made, inflation doesn't even gaurentee that a *GOOD* investment was made. With a rate of 2% inflation, an investment that has a negative ROI of 1% is, by comparison, a "good" investment. Because at least you're not losing 1% to inflation. That doesn't gaurentee honest economic development. Not whatsoever. And so everyone is now inclined to invest in SUBPAR ventures. At least a rate of deflation guarantees that investments made are genuinely incentivized to create long term growth.

This doesn't address any of the major criticisms against the Federal Reserve. 
Take their QE programs. The FED artificially buys up assets to maintain their prices. Why? How is this a good thing? It's zombie demand. It only serves to maintain the wealth of those that HAVE a lot of assets already. It doesn't stimulate consumption in the economy, it actually PRECLUDES the purchasing power of most consumers. How are those prices going to be maintained unless the federal reserve perpetually dumps value into the system?
Sure, we haven't seen rampant increase of prices, but what we HAVE SEEN is an artificial maintenance of prices which SHOULD BE LOWER. That's JUST AS BAD for the economy as is inflation.

Furthermore, bubbles typically pop, and when they do, they stay popped. So over the last 9 years, why hasn't Bitcoin stayed "popped"?

But it effectively *IS* being paid to borrow money.


Yes. And the government gets the difference. Because they *DON'T* lose the same amount of purchasing power caused by inflation. Because the government gets to spend the money immediately. They've *MADE* money in real terms, regardless of whether or not they've done so in nominal terms. Real money has effectively transferred from the lender, to the borrower. 
And its because of an interest rate suppressed environment that incentives negative yield bond purchases. You fail to mention that central bank policy effectively *CREATES* the demand for these bonds the first place. 
It's an absurd self-reinforcing cycle which is confusing to those who fail to see it for what it *REALLY* is. A semantic and surface level excuse for paying the government to lend them money.

@_date: 2018-07-19 13:36:58


Not true. Because inflation dis-proportionally benefits the rich at the expense of the poor. Deflation does not.
The poor don't make enough money to benefit from investments. At best, they can buy a few measily stock shares.  Many of which are well out of their price range by design. Arbitrarily high stock par-values. The poor also don't own any assets that appreciate in value as a result of inflation.
They live a pay check to paycheck lifestyle, with a relatively fixed income that is forced to pay for ever rising costs of living. Any money left over is held as savings in their bank account. Savings which, in an inflationary environment, do nothing but lose them value. So what becomes the rational financial strategy for the average poor person? Spend your money now (not necessarily on anything productive) on whatever. Never save. Saving is irrational. And that's *exactly* what has happened. Savings rate is at rock bottoms in the United States for the average household.


The one who looks at it simply is you. Because if we are to take your very simple statement


The exact same can be said in reverse. "Inflation benefits everyone, thus no one." 
Which effectively admits that inflation *has no purpose* and yet so many *BELIEVE* it does. This is what we can conclude from YOUR simple outlook.

Which means nothing if the purchasing power of that money is worthless because rather than repay the bonds with earned wealth, the government instead printed money to pay off the debt. The point of a currency being "backed" is to limit the extend to which it can be printed, not to limit the extend to which the issuing government can default. 
Guess what? Wiemar Germany did not default on its debts. Are you saying everything turned out happy and rosy for the German citizens? Are you saying the Wiemar Mark is still a valuable and valid currency?

You failed to understand my point. Under an inflationary environment. the negative 1% ROI investment would be "good" and therefore made because it is "good" relative to the 2% lose you would lose anyway. Thus, negative yielding investments are sometimes "good".
*By Comparison* in a deflationary environment, if your venture fails to generate an ROI higher than the rate of deflation, then it is not a "good" investment, and you're better off saving your money, which can be later for an actually "good" investment opportunity. Negatively yielding investments are never "good".
And don't mean to confuse these examples with a venture that, say, intends to perform research at a lose for a few years before generating a ROI. Not what I'm talking about. I'm saying an investment that generates a ROI at least better -2% per year *FOREVER* is rational under a 2% or higher inflationary system.


If we're speaking nominal terms, yea it would. Absolutely. Because The investment in nominal terms would have the exact same ROI, regardless of inflation or deflation. It's ROI in real terms is, by definition, adjusted for the rate of inflation/deflation. Duh. This is irrelevant to my point.

Super convenient when you can simply force the interest rate to zero. Then literally *any* debt is "healthy".


Yea. Because its *really* easy to be &gt;than zero. But guess what? You can't simply suppress the foundational interest rate of the economy forever.

Not really. It merely makes it more rational to take a loss on an investment. Because so long as that loss exceeds the loss of inflation, it's rational to make it. That's not necessarily a "profit". And just because the money is "invested" doesn't mean it's doing anything productive in the economy. An investment that loses money is just a drain on the economy, not a benefit. The fundamentals of the investment are not sound and so there is a negative or near zero return. And if the return is merely neutral, then nothing productive was added.
Deflation guarantees that investments are productive. Because those investments have to compete with the default rate of deflation. Sure, there are less investments being made, but the investments that *ARE* being made are actually worthwhile and doing something to benefit the economy. Money will naturally flow to genuine investment opportunities instead of flailing about across the economy in search of merely *some* return, even if at a loss.
And it doesn't even gaurantee sound investment. For example, there is literally zero reason why a CEO might decide to severely indebt the corporation, use the funds to purchase a bunch of their own stock, see massive appreciation in the value of their own personal stocks and peace out, selling their shares after they quit. Easy money policy has NO INCENTIVE not to do this. 
Because debt can float an unproductive company for decades if the interest rate is low enough. Zombie corporations with no real productivity just playing with financials, where the executives slowly plunder the coffers and replace the real wealth with a mountain of debt. I'm dead serious when I say this is *entirely possible* and *does happen* when there is little to no cost of debt. Both because of low interest rates AND because the value of debt inflates itself away.

For *you*. A profit *for you*. You STILL don't get it. You can make a relatively "good" (for you) investment in a company that is a net LOSS on the economy. Because *YOU* haven't lost *as much* money as you would have with inflation, but the company provides a NEGATIVE return on the economy. Money goes in, less money comes out. That is the result of BAD wealth generation and BAD productivity. But so long as it provides a LESS WORSE RETURN than inflation, it is a "good" investment *FOR YOU*.
It's a problem of resource allocation. Resources used on this BAD company could be used elsewhere. And if there isn't somewhere else to use the resources, you can SAVE them until you do find a good place to make a economically good investment. Inflationary currency incentives just making ANY investment *REGARDLESS* of the genuine economic output that investment produces. REGARDLESS of whether or not that investment *ACTUALLY BENEFITS THE ECONOMY*. Throwing more money at something is NOT GOOD BY DEFAULT. 
Not when that thing returns 95 cents per 1 dollar spent. It is a MONEY BURNING MACHINE. But so long as it is better than the negative return of inflation, it becomes RATIONAL TO LOSE MONEY. UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT.

Investing doesn't become obsolete simply because of deflation or lack thereof. That's just patently false. Because its all relative. If the rate of deflation is 1%, then any investment that provides a &gt;1% ROI is a good investment.

And if the incentives are mal-aligned, the system will become entropic until it ceases to function. This is a process that can take decades, but be ultimately caused by what was an initially "sound" incentive structure. I would argue the current incentives for politicians are to make the biggest promises possible, exploit their new-found power for special insider favors, and peace out as an "ashamed" scape-goat that everyone can lay blame on.  
There *really* is no long term incentive to make sure these bloated socialized systems are funded. Because unless the government forcibly requires the wealthy to keep themselves and their wealth in the country, there *will* be nobody left to dump the consequences onto other than the average person. There is simply *a few too many trillion* in debt to be paid back. And don't be so naive to think that the hyper-wealthy will just casually wait for the government to come confiscate their wealth. No. They will, and already have, been moving wealth outside of the country.

I'm not sure which of my definitions of bubble you're referring to.


So then what primarily drives the price of forex trading?


So by your definition, Bitcoin has never once been in a bubble. Because the run ups have always been greater than the following crash. Not just by a little bit. By a significant degree.


Or, more likely, you'll never be able to afford that car because you're the average European living off a fixed wage, high taxes, saddled with debt, and lose any pittance of savings you have leftover to inflation. Bitcoin doesn't need to be the end all, be all, world dominatrix of currency to be successful. It doesn't need to achieve this to merely not be labeled "a bubble". 
Bitcoin is valuable for the exact reason it is purchased at this moment in time. It's an asset you can be certain will exist apart from the mainstream monetary system and which has a fixed total supply. Such a thing is, whether you believe it or not, valuable for investment purposes. Nobody here is telling you to empty your entire bank account into Bitcoin and use it to buy coffee *right now*. You seem to think if its not safe for you to do so *right now* then it *MUST* be a bubble.

How does this prove that "inflation encouraged sharing" is beneficial to the long-term health of the economy? It doesn't. Because it has *plenty* of side effects. Such as a ROCK BOTTOM SAVINGS RATE for the average citizen. Savings in this country are nearly non-existent. When you manipulate economic incentives, you don't merely affect 1 aspect of the economy. And most often, you fail to even affect the *targeted* outcome of your policy. Because while more "investments" are being made in that the stock market has gone to record highs, there is little indication that those "investments" are being used to ACTUALLY develop the productive capacity of the economy and create new jobs. A significant portion of the stock market is just leveraged stock-buybacks to boost executive portfolios.

Gold has a high probability of "winning" such a scenario, but do not discredit Bitcoin so easily. Bitcoin is the first "hard" digital asset that is highly liquid.

Traditionally, only *some* commodities could be used as money. And only *some* commodities have a limited supply. And even fewer commodities are both. Gold has traditionally been the best of these commodities. 
Until Bitcoin. Fundamentally, the monetary characteristics of Bitcoin rival Gold in some areas, and are better than Gold in others. Whether or not this will be recognized by the broader society is a different issue. Which is why I own both Gold and Bitcoin.

It's the single most secure network. It has the first mover advantage. It's a guaranteed fixed supply coin. Every coin that isn't fixed in supply, or is subject to some kind of centralized intervention can be written off as a non-competitor. Because Bitcoin is competing as a alternative to a fiat system of wealth storage. If its not a fixed supply and if its not decentralized, then its no different than the current fiat system.
And so Bitcoin's natural rivals will be precious metals, and other fixed supply cryptos. But cryptos are only fixed in supply if their networks are secure. And Bitcoin's is the most secure. And so it attracts more people, further securing the network. It's a self-reinforcing process.

TLDR; I realize I rambled a bit here, so let me summarize. Deflation is good because, contrary to popular belief, it helps the middle class and the poor. Deflation is a policy that combats wealth inequality, a massive problem today, because the problem isn't hoarding of money, it's hoarding of *assets*. The wealthy don't hoard money, they hoard *assets* to store their wealth. Expensive, yet vacant Vancouver apartments is a good example.
Deflation provides an opportunity for the poor to actually save money and afford goods and services. There is little to no incentive for a poor person not to spend all of their disposable income today on beer and other frivolous purchases. After necessary expenses, they probably only have $50 to spend anyway, what's the point of putting it into a savings account that nets interest below the inflation rate?


It's an issue of resource allocation. Because inflation doesn't necessarily incentive *good* spending and investment. It merely incentives spending and investment. And so you get a situation where corporations are spending ridiculous amounts of money not on hiring new employees or developing their production base, but rather buying back their own stock and playing with financial derivatives (which is borderline gambling) in record numbers. This does very little to improve the *real* economy. It merely pads the bank accounts of executive and priority stockholders.
The second issue is wealth concentration. Inflation does very little to prevent massive wealth inequality. In fact, contrary to popular belief, inflation makes wealth inequality *worse* and not better. Because it's not like wealthy people just stick a bunch of dollars in a vault and cry as its value inflates away. No. They buy assets. A LOT of assets. Those assets appreciate in value because of inflation, but that does not mean a genuine economic investment was made.
For example, there is a huge problem in Vancouver right now where wealthy Chinese are buying up properties and not living in them, driving up the costs of living for Canadians. They're having to move out of the city and commute in for work while there exist countless vacant apartments. A natural outcome of inflationary monetary policy. Hoard illiquid assets instead of currency.
Now how might deflation be better? It would, *for sure*, naturally redistribute wealth in the economy. Because lower asset prices will allow poor people who live on a fixed income to actually *afford* to buy things. See, this is where soooo many people get it wrong. It's not the money that does the economic development. It's the productive *ASSETS* that develops the economy. Zimbabwean trillionaires are meaningless. Because Zimbabwean doesn't have a wealth of assets. And right now, there is a massive hoarding of asset (wealth) ownership, where only a very small portion of the economy actually owns some significant wealth apart from their bi-weekly paychecks and maybe a car.
Deflation allows the average citizen living on a fixed income to actually *save* capital and make a significant purchase later. Deflationary policy would benefit the poor tremendously. Perhaps not in the short term, but certainly in the long term. And that's the thing. Deflation is policy that incentivizes looking toward the future. Inflation is all about *today today today*.
What many people fail to realize is that prior to the Great Depression, there was massive wealth inequality. Inequality that rivals that of today. The Fed, at the time, went through an overly enthusiastic tightening policy which triggered the deflationary spiral that we know as the Great Depression. Unfortunately, it was followed by massive inflation because of other poor decisions, but I digress. 
The point is, the American middle class had its golden age not in spite of, but *because of* the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. The costs of living sank to such a degree that wealth (assets) actually spread throughout the population. And the 1950s American Dream meme of the middle class came to be. Something that is increasingly less possible today because of the massive wealth inequality.

This is a statement which means nothing more than inflation is predictable when it is predictable and it isn't predictable when it isn't. Venezuela was a stable nation... until inflation destabilized it. The Arab spring countries were considered relatively stable... until inflation destabilized them. Wiemar Germany was a stable nation... you know the rest. You're failing to consider the fact that sometimes inflation is *ITSELF* the destabilizing factor. You can't just label any country who suffers massive inflation as not *really* having been stable in the first place. It's the old, tired "Not real socialism" argument.
Also, very few people expected or predicted the high inflation in the 70s, or the *very* high inflation in the 30s. How about you amend your statement to, inflation is predictable... in "stable nations"... most of the time...

By the way, the average American is at record low levels of saving and record high levels of debt. And wealth concentration is *higher than ever before*. Because guess what?

Overtaking a major currency in the short term? No. I'd agree, unless we have a major currency crisis. Which I'm not entirely convinced is out of the question.
But continue to grow such that it rivals other stores of value like gold? Yes, absolutely. Gold is at a 9 trillion market cap. If Bitcoin even achieves half the size of gold's market cap, it will reach a price in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.


Perhaps not initially, or on its face, but consider a second layer solution like the lightning network. Such additions would make Bitcoin no less difficult to trade than digital dollars. It would be faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient even.
The whole reason there ever existed a gold standard was to make convenient the use of gold as money. Gold was the *real* money and paper currency was the *claim check* on that money. At some point, people forgot the reason why gold was used as the foundational unit of money in the first place and once again decided to "try" a fiat system. If, and when, this fiat experiment fails, we could very easily migrate to Bitcoin. For its store of value characteristics as the foundational global monetary unit of measurement and use a second layer solution to transact Bitcoin on the day to day. It would mirror the gold standard in terms of monetary policy, but with improvements in efficiency across the board.

Doesn't matter.

The "government" doesn't have an agenda. Its *always* about individuals and their agendas.

Yea, I do. Because more investment doesn't gaurantee more wealth. Especially when you use a method like inflation to do it. Because in order for an investment to be a "rational" decision under an inflationary environment, it merely needs to provide a return that isn't *as bad* as inflation. That *DOES NOT MEAN* that economic wealth was produced, however. Overall economic wealth can be *LOST* in an investment and yet it was still smart for the investment to be made on an individual level. Because of inflation.
Inflation *DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT THAT PRODUCES MORE WEALTH*. It merely incentivzes investment. Peroid. Not the same thing.
Whereas deflation *DOES* incentivize investment that creates more economic wealth. Because you will only make an investment that creates a gross positive return AND a net positive return in every scenario.


This is where your assumptions are simply wrong. Because wealth is NOT THE SAME as money. *Especially* in an inflationary environment. 
If something increases in price because of inflation, it has not *actually gained more productivity or value*. Putting more money into something *doesn't mean more wealth or productivity is being produced*. 
And inflation *skews investment incentives* such that you are trained to care more about the face dollar "value" return of an investment *rather than the real economic value* that is returned.

So you're suggesting that the government would be willing to pay private companies to fund a blockchain that they have no authority or control over? 
Or did you more likely forget the two most important components of a blockchain? A blockchain is just an inefficient database unless it is both  1) decentralized and 2) has no central authority. 
A centrally controlled blockchain is susceptible to the EXACT SAME vulnerabilities that the current fiat system is. The government will be prone to printing currency to pay off their irresponsibly accrued debt and the currency will by subject to hyperinflation. We already talked about this. And you ALREADY settled on the notion that Gold would win in such a scenario. Now we *should* be talking about why Bitcoin might surpass an actual competitor (Gold), but you're still confused as to what the purpose of a blockchain even is.
EDIT: I see you're suffering from the exact same confusion in your conversations with other users in this thread. Get this simple concept through your mind and save yourself some time. A cryptocurrency is *worthless* if it is not decentralized and both in mining AND CONTROL. A centrally controlled cryprocurrency DEFEATS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF A CRYPROCURRENCY.
A government crypto wouldn't fail as a currency because the currency is "insecure". It would fail for the exact same reason all other fiat currencies have failed. Because it is CENTRALLY CONTROLLED. Because it let's individuals in the government print money for POLITICALLY CORRUPT purposes. And entire different issue from whether or not the currency is "hackable".

Spending for the sake of spending is not, by default, a good thing. I can pay a man to dig ditches, and fill them back up all day, but that adds nothing to the overall economy. Making an individual spend, when they might be better off saving, doesn't become a good financial strategy simply because you've said "spending is good".


Nope. Because real wages have been falling, not rising. Inflation doesn't keep wages "in tune" with price rises. Inflation *causes* the price rises. And it just isn't true that wages have kept up with price rises, so that's not an argument in favor of inflation. It just isn't.


Feeling progress and having progress are not the same thing. Placating to people's feelings is a *very* flimsy reason to encourage inflation at a macroeconomic level.


Okay. So then tell me what it is.


Inflation is a capitalist doctrine? News to me.


Are you saying the industrial revolution wasn't capitalism? Because nothing you've mentioned explains why inflation was necessary for the massive growth that occurred during the industrial revolution in the late 1800s and early 1900s. 
Here's a chart of USD CPI inflation: 
The dollar was *fixed* to the supply of gold until 1971. No significant expansion of the monetary supply was possible. So did capitalism not exist?

Its value increases and decreases with demand. With widespread demand saturated, it's value would plateau. It would not suffer inflation.


Investment and long term wealth storage in an asset which has a fixed supply *is a real world use case*. It's merely that YOU personally fail to recognize it as one. And yet people, and banks, buy and store literal tons of gold for the exact same reason.


I don't really care so much whether or not a get rich quick kid sells his 0.0005 Bitcoins at a loss. That's not Bitcoin's main selling point. Not even close. It's a fixed supply, highly liquid store of value apart from and not beholden to the mainstream monetary system.


Not at the moment, no. But not because it isn't money. People are free to transact in Bitcoin, and they do. The reason they don't is because of Gresham's law, not because Bitcoin isn't money. With more adoption will come less volatility, and more accessibility as a medium of exchange. Until then, it functions as a long term store of value.


Fiat currency is based on faith in government. Bitcoin is a money whose faith is based on dispassionate mathematics.


Again, you fail to recognize fixed supply wealth storage as a use case, when it clearly is. Maybe not for you, but *plenty* of people buy gold (and subsequently hold it) for the same exact reason. It's just the consequence of Gresham's law. It doesn't invalidate gold's monetary value whatsoever.


But you're still wrong, because fiat currency is *ALSO* based on speculative faith. Forex traders buy and sell currencies *speculating* on the future value of each every single day. The average person uses fiat currencies with the expectation that their currency is special and not subject to surprise inflation. When history tell us that is fundamentally *wrong*. 
Monetary theory and economics didn't become magically different these past few decades. Fiat currencies have a bad historically track record. Period. They are prone to failure. Even in countries whom were considered highly stable *at the time*. And why do fiat currencies fail? They hyper-inflate. And why do they hyper-inflate? Politically interested individuals begin to "relax" on their notions of "reasonable" amounts of monetary creation.
Hint hint, have you *looked* at the National debt, yearly deficit, and Federal Reserve balance sheet recently?
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:45:33
No they are not. Keywords are "value" and "faster". The word "value" implies we are speaking in real terms, not nominal terms and the word "faster" implies we are speaking in relative terms, and not merely appreciation vs. depreciation. In other words, "the relative difference in appreciation or depreciation of value determines the 'health' of an investment" is a different statement than "only appreciation determines 'health'".

A government backed crypto is not a plausible scenario because it is NO DIFFERENT from our CURRENT system. And has NO MORE VALUE than our CURRENT system.
And it's not about whether or not a government "allows" a crypto to succeed. Do you think any government would have "allowed" their currency to hyperinflate and lose the confidence of its citizens if government could prevent it? No. Of course not. Fiat currencies collapse because they are *inherently* unstable. They are inherently vulnerable to internal political corruption and misuse.
Which is why fiat currencies have defaulted back to commodity money. Because citizens lose confidence in the government money. No sane person is going to accept a government "crypto" if they're hopping ship from another failing government currency. They will choose Gold, and maybe Bitcoin.

Yea. To who? Other rich people? No. To the rest of the economy. See. What you fail to consider is that decreasing prices isn't necessarily always *bad*. Because now the less fortunate can actually afford to buy things.


But I can. Because it *DOES* affect the poor in ways that they specifically cannot control. The poor cannot simply re-negotiate their wage on a monthly basis to account for inflation. But they *MUST* pay for the same goods that cost them less the previous month. They never get that difference back. It is a consequence that invariably ONLY affects the poor because they live on a fixed income and paycheck to paycheck. A deflationary system *would* allow them to save more easily. 
Because understand, you're already trying to incentive a person who likely works two jobs to invest money in the stock market. Something most poor people will admit they have no business doing simply for the fact that they don't have the time to educate themselves on the process or educate themselves on the potential stock picks. And pay for a stock-broker/accountant? As a poor person? Lol. 
So what do you get instead? No investments made by the poor, no savings, and all extra spending on frivolous comfort purchases. And now you've got to pay for more of their living expenses anyway through massive and inefficient government welfare programs. That is 100% the result of low-interest rate, inflationary policy. 100%.

And you missed *MY* entire point. Housing is one sector of the economy. One bubble. Other bubbles have risen to take its place. Just because one sector was given a band-aid, doesn't mean other sectors are safe. Sub-prime auto lending. Credit card lending. Student loans. Financial derivatives, etc. etc. The cause of the 2008 crisis was not the housing bubble. The housing bubble was a *SYMPTOM*. A symptom of an economy starved for an ROI. A symptom of an economy willing to grant debt *far too easily* no matter the loan. The lending for the housing market may have been regulated, but *are you so sure* that irresponsible lending hasn't occurred in other sectors? Because you seem to think that only a *housing* crisis could possibly cause another deflationary spiral.
If a recession occurs, if a stock market crash occurs, if Americans lose their jobs, if millions of students can't afford homes do you think the housing market will fare well? No. The auto market tanked along with the housing market in 2008. What makes you *so sure* that housing isn't susceptible to a similar scenario in the opposite direction? What makes you *so sure* that the current housing values represent genuine valuations?

You're kidding me right? Did you not read my second paragraph? I addressed this already. The fact that you think I'm suggesting we "remove" the financial system entirely is a complete mis-characterization of my point. The point is that a policy of continued manipulation isn't going to fix a negative situation that was caused by PREVIOUS manipulation. When a heroin addict is going through painful withdrawal, you aren't going to fix their addiction by giving them MORE HEROIN.


And you're wrong again. Floating interest rates would do this. It prices out individuals who can't afford the interest payments from the beginning rather than baiting them into excess debt with cheap money and then surprising them later with rising rates. Want a loan? Then you'd better save up first and make a down payment.


Come on, man. This was my entire first paragraph. Are you being intentionally dense? I'm literally just going to paste what I've already written because you clearly didn't get it.


The system WILL have to deal with those consequences REGARDLESS of blame. Again, who is to blame ISN'T THE POINT. You can blame people for taking out bad loans ALL YOU WANT, but that won't fix the bubbles that result and it WON'T prevent the bubbles from popping and damaging the other sectors of the economy. I don't care how much you blame individuals. It WILL NOT CHANGE THE REALITY that low interest rates and easy money CREATE BUBBLES IN THE ECONOMY. Why can't you understand this?

Private banks issue mortgages and the Fed buys bundles of mortgage debt from them.

You're confused. Gold was at speculative highs in the early 80s. It had just been depegged from the dollar and was at all time highs from the ensuing money chasing it. Sorry to say that you bought the top of the mania and seemingly sold before the next big run in the 2000s. Commodities tend to do this. They become overvalued and undervalued on human hype cycles. But the "true" value stays the same. And so an expansion of the money supply results in a guaranteed rise in price. This is a long term gain investment.
Gold won't go down lower. It is cooling off from its previous run up and trillions of dollars have been created since. It's basic math. It will go through another manic run up and then cool off at some higher level. It will not retest pre-2000 run up lows.

Key phrase at the end and it's PRECISELY why you're wrong. It might not be the system's fault, but it IS the system's problem. Regardless of who is to blame, there still exists a bubble. Just because it's "the student's fault" doesn't mean the bubble isn't there and it doesn't mean the consequences of a bubble won't happen.
It's a complete dodge of the issue. Same goes for other types of loans. Just because people need loans, doesn't mean an artificially low interest rate is ALWAYS beneficial or necessarily encourages sound, productive investments. It doesn't mean creating money to prop up an industry is ALWAYS a good idea. It actually incentives that industry to gamble MORE and not less. Why? Because they know they are "too big to fail".
As for "how could I afford a $18,000 car if I couldn't get an easy loan" I simply ask you this. How could students POSSIBLY afford to go to college before government loans were universally available? It's a simple answer. College used to be AFFORDABLE to the average person working a minimum wage, part time job. Access to government guaranteed loans made the price of tution skyrocket. It created a scenario where you CAN'T afford to pay unless you get a loan. Take away access to easy money and the tution WOULD drop. It would do so necessarily. This is what you don't understand.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:04:51
You're confusing yearly inflationary with the expansion of the money supply. Price increases always lag behind the expansion. We've seen trillions of dollars in created money over the past decade and CPI inflation hasn't followed. Why? Because most of that money has inflated the stock market. Stock market goes down and you'll see PLENTY OF price increases. You're looking at the problem as the tail wagging the dog instead of the dog wagging the tail. Rising yearly prices are a later consequence of an expanded money supply. 
The rising prices always lag behind, by many years even. I'd absolutely argue that gold is actually undervalued based on the expansion of the money supply. It has shrunk considerably compared to many other financial assets. Most of which are paper assets and highly speculative. Just look at the stock value of Tesla versus Ford. Then compare their actual yearly earnings and output.

Although I tend to agree that civilization is less stable than many often presume, I'm not convinced that the entire thing will reset such that computers become completely unusable or uncommon. I'll give your book a look see regardless.

Great. Next question
Does increased access to home loans (funds going into the market) put more or less buying pressure on home prices?

Do you know the definition of the word "advocate"?


Yea. In the future. Probably during the next recession. What a truly precise and *outlandish* prediction. 
Why the fuck do you even care about my personal financial decisions anyway? Seems like you're trying to justify your own position rather than convince me. Demonstrates that you're more-so arguing from forceful ideology rather than curiosity and learning.


Am I this sub? Or am I an individual? Do you have an argument or just more complaining?

There is good reason. You're just too dense to see it. When you need food, you spend money (even deflationary) to buy it. When you need shelter you spend money (even deflationary) to buy it. When you need a car you spent money (even deflationary) to buy it. Your characterization of a "rational" holder of deflationary currency is a naked, starving man living in a cave hoarding piles of gold like a fucking goblin. It's ridiculous and wrong.

It's actually amazing. I made an offhand comment about the Greeks using gold for coins. That's it. But you DESPERATELY NEED ME to be "citing them" for my "argument". It's so absurd. I'm amazed your mind hasn't short circuted. 
Also really cute how you've decided to toss in "developed". Bet you think that's a clever little trick that no one will notice. Your intial question about free markets was, literally, word for word:
"You cannot point to any free market existing without a strong central government"
In your severe delusion, you've convinced yourself that I *made a claim* about free markets and that claim involved *specific developments*. In reality, it was YOUR poorly formed question that I simply answered to show how deeply entrenched you are in your absolutism.
Face it. You're a rabid ideological lunatic who cannot help but RELENTLESSLY get my positions wrong. You probably don't even read  what I've written. You just skim for more idelogicially motivated talking points to regurgitate. You're literally a robotic slave. Your comment exists, and so you have no free will. The talking points are becoming too predictable. It's starting to be rather boring.
I dare you to reread this exchange from the beginning. See JUST HOW MUCH you've twisted and contorted your positions to fit your mindless ideology. From the beginning, I've been asking about RESEARCH FUNDING. I've been questioning the necessity of RESEARCH FUNDING. NOT THE EXISTENCE OF GOVERNMENT. Get that through your DENSE SKULL.

The little money poor people do make is not enough to invest in assets and gains no benefit from being saved. Poor people who could put the little savings they do have into an interest accruing account would be SIGNIFICANTLY better off. But they can't. So it gets spent on beer, iPhones, and clothes.

No. You're blatantly wrong. Gold cannot just drop to previous lows. To believe this is to fundamentally misunderstand inflation and is to fundamentally misunderstanding that money is merely a measurement. There are trillions in new USD since the 80s. When USD is created, there IS UNIVERSAL price increase. Commodities, like gold, silver, oil, and Uranium are priced in this expanding measurement of USD. The USD expands and so the price of commodities rises. And the only way the prices will permanently retrace is if the currency supply, itself, shrinks. And that will never happen.

The key is that Bitcoin is limited in supply. Fiat is not limited.

You *DID* change your definition. You went from "value appreciates faster than the debt's interest rate" to "a depreciating asset is unhealth". Those are *not the same definition* and I explained why. Would you like to address the issue or would you rather play pretend with words?

People with Billions don't hold their money in cash. They hold it in assets.

The FED bought up a bunch of bad mortgage loans. These loans had inflated the value of the housing market. When the loans went bad, so too did the housing market. Their solution? Create money (literally) out of thin air and buy up the bad mortgages thus preserving the value of those homes. They became a replacement buyer where the previous buyers were no longer solvent. They become the "created" demand to replace the phony demand. Why is this important? Because they didn't fix the underlying economy. They didn't fix the lack of home demand. They didn't fix the conditions which made homes unnaffordable to citizens. They merely manipulated the market value of those homes so that the CURRENT owners of the mortgages and titles didn't LOSE THEIR MONEY. Effectively, they protected the value and wealth of the few at the expense of the many.
The housing market didn't get better, the devaluation was merely delayed. Home ownership in the United States is decreasing, not increasing. When the boomer generation goes to sell their homes for retirement, they will find a generation of millennials who cannot afford those homes. And thus we will have the housing market crash once again. A crash that was merely delayed.

The Fed balance sheet is filled with billions of dollars of mortgage backed securities. Do some research before you say things that are provably false. The market rebounded BECAUSE the Fed bought these loans. They've been buying mortgages with QE open market operations for years.
The title owners are the banks who secured the bad loans. The banks DID NOT LOSE MONEY. That was the whole point of the bailout and Fed intervention. To prevent the banks from losing money. And it worked. But only nominally. None of the conditions that caused the 2008 crisis were fixed. Merely delayed. The economy is worse, not better. Too many people confuse the stock market with "the economy". That's a false equivalence.
