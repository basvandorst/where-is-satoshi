If you come here as tourist you will get that impression. Work here, earn 9 usd per month and then we talk.

I wish I would be a State Department contractor. Sadly I am not, I am Venezuelan living here and I have to do several things to earn enough to barely survive.

People don't have savings in Bolivares. Buy first option is gold and usd, some people go to cryptos.
Technological means could be a barrier too, a lot of people have downgraded from smartphones to dumb phones or no phone because of the economic crisis.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:59:08
Not yet
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:02:33
For that point of view, you will have that impression.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:01:49
Maybe because I can support whoever I want to? As you are free to oppose him
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:31:46
Nothing much. If that is your only income you depend on monthly box of food sold by the government.
A used cars could be from 1000 usd (small car, Chevrolet of Ford)
Rent could be 100-200 usd per month.
Food prices are almost the same than Colombia and other countries, meat is 5 usd per kilo, rice is 2 usd, flour 2 usd.. a canned Coke is 2 usd
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:17:54
0.77 Bs are 1 Satoshi. Very close to 1:1
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:36:44
Sanctions aren't starving people here. You can read the UN Human Right document about the matter and the document o posted in the original post. I suppose you don't trust UN. I support any kind of sanction against the government.
Yeah right, anything to do or say won't make me change. I'm my point of view the traitor is Maduro.
I am Venezuelan living here, your can search my post history, when I first posted in Reddit a mod ran a verification to me. I won't post any cedula to convince you.
I respect you point of view.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:38:53
My wage is a little higher and I also do some work online. But in general you cannot live , that is the main problem here
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:06:43
Thanks for your support.
I hope you never have to live in Venezuela and earn 9 usd per month.

I mean Localbitcoin. The data I post is based in Local Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:34:25
Some of them are easy to buy. Most prices are very high for us.
Government has a list of some products that has fixed price, there is scarcity of all of them (meat, chicken, eggs). Is really hard.

Mostly people is using custodial wallets. Main hardware is old Android phones.
People try to avoid fees, but knowledge is not enough to  know how to do it.
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:07:53
Yep, you got it... That is why I am trying to show here... In proportion BTC is really used here 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:25:08
No. Nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:27:29
Toilet. It is softer 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:06:51
It hasn't been safe since years. You have to keep a low profile and you have to be Venezuelan. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:30:01
Which fees?
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:05:58
Openly it is not possible, it is not legal. Under the table it is another story. I think the public perception is higher that other countries, remember the government has its own "crypto" the Petro. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:26:25
Even jail? Getting tortured? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:55:32
It's good that you understand the situation. Rocks and fireworks cannot fight against fireguns.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:53:56
Yep, that is why we have to wait. Nothing done by the government has worked so far.
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:30:21
If that excite some people, they better come to the country and yell "Fuera Maduro" that would get you jail easily. No need to start a company.
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:03:03
Normal people too.. what would be the advantage of the whales buying bolivares ? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:05:41
Government controls everything. They have been working for years to archieve that.
I really don't know . Even living here. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:07:22
They would still hace more Bolivars... One year ago the exchange rate was several times less... 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:54:50
On Friday the released a new law that allows "free" transactions for USD and other currencies. Let's wait if it true.
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:55:54
People that needs to buy food, groceries and everything and should pay with BsS. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:23:37
So far it only exists in NM mind. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:39:56
People that works with high volumes love it.. easy way of buying or selling 1-2BTC
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:20:43
We hope so. But they have resisted for years like that

@_date: 2018-09-10 20:01:42
Good idea
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:21:14
You could but it is a very risky thing to do.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:33:13
How would you want the bolivares? Is it illegal to ship them outside Venezuela
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:55:01
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:59:35
Sorry but that is Localbitcoin data. 
292,000,000  Bs is around 3,000,000 USD which could be around 420 BTC .
One USD is around 90-110 BsS. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:30:56
hehehe, thanks my friend.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:56:20
You deposit money in AirTM (Almost any option is possible, BTC, USD, LTC, ETH, Giftcards) and then, when you need it you withdraw it in BsS.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:43:14
Everything is done electronically. Yes it is a scrow like Localbitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:30:00
I think it is not updated, July was around 100%. It is not slowing down.
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:39:04
I don't know... Yes, for now a lot of people have their Android /iPhones from 2013-2014 when things were better...
I still don't know how does lighting works... 
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:18:08
Gold is really used. But I don't know about silver. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:41:00
It was 30 USD two weeks ago and before that and they crazy raise it was around 1 USD per month. You can read my post history. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:54:36
What do you mean
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:59:25
Two weeks ago 5 zeroes were knocked off from the currency and new bills were issued. 1 BsS. (Bolivar Soberano) is 100,000 Bs. (Bolivares fuertes).
There are two exchange rate the official one were 1 USD is around 61 BsS. and the street one (used by Localbitcoin) which is around 90-110 BsS. per USD.
You can see the official rate in the BCV  (Venezuelan Central  Bank) webpage and the unofficial and illegal rate in various webpages like Localbitcoin, Airtm, Dollar Today, Dolar Promedio and Dolar Beta. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:04:04
I have to read about runscape gold. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:25:25

No, too dangerous.

@_date: 2018-09-24 02:37:35
Thanks for the best my friend. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:21:25
Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:26:15
Most of it is done in Bs 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:38:06
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:24:24
We will know in a few weeks, I will post here or if you DM, we can talk.
Sadly all the initiatives from the government never work. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:57:33
I'm not asking for it but I should also say that anything will help. It's true. Well, prices have been increasing a lot in USD too (There is BsS. inflation and also USD inflation, of course much lower). Let say 8 USD are around 800 BsS. I could buy 10 kilos of potatoes (250 BsS.), one kilo of meat (250 BsS.), tree kilos of rice (150 BsS.) and less than one kilo of cheese (150 BsS.)
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:31:59
Too flammable, also doing that for more than a few gallons will call the attention of the autorities. Here it means jail and torture.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:06:13
I don't think so. It's a good buy dangerous idea. They have a really good intelligence agency (SEBIN) which I think should know about that idea.
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:47:50
Yes, most of them.
The ones that will continue working are:
1,000 Bs. (old) which is 0.01 Bs. (new)
2,000 Bs. (old)
5,000 Bs. (old)
10,000 Bs. (old)
20,000 Bs. (old)
100,000 Bs. (old) which is 1 Bs. (new)
There were 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 Bs. (old) which will be de-monetized on monday.
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:46:26
It's a good question, they have been working for months waiting for tomorrow.
Today at 8pm all the POS will stop working until tomorrow 6am, same with online bank. It'll be a blackout. Tomorrow is a non-work day so people and stores can adjust.
It's a big logistic and technological operation. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:25:53
In explain that in my post, you need bolivares to pay for things. Finding someone that accept crypto as payment is not easy. Only case I know is one Subway in Caracas where you can pay using dash.
If the owner want to accept crypto he has to find a way to mask that, legally you only have to accept bolivares. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:35:50
Where can I sell that gold for cryptos?
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:18:39
I think political control. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:07:04
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:59:29
Yes it was 2-3 usd like two months ago.
Highest will be 500 Bs. from Monday, that is around 10 USD.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:28:13
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:57:35
Minimum wage was 5,200,000 Bs. That is per month.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:33:08
People buy what they can, even if it is a really small amount. A lot of store owners are doing that so. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:31:29
Ok I could buy maybe 10-20 gallons of it. And after that? Gas is not safe to store. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:56:27
Yes. Everyone could do it... What could I do with it? I am very far from the border.
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:16:19
You are welcome the bank black out started two hours ago. No pos.. no banks.. no ATM.. no online banking now 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:04:12
I am gonna leave this here: 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:59:10
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:25:13
One month. Yes, it is the minimum by law. It is illegal pay less. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:43:21
It is a good case of study. Last months some prices have been hiking even in USD so they would hike in BTC as well...
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:32:10
Yep,. That is common here if you have the place to do so.
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:16:47
It is being used, I think it is important.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:53:53
If you don't "allow" this, you go to jail, maybe they can kill you. So you have two options, stay low profile or leave the country.
There are a few US citizen held in the jail here, they are suffering for example:
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:07:07
Also there is a "legal" way of doing that. I mean the legal way would involve the government and none wants that. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:52:30
You cannot fire employees here. It is illegal to do so, one of the laws made by Chavez-Maduro. Only way is to give money to the employees so they accept to sign a quit letter.
But you got it right.. people don't know what would happen on Thursday (Monday is the day the zeroes will be knocked and the economic measures will start).
Maduro say that the government will pay the wages of all the workers in small and medium companies for 90 days until they adjust but that is, nobody knows nothing and people don't know how that could work. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:19:53
Yes, you go to a gold/silver shop they check your gold/silver and tell you how much you will get (in bolivares).
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:01:57
Mailing things is fine, with DHL. But sending cash is prohibited. Maybe you can send some bank notes inside something.. but not that amount.. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:22:28
Yes, after 4th June. Old bills won't be the legal currency.
I don't know if you will be able of shipping them as collector items after that day..
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:32:15
He is in jail under direct control of the government, so I suppose they feed him well 
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:16:33
They are using Bolivares Soberanos, that should be around 5,000,000 USD
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:06:07
That is a part. Also if you go protesting you get shoot by the police and can be taken to jail and tortured.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:24:53
It is possible. Mostly slow and old android. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:58:01
They have to survive and depend on the subsidies by the goverment.
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:53:32
If you pay with a USD credit card (VISA, MC or AMEX) the exchange rate would be around 75,000 Bs per USD. So one kilo of meat (4,500,000 Bs.) would be 60 USD. So it would be crazy to do that.
There is a exchange control over here and they have closed all the shorcuts.
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:48:08
That is around 700-800 BTC (1 USD is around 90 Bs.)
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:20:37
Even 1 USD in any crypto. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:03:45
Yes, I think a foreigner can. A 90m2 apartment is around 10-12k USD. In this place (Prebo, Valencia) 
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:58:26
it is ok, he is a goverment controller jail, i am sure he is well fed, they dont want him to starve
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:16:26
Hey man, I really appreciate it. Will spend it wisely. Thanks
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:09:49
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:46:14
Hey my friend don't attack the messenger I think petro is a scam, I just a word that "worth" the same as oil barrel. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:10:29
Thanks for the link. It is always excellent example. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:23:13
If it doesn't get stolen at customs. The answer will be yes. Buy sending money using crypto would be much better. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:11:06
Yes, but not to help the government. Just to buy food and needed things.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:36:05
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:47:34
Some people are buying bitcoin. It's true.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:21:27
And you eat babies.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:13:37
It works because a small part of the economy us subsided by the government, people try to get as much from that market (CLAP box).
But it has been less and less and all the products use the dollar as reference. 
So, for your question, I don't know how people do...!
Gasoline is really cheap here, as well as internet, water and electricty. With the minimum wage you could buy 450,000 liters of gasoline. Internet, water and electricity for a house is under 10 cents.
 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:18:32
You know exactly what is going on! Peaceful demonstration don't do nothing if the other side controls all the weapons and don't want to do anything!
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:01:10
This is not true.
One USD dollar here is around 1,300,000 Bolivares \(Bs.\).
One BTC is around 7,500 USD.
So one BTC is around 9,750,000,000 Bs.
So one satoshi is 97,5 Bs.
Check my post history.
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:03:08
@_date: 2018-08-12 19:03:20
That is the problem. Prices are like or higher than Colombia but they difference there is the minimum wage is 300 USD.
10 USD can get you 2 kilos of meat, 2 kilos of rice, some veggies and a 2 l coke. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:01:22
I have read a lot of books, I'm a not a hollow head right wing. Most of my family come from left side, so good I noticed everything was a fraud. So I know you are talking about.
This doesn't have to do anything with US. Venezuelan government is full of thieves, corrupts and incompetent people. That is the reason of everything is happening here.
Come here, work with your PDH in a Venezuelan university and earn like 15 USD per month. Live like that at least 6 months and then we will talk again.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:02:56
Some do, but I don't know if they will do an effective action someday.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:28:20
Yes, if you are ok with getting an infection. 
At baseball, soccer and basket games, people take packs of bank notes and launch them as confetti. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:35:58
No it's not. 
One kilo of rice is 1,000,000 Bs.
One kilo of chicken is 1,300,000 Bs.
Done, you spend all your monthly wage (2,550,000 Bs.) buying that.
According to CENDAS (A NGO) the minimum amount you need is 75,000,000 Bs. per month (30 minimum wages) to live "ok" 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:41:15
yes, I received some donations last month and used them to purchase food 
problem I see now, is that the goverment is "hunting" people that change cryptos to bolivares 
Solution would be more people accepting directly cryptos
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:20:05
I have received some donations in the past, but had to spend all of them buying food, you can read more about that here 
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:20:05
Yep, it is free for now.. there is no way of paying because there is no coin or banknotes so small.. I fill the tank and give 0.01 USD.. if I don't have cash I just say that and no problem.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:17:04
I think 1 Satoshi is 100 Bs. they rate shown here is the fixed rate by the government.
One usd is now around 1,000,000 Bolivares
You do the math
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:43:01
So sick man, you feel powerless
You can see prices here  
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:21:04
Petro is a scam.
It doesn't circulate in our economy.
We cannot buy it because there is no way of purchasing it with Bolivares.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:57:20
I still hope we could recover..
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:07:48
It doesn't stop getting worse.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:09:42
Maybe if they could "give" per week but that doesn't happens. It usually includes, black beans, lentils, powered milk (it's common here), sugar, mayo, corn flour, pasta and some other things. 
But it doesn't include meat, chicken, pork or eggs.
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:19:34
The only target of the petro is to avoid US santions over the goverment. But it will fail anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:17:21
I think this is much worse than Nicaragua, Nicaragua has a almost capitalist economy, there is free exchange at the streets between USD and cordobas and a lot of other things that are impossible here.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:06:08
So I repeat my question, do Venezuelans have to starve and have a miserable life, just because Maduro defies America?
Are the Venezuelan that are dead because of this tragedy, collateral damage?
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:31:52
I think it could be around 50%. Debit card are much higher.
Yes, credit card are issued by local banks. I don't know how the banks work here, honestly, they lose money if the inflation is 50% weekly and they can charge only 39% per YEAR!
Yes, you can have black credit card, VISA, MasterCard, Amex and even Dinners Club, but they won't work outside Venezuela, just in Bolivares! If you try to buy in Amazon they won't work.
Biggest banks are:
Banesco (private, currently under control by the goverment at least for 90 days)
Banco de Venezuela (owned by the goverment, was part of Santander before)
Banco Bicentenario (owned by the goverment)
BBVA Provincial (private, BBVA group)
Mercantil (private)
Citi has a branch here as well.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:16:26
Stay away from socialism and populism.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:12:05
So, we, the Venezuelan people have to suffer this economic collapse, inflation and murder rate, just because Maduro "defies" America?
Sorry, but people here now will prefer a US puppet government where then can go to the beach without having to break the bank or going able to go the street without getting murdered. Or even easier going to the supermarket and buy rice.
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:49:15
Subway , yes the sandwich restaurant. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:52:10
Yes, there is a black market that uses US D. I can use cryptocoins without VPN. But I need bolivares to pay for things here, if you own a store you must accept only bs. under the table it's another history
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:21:04
It's true, prices are in millions.
One kilo of meat is 4,500,000 Bs.
Next month government will shave off 3 zeroes from everything (it won't do anything, just psychological impact) 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:23:04
Venezuelan military is under control of the goverment, only option would be a international intervention which I don't think could happen.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:04:34
I as Venezuelan can buy anything I want from US (all I need is USD).
American Airlines is still working here. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:16:06
When I got an increase in my credit card, I went and bought as much tuna cans as I could. It was like three months ago.
Price I paid was 80,000 Bs. (Bolivares) per can.
Now the price is around 2,000,000 Bs. per can.
Credit card interest is fixed by the goverment at 39% per YEAR (Yes, Mastercard, Visa, Amex and Dinners Club have to obey that) . So it's stupid not to use credit cards.
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:52:30
Could you repeat again that the minimum wage in Venezuela is set by US war criminals? So they order Maduro? Could you explain how does that work? Does Elliot Abhrams calls Maduro and orders him to set the monthly minimum wage at 7 USD ? Is Maduro a undercover cia asset ?

Yes, people do that when they need to purchase goods here in Venezuela. Also, some people use BTC as "transit" currency. People abroad send BTC to their relatives in Venezuela and they change them to Bs. to purchase food and things.

You took for granted I was attacking the goverment. If you read my post I just explain how much Bitcoin is traded using localbitcoin considering it the really low wages. In the original post I dont blame anyone, just to be impartial.
Thanks for the personal insults.
By the way, you didn't argue anything of what I posted.
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:27:38
I haven't heard of anything like that.
Localbitcoin is used with local bank transfers, it is almost impossible to do a trade with Venezuelan bolivares cash

@_date: 2019-11-05 16:11:35
The USD is the street currency de facto, even stores managed by the government set their prices in USD. You cannot pay anything in cash bolivares because the banks only give you 50.000 Bs. per daily withdraw, it is an order set by the Venezuelan Central Bank (pro-maduro).
There is plenty of food and medicine mostly from the United States it is easier to buy members mark products than locally produced, problem now is not scarcity, problem is purchasing power the minimum wage that is set by the government of Nicolas Maduro is set to a misery of 7 USD per month. That wage is paid to all the public workers. Ironically private companies pay much better than the socialist government.
So yeah, let's blame the US and their sanctions...... 
By the way these hard sanctions have less than one year, country went downhill since 2013.
I would like you to argue something of this.
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:40:05
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:10:38
Also if you do the math with Localbitcoin:
6,932,309,904,123 Bs. / 529 BTC = 13,104,555,584 Bs. / BTC
Using 1 BTC = 7,500 USD
(13,104,555,584 Bs. / BTC) / (7,500 USD/BTC) = 1,747,000 Bs. / USD which is very close at the exchange rate of that week and very far from the fixed rate set by the government.

That is a good question. Some people are mining, government is mining.
Families abroad sent btc to their relative here in Venezuela and the relatives use lbtc to change to bolivares
@_date: 2019-08-18 19:32:53
They won't do it. Economy has been a chaos since years. Nothing they have done has worked, even 5-10 years ago.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:20:30
Most people have extra income:
They do something online to earn a few dollars.
They have a relative abroad that sends money.
They sell things don't use at home. Selling an old gold bracelet for example, gives you enough money to live some months.
They purchase things/products somehow at good price and resell then. For example, now that you mention a factory, most private companies and factory give something to they workers so they don't leave, ok we cannot pay you 500 USD per month but take 100 USD per month and take 10 kilos of flour (assuming it is a factory that produces flour) I will  pay for your meal at work and I will guarantee transport and few other benefits.
Of you work for the government or are retired you are in a pretty bad shape (like my parents) they need their family or depend to the government (which is ideal for the government) as the government sells some boxes of food (around 20 lb) for a very low price that even the people that earn minimum wage can purchase (around 40 usd cents), but this thing is used as political control. If you don't vote for me, forget the box of food.....
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:58:02
That is not true, 1M is around 70 USD (exchange rate is 1 USD = 14,300 VES)
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:50:11
It's not as easy as you said it. I'll give you some facts:
1.\- Elections were called by the government itself in advanced \(they were going to be at the end of the year\), do you think their are stupid enough to call an election without need to, if they were going to lose it?
2.\- Main opposition \(which got more than 7.3 millions votes last time they participated in an election\) called to not to participate. So a opposition victory was almost impossible.
3.\- CNE \(Which is like the main electoral institution here\) is totally controlled by the government, it should be an impartial institution. 
4.\- Maduro promised 10,000,000 Bs. bonus \(FOUR monthly wages, to put that into perspective if you live in US that would be like 6k USD\) if you voted, he didn't say that you had to vote him, but if main opposition was not participating almost the only way to go and vote was for him. People starving would vote for this reason, in a democracy this is called vote purchase. After winning, the CNE said elections were clean BUT there was not going to be any payment \(oh, after Maduro WON!???\).
5.\- According to some studies between 3 and 5 millions of Venezuelan have left the country, current population is around 32millons, so at least there are 27millions of Venezuelan here in Venezuela, 27millons of workers, professionals and normal people without a brain \(including me and my family that are still here\)?
6.\- Around 20millons of Venezuelan can vote. Maduro "got" around 6millions \(And you have to remember point 1, 3 and 4\). So he has 6millions of 20millions voters and opposition got 7.3 millions in 2013. He has 6millons of 27millions of Venezuelan.
7.\- According to the law, all Venezuelan even the ones outside the country CAN vote for the presidential election. The registry so people abroad can vote never opened and they "add" a new requirement which was not in the law, you have to be legally established in the other country. With this millions of Venezuelan living in other country weren't able to vote.

The diference between vef and VES is the amount of zeroes.
The exchange rate in vef would be 150,000,000 + 00,000 (5 zeroes were shaved ) so 15,000,000,000,000 still different from the one you posted, remember I live here

I earn much more than minimum wage and even with some tips wonderfull people send me and extra work I have done it is almost impossible saving some crypto, I always end spending almost all of them.
In the Venezuelan reddit, someone asked that question. It really depends, but most answer range around 100-150 USD per month per person. It is really low if you are from a developed country but is on par with countries like Colombia/Peru/Ecuador if you dont pay public utilities (here they are almost free when they work....)

In a country where minimum wage is around 1 usd, with an exchange control (you cannot buy and sell foreign currency) with 25,000% inflation and where the government sells around 1millon of usd each two weeks to make the country work. I think it is a respectable amount.

You have to be careful, because if they found you mine they will ask for ransom. But if so you in small scale you will be fine, you have to be in a place with at least internet and electricity (forget Zulia state for example).

Localbitcoin 05\-19\-2018 469 BTC / 3,885,616,508,983 Bs. SO 1 BTC equals 8,284,896,607 Bs.
Last week:   474  BTC /  4,913,249,752,178 Bs. 10,365,505,806 Bs.
25&amp; increase
and I think the BTC price in USD decreased during that period!
Today in LocalBitcoin 1 BTC is around 15,000,000,000 Bs.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:09:50
It is a long story but that is the fixed exchange rate set by the government. I would prefer to starve than sell usd at that rate. If I use that exchange rate I would need to sell 50 usd to buy one kilo of meat.
No one sells at that price.
See local Bitcoin for a real and street exchange rate. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:29:46
Yep, a year ago we would pay 5,000,000 Bs. for a can of Coke. After slashing 5 zeroes, it's price was 50 Bs. But one year later, because hyperinflation it costs 15,000 Bs 
So maybe 3 more zeros will be cut off soon.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:50:52
That won't work  here. If you buy a lot of Bolivares with Bitcoin you will loose money at least at 30% per month (inflation monthly rate)

Look my older post my friend.
There are empty supermarket but there are some full of products, problem is price (I really don't know how they are not looted) for example you can buy online from this one: 
Remember minimum wage is 2,500,000 Bs. per month.
I think crypto is known about for about the 10% of the population, it's my guess. BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH and ETN (Electroneum, people can "mine" them with their android cellphones and can get some dollars per month)

@_date: 2019-06-16 22:19:53
You cannot live off of 10 USD/month. That is the problem.
You could buy some cassava/yucca and sardine and eat that, also the government has a program called CLAP where they sell like 10-12kilos of food, mostly carbs at a really low price (this is used as political control).
With 10 USD per month, you cannot go to a supermarket. One kilo of meat here is around 5 USD, rice is 2 USD, flour 2 USD, cheese 3 USD and so on.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:10:31
Electricity is only offered by a state owned company same for tap water. 
Electricity and water, doesn't make sense \(they are coherent with the wage\) they are around 3,500 Bs.
Internet is offered by state owned company \(CANTV\) for 4Mb is around 12,000 Bs. There are private companies like Movistar, NETUNO and Intercable, prices are way higher 400,000\-1,000,000 Bs. for basic speed.
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:55:32

Maduro won't give up. More international pressure is needed.

It is not.
You depend from relatives abroad and send money. Also you have to have to find a way of getting money, doing work online, buying and selling things, etc.
Government sells box of food (around 20 pounds), it is supposed to be sell monthly, at a really low price... Maybe 2 usd.. rice, flour, lentils, tuna, milk, etc. But they use it as political control

It really depends, the majority is being paid in Bolivares, some in usd and a few in crypto. But people try to go usd or crypto
 Problem is when the wages are that low you cannot have anything enough purchase

Yep, so it is cheaper here. 
For example, a canned Coke produced here in Venezuela is around 1.8 usd right now.

I am sure people would vote Guaido, but for now it is impossible.

Mostly of the utilities are free or almost free. But the cost is the quality of the service. Electricity fails almost daily, internet also and water comes from the pipe like 1-2 times a week (depends on the zone), also for cooking gas.

@_date: 2019-12-09 20:23:09
What you describe was the situation for around 15 years of exchange control. But since a few months ago tecnically there is no "exchange control" and the rate set by the BCV is just a reference value. And it is very close to the street rate, most of the time under 5% the street rate and even some days OVER the street rate. So for now, it is a good indicator. 
If you come with a debit or credit card from abroad it will use that exchange rate, which is ok because a few % losses without having the hassle and risk of going to the black market will do it. 
But, we as Venezuelan have low access to that anyway. Using my debit card (Maestro) wont work with USD dollars (not because any santions by the way) and I cannot go to the bank to purchased USD in cash, technically the law allows it but if you do so, they say "We dont have any currency right now, come back later"
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:50:30

Yes, but it is really a low %.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:10:04
Dont worry asking.
Yes, people buy BTC to avoid hyperinflation. Amigo, bitcoin crash is nothing against the "Bolivar Crash". We are talking about 100% crash per month.
Yes, electricity is a problem. but anyway, we always find a way. At least with smarphones you can work with localbitcoin. Movistar keep is signal (LTE or 3G) when the big blackout happened (it lastest between 3 and 4 days), but cash is king. That is true, having money in cash (USD and even Bolivares) will be better in these chaotic situations.
People fear BTC, but like everyone else in the world. You MUST use bolivares, it is the national currency. Most of the people earn their wages in Bolivares, you go to the supermarket and pay in bolivares, cash, credit or debit, but bolivares.
Goverment has been very strict with the use of bolivares, last months they have opened a small posibility as last resort of using USD.
There is no easy way of going from bolivares to USD, in theory you could go to the bank or exchange, but here is doesnt work like that. They would say they dont have USD to change. You have to go to the blackmarket OR go crypto. 
With localbitcoin you go easily Bolivares&gt;Crypto and if you add UPHOLD for example, you go Crypto &gt; USD.

No, thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:24:24
What you said is almost true, a lot of people is private companies earn more than a minimum wage I would say 4-6 times minimum wage... Ok, that is 20-30 USD per month.  Not a lot? 
Also, in the public sector (federal employees if you are American) have these wages, ranging from 1 to 2 minimum wages, they get a box of food (mostly carbohydrates) each month that worths more than their wage. I know that because I have relatives that are like that.
Venezuelan deals with dollars and crypto because:
1. Most common reason: they have family overseas and they send money weekly 
2. You work as freelance 
3. You work remotely for a overseas company
4. You work in the few private companies that can pay you in dollar or crypto (but, as a engineer, wages are not like Colombia, Panama of course not even USA, an engineer earning 100-150 usd in a company is a good wage)

Petro is not mentioned now, even by the government. It was a failure. Some people invested and weren't able of cashing out.
It know the platform you refer, it is called patria remesas. I think they take 15%. I don't know someone using it but I'm sure some people use it, because they are Maduro supporters, ignorants or fear

Other thing is if you want to help me personally.
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:21:46
Good question, yes it is.
In fact a lot of people over 40 yo use gold and silver to survive. How?
20 years ago Venezuela was a "normal" country. So people had gold/silver rings and so on.
Now they have to sell them to buy food, fix the car and so on. In fact my parents did so with some old rings. Of course people that purchase these goods pay less than the international price.
Anyway due to insecurity at the street people dont wear anything flashy, no ring or anything gold. Thta can get you killed.

There wont be any civil war here, noone is is willing to die defending Maduro or Guaido.
The government could check these aids to be sure there aren't any weapons right?
If course the help of the US could be related to the oil.
You are totally wrong about the ethnic component.
"Currently, according to the critic D'Ambrosio and other academics,[21] about 51.6% of Venezuelans are mestizos (called Criollos: the 40% of them are with mostly white features, 20% with mostly black features and 10% with mostly Indians features), 45% are white, 2% are black and 1% Indians.
Notably, according to these scholars, is the fact that virtually there are no pure blacks in Venezuela, including those with the darkest skin, found especially in the area of Barlovento. Most of which being limited to black Venezuelans who descend from recent immigrants. Virtually the same is also said for both white Venezuelans and indigenous Venezuelans.
In addition, according to a genetic autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasilia (UNB), the composition of the population of Venezuela is: 60.60% European, 23% of Native American contribution and 16% of Africa's contribution.[10]""
And of course he could win a fair election. Capriles got 49% of the vote (according to the own Maduro government) in 2013.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:15:44
Obviously the 5 USD is rounded. The exact amount is :
18,000 Bs. / 3,202.24 Bs/USD = 5.45 USD 
I know people that has that only income monthly, no more, nothing under the table. 
You can see the minium wage here :
18.000 BS. per month
And the official exchange rate is 3,302.24 BS. Per USD. 
Now you believe ? 
@_date: 2019-04-14 14:33:29
You can see that in my first post 
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:13:56
You can check my values in CoinDance. They are accurate.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:39:05
It is not free. I mean, the price could mean free for you. But now, the "Caja Clap" is around 10,000-14,000 Bs. Ok that is like 2-3 USD but remember the minimum wage is 5 USD.
That box of food has mostly carbohydrates, like flour, pasta, rice. Podwered milk. Beans. Tuna. It is supposed to arrive at home at least monthly, but it doesn't. Also it is used as political control, if you don't support Maduro, we won't sell you the box.
These products have a real price of around 30 USD in my calculations.
You still have to buy meat, hygiene products, public transportation, etc etc etc etc

There won't be any civil war here. Weapons are under control of the government and military.
Opposition civilians are totally unarmed. You need two armed civilian sides to have a civil war and that doesn't exist here.
Also, there is no religion fundamentalist here. Only a few people would sacrificate defending someone (Maduro and Guaido).
Guaido didn't selt proclaim president, in Venezuelan constitution there is an article that says something like if the country doesn't have legitimate president , the president of the National Assembly (Like Congress, like Peloisi) MUST take oath as the president interim.
Why? Because in the last elections in May 2018, the National Assembly declared them as fraudulent and illegitimat because they were called by illegitimate organ. USA and all the other countries also said these elections we're rigged, when Maduro took office after these elections (in January), the natural reaction was to continue with their position, and not regocnizen Maduro but recognicing Guaido.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:42:33
I don't have a reason I mean it is the same, monthly wage:
18,000 Bs = 5 USD = 100,000 satoshis

Before someone asks about the petro:
The current petro is really Petro v2, first one (v1) was a scam (and V2 has several problems too....), a lot of people put money in Petro V1 and they don't know where the money is, for what I have read they have to contact the goverment and ask to exchange their V1 for the new V2.
@_date: 2018-11-05 09:27:59
Right now it is around 8 usd 
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:46:32
It is the same.
 BTC is the king.. but others are used.. dash is really popular as well..
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:27:34
Yep, my parents were paid in Petro a month ago, 0.167 petro
@_date: 2019-01-14 09:31:57
No. That number is around 200 USD per month in my opinion. Which is closer to countries like Peru and Colombia.
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:27:38
Using local Bitcoin it is safe. You pay with Bolivares bank transfer and done
People use USD and gold
That volume traded weekly is not tiny, remember minimum wage is around 6 USD per month
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:26:40
You need Bolivares to but things, food, supplies, etc
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:58:04

I don't know someone with a Ledger (usually the amount you have in crypto is very small).

I don't get your question ? In USD is it the same... 3600 USD 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:22:32
Yes, I have heard about that. Even when the 40% is just a guess.. if that % is true anyway that means around 600 btc are traded weekly by honest people.
Ahora será que esos carajos en verdad usan localbitcoin para cambiar a bolívares? Para sus gastos personales??? Noendría sentido cambiar el volumen más grande a dólares?? Esas estadísticas son solo de cambio btc - bss y viceversa.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:14:39
You could do that in local Bitcoin , but why would you do that ? You will have to burn a really big BTC volume. Also, you will sell your BTC for bolivares.. you will need a Venezuelan bank account...

Here is the reality of Venezuela 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:32:43
Hello Benji, thanks for your reply.
To be honest, right now there is a lot of food, main problem is the lag between the wages and the street prices. A lot of people get money from abroad (relatives working there) and they can but food and things.
Years ago it was like you describe even with money you aren't able of buying because there was scarcity.
Yes, it is easy to find an hamburger could be a street vendor, local chains or US chains like McDonald, Burger King and Wendys. All you have to do, is have money.
You use debit or credit card to pay, it is really hard to pay with cash (highest bill is 500 BsS. and one hamburger could be 6.000 BsS.)
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:26:15
Yes, because what you say makes sense
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:58:57
Yes, that is what people do. When I get a credit limit increase I got and max the credit card. 
Problem is the limit are really low, under 10-20 USD.
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:38:21
That makes sense. But somehow it is almost the same in USD than the rest of the world 
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:04:19

For real time price you can use this page, they  even posted their github code 
When I'm writing this, this is the exchange rate  "1 Bitcoin está alrededor de los Bs. S. 8.763.124,47"
Also if you use CoinDance data, you can divide the weekly BsS. volumen / weekly BTC volume and that will give an stimation. It wont be exact because price on Friday could be two times higher than price on Monday.

Banks still work. Credit card interest is 30% per years(VISA, MC, AMEX and Dinners Club must obey these rates).
In fact, debit and credit card are the only way of paying, with this inflation rate cash is useless.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:26:45
Monthly wage is below 100 USD. I would say monthly is around 30-40 USD per month.
It is happening exactly as you describe. But that only applies to:
People that know programming
People that know English
People have have reliable internet connection
People that have reliable electricity service
That would left a few ones. Less that  2-3% of the population.
Would you hire someone that can dissapear for several days because there is a widenation blackout? 
Where I live the government ISP is the only one available, Cooper wires were stole more than a year ago, they don't give any answer and have no interest in fixing it. I have to use a mobile hotspot to connect, each GB is 1,3 USD.  Writing this costs me a few USD cents.
You have to see the bigger panorama.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:27:06
You need BsS to pay in most of the stores.
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:25:03
Yep. At least at the time of the posting.
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:01:45
The government is the one that defines a big amount. But it makes sense if you handle 10-20 USD per month, having a transfer form nowhere without any kind of explanation 1000 USD is suspicious. If you own a store and handle that amount of money monthly you won't have problems.
Anyway since a year ago, government stopped a little chasing that. I think they left free that.
In fact now as a person you can transfer around 5k USD daily between accounts in theory you won't have any problem. 
All the amounts I call in USD are the equivalent in bolivares
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:35:27
You are looking as the same way I do even live here. Opposition lost momentum and there is a little energy to protest. The people willing to protest left the country or are resigned.
I protested but I am very pragmatic, for this kind of government protest won't do anything, they control all the police and militar forces. They just dissolve using the force any kind of protest.
Military doesn't seem to have any interest in an uprise, not even with USA/EU/Colombia/Brazil pressure or sanctions. So I see the game is locked and no easy way to solve it.
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:02:27

Even since I was a kid before Chavez government people don't trust the Bolivares, since 1983 there has been several problems with it. So everyone is very doubtful about the Bolivar since 35 years ago.
Hyperinflation started way before any US sanctions , so there you have your answer.
About the free speech I think it is midway, I could talk shit about the government with my friends, in a store, in a bank, I don't think anything will happen. But if you post really hard things in the social media or on the few free radios and TV they will "follow" you and of you cross the "line" they will get you.

First you need a visa to get into Venezuela and I don't think you can get a visa from Venezuela in the states (maybe you have to go to Mexico to get the visa there).
It is not safe, you have to have a local guide and that doesn't guarantee anything.

Electricity is free without any quota. At least in paper, but believe me if you install a mining farm at home they will notice. There is no way of keeping track, buy big loads will collapse the system and they will investigate then. It has happened before.
Downside, service sucks you are lucky if you have 2h blackouts per day, some of them reach 6-8h per day.
Gasoline in the central region is available without any quota I could go to the gas station and fill up the tank without any consequences (maybe the one that work there will notice and ask me what am I doing ).
The places near the borders with Colombia and Brazil are another history.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:57:07
In fact that is the main usage in my point of view. Much more than as method of payment

The Bolivar recovered a little during that time.

Well 10 years ago Venezuela as a traditional South American country more or less... So we have almost the same infrastructure since then.. internet is cheap if you have the state run isp, less than 50 cents per 4Mb which is a disgrace speed but at least you can use WhatsApp, read the news, use the online banking and even stream sd resolution.
People just keeps going on, and the govemrne does that is need to make that happen
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:46:30
Using 1 USD bills would be better.
USD coins are not accepted.
1000 USD would purchase the same as a country like Colombia or Peru. That is the problem, almost everything has the same price than Colombia or Peru but wages are way lower .

Exactly like that. If you want to buy meat and eggs you need bolivares. A small amount of merchants will receive crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:50:10
You get paid in bolivares. You have to pay in bolivares, by law all stores should accept only bolivares. Want bread? You have to pay in bolivares.
If you have a store and don't accept bolivares, store closed and jail for you. Of course, under the table you can accept USD or cryptos. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:13:16
Yes, that is one of the things the government does. But even expecting the box of food it is not reliable, it might or might not arrive and also what is worse they use it as political control "if you don't defend me, you won't have more boxes", believe me, when it is they only thing you have to eat you will defend them.
Basically some people "live" (I would not call that life) "free" as you said.
I think you can send money here using Western Union for example, but you will get here the Bolivares equivalent, they don't give dollars. It is hard to get them, that's why cryptos are important
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:22:42
The price in USD is the same than coin market cap. The price changes in bolivares

Giving a % is not precise in my opinion.

You can buy the fuel there is no limit or problem with that. But smuggling it if you live very far from the borders is not easy.
For people that live near the border with Colombia and Brazil, yes, that is how they survive.

Dolar today also dropped.. it was 25,000 bs per USD not it is around 20,000 bs per USD. Check by yourself
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:23:13
Yes. Even using the exchange rate set by the government, minimum wage is 2 USD per month.

Problem is here civilian don't have weapons. And people that wanted to use guns is dead, in jail or left the country. 
Maduro somehow has managed to keep perfect control of the Venezuela armed forces , they are willing to die defending him. They just don't care about economical and political santions.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:56:15
I really dont know.
My guess is that you cannot measure how to pay them using as reference the minimum wage that is like being homeless. That is the problem here, minimum wage is 2 USD but you need maybe 200-300 usd per month to survive. 
10 TIMES minimum wage is still homeless.
Selling candies at the street will give you maybe the same amount of money per month.
Usually programmers know what they worth worldwide and the prefer not to work knowing that someone will pay them 10 times lower that someone from else where. Anyway you can ask in our reddit r/vzla Im not programmer.
Remember here government gives free money (around 10 USD per month), free electricity and free public services. Doing nothing can keep you alive.
entrepreneurship  is not common because if you hire you someone you cannot fire him (like never), if you success you will be in the radar of the government and technically there is no marke in Venezuela for any product you could produce.
I repeat, the target you are referring is really small and most of the already left the country.
You have to know english+young+programmer+have reliable internet+have reliave electricity, that in Venezuela tends to 0%
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:58:16
I understand what you mean. 
People trading small amount don't have any USD account overseas so they mostly get bolivares.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:35:16
Yes, you can read about the last rising by the people by fireguns.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:55:00
Yeah, still happens. Much lower than inflation in Bs.
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:35:48
They are random.
Cash here doesn't exist. Being the highest bill 2 USD and hard to find (you cannot go to the bank and withdraw).
People use USD , Colombian pesos, euros or crypto.
But a lot of stores have battery banks or power generators too.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:34:00
It is not far from being that
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:03:58
Now I would say at least 70% even if it is 10 USD

You could get it expropriated by the government or invaded by squatters. Anyway some people are doing that and they take the risk, if everything changes someday that 50k house could be easily 200k or more

Mostly LocalBitcoin, Uphold and AIRTM. There arent any ATM

They are the main responsible of this situation

Not by email. That is what crypto are for.

A beer could range from 40 cents to 1,5 USD. Here tacos aren't sold , they are not common. Arepas, hotdogs and hamburgers are common street food. A street hot dog could be around 1,5 USD

Yep, not everyone. And they use it as political control. Anyway it is not technically free. It is around 25 cents
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:59:00
Doctors, policeman, teachers are around 10 USD per month.
Inflation hasn't stopped it is around 50% per month.
One USD was 25,000 bs weeks ago now it is around 22,000 bs per USD
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:47:04
Yep, it is exactly like that... I think you need like 150-200 usd per month to "live" ... If you live alone .. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:21:50
People won't. Even if 1,000,000 died government won't release the power. They would rather die defending their revolution.
Anyway if you count the people that have been killed because murdered, kidnapped, lack of medicine and health, and died in older protests against the government , the number could reach easily 300.000 lives.
And yet they are in power. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:07:15
Maybe 2 USD ?

Localbitcoin is one of the most used ways. Bolivares to btc

@_date: 2019-09-22 13:59:17
I think there is ignorance about that. Most people I know use online wallet and just have the "send" option.... Localbitcoin, uphold and airtm are used as wallets
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:35:54
Yep. I believe in that. You cannot set prices for anything.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:07:19
No, because that is one of the problems. Food has prices as if you lived in Colombia where minium mothly wage is around 300 USD.

Thinking about your question, I dont know if it can be called a failed state because people still follow the law or the rules. If you steal in a supermarket the police will catch you, if you do a U turn and a police is there you will be stopped.
It is really hard to explain.

If you don't get killed. It is not safe

By law banks cannot restructure their previous loans. So, yes, everyone paid off their car and house loans. One of the advantages.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:04:53
Some people mine, anyway to mine you need a initial investment that almost no one has. 
Electricity is free but unreliable. 4-6 h blackouts are common even in the big cities.
Also if you do big scale mining you become a target of the government
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:03:37
Search indigotraveller in YouTube. He visited the country weeks ago.
It is not safe. Here some people manage to "live" with that.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:46:43
Internet sucks, cheap internet that people can afford has a limit speed 6Mb/s (It is a government ISP). It is ADSL, for example where I live, copper wires were stolen more than a year ago and they wont fix it. 
Where copper wires havent been stolen, it is slow, sometimes fails and it usually drops.
There isnt another ISP available here. I have to use a hotspot, price is 1,25 USD per Gb. Just posting this costs me some cents (remember monthly minimum wage is 2 USD)
Also, electricity is unreliable and there are daily blackouts. They could last several hours.
I think this answers your question.
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:55:21
Yes but you need a computer, internet connection, reliable electricity and English knowledge. Not common here
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:33:32
Wow thanks for the comment. In fact, one of the things the government uses to control people is by the economy and hunger.
We have a say here that is like "a dog would not bite the one that gives its food", prices are crazy but the government gives to the poor people something called " Clap boxes" which are a subsidized box of food that makes sense with the monthly wage. A box of food that could last one week on a family of 4, is sold by the government at 600,000 Bs. ( Remember monthly minimum wage is 5,000,000 Bs.) , The price of that box in the stores could reach 30,000,000 Bs.
If you have another way of income, by working online, getting payment in crypto and so on, you don't depend by the government, so you are independent. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:13:02
There are some stores that accept Bitcoin. You can sear traki and pundix that is a department store that uses a POS that accept Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:06:12
You should invest also in personal security so you don't get killed. 
A nice house in Caracas could be around 50k
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:07:01
Yes, that is common. Anything, since food to clothes.
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:25:25
Maybe 6-8 months? Something like that
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:11:13
Petro was a failure. People still use bolivares. I mean , simple places have to accept it. Only detail is that the amounts are crazy high. A bottle of water is 15.000 Bs.
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:10:06
Your budget depends what do you do. If you earn minium wage you can purchase 2-3 things and have to wait for the box of food of the government.
Here electricity (when it works) is free, tap water too (when it works) and so on.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:19:08
Sadly the ones that earn 2 USD cannot not much with cryptos. And, a lot of people earn that amount of money.....
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:30:45
Government stopped showing accurate data years ago. Last time what they did was consider as people working, all the people even the ones selling things at the street. They try to hide everything.
One loaf of bread for sandwiches is around 35.000 Bs (holsum is the brand).
Thanks for your interest!
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:33:14
You can own land. Private property still exists (which a risk of being invaded, but in the last year's it hasnt happened )
Prices are really low. A apartment in a really good place in Caracas could be 30k USD. 
See indigotraveller YouTube videos

In fact that is one of the problems. As it is free, if they are an abnormal usage they will come to check and you will get problems if they find out you are mining, they are not crypto expert but they know the mining machines produce money and you know what could happen when policeman and electricity workers know that and have a wages under 10 USD per month....
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:46:36
Yes. Exactly.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:03:07
You got it right. Now you understand the size of the crisis we are into. Right now one minimum wage only last for 12 eggs.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:51:55
That one I say (50 USD /montj) is the highest being employed. 
The "Venezuelan Engineering College" suggest the following wages:
10 years experience is around 12,000,000 Bolivares, which using the unofficial exchange rate is like 17 USD. Using the government fixed and controlled exchange rate (which it's almos impossible to obtain, supply is really low) that is 200 USD.
So I would supposed average is around 5 minimum wages.. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:09:51
People have someone here in Venezuela that can do that... If you pay well you can have some kind of security... Paying policies, lawers and so on... I know people is doing that... Is like buying in the dip hehe
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:44:55

Fucking liars!

A 650 USD wage in Venezuela puts you in the less than 5% of the population I think , or even less
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:01:03
Only if you have big contacts inside the goverment, volia, you found the way people at the government is getting rich!
Real exchange rate at the streets is between 300,000 / 400,000 Bs. / USD, see how crazy is the market... there is a 25% spread in the exchange rate....
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:10:14
People that save some satoshis want price to sky rocket lol
Price needed here is around the same that Colombia , Peru... 200-300 usd per month. That is the main problem here
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:01:42
Very hard to do so. It is illegal to ship banknotes. eBay has some of them.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:16:53
I think it is safe... But there is another way.. receiveing the crypto in a uphold wallet... Moving it to usd card.. then moving the USD to airtm then exchanging them there to Bolivares
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:16:19
Yes as a big chunk of the Venezuela population.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:37:38

@_date: 2018-04-22 20:37:01
What is relevant in your opinion?
Best private company in the country (Polar) pays like 20 times minimum wage to their managers. Guess what? It is less than 50 USD / month..
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:23:57
That is the problem. Cost of living is around the same than Colombia or Peru, where wages are around 300 USD per month

You need to have bitcoin, but also you need a Venezuelan bank account (With Bolivares), where you can receive the Bolivares after selling bitcoin.
1 Bitcoin is around 3,000,000,000 VEF (Bolivares).

For now crypto is a way to fight inflation, but mostly in the end you have to go fiat and the pay.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:44:15
Fiat is dead here, people prefer to save in potatoes than in bolivares.
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:52:01
Coindance also checks local Bitcoin cash statistics
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:02:14
Sorry but I have to post this again...
Living in Venezuela right now inside a inflation process.
Since I posted this, exchange rate went from 1 USD to 200.000 Bolivares to 1 USD to 600.000 Bolivares
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:23:33
Under the table there are some shops accepting it. Problem with here there is a fixed exchange rate USD to Bolivares, so technically it is a way to avoid that control and then it not legal.
Mostly young people and middle and high class. 
You can read my my old posts
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:25:09
Exactly.. you have to use bolivares to buy things, If you see my post in the litecoin sub Reddit I explain that...

@_date: 2018-04-08 20:09:56
Yes, that's exactly like that. McDonalds has tried to lower their prices using local products but the quality is not that good. French fries aren't imported anymore and the potatoes that grow here have a good taste but they don't get as crispy as the imported one. They even sold the hamburguers with fried cassava and fried arepas.
Burger King, Subway, Wendys, Quiznos, Papa Johns, Domino and KFC have higher prices than McDonald. People save money just to get an ice cream there......

@_date: 2018-07-22 14:23:37
A year ago people went to the street with sticks, rocks and tires a lot of people. 160 killed by the government. And Maduro is still the president.
Civil population here doesn't have fireguns and the government controls all the police, army, justice and every institution that has power.
If I were to go outside and start protesting, blocking the streets in less than 5 minutes the Army would come and arrest me if I confront them they would shoot me to dead.
Would you give your life knowing that would not make any difference?

Yes, well it takes time to get here (around 20 years, but in fact it really got worse like 5 years ago) but in a history of an country is not that much time....
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:55:41
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:24:29
I live here and I think it's correct. 
There isn't (well technically there is, but it's very small and non-competitive exchange rate is fixed under the street rate) legal market forex, so people go USD &gt; BTC &gt; VEF, even big companies.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:23:51
Thanks, English is not my first language
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:01:13
As Venezuela I approve your comment, it's on point.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:07:55
That is true, you could live farming on OSRS.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:53:08
Kinda, LocalBitcoin is known and people know about "mining" because electricity is almost free, but it's not clear if it's legal do to or not (miners have been raided and sent to jail before) 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:00:46
Yes, they want to control the miners. They have raided some of them. Because it is a form of avoiding the government control..
But now they launched their our crypto to try to avoid us sanctions
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:49:19
Thanks. I'm here had some internet problems (very common here )
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:11:02
Petro looks like a scam.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:39:19
First you need to know someone here and trust him/her. If you purchase an apartament in a  medium class zone in Caracas and Valencia, chances of being assaulted or have people go inside are lowers because these apartament have gated security and a main entrance. Also no one has to now the actual owner doesn't live here, you need someone to go there some days and pretente that someone lives here... That is... But if has to be someone you can trust because if it is anyone he can sell you and won't leave the apartament
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:47:20
 I think both, of course USD is known.. easier to convert into Bolivares...
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:57:37
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:43:02
These prices uses the government fixed exchange rate which is not possible to get, so people go to the black market exchange market. A 70 sq m apartment in a good area in Valencia is around 8-15k USD. Anyway it is impossible to buy if you make that amount of money, there comes the government as savior giving social houses and apartaments for free. 
People in their 30 yo is still living with their parents, even married....... 
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:11:04
Hello, living something like that right now....
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:56:35
Petro is a scam 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:21:34
I see, that data can be gathered using 
If you switch to BTC, you can get the exchange rate BTC/VEF
For example,
Last week:
VEF: 1,744,669,000,000
BTC: 663
1 BTC equals 2,756,191,153
The week before:
VEF: 890,524,000,000
BTC: 350
1 BTC equals 2,544,354,285
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:23:27
Polar does if you do overtime. When the USD was at 200,000 Bs. a month ago I know a friend in Valencia and she was earning around 8,000,000 Bs. So 40 USD at the time.
I know other places where they pay amounts like that. But it is not common or the majority
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:43:24
Where ? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:46:20
I think I can understand. But the USD/BTC price here is the same that Coinmarketcap shows for example.
The only one that changes is the USD/VEF the rate is crazy!
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:29:12
I'm not starving, let's say I'm ok.. I mean I eat every day, have internet and some things.. Most people are really worse...!
But here you can read,
(All the amounts are outdated...)
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:12:47
Well it's true but I think it also has to do with ignorance and incompetent. Evo Morales (Bolivia), Rafael Correa (Ecuator) and EVEN Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua) share the same "socialist" ideas than Chavez/Maduro and see the economic and social indicator of these countries, right now they are MILES ahead Venezuela.. And they don't have oil like Venezuela has......
Don't get me wrong, I don't like Chavez/Maduro but I would prefer a POS like Daniel Ortega or Evo Morales.....
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:44:49
I really don't understand.
You need 45,000 for a kilo of cheese, seller only accepts Bolivares.
You have Bitcoin, you sell your Bitcoin so you get
45,000 bs and go and buy the cheese
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:19:10
They need to buy things and to pay you need Bolivares, aka fiat
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:00:48
Venezuela: hold my beer....
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:48:43
Very dangerous.
There aren't direct flights between Venezuela USA. You still could come using a connection but I wouldn't recommend it
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:25:14
It is hard to do so. Best bet is to use the average price of the week.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:01:50
Majority of the people are trying to not starve
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:38:28
It is hard to explain. I suppose internal transfers between exchanges are widely used.
Anyway, if you go the localbitcoin path, today you will get around 6100 Bolivares per each usd.
If you are abroad and want to send money to your families and relatives using the "legal" way (Western Union) the rate is around 5300 Bolivares, so you can easily pay a 15% fee and still have better rates using localbitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:22:17
Did you read the PDF in the op?
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:25:14
Sometimes it is used directly without going to fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:35:23
Months ago I would say there was fear of using cryptos. But now I dont think it could be a problem.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:10:22
I won't !
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:13:40
People use they money asap.
Cash is hardly used
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:25:56
Of course, national currency is worthless and volatile/
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:30:13
If you send 5 usd the fees are really low
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:38:57
1. Black market is easy. Anyway the difference between official and black market is very low now.
2. No, you would have to use something like Airtm.
3. Usd, euros, canned food, houses, cars.
4. Mostly to save and buy things. Dash has a strong presence here.
6. You wait, I mean if you send 5 with btc network the fee is low anyway
7. Nothing safe
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:25:36
People do use other cryptos. But I dont think so much, BTC is the leader
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:55:18
I must do if I want to buy food.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:37:15
Maduro has some kind of support. Yes.
And there are people starving too. Everything is relative.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:36:50
Sometimes people here do like that. But usually as we fear, prices are fixed in USD and then converted into BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:16:59
Website using bank transfers. It wouldn't be safe to meet the people in person.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:57:16
Well, I dont judge them. They are a company that needs to make profit and people is free to use or not them.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:12:13
People is afraid because the government chases people that doesn't use bolívares 
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:08:56
Around 12,000 Bs
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:22:51
Works here in Venezuela?
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:46:42
Yes it happens, in fact I don't have landline because of that.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:07:10
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:57:03
I have heard about Paxful but I don't have experience with it 
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:28:20
Well it is a price you have to pay... Btc is more popular anyway 
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:56:41
People is used with that difference.
You have to remember here with the inflation a 20% price difference seems like a steal
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:55:35
Using localbitcoin is really easy using Bolívares Soberanos
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:16:55
Thanks my friend. Hope this year will be better at least when it comes to economy.
Happy new year
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:56:28
Yes, it is for now
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:32:04
I understand the fee problem, but I suppose if around 1,200 BTC are traded weekly in Localbitcoin Venezuela according to Coindance, these people dont care about the fees, right? If they cared, they wouldnt use it, do you think that?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:23:23
People just use it. The local Bitcoin volume backs my theory.
See things here work different, if you want cash (like Bolivares bills) you have to pay 50%, if you want 12.000 bs in cash (around 2 usd) you can pay 18.000 bs in bank transfers.
No, the banks don't have enough cash.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:34:50
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:27:49
Will check it
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:07:25
Thanks 
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:26:51
Not yet..
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:16:26
Petro v2 is used as payment for some things in the government, but not as crypto just as money pegged to that crypto.. one petro v2 is around 60 USD..
Even this government can fix the economy, of course it would be better if the government changes
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:28:15
There are flights from Caracas to Panama, Madrid, Paris, Istanbul, Lisboa.
Heck American Airlines was here like 2 months ago
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:27:46
It is a constant cycle. Everytime there is a wage increase it stays for a few days and the it goes don't. In 2012 is was more than 200 usd per month which was ok for latin america 
Heck even in August it was over 30 usd per month.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:24:20
Government wont allow that and you specially if you are American.
You could end in a jail like Joshua Holt
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:38:10
Localbitcoin, Airtm and Uphold.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:27:31
People is doing because you need dying currency to buy food and pay public transportation and so on.
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:48:40
Usually people get paid here each two weeks. If you want to save, you go to localbitcoin and find a trader and get the BTC (cash is scarce here so it works with bank transfers).
If you can to get the cash back, well it the same but backwards.
People abroad send some BTC to their relatives in Venezuela and they change them to BsS to buy things and there are the miners that need to cash out.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:29:12
Which chart?
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:49:48
Yes, maybe. Remember this country is not safe, still you can get a ticket with AA Miami-Caracas. I live in Carabobo state.
Are you american?
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:25:37
Because they don't believe in that. It is against them
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:30:56
People here don't care about the price it is just an instrument.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:15:44
Yes, YouTube works here. Usually they main volumen of btc is exchanged in BsS. to pay for food
I think the crypto with widely use in stores is dash, they have an agressive campaign here even with billboards in the highways.
It is accepted in PapaJhons, KFC and Subway here 
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:04:37
You could
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:40:52
I  think they stay there or go to uphold/ airtm
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:49:22
People just don't care I suppose. People here is used to pay fees for everything
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:43:17
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:46:50
People under 30-35 years is aware of crypto.. yes dash has a huge presence
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:15:55
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:21:34
Thanks for your support
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:33:29
In theory maybe 100,000 Bs. Buy that is when corruption comes in
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:09:51
No. Even in the black market is happening. Take as example the Bloomberg link I posted 
In September 5th one cup of coffee was 35 BsS. which at that moment was around 0.35 usd ( black market exchange rate was around 100 BsS. Per USD)
Last update was December 5th one cup was 400 BsS. And the exchange rate that day was around 550 BsS./USD so 0.72 usd
Usd price increased more than 100% in 3 month
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:41:18
Well a rought estimated would be using 3800 usd per btc during that week .. that is around 6,000,000 usd..
It might sound a little but remember how much is minimum wage is 
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:29:20
Thanks 
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:33:34
Yes, runscape is popular for doing so.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:01:16
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:34:24
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:11:44
The tipping point in my opinion happened weeks ago, people don't care.
But still,it is not easy to make people over 40 yo thing of using btc 
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:52:41
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:35:56
I am not sure but I don't think dash moves 8millons usd per week as btc is doing only in local Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:52:08
Thanks!!!
