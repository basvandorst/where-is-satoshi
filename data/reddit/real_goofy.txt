How old is that photo? They couldn't spend like 10 minutes to update the photo to reflect current prices??

So GDAX is more for trading and Coinbase is more for purchasing/selling?

Thank you all for the replies :) 
Is there a way to link your GDAX account and Coinbase account?

I mean my main reason behind it is because there are more live updates on it like woth different trades, buys, etc. And coinbase seems to have been having issues lately due to high volume so I was considering a switch

I'm not sure if there is a clear answer to this, but what caused a big drop in BTC, LTC, and ETH yesterday all around the same time?

Where could I learn more about limit and stop?

Thank you! Are there buy/sell fees with GDAX?

Hi! So I was wondering if someone could explain to me the advantages (or disadvantages) of using GDAX over Coinbase. I currently have Coinbase as my exchange but I am considering switching as I am becoming more serious with crypto trading. Thoughts? Thanks for the help in advance!!

Would you have to buy a certain amount or is it like coinbase where you can buy any amount? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really curious about the whole matter

This may be a very dumb question but what's the difference between coinbase and gdax? Are they just different means of acquiring cryptocurrency?
