10$/day * 22 work days a month * 12 months = 2640$ per year
I don't know where you got 28 years, also as if paying a house with a single income is worse off than paying a house off today in 30 years with 2 incomes.
Inflation is really bad for the average person as real wages simply have not kept up with cost of living.

This data is stupid.
1. People used Bitcoin-Qt as their main wallet in 2013, not the case today.
2. People were more likely to download Bitcoin-Qt and run it for sheer curiosity and learning, also not the case today. Bitcoin has grown in utility, and has become less of a hobby. People actually use services such as Purse and Overstock along 100s of other things.
3. 2013 was also the year of the big "bubble" which drew massive mainstream coverage which flaunted millions of people to download the client.

After rising 10000%.. Stop spreading lies in the form of half truths.

The fact that he chooses to keep certain information away from the audience. The fact that Bitcoin had risen about 10,000% between 2010 - early 2014. 
While what he said was "true," it is still a half-truth as it doesn't describe or depict the entire picture. 
One can alter realities in just about anything through means of half truths and selecting certain information to include and what not to include.

The US stock market crash will follow soon after. Dow Jones has doubled in 7 years.

Stop spreading FUD man, you sound like an idiot.

Why do we run two critical services on the same server? These are both very important sites and web services related to bitcoin. 
Can we move it onto another server?

Ooh pretty lines.

None of those are directly related to bitcoin itself.

Bitcoin is already money. What "type" of money do you want to convert it to? Euros, dollars, pounds, rubles, gold?

Ah fantastic! Thanks!

He said bought a million bitcoin, not a million dollars worth of bitcoin.

No he can't. Gates is still largely invested in all over the place, primarily Microsoft. If he were to convert all of his shares to dollars to acquire, all respective stocks he controls will plummet driving his wealth down.
Market capitalization is tricky. Tldr, Bill Gates wealth in regards to a dollar amount is always in a floating state. Read about liquidity and liquidization.

Earning money* not making money.

Maybe he was referring to that same gas station attendant Socrates?
Stop being an ass.

Because those are dumbed down while 30 years ago that was not the case.
