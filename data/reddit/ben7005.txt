Dude, I wasn't trying to say anything about Luke-Jr's sexuality. Honestly, I had no idea he was gay. I don't care. He's still a dick for completely separate reasons.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:44:07
What's that noise?
I think it was a joke sailing above my head a few comments ago
:/ whoops
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:10:00
nope, I'm very much in favor of gay rights
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:25:36
Bad argument, but a good way to get people to read your post. Luke-jr does really suck a lot.

You can tho. 1 satoshi (the smallest possible nonzero amount of bitcoin) is 0.00000001 BTC. Any integer multiple of 1 satoshi can be sent in any transaction, for example, 2300 satoshi = 0.000023 BTC.

Or you might lose an entire $100. As a high school student, that's a large chunk of my net worth.

wow fuck luke-jr

Lol that's like saying "nigger" is just a name used to describe a group of people with similar skin color. It has other connotations obviously.

You tossed together science words into a word salad that makes absolutely no sense. Then you wrapped it up by saying you know this isn't actually scientific knowledge and is just magical thinking on your part.
I'd explain which parts of your comment are wrong, but it's almost literally every claim you make, and at this point I can't think you're acting in good faith. Hint: you may have convinced yourself that you understand advanced physics without ever having studied it but it's easy for people who actually do have a basic understanding of physics to tell you're speaking out of your ass. For example, no one who understands what physical dimensions are would use the phrase "the 5th dimension" here. Why? You'd be able to tell me if you'd ever obtained a solid understanding of classic mechanics, for example. Or even just linear algebra.
Your comment is exactly as shitty as people who spread dumb nonsensical bullshit about bitcoin online, misinforming others while patting themselves on the back.

This is a common misconception, but quantum entanglement does not allow for faster-than-light communication. In fact, it's *never* possible for information in the universe to propogate faster than c, as far as we know. Quantum mechanics is confusing: entanglement does mean that particles can, in some vague sense, "influence each other" faster than light, but it's physically impossible to use that to transmit information.
This kind of thing gets upvoted every time it's mentioned on reddit because it seems exciting and possible with an extremely-layman understanding of entanglement. I don't mean to disparage you for posting this but I do feel the need to correct it whenever I see it, so people don't repeat the same misinformation.

Bitcoin is a technology. It's not supposed to be used for the advancement of any particular ideology. It's supposed to be used to transfer money.

Yup, welcome to where no one has taken econ 101 but everyone has a deeper understanding of macroeconomic policy than any professional economist.

Tbh I don't understand the relevance of what you said to what I was talking about so most likely I was unclear; I'll try to elaborate. I'm not saying people shouldn't have opinions about banks or the fed or whatever. But people spout off grade A bullshit about the financial system all the time here and get upvotes, which is both absurd and unfortunate in that it enables a feedback loop of misinformation. It's like if someone on the street says "bitcoin is dangerous cause what if someone hacks your coins!!" and that fear spreads through society until everyone inherently distrusts bitcoin. Obviously they're wrong (in the sense that it's really hard to brute force someone's private key) and that misinformation could be corrected by a quick google search, but no one cares to put in those few seconds of research. Likewise, people who read this thread may leave with the unfortunate misunderstanding that a currency can be viable without being a store of value, and that's just wrong (unless you're using a different definition of the word "currency", which should then be explicitly stated). I'd hope that comments which present false/misleading statements like that would be downvoted (as is the point of the voting system), but it rarely happens. Opinions aside, this sub is factually wrong all the time and it's actively harmful for people trying to learn.

He's a cool guy but this is like claiming to be a nuclear physicist after taking intro to classical mechanics; it's just obviously nonsense. I think most people have a poor understanding of what mathematicians actually do, and so it's easy to believe that you are one if you like math. But I'd be willing to bet, for example, that the Woz doesn't know the definition of the homotopy groups of a pointed topological space (something I'm pretty sure every single mathematician alive could explain in their sleep).

Yo, thanks for bringing the facts. I'm in no way an apple fan, but I can't deny that Apple Pay is way more secure than Google Wallet or PayPal.
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:33:13
Good for you, I guess?

What's wrong with that intro? It's a very concise and accurate 1-sentence description of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:02:39
Bitcoin should be used as a currency, not a speculative hoarding tool.

I buy loose tea from a "fancy" tea shop, so the price is definitely greater than in a supermarket. I'm sure I could get 100 Lipton tea bags for about $5.

In the US, I could get a cup of good quality coffee for $0.75, but good tea (my morning beverage of choice) is around $2 a cup for me. I wish I lived in England.
Note: Both of these figures indicate scenarios in which I would buy tea/coffee bulk retail and brew the drink myself.
