nope, they have the audacity to take my coins, so i'd rather cut my losses now and go somewhere else

i dont disagree with that, but at the same time as you said, 
"It would be nice if they sent an email saying you're going to be billed but they're a business and they're eager to take any easy money, especially stuff like that"
they could be respectable, but they choose to be greedy

im more of a passive trader, i prefer to catch the big swings than the micro ones, but you are right. im choosing paper

read my comments above. I directly quote his article, and refute his points based on logic and reason. And i was at a [0] while writing it
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:06:48
For example (and the reason why I left - i posted (sorry for the shameless self-plug) this 2 nights ago -  ), as you stated, cavirtex handled the dormant account activity fee very poorly, and your post today clearly shows that you and the cavirtex team are ready to take a step to fix things that havent been implemented appropriately
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:50:37
they responded. they will close the account via ticket
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:43:08
Hi Kyle, glad to see your post. Unfortunately I have just closed my account with cavirtex, and have opened one up at VoS. It would be great if you can help make cavirtex more accountable for its actions. maybe one day I (and potentially many others that have left) might reconsider signing back up. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:44:49
just for clarity and accuracy, i checked my cavirtex transactions. my first transaction was april 2, 2013, my last was may 1st 2013, where i withdrew the last of the funds in the account (i.e. had a zero balance). i then made that deposit feb 22, 2014, and the inactivity fee was charged on june 1, 2014

His arguments are wrong on many levels. 
"Credit card companies compete wildly based on customer benefits, from purchase protection to hotel and airline points. Yes, there may be a fixed annual fee and you'll pay high interest if you don't pay off your bill every month, but you can make out much better with a credit card than with Bitcoin if you do pay your bills. And if you use the credit card enough, the value of the benefits drowns out the fixed annual fee."
Comparing bitcoin to a credit card is like comparing cash to a credit card. Bitcoin is not a credit based system. Thats not to say that it cant have credit involved in the process, but its like cash - you have to have some sort of entity that is willing to provide you with credit as a service. I also love the fact that he adds the huge caveats to the credit card system, yet doesn't count that towards his argument.
"If I pay with a credit card, I'll get a bill for $100 later, Acme will get $100 less the discount (the fee paid to the bank), so probably about $98. If I buy with Bitcoin I have to go to my wallet, like Coinbase, and pay $101 to get $100 of Bitcoins, the extra $1 going to Coinbase, and pay the Bitcoins to Acme. Hopefully, the price of Bitcoin hasn't swung in the meantime to the point that $100 isn't enough anymore."
While correct, you forgot the $100+/year for your annual credit card payment (depending on the card you have). Plus you forgot to add the value of the interest for the payments you miss which you stated above. So while your short term payment is $100, your long term makes it significantly more expensive. Thats the beauty of credit cards. they make you think you're winning, when in fact they are.
"For me the transparency aspect also argues against Bitcoin. This stuff is confusing, and adding in the complexity of the exchange rate doesn't help matters."
You're mixing up two things here. Transparency vs. your own ignorance. Clearly you have no interest in bitcoin by saying, "I'll admit it, I've never used Bitcoin." How about you take a second to learn about the thing you are slandering, maybe then you'll realize that the blockchain is a ledger of all transactions, and there are many tools out there that you can use to search through it very easily.
"Banks want your money because, while they have it, they can make money on it. What about a Bitcoin wallet company? Are they banks? Can they loan out the coins in your wallet? Without some sort of scheme like this they can't afford to offer discounts or benefits like the credit cards offer."
Depends on the company. This is like the third-party entity i mentioned earlier. it's up to you to trust a company like this with your bitcoins. just remember that bitcoin is based on the idea that you inherently trust nobody. And that last sentence just sounds like a stereotypical American (note i said stereotypical, not typical) - "I want my free stuff, now." Ever heard of the credit crunch? didn't think so. Also, banks want your money because then they can control you as well. C.R.E.A.M.
"It might get better once the system gets as organized as it is with cash and credit cards, but then what's the benefit of Bitcoin? If you're going through a bank it's not like you're anonymous. Institutions like that are heavily regulated and obligated to keep an eye on what you're doing with your money."
Again, because you haven't done the research, you don't understand the concept. The idea behind bitcoin is that YOU are your own bank. So your last 2 sentences are correct, but you havent taken the time to understand the concept. And again, you're hinting at the previous statement - whats the point of the system if I can't get free stuff out of it. You fuckin freeloader.
"The gee-whiz coolness of the Bitcoin algorithm may end up being valuable somehow, but as a currency, the value proposition to the average person just isn't there."
Thats because you're one of the ignorant masses that wants everything spoonfed to you, and if there is something that you dont understand, you immediately get scared of it and decide its not for you. Take a second to stop being a fucking moron, a learn something.

no, they wont charge you for the previous months if your account was sitting for the 5 months. they charged because they discourage the use as a wallet. and i'm fine with that. what they did wrong was 1: they changed the definition of a transaction, and 2: they didn't inform me that the one year time period was up, and that they were going to start charging, they just took the coins out of my account and told me after the fact
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:56:10
clearly you're a cavirtex supporter, and thats fine. in my opinion, i felt that cavirtex handled the situation inappropriately, and to me i prefer not to do business with a company that is that greedy. as i said in my post, i prefer to cut my losses and deal with companies that show respect for the services they provide. so i chose not to open a support ticket. you have a problem with that, then thats your problem.

How Bitcoin ~~Could Become~~ Became The Internet Of Money
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:17:15
im not devastated, just frustrated. 
and i didnt bash them, not once did i state an ad hominem attack on them, the only negative thing i said was i mistakenly trusted them. When they decided to tell me they were taking coins out of my account AFTER they had already done it, instead of giving me notice that this will  occur in a certain time period unless there are certain actions i must take, i consider that not trustworthy. 
and i dont think you understand the term "doing business". you even mentioned that im paying fees. I'm paying fees for a service they are providing, i.e. trading, so yes, in fact i am conducting business with them.
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:38:22
as i stated above, i had originally used the account to make deposits a long time ago (i made 3 deposits between march-june 2013), and had withdrawn all of that to different places (other exchanges i.e. btc-e, paper wallets, etc.). So between approximately end of june/early july 2013-feb 2014, the account was empty. then in feb 2014, i made that deposit into the account. 
and i appreciate your request for validation from other sources, i agree that this can potentially seem like a competitor to falsely make a claim here. i assure you i am not, and i too would love to see a response from cavirtex, whether it be via email or forum here. i have sent them a ticket stating to close my verified account, i will post what they respond with. (note, in my request to close the account, i did not give a reason why, i am curious to see if they will even bother to ask why).
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:29:22
good question. i opened a ticket stating i wanted to close the account. we'll see where it goes from there
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:22:05
i dont disagree that automated systems can make mistakes, but this clearly isnt a mistake, this is standard business practice. and the fact that when the announcement was made 6-7 months ago as stated by mokahless in this thread, and that a significant number of users stopped using cavirtex because of it shows that it is standard business practice. 
and i dont think im acting irrationally either, money was taken out of my account without my permission, or knowledge that it was going to happen. that is irresponsible on the part of the business, and i chose from that point on not to interact with them. call that irrational if you want, i think that its quite the opposite, its a logical decision. they're now stating that they are going to take money out of my account consistently until they drain it to zero, i'd prefer it if that doesnt happen.

not if you're broke (also credit unions and places like money mart can substitute for banks, especially in terms of cashing cheques, so technically you wouldnt need to)
