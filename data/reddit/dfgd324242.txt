to some extent the ETFs will attract investment that would otherwise have gone directly into bitcoin and had a price impact on the bitcoin exchanges.. by capturing an increasing amount of that investment flow in ETF shares brokers will be able to credit client accounts with ETF shares that they didn't actually buy and thus don't have any effect on the price.. the same could happen now at bitcoin exchanges except it would be illegal because the exchanges are not licensed fraudsters.

you're probably better off with xe.com, currencyfair.com or transferwise.com for something like this.. or tbh, just withdraw cash from an ATM, it'll only cost around 3% - which is probably less than you'd pay to exchange in and out of BTC.

I guess the thing to understand is that kraken has hundreds of thousands of customers and they don't charge much in fees - for example your $5k of business is probably worth around $20 in exchange fees to them.. there's a good chance that their expediting of your ticket (being handled by two support reps seemingly) has already caused them to make a small financial loss on dealing with you :p These exchange companies don't charge enough fees to answer the phone or do anything other than bare bones support.

There's no guarantee that the broker actually bought any ETF shares on your behalf.. they might just add a new line entry to your account and you'd never know. Or maybe they did buy the ETF share from someone, but it's held at another bank that lied and doesn't really have it either. Basically there is no end-to-end transparancy to map the line entry in your brokerage account to some bitcoin (or even to an actual ETF share) and there can be a huge list of parties involved behind the scenes any of which may be lying (or to be more polite have inconsistent records) and none of which may necessarily be the ETF administrators or whatever companies they employ to hold their BTC private keys.

If you compare the market caps all gold is only ~358 times larger than all bitcoin.

yes, it would certainly be convenient of bhutan would allocate the BTC code, or at least reserve it.

well the minimum wage in california is $10.50.. I imagine their support reps make more than that.. and you had two of them for a few minutes.. now I'm sure it didn't take them an hour.. and maybe not even half an hour but I expect they have other costs as well (desk space, health insurance etc). Certainly kraken would like that you don't just buy and withdraw as active trading is how they make their money, but really most clients don't make them much profit and if they're difficult in any way (even if it's not their fault) it's probably better to not have them as clients.
