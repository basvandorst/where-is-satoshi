Let's run the math on that statement: 
$50 equates to roughly 1/5 of a Bitcoin at today's price. 
It's recommended the average American needs $2m to retire comfortably.
Bitcoin would need to jump to $10,000,000/Bitcoin in order for that $50 investment to "cover your retirement".
In order for Bitcoin to hit $10m/Bitcoin, the total market cap for Bitcoin would be $210 Trillion, or 12.52x current us GDP.

And by JPMorgan, I'm assuming you mean Chase Bank, since JPMorgan's banking side has gone by Chase since they merged in 2000.
But no, this story totally checks out as legit, and you are totally in the industry....*wink wink*

But couldn't those Statist Shills just have 1/10th of one of their Monthly Shill Checks paid in Bitcoin, thus circumventing this whole idea?

The real question is whether or not they can prove the validity of their approach.
If creating a valid risk assessment model was a simple as looking through someone's social media pages, I can guarantee you ChangeTip wouldn't the first/only ones doing it.

It's not creating value though. It simply transfers money from new bag holders to early adopters.

How's that volatility working out for you as a store of value?  I don't seem to remember when Gold lost 62% of its value in a 1-year time span.

So instead of sourcing claims, let's just prax it out?
Because AmEx introduced the first true Credit Card and within 5 years had millions of merchants adopting them as payment processor.
