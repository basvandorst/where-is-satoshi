Problem with voting is the options never solve the actual problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:33:06
Nice man! That's my goal as well!
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:35:22
Lol I would be stoked to make 50k a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:01:28
xD this guy is funny. 
1. I don't want to.
2. I am from the US. 
3. Literally every comment you have made you sound silly. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:39:44
Why not just use Litecoin instead.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:26:56
Is that saying you are 25+ ivy league? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:10:48
I don't understand the reasoning to have both. If one is better then the other then why not just have all your money in one. What is the point of owning both to just have one just sit there. The use cases are running out for Bitcoin and people are so attached the only thing they have left it seems is "a store of wealth".
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:23:45
Then what are you good for hobbit 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:13:36
O the irony, bankster coin. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:50:05
HAHAHAHA this is lame AF. Clown.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:18:57
But the Argentina bank is using BTC now... Welcome to being a "bankster" coin lol
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:13:15
But you are so shiny.
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:43:49
Things only bleed for so long before they die...
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:49:33
Someday you will understand. Good luck kid.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:54:24
Lmao. Exactly. You got a lot to learn.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:14:25
You are an attention seeking cuck is what you are. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:18:08
Wow, crazy much?  Also, that would be a super easy PS job, to be honest, there is nothing "elaborate" about it. Would take about 10 minutes max. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:17:31
If he makes it that long. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:39:04
Account doesn't check out ignore this clown. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:47:34
So no BTC acceptance on Alibaba anytime soon I suppose.
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:57:25
So why would the price keep rising as it is mined if it can just keep being split up for more people? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:14:23
Yea by Genesis Mining dude. It was satire. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:13:07
You continue to prove my point. Best of luck.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:13:50
Yes it was paid for by Genesis Mining I hear. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:38:13
How is that possible when Btrash just arrived last summer?
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:16:19
Send me some ETH and I'll make a tutorial just for you. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:22:50
BLAH BLAH BLAH
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:10:55
Look at the crypto market caps last couple years. It was at like 50 million at last years Consensus. TINY compared to what it is now. It would take farrr more money now to pump it, unlike the previous years. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:48:34
So pennys to dollars? Makes sense gracias. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:04:51
Yea thats what I was saying btc needs the new tech cause it just isnt that strong at the moment from a use case perspective. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:47:01
It is kind of lame though that is how you spend your valuable time kid. You only have one shot at life and you waste it being a troll. I kind of feel bad for people like you.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:09:41
Great for adoption. Not currently great for you profit margins...
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:36:34
As someone who uses Photoshop for a career, putting whatever you want on his sign would be on the level of basic. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:41:28
Lol I would just buy a different car at that point.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:11:50
Futures destroy everything
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:21:22
And if you somehow ended up being wrong for whatever reason your friends never trust you again.
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:00:34
Maturity is not teachable. You have to figure it out for yourself. It comes with mistakes and time. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:24:20
Somebody being realistic by looking at the data currently provided and asking questions dosen't mean they are mad or "have an agenda". (Grow up kid salt is a seasoning.) I have BTC also but for real, unless Lightning network is a big success, BTC just really is not all that amazing anymore with all of the emerging technology in the space. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:06:39
Edit* You are not my boss.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:24:42
Where is the source America is not England?????? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:51:30
Mind explosionssss
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:19:08
People literally snort drugs with Fiat. Show me snorting a fat line of coke with a Bitcoin! Show me!
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:36:46
If the price keeps going up tho you technically could overpay. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:57:38
Aka Elon Musk
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:33:56
Coinbase and Gdax = Same
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:50:51
Heavy language? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:29:24
Ahh understood. Been there....
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:20:17
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:27:39
Tru dat
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:37:46
Hahaha what a clown.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:31:12
So what should we do about these dbags?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:56:39
The video one somebody made was better.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:26:09
Who the fuck are these corny wine drinking douchebags? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:59:08
He tweeted me first but if you reply no matter how many times he just copies and pastes the same thing. It's hilarious. "But why do you try so hard to distract away from Bitcoin Cash? Is it because Bitcoin Cash removed the Blockstream code that caused the high fees?" 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:09:59
Why does it have to be a bubble, there has never been something similar to Bitcoin. So who's to say something brand new automatically works like other dumb shit like stocks?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:14:15
How is it the same? Because it has graphs also? xD
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:48:51
Whoever wrote that book had never even heard of Bitcoin or Blockchain, this is pointless still. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:01:31
Everybody that is saying he was an asshole are pussys. He didnt even say anything mean. Groe a pair ladies.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:15:20
I want a BTC100K plate. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:52:13
Looks like a lady from Coinbase Board of Directors will be there though. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:06:09
Yea but especially for noobs its easier to get your coins split there and not have to worry about exposing your private key to the internet.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:32:10
You even caring he did that makes you a super dork.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:33:33
I know I was trying not to be a dick while calling it out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:36:16
Ahh what? Why not make some money on it? When it becomes stable at $25,000 or even way more? Gonna be way harder to get in. Your thinking is rather flawed. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:57:33
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:09:26
I see a lot of Roadster wrecks in the future with that acceleration. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:21:55
But its not ONE PERSON that decides the value. It feeds off the strength of all the people. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:45:57
You need smarter friends then. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:35:14
Yea pull a New York on us. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:10:49
Congrats dood that's dope!
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:53:33
If you cash out to Fiat over $20,000 the IRS will spank your naughty lil bum.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:28:53
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:36:02
Just remember, you are quoting Fightclub. A satire written by a gay man about how male fragility causes men to destroy themselves, resent society, and become radicalized. Tyler Durden isn't the hero but a personification of the main charcter's mental illness. His "snowflake" speech is a dig at how fascists use dehumanizing language to breed loyalty from insecure people. 
So basically people who say "snowflake" as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:07:06
How does she think your salaries are enough for a 350k house without knowing about the Bitcoin? I haven't bought a house either but that seems a lot just based on income. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:47:00
Nice that's the same price I finally got into Bitcoin at. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:58:58
What I can't grasp is how it will ever be worth it to actually spend on stuff while capital gains taxes are a thing. I would have to pay capital gains tax plus the sales tax on the item??
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:53:59
Yea the Chinese New Year excuse is one of my favorites 
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:50:37
A dead guy can't rob you. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:57:09
Skeptics* And a 24 hour confirmation time! Wow how impressive /s
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:23:40
Lambo's are wildly impracticable. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:50:46
That's rad
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:00:55
Got 10% discount, paid more because of 20% capital gains tax and 10% sales tax lol
Edit* Which mall is this in LA?
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:04:44
None of the moon boys have a clue how much it cost to maintain a car like a Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:10:02
This kind of picture looks great to regulators. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:30:22
I love space bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:31:44
Sooo you are about 6 months late with this...
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:56:07
But the universe creates gold.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:43:57
Which defeats the purpose if you have to do that everytime from fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:33:15
Dude, why are you just stealing old memes and reposting them as your own?
