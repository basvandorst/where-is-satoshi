I'm sorry will do soon, not trying to be annoying. Just wanted to get some feedback from few people first that's all. I promise to release url very soon. In mean time please add your desires for features and I would love to consider them for site.

Hi guys thank you all for your interest. The site is [ Please note its just started so there's not much traffic. But what I would like is feedback in terms of updates to features and bugs.
Both bounty setup and answer payout are working. And all posts can be done with youtube video as well as text.

Hi guys made some big changes to styles and flow. Take a look when you can and let me know what you think?
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:57:08
Yes legitimate question. As  [monoclemoney]( states I am trying to not do too much all at once. I will have a version of site that's much more broad, but right now I"m trying to be somewhat careful so I don't end up creating something that does all things poorly.
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:48:53
Thank you for your interest. Really appreciate it. So the way payouts work is like this. The question asker first pays into their account and get's "credits" to set bounties with. When they create their question they can then determine how much money they want to set as the bounty. Once an answer that they like comes in and they confirm it as the answer the bounty amount is deducted from the question asker and put into account of answerer. 
As far as preventing fraud and getting people to pay I have a system somewhat similar to ebay. Everyone get's a payment score, in other words you can see who is actually paying their bounty and who is not. Additionally even when people do not acknowledge an answer the system regularly checks question status and if a question has a certain number of replies and if the they have a good point score the question is considered eligible to pay and it affects their score.

Also I’m seeing some gmail registrations. Should I add google login? Right now it’s just github

Perhaps you've had different experiences than mine. But I've had times where I searched google and stackoverflow for a particular issue and could not find a good response. Some how I don't think I'm alone in this, as I've also asked numerous colleagues at work who've sometimes had similar experiences.

That's a good idea. A running total of each answer and its bounty would be quite useful.

Hello everyone. So I've made some significant changes to the site. Styling has been revamped and now **payouts for answered questions**, can be done in **US dollar** as well as **Bitcoin**.
Url again is

I believe it so strongly I'm using it in my own startup, [DzHaven]( as payment to users. Also **one million plus** is the real goal!
