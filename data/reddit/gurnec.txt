Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that Adam Back no longer supports 2-4-8, but instead supports the more conservative SegWit-2-4 give or take...?

To date, I certainly agree.
I'm not yet willing to pass judgement on the recent policy change, and I'm concerned over [whether or not theymos and/or cobra have decided to flex]( their de-facto administrative muscles.
For example, harda says:


While that's true, it's only true as long as Bitcoin Core's hard fork policy remains unchanged. To me, that sounds like a choosing a side on the recent debate.

It's all quite well sourced (and not biased in the illusion that he's certainly been found), good for them.

That's an understatement. To reverse a BRIT wallet ID back into the the wallet words, you'd need a successful preimage attack against scrypt, SHA-256, *and* RIPEMD-160, and you'd need to solve the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (any *one* of which would at least temporarily break Bitcoin).

Are you suggesting that the MultiBit folk should partner with Yahoo (and, by proxy, Microsoft) so that they can track your transactions? MultiBit actually goes out of its way to preserve your privacy when these tiny fees are assessed.

There are some wallets which are compatible with one another; many are not.
There is a spreadsheet linked off of this post which details which wallets have interoperable seeds/xprvs/xpubs: &lt;
If I'm missing an HD wallet you'd like added to that sheet, let me know and I'll look into it.

OP- I'm not sure if you still need assistance, but in case you do, I'm working on an improvement to [btcrecover]( to support BIP-39 (TREZOR) passphrases. You can follow any progress (or lack thereof... ;) ) here:

As a non-profit, the Foundation is required by US law to make their tax returns publicly available. Although they are not required to make viewing them easy, they've nonetheless chosen to do so and have posted them online here: [IRS 990 Forms](
I'm no accountant, but a quick look shows that about half of their revenue came from membership dues, and half from conferences (totaling about 735K USD) plus another 65K in donations and 77K in investment income.
Most of their expenses were the result of salaries &amp; benefits (they have 3 paid employees, 2 full time and one part time) totaling 546K (that includes employer's health care and social security contributions). They also gave out 10K in grants last year.
You're welcome to disagree with how they choose to spend their money, but they're certainly pretty open about where it goes.

Which states, pray tell, in "North East USA" have county sheriffs with *any* investigative duties? (source: &lt;

An [article you linked]( in your post states that Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie ordered an investigation into the beatings which [allegedly] occurred at the Arthur Gorrie Correction Centre.
Do you know if any conclusions were reached, or if indeed any such investigation even took place?

You can't use the same seed on both, but you *can* export a Mycelium account's master private key, and then import that key into Electrum 2.x (via Electrum's "restore a wallet or import keys" feature).
Doing so may be dangerous, depending on how you transfer the key over. Via QR code is probably the safest choice.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:21:10
I'd be a little bit worried, but it depends on how much you've got stored.
*Very* rough estimate: you can check somewhere around 100 - 500 million BIP39 seeds for 0.25 USD on an EC2 spot instance (Amazon). Checking for 4 missing words (all at the end) equates to 43 bits (on average), which comes to a cost of between 4,000 and 20,000 USD to brute-force your seed.
Under ideal circumstances (attacker has your master public key), or if I'm just flat-out underestimating, it could be even cheaper, perhaps a lot cheaper....
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:35:21
You should be aware that if an attacker has a single private key of yours, and they also have your password-protected Armory wallet, they can derive all of the private keys for your wallet (they don't need to decrypt your wallet to derive them).
Storing your wallet online increases this risk....

At least it looks like coinbase is paying attention. Their DNS provider (CloudFlare) is now returning NXDOMAINs for em.coinbase.com: &lt;
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:32:53
Armory's key stretching is pretty good. The cost of brute-forcing an Armory wallet is somewhere around 0.25 USD per million passwords (based on EC2 spot instance pricing), so an 80 bit password would cost somewhere around 100 quadrillion USD, assuming non-custom (ASIC) hardware.
Using ASIC hardware to attack an Armory wallet is theoretically possible, but doesn't currently (publicly) exist.
IOW, you could probably get away with a lot less and remain safe from all but rich nation-states.
IMO you should be weighing the likelihood of loss (of both your wallet and your written-down backup) against the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack (while also keeping in mind privacy issues and the other risk I posted about).
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:58:30
GPU based cracking, at least for Armory on EC2, costs roughly the same (Armory uses a memory-hard KDF). Regardless, I completely agree with what you're working to get across.

A dead person's estate does not relinquish ownership of assets once that person dies, and there's no "statute of limitations" on bitcoin ownership. As I read this thread, I'm becoming convinced that taking ownership of the bitcoin in question is morally ambiguous at best, theft at worst, but of course that's a lot easier for me on my high horse to say (financially secure); 19-year-old-college-student me might have had a different opinion :-P

**The effectiveness of blockchain.info's 2FA often overstated**
Logon-only 2FA (such as supported by blockchain.info) *does* help protect against online password brute-forcing attacks, but it does *practically nothing* to help protect against malware (e.g. keyloggers), which seem to be the more ominous threat.
Per-transaction 2FA (such as supported by many online multi-sig wallets) means that each transaction that sends bitcoin out of your wallet must use a new 2FA code. This type of 2FA offers very effective protection against malware (although it's not necessarily perfect).
When you log into blockchain.info (even if you use good 2FA such as Yubikey), the private keys for your wallet are sent to your computer. This means that your computer (and any decent malware that's running on it) has access to those private keys, and can use them to relieve you of any funds.
By default, Blockchain.info doesn't save those private keys to disk (if you have 2FA enabled), and that does protect you against stupid malware, but it remains much less secure than per-transaction 2FA used by multi-sig wallets (where only a portion of the necessary key material is *ever* on your computer and available for malware to abuse).
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:15:36


Can you expand on this? Do you believe that, "morally", when someone dies, their assets should just be up for grabs? Is a will in some way not morally acceptable?
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:12:28
Fair enough, but even if you're an expert in the field, the possibility of a malware infection is ever present.
The purpose of 2FA is to significantly reduce that risk, but if you're not using it right (by using different devices *and* different types of factors (something you know/have/are)), then you are defeating that purpose, and you really shouldn't be mentioning 2FA it in your post.
Of course, it should be said that a lot of wallets (*especially* blockchain.info) misrepresent the effectiveness of their implementation of 2FA. In fact, I'll respond in a new thread on this topic below.
FWIW, you have my condolences....
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:44:34


That part wasn't in your earlier post, but now I understand what you were saying (and agree).
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:24:12
Do you access your blockchain.info account and your email account from the same PC/device? If so, it could be a run-of-the-mill you-have-malware issue.

So if a backup happens to exist, neither copy "represent[s] bearer rights"? And if that backup is destroyed, then the remaining copy suddenly "represent[s] bearer rights"? That doesn't make much sense to me....

Pretty late to respond to respond here... but I'm the author of btcrecover, and thought I would anyways. In short, that error means that if you (had) forced it to continue to run (by adding a --max-eta option), it would have taken at least 7 days to complete unless you were *really* lucky (and possibly much longer).
For 0.3 BTC I'd have to agree with Dave, it's probably not worth it, but if you you'd like to contact me for a hand, feel free to respond here or by opening an [issue on the GitHub repo](
You can also PM me over at bitcointalk; I'm [btchris](
