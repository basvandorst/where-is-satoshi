Well, how about this:
I am fully verified, I deposited 100k a month ago
They confirmed having received my wire, but they did not credit me.
They were supposed to credit me with USDT... they didnt
Thay have been ignoring me ever since.
Would you call that theft?

Did bittrex finally credit your account for the wire transfer you did?

I wired $100k to my Bittrex account last week, they acknowledged that they received it and informed me that my account has been credited when in fact it has not.
They have stopped responding to my support request/ticket
This is very worrying.
Has anyone else had their wire transfer money taken by Bittrex without crediting your account?
Not here to bash them, but just saying dont wire money to Bittrex, rather use another exachange

unnerving is an understatement
I have the account for a few weeks, but it is fully verified at top tier level and I have transferred bitcoins and other alts to the account with no issue.
As of right now, funds are still not in my account
The minimum wire transfer they accept is 100k, so, although 100k is a large transfer, they will not accept anything smaller:

Has Bittrex finally credit you for your $100600 yet?
