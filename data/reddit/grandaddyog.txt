You're wrong. Dogecoin is not like bitcoin, it's not as short sighted and based on greed and black markets. If anything bitcoin is part of the larger dogecoin ecosystem.
Haters gonna hate

You must have taken on the IQ of a goat.
atm roughly 3.5% of the dogecoin subreddit is currently reading
only less than 1,5% of the bitcoin subreddit is currently reading
Pretty sure if we look at these numbers throughout the day that bitcoin will almost never come above 2%

I think with the nuance that bitcoin was a first, where dogecoin is not.
Bitcoin community started off like that because it was the only one in it's kind back then, with doge it is much different , it grows so rapidly because of the positivity involved with it. 
I mine doge, but i wouldn't call myself a shibe. I've mined other coins as well and simply for monetary benefit and doge is no different but the community has a lot more positivity to it than bitcoin.

No because futures will not dictate any price movement. 
It's the exchanges that will dictate the price movement of the future contract.

You mean the fed manipulating gold and silver prices to strengthen the dollar?
The futures settle daily on the BRR. Which means a unified exchange spot price. 
Like i said it's a pure bet on the price.
Which means if one wants to speculate on the price of bitcoin, instead buying and selling physical settlement futures or real btc they can get a cash settled futures price. That also mean there is no immeadiate or future delivery of btc, there is no btc being transacted and thus less btc being held. That in term would drive demand down for the good compared to a physical settlement.

It hasn't launched yet "DECEMBER"
It's from ViaBTC, pretty sure it's not gonna be a small player for China and other parts of SEA if it proves to be a good exchange.
The Alt/BCH pairs are worrysome for bitcoin. That's the point.

Go read on the internet, no wait you're too retarded to figure stuff out yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:44:52
Yes it will work that way because the BRR and BTRI are based off of exchange prices. 
It's like stocks lead their index and not the other way around. Stocks dont go up because NASDAQ goes up, NASDAQ goes up when it's stocks go up. Same thing will be true here.

A correction back below 2k hell yeah

That's not how a cash settled futures contract works.
CME will have no effect on BTC price, or little. since it's a counterparty trade and cash settled (rather than physical or in this case digital delivery) it's a pure bet on the direction of the price without supporting the liquidity of the underlying asset.
There is an ideal hype created for some big whales to go short on the futures and then dump their physical bitcoin at market , the money made on the futures would account for the slippage on the market dump. The short on the futures would not affect market price provided there's someone to take the counter to your offer at a decent price.

You need liquidity hubs. 
Who is are the liquidity hubs in our current fiat system? Banks.
How do banks operate? They settle balances with eachother, not on seperate transactions. Gee that resembles channels... 
If you think Charlie Lee is gonna be your saviour think again. He doesn't know a single thing about how economics or currencies work, he just copied some code and rewrote some strings to Litecoin. 
&amp; Fees in fiat value go down, which is all everyone really cares about.
Unless you nominate the value of your groceries in bitcoin don't tell me otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:44:11
Lightning is not crypto, lightning is central banking. 
If bitcoin price falls because hashrate goes down fees are not going up
Your points are invalid.

It's a payment channel not a smart contract. Smart contracts don't require intermediaries, payment channels do because they require liquidity hubs. What's puzzling you?
