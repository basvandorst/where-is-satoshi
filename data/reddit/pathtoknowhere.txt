Real money - as in USD? Real money - like gold - *lasts*. USD will not last in any meaningful sense; instead, it will likely be relegated to a local currency (similar to the Mexican Peso or Costa Rican Colon) before dying completely.
Many hope to spend their BTC directly in the future once the market for it grows another order of magnitude or two and the volatility of purchasing-power tends toward 0.

My comment wasn't  in reference to whether or not the OP's model is predictive, it was challenging the gripe that a particular choice of scale for the Y-axis was inappropriate for visualizing the data. Please try to keep up.

You can keep saying this, but it doesn't make it true. Putting aside order-size, the 'floor' for any market good is always the highest bid in the order book. It makes no difference what happens to supply if demand is non-existent. A 'store-of-value' is any market good whose purchasing-power remains constant or increases over time. Supply is very important w.r.t. both of these concepts, but demand is critical. It's no more complicated than that.

If JPY's supply was a function of energy expended to produce it, and it had a predictable supply schedule, you could probably get a pretty good idea of where it's headed using S2F.

That was *a* moon. In time, bitcoin is likely to visit more of them as long as its core value propositions aren't compromised. The flaws in your analysis are two-fold: 1) you assume that BTC needs to function as a day-to-day currency in order to reach another moon \[the long-term SoV function available today may be sufficient\], and 2) awareness =/= adoption. During the 'dot-com' bubble most people on the planet became "aware" of the web, including my parents; however, they didn't "adopt" it until years later.

I'll take my chances with Bitcoin - in the wake of the 20th century and beyond, central bankers have given the people of the world little reason to believe they can course-correct enough for it to matter in the long-term. The response to the 2008 crisis alone speaks volumes.

What an absolutely ridiculous statement - unless, of course, you happen to be part of the minuscule fraction of the global population that own stocks, real estate, gold, fine art, etc. Bitcoin is the first democratic store-of-value; it doesn't care what you look like, what your gender is, where you live, how much you're worth, whether or not you're a financial wizard, etc. - it just lets you store the value of your labor over the long-term in as simple and accessible a manner as possible.

\&gt; A linear scale would visually and correctly display the magnitude of the current -75.57% drawdown and year long underwater period.
That's true (and I'd agree with you if OP's purpose was to highlight how brutal it would've been had you made a one-time, all-in purchase at the peak you're referencing), but it doesn't make it "appropriate" for the analysis here which attempts to encapsulate BTC's *entire* price history.

\^\^ The guy who just hates it when BTC has a high price-per-coin. He'd much rather it be worth, like, $20/coin - then it would actually be used for "what it was meant to be used for" (a means of transaction) and we could finally rid the space of all this "greed".

The Bitcoin network needs to continue to grow and absorb much more of the world's wealth before something like that could ever possibly happen on a higher-layer, etc. BTC needs to evolve from what it is today, which is a collectible / long-term store-of-value. Historically, that's the process by which a free market chooses what becomes 'money'. And you might not like it, but that includes speculation.
And "baseless predictions"? If you think 'stock-to-flow' is baseless, you got a better model?

The Coinage Act of 1792 explicitly defines a United States Dollar as 371.25 grains of fine silver, which is \~0.85 ounces. Any other definition is unconstitutional - it's really that simple.
At today's price/ounce, a United States Dollar is worth \~14.5 federal reserve note dollars. There is no other word than 'theft' that better describes this loss in purchasing-power.

Okay, 'every halving will have less effect'...and? I'm not sure that your claim is that controversial. I do think that THIS halving, coming up in May, will have a significant impact though the crest of the wave is not likely to be seen until 2021 or so if history is anything to go by. A daily supply cut of 1,800 new coins to 900 new coins is a big deal, in my opinion.

\&gt;  BTC is only worth the most because it was first, there's nothing spectacular about it.
No - it's worth the most because it's decentralized to such a degree that it renders by comparison every other alt, including ETH, centralized. As a corollary, the market does not believe that any cryptocurrency besides BTC is scarce. For evidence of this, note that the 'stock-to-flow' model only has a high level of correlation with BTC.

This. HODL'ing &gt; spending at this point in time. If/when the network tech develops sufficiently and BTC captures a large enough share of global wealth to become a true medium-of-exchange, then spending might do more good.

\&gt;  The percent of wealth is irrelevant.
Uh, no - it's definitely relevant. Across scales, percentages are the best way to make 'apples-to-apples' comparisons. Making the simplifying assumption that he's worth $1B, an 11BTC investment represents a commitment of less than 1/100th of 1 percent. That's equivalent to an 'average' individual worth $100K investing the cost of a fast-food combo meal. Had he invested 1-5% of his wealth in BTC, which tends to be, on average, the recommended level of investment for most people, it would be much more newsworthy. Now, all that said, it's entirely possible that he plans to work up to a larger target allocation through DCA'ing and this is simply his initial buy-in.

By the standard definition of a 'Bear Market' from legacy finance (which is -20% from ATH), we never left the one that began in December, 2017. I was saying this in June of this past year and thereafter, when many were convinced a new Bull had begun. We would've needed a close above \~$15.8k for that to've been true.
The Long Night is still very much with us.

" The higher the stock to flow, the worse it is for BTC. "
You're saying that a lower (say, yearly) inflation rate of a market good puts downward pressure on its price - in what reality is that logical?
"Its clear each having will have less effect on price also as the stock to flow increases."
I think this is sensible, and the stock-to-flow model even suggests it given its 'noisy-logarithmic' structure.
