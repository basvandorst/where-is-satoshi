 is an online wallet that uses P2SH 2-of-3 addresses. You get two keys, one hot, one cold, and BitGo gets the third. No transaction happens unless two keys sign it. The service is still vulnerable to a MITM attack, but the improvement over other online services is that the site literally does not have the information needed to transfer your bitcoin without your key's signature.

Back when checks were popular, they didn't. Merchants would accept checks that had your name and address printed on them as self-verifying ID. There would be signs posted at registers to warn cashiers about people who wrote bad checks.

You can verify this yourself by signing two transactions offline that spend the same inputs. Then broadcast them both at exactly the same time (perhaps using two computers where you press the enter keys on both simultaneously). With very high certainty, only one will propagate and the other will be rejected as a double-spend attempt. This happens long before even the first block confirmation.
I've tried it one or twice while trying to rebroadcast a fixed version of a small transaction where I mistakenly added zero fees. I failed because it was a double-spend. I then experimented a bit to see what the threshold was, and wasn't able to get both into the pending transaction queue.

This happened to me on March 8. I called Chase as you suggested, and they said something similar to what said (except actually the opposite, that they **can't** authorize the transaction or trust the merchant because of something about account-to-account transactions, and the lady on the phone admitted that she had no idea what that meant, either).
So at the moment I'm SOL on a recurring instant buy that uses ACH. It'd be nice if Coinbase automatically fell back to a non-instant ACH buy. Instead your system simply failed to complete the transaction entirely, which AFAICT leaves both Coinbase and me unable to do business with each other anymore.

The object identifier prefix is 0x0143, meaning this private key is using EC multiply mode, which means successful decryption will need the "ownersalt" value. In non-multiply mode, the value is included with the key, but in this case, it appears to be additional information that must be brute-forced.
TL;DR: even if you guess the three-character passphrase, you need to know something else to decrypt.

If the U.S. imposed a [VAT]( then it seems that retail cash transactions would draw so much regulatory scrutiny as to effectively abolish them. This would be a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin -- either the very use of it, like cash, would be *prima facie* evidence of tax evasion, or all Bitcoin transactions would be reportable as part of the VAT system, at which point, overnight, Bitcoin would gain the same stature as Visa/Mastercard.
Disclaimer: I'm American and have no idea how VAT actually works. I assume it's a national sales tax that includes a bunch of paperwork, as well as some kind of vicious-circle-jerk that causes every taxpayer to verify every other taxpayer's compliance the way W-2s and 1098s do for income tax here in the States.

As says, it'd be for recreational purposes only. Anyone who was seriously thinking of conducting a transaction would want to know the real price at his real exchange. An average or smoothed price is interesting only if someone is willing to trade at that price (and that person would quickly be arbitraged into the poorhouse).
Here in the U.S., the national news likes to report on the average price of gasoline, which today is $3.598 per gallon. This number is meaningless in California, where I'm lucky if I pay only $4. Same thing -- the average is just noise; it'd actually be dangerous if I paid attention to it.

ECDSA does signing, not encryption. I actually don't think the Bitcoin protocol uses any encryption at all. It uses cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, and HMACs. But no encryption. (Excluding symmetric encryption of the wallet, of course, which wasn't even a feature of the original client and has nothing to do with the protocol.)
I am no mathematician or cryptologist, but I believe that if you want to use ECC, you'd need a full-fidelity representation of the public-key component, rather than the 160-bit Bitcoin address, which is really just an information-destroying hash of the public key. (I'd be delighted to learn that I'm wrong about this point. It would be really cool if one could encrypt using a Bitcoin address.)

Thanks for the research, slit_licker! Unfortunately, the problem is not getting the cert (which as you point out is extremely cheap), but rather getting Heroku to *serve* the cert. They priced it pretty close to the maximum pain point; they know that if you bothered to get the cert, then you have something worth protecting and are willing to pay for it.
On EC2 or Linode or any other VPS, the prices are much closer to the cost of providing the service, because they're in a commodity business.

I think of this wallet format as a safe way to transfer small amounts of Bitcoin, as gifts, to other people, and the format is pretty awesome for that purpose. You (the recipient) are already trusting me (the giver) not to have copied down the private key before I assembled the wallet. If I actually had copied it with the intent to spend the funds, then that would defeat the purpose of the gift in the first place. I keep a few handy, and whenever I'm in a conversation with people who are new to Bitcoin, I give them one and zap 0.01 over to it from my phone. Much easier than asking *them* to install a wallet app on their phone.
As a regular cold-storage paper wallet for your own funds, this format is still better than plain-old exposed private keys printed on regular paper. You were planning on keeping the physical copies secure anyway, so the flashlight attack isn't a big deal.

While the heat-death-of-the-universe comparisons are amusing, they don't tell the full story. Long before a brute-force attack is feasible (zillions of years), someone will likely have figured out a practical Bitcoin-related attack on ECDSA, RIPEMD-160, or SHA-256 (probably no more than a couple human lifetimes from now).
It's a fair point that no such attacks are publicly known to exist today. But I'd wager in favor of humans breaking the math before building computers fast enough to brute-force a private key. If you agree with that reasoning, then the better question is not many [insert plural noun] are in the universe, but rather how quickly the field of cryptanalysis is advancing.

Name different units after the early engineers. We already have the Satoshi. The community could vote on each new unit name, celebrating as the exchange rate hits specific USD milestones. There would be some catching up to do for everything before $1,000/BTC. Examples:

* 10 cents per BTC: 10 BTCs is a Sirius.
* 1 dollar per BTC: a single BTC is a Garzik.
* 10 dollars per BTC: a tenth of a BTC is a Hearn.
And so on all the way down to 10 Satoshis being a Corallo. If you wanted to skip voting and be a little more objective, then you could simply do a git log on the repo with appropriate arguments, sort by number of lines of code committed, and assign names according to the results.
Note that most denominations of currency have many different nicknames already, so it's not like this needs to be official -- people will eventually figure out what makes sense.

I just upgraded to 1GB. Heroku pricing is completely nonlinear -- I'm paying $20/month to have an SSL cert, $17/month for Cloudmail, and now $10/month for the 1GB database. Zero for the Heroku site itself. Given that it's a hobby site with no revenue, $47/month is a high price to pay. If I put in the time to migrate the code to a plain EC2 machine, I could probably get the price down below $20/month ($15 for the server, less than $5 for the disk). But it's your usual time/money tradeoff, of course -- and if the product doesn't actually fulfill a real need, the cost doesn't matter much anyway because I'll shut the site down!

If you really want to be sure:
1. From command line: `electrum getseed`
1. Write down the "seed" value, which is a compact version of the mnemonic. Mine is `7ff362bcba1710122aa83d23276894e5`.
1. Print out the 60-line [class OldAccount in the Electrum source]( If that's too much work, the really important line is `return string_to_number( Hash( "%d:%d:"%(n,for_change) + self.mpk ) )`, where n is the nth address in your wallet, for_change is either 0 or 1, and mpk is a 100,000-iteration SHA256-stretched version of the seed.
1. Save the paper somewhere safe. Beware that the seed is literally the only thing needed to get all your wallet's bitcoin. In fact, right now some joker reading this is excitedly checking the seed in step 2 to see whether it contains any funds.
1. Far in the future, in the extremely unlikely event that (a) Bitcoin still exists, but (b) the world has collectively forgotten how to regenerate Bitcoin keys from Electrum seeds, hire a smart programmer friend (or even just an average one) to read that snippet of code you saved and regenerate your wallet keys/addresses. Keep an eye on your friend so he doesn't immediately go and spend your long-lost funds.
By the way, you might be wondering why it's "OldAccount" and not "Account." I think the reason is that Electrum is going to switch to a flavor of [BIP0032]( If this is correct, then migrate your funds when the change happens, and then save just the mnemonic and/or seed as well as that image; you can forget about OldAccount at that point.

There aren't two addresses. There is only a key. From key you can derive the address. You'll see "private key" and "public address" tossed around, but in the user-level Bitcoin context, those terms are redundant. Public-key cryptography typically has the concept of a private key and public key, and Bitcoin is no different, but it doesn't use the public key for any user-visible purpose. A Bitcoin address is derived from the public key, but it's not the same thing.
If you back up a private key, you have total control over the corresponding address. For example, here is a complete backup of three Bitcoin addresses:
If you paste one of those into the last tab of bitaddress.org, you can see that each generates a Bitcoin address (including the public key if you look at all the generated gobbledygook). As long as you have the capability of regenerating a specific Bitcoin address from something (be it a WIF, a sequence of 32 bytes, a passphrase whose SHA-256 output is used as a private key), then you control that address.
Fun facts and caveats: Bitcoin addresses usually start with 1. Bitcoin keys usually start with 5. For every Bitcoin address, there are actually about 2^96 keys that will generate that address. The "user-visible purpose" distinction above is relevant because public keys are used in the Bitcoin scripts embedded in the blockchain. You can see this by generating the key for the brainwallet "correct horse battery staple," seeing that the public key starts with 0478D43027, then finding that byte sequence in the script of [a recent transaction spending that address's outputs](

I've done almost the same thing with a C7: installed Ubuntu, then went offline for good, adding a few packages via USB stick that I needed for key generation and wallet manipulation. So I went through the same thought process as you. The most accurate answer is, unfortunately, that you can't be sure. You have to trust that Asus/Google/Ubuntu didn't build in backdoors, and that the Ubuntu installation you got is authentic. The trust decisions seem reasonable, at least to me (disclosure: I work at one of those three companies). If we're wrong about it, then a whole lot of people are affected, not just you and me.
As for the authenticity of the [Chrubuntu installation]( that's a tougher decision, but I still came out on the trust side. The guy running the blog appears to be a Google fan, which is a neutral point. Neither his blog nor the wget links are https, so it's hard to verify that you're really even talking to him. Thus there are two threats to consider: the motivation of Jay Lee, and whether a MITM attack is happening. But someone (maybe Jay, maybe someone else) went through the trouble of producing real, working Ubuntu builds for your Chromebook, purportedly to steal your secrets. It doesn't seem like a cost-effective hack. If you've decided to steal information by distributing bad OS builds on the internet, why not go for a larger target, like Raspberry Pis, or by offering some kind of "MacBook Pro-optimized super-secure Ubuntu custom build" that will ensnare a more specific and lucrative audience?
I use my Ubuntu C7 for a few specific things: GPG key generation, Bitcoin address generation, and printing of cold-storage wallet addresses -- via USB, not wireless. I reformatted the machine after the initial GPG key generation to make sure all traces of the private key were gone. I'd already printed the key using paperkey and put it in a safe deposit box. Every few months I move the cold-storage Bitcoin to new addresses. I do this for two reasons: one, for the same reason you periodically change online passwords (someone might have found them a while back via a botnet and is just getting around to exploiting them), and two, to test that I really do still have access to the private Bitcoin keys. The C7 actually doesn't get used for much these days besides generating new addresses and making GPG-encrypted backups to SD cards. I do the actual money transfers on a regular machine because I'm comfortable with the brief risk that the about-to-be-emptied addresses have their private components on the untrusted machine. No state remains on the C7 at the end; I shred -u everything before signing out. Then the C7 is kept in a location where I'm likely to notice that someone messed with it while I was out.
For day-to-day Bitcoin transactions, I keep about $100 on my phone (Blockchain). That's less than the value of the phone hardware itself, so I'd be more upset if I lost the phone than the Bitcoin on it.
Again, no, you can't completely trust the hardware or software. But you can minimize risk in the case your paranoia turns out to be correct.
(And no, I don't do this because I own a lot of Bitcoin. I don't. I'm sad to say I missed that boat. But the idea of securing digital assets is interesting, so it was fun to come up with a process that was just a little bit over the top, particularly in the case of Bitcoin where there's no recourse in the case of theft.)

This isn't really a meaningful question. It's a little like asking "which car should I buy?" without our knowing anything about you.
2FA is the combination of something you have and something you know. Usually the thing you know is your passphrase. The thing you have is the OTP generator. Part of the security is that the attacker who figures out or guesses your passphrase can't easily get the OTP generator. Thus, some questions:
* Does the website rate-limit authentications? If not, then a longer passphrase and longer OTP (8-digit vs. 6-digit) matter. Otherwise neither matters all that much.
* Does the website indicate that you have the right passphrase and then ask you for the OTP? Or does it ask for both passphrase and OTP at the same time, then either accept or indicate that authentication failed? The former is bad. The latter is good.
* Can someone using only a stolen web cookie turn off 2FA in the website's account settings? If so, 2FA is useless.
* Do you leave your signed-in computer unlocked at home? Do you leave your phone near it? If so, 2FA is useless for the most common attack (someone who lives in your house).
* Is your phone rooted?
* Do you back up your phone? Who has access to the backups?
* If your 2FA is SMS-based or email-based, who has access to those accounts?
* Pretend you've lost everything (computer, ID, files). How do you re-establish access to the website in question? Now ask yourself: could an attacker easily do the same thing?
* If you lost your phone, would the attacker be able to easily access your 2FA token? How strong is the PIN on your unlock screen?
* Do you have a remote-wipe feature set up? Do you know how to use it from a fresh computer? (e.g., you've lost your phone on vacation and go to a hotel public computer. Would you need your 2FA token to sign into whatever service you use to wipe your phone?)
* If you lost your phone, how long would it take you to realize it's gone?
* If someone stole your phone, who's the most likely suspect in your life? A friend or family member who's motivated to steal from you? Or a crack addict who just wants to sell it for $10?
Once you've answered these questions, you'll probably conclude that Google Authenticator, Authy, Yubikey, etc., are all about the same. The physical token versions are vulnerable to loss. The SMS ones are vulnerable to loss of phone (unless you use Google Voice in which case the attacker who has your Google passphrase has everything and you're dead in the water). The email ones are worrisome because an attacker who has your passphrase probably also figured out how to get into your email.
It all depends on which threats you think are most applicable to you.

Sales tax goes to state/local. Gas tax goes mostly to fed. Income tax goes to both state &amp; fed. Cap gains tax goes to state &amp; fed. Sin taxes (cigarette, alcohol, etc.) go mostly to local. You pay a wide variety of fees and taxes for all sorts of transactions. Just because you're paying sales tax on a purchase doesn't mean the transaction doesn't also trigger other taxes, some collected by the seller, some paid by the buyer, some with a duty to report at tax filing time.

The Raspberry Pi model A costs $25. How are you going to get any microcontroller-based system cheaper than that? The Teensy 3.1 is $20, which is cheap for a complete microcontroller dev board. But it has only 256KB flash (probably enough for an offline wallet written in C or C++), and it's missing the SD card reader. Unlike custom hardware, the Raspberry Pi already exists, so its design cost is zero. Finally, because the RPi is a full Linux system, it's easy to take a known-good wallet application like Armory and throw it on there in a weekend.

The issue was Alternative Minimum Tax, which is this crazy shadow tax system in the U.S. that was originally meant to ensure that extremely high income-earners (like the top 0.01%) paid at least some tax. Because the limits weren't indexed for inflation, today it catches many middle-class Americans.
AMT considers an incentive stock option exercise to earn income based on the fair market value of the stock on the day of exercise. So back in 1999-2000, some people would exercise their options in anticipation of their company's IPO, thereby earning huge amounts of phantom AMT income, but they couldn't sell any of their stock until (typically) after the 6-month lockup following the IPO. Either of two things would happen: they got caught in a cash crunch on tax day because the IPO hadn't happened yet, or the stock crashed and they owed tax on income they could never have received. Either way they were pretty well fucked.
I doubt AMT applies here, but the barter case definitely could, because it could cause a similar cash crunch. Consult a tax adviser!

That's on the list for sure. There are two issues I'm struggling with: (1) I don't want the site to become a source of spam. Today, if I ever get a complaint, I can say with 100% confidence that b1txr.com has never sent an email of any kind, and that any mail appearing to originate here is just a joe job. (2) I don't want recipients of b1txr.com email to think that the sender is necessarily legitimate. It's really easy to forge email, even if you do DKIM/SPF, and if people start accepting b1txr emails as a substitute for a full Bitcoin digital signature, they'll have a bad time. On the other hand, everyone who's been on the Internet for more than 15 minutes recognizes that spam/fake email is a problem, so maybe it's not a problem I should worry about.

Thank you for saying this. I thought I was the only person who found the usage of the "ROI" term notably incorrect. I know what people mean -- it's a weird colloquialism of the Bitcoin community -- but it's as grating to me as any of these:
* Let's stop at a gas station. We need more MPG.
* It's going to be pretty sunny today, so don't forget to apply SPF.
* Ooh, I need to mail in my APR to the bank, or else my house will be repossessed.
None exactly the same error, but in the same "a measurement having to do with the thing I'm talking about" class.

One suggestion for an alternate approach to step 4, where you verify the mask: on Android, the Barcode Scanner app has an option to invert the image when scanning, so you can just point your phone at the actual masked metal and skip all the stuff with the desktop computer.

Technically, QR code readers are supposed to invert the image on their own, but in practice it doesn't seem that many of them do that.

The easy version is the ssss utility available on most Linux systems and OSX through brew. Create a GPG key pair, encrypt with a long passphrase, ssss-split -t 3 -n 5 the passphrase, print out each of the five shares, give one to each of five trusted friends/family. Now email the encrypted private key to yourself, your SO, your lawyer, etc. Any three of the five can get together and decrypt the private key and anything you encrypted with the key.

That's the million-BTC question that I tried to address in the FAQ.
The best example I can think of is a site that sells digital goods like prepaid phone cards. Suppose the site sells $20 T-Mobile cards at Bitcoin address 1abcdefghijklm. You send BTC 0.2 from address 1nopqrstuvwxyz to 1abcdefghijklm. They wait for the confirmation and then send the prepaid code to 1nopqrstuvwxyz Transaction complete. No site registration needed, no personal information whatsoever changed hands. True, the site could spam you later at the 1nopqrstuvwxyz address, but you don't ever have to use that address again (it's a little like Mailinator in this respect).
Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be. It's extremely anonymous if you never transact! But the moment you actually do anything useful, you cross the boundary between Bitcoin and the real world, and you're forced into associating an Bitcoin address with something real and identifiable -- a mailing address for purchased goods, a physical meeting place, a Bitcointalk forum handle, an email address.
Obviously I can't solve all those problems, but I can do my part by making it very easy to have an *email* address that's exactly as anonymous as your *Bitcoin* address. (To be clear, there are much stronger solutions out there such as Bitmessage and GPG, but there is a tremendous amount of friction because both parties have to care about privacy. With b1txr only *you* need to care.)

I upvoted you; better to address your point directly than avoid it.
Is the site trustworthy? No, of course not. It's new, and it'll be hard for it to climb the hurdle of trust. But I bet the site would be popular as a feature of a well-established, trustworthy site like Coinbase or Blockchain, either of which actually *is* expecting you to trust it with your Bitcoin. I hope this announcement leads to enough usage of the feature that it'll be picked up elsewhere (in fact, I [open-sourced]( the hard part of the site to make it easier for them to do so).
Is the feature useful? That's what I'm trying to find out. I don't use Bitcoin in enough transactions yet -- I'm more of a hoarder -- to have found more than contrived value so far.
Edit: sorry again for the mixed metaphor. "jump the hurdle of trust"? "climb the mountain of trust"?

Imagine there were only one brand of web browser in the world. Every website developer would test only against that browser. Web standards would be arguably meaningless because only the practical result would be whether your site looked good on that browser. Moreover, it would be tough for a second browser to become popular, because its developers would need to implement not just the web standards, but also bug-for bug identical behavior to the first browser.
Contrast a world where many different browsers exist and none is significantly more popular than any others. Now the standards control, not any single implementation. No single vendor can alter the standard without cooperation.
Depending on your point of view, introduction of a new Bitcoin client might introduce a healthy diversity to the ecosystem. Or it might just make bugs more serious or harder to fix. I can see either point of view.

Mining today creates about $3 million in new coins every day. If a group possesses mining hardware capable of generating 50.1% of that amount, it's unlikely they'd do something as irrational as forking the blockchain. They'd be losing millions of dollars a day for no benefit.
It would be much more likely for a government with tremendous computing power to disrupt the blockchain in order to destroy Bitcoin entirely. Depending on that government's view of Bitcoin as a threat, it might be rational for it to destroy value in order to achieve its goals.
But a Bitcoin player forking Bitcoin? Unlikely. The system is designed for economically rational players to contribute to the network, not destroy it.

How about this instead: pick some future event that incontrovertibly means Bitcoin has succeeded as a world currency. Everyone holding Bitcoin before that event is entitled to self-identify as "pre-[event]" (fill in whatever the event is).
This is reminiscent of what classy people do in the tech industry when others dog them about whether they're rich. Instead of either saying they're rich or getting weird about being asked such a personal question, they might respond that they were pre-IPO at such-and-such company. It's a verifiable fact that is usually part of someone's resume anyway, and it doesn't get directly into wealth.
Denominating this group "pre-Event" tends to unify Bitcoin holders around what's most important today: that the currency needs to catch on as a world currency before it reaches its full potential. As with a company that manages to go public, the wealth will be a consequence of success, not a goal of its own.
Plus it's nice because almost everyone reading this post today is pre-Event. :)

Question  USB miner. Yes, same idea as the big hardware but smaller. Consumes 2.5 watts so is cheap to run. Plugs into a computer that probably consumes more like 100 watts, but either way not a big deal. The tradeoff is that USB Block Erupters are so slow compared to the rest of the hashing power out there that you will make only about 0.002 Bitcoin/day (and declining rapidly). Translation: fun hobby, but will never recover your cost, so don't do it for the money.
Question  What are shares? Your understanding is right. Buy a share of something like ASICMINER, or do a team purchase of a mining rig. Sit back and collect Bitcoin, either as dividends from ASICMINER or as direct mining proceeds from the equipment that you partially own. As with all mining today, you'll probably barely break even (though note that ASICMINER is a relatively liquid security, so you can possibly benefit from capital gains in the stock itself).

I hear what you're saying on the multi-factor authentication, but in that case I'd prefer to use GPG, keep the encrypted keys online and replicated in a zillion places, and put the GPG private key and its symmetric passphrase somewhere safe. These (this way and Piper) are all valid approaches... and all fun to implement.

There is some discussion about where these numbers came from, but I can't remember whether I heard it publicly or directly from an alleged friend of alleged Satoshi.
If you start with the idea that M coins are awarded every N minutes, the difficulty adjusts every O days, and M gets cut in half every P years, then 50 coins every 10 minutes according to difficulty adjusting every 15 days with a reward adjustment every 4 years is a nice, reasonable set of numbers. Sure, M could have been 50 million or 50 billion or 999 trillion coins per mined block, but that would make everyday math hard, and would immediately raise questions like whether you could make change from a single coin, or whether the base denomination should be a gigacoin or teracoin or whatever so you wouldn't pay a zillion of something for a 6-pack of beer at the store. Anyway, the M/N/O/P set of numbers happens to work out to a total number of coins somewhere in the tens of millions range. A number that is tens of millions has 8 digits, and it's a nice balance to add 8 digits of precision to the right of the decimal point, too. 12345678.87654321. The placement of the decimal point at what turned out to be the 1.0 Bitcoin mark was probably just a decision to slice the number range in half. Nobody knew in 2008 which way the inherent value of the currency would go.
By the way, even if Satoshi had decided the base number was 2.1 x 10^15 and there wasn't such a thing as half a Bitcoin, the software could always be changed to add fractions. So again, assume a single alternate-world Bitcoin is worth today's 1 Satoshi (0.00000001 Bitcoin) and somehow the exchange rate is such that a Satoshi is worth something like a dollar. We'd still have to introduce fractions to make the currency divisible for things like micropayments for cafe wireless, and then you'd be asking again why the decimal point is where it is.

It sounds like the only way you will be happy is if Bitcoin drops far below your sale price. As a casual onlooker, I wonder whether you're truly satisfied giving control of your emotions like that to a single number on a computer screen.
You need to understand this thing you're calling "regret." Go back to the day you sold. Why did you sell? It was obviously an important decision to you (though at most it involved $266 x 3 = $798, which where I live is about a week's apartment rent), so presumably you weighed the pros and cons, evaluating all the facts, and concluded that the right decision was to sell. If you did do that, and if today you still believe that you made the right decision *based on the facts available at the time*, then **there is no reason for regret**. The best you can ever hope for in life is to make great decisions based on your assessment of the present.
If, however, your decision was more like "OMG OMG OMG I'm so scared that I might lose this money and I think it's still going up but I need to sell because I'm scared," then that's not really a decision but more of a fight-or-flight reaction, and either you should decide to do better in the future by making decisions based on your cold assessment of present facts, being comfortable with the likelihood that your assessment will be completely wrong, or admit that making big decisions is too stressful for you, and hand your money over to a financial planner so you can pay 2% of your net worth each year to have someone else worry for you. (Imagine Zoidberg meme here; he's yelling "you're a bad decision maker and you should feel bad." But you don't cut your own hair, either. You pay someone else to do that for you. That's normal. Hiring a financial planner is normal, too.)
If, after reading this exposition from some stranger on the Internet, you still feel regret that even though you made the right decision at the time you would have profited more by making the opposite decision, then **all you are doing is feeling bad about betting on black instead of red**. That's the same as feeling bad about playing a game and losing, which is the same as being a bad sport. If you don't like losing, then don't play games. If you don't like losing money, then don't speculate with money. And especially don't do the worst of all, which is **not speculate** but **in your head** still speculate what would have happened if you **had** speculated. That's like gambling where you can only lose.

There are a few questions to ask.
1. Do you think mixing will become illegal? If you do, then do you think coins already mixed will increase in value, decrease in value, or stay the same (relative to unmixed coins)?
1. If mixing became illegal, do you think it would still be easy/safe/reasonably priced/within your comfort zone to do it? This is relevant to a decision whether to do it today or to wait and see.
1. If you think mixed coins will become more valuable, but the value can be realized only in dark markets that care more about privacy/anonymity, do you think you'll be willing to participate in those markets? It would be unfortunate if (for example) your prediction were true that a 2013 mixed Bitcoin were worth much more than an unmixed one, but you had to go through tricky hoops to cash in.
1. Even if mixed coins don't become outright illegal, do you think there will be different value attached to coins whose provenance you can easily demonstrate? In other words, could mixing actually *hurt* the coins just because they have a blurrier history?
1. Suppose you predict mixing might someday increase (or avoid decreasing) the value of your coins. Are you confident enough in your prediction that you believe the expected value of your coins will be higher after (a) the mixing fee, and (b) the chance that your coins go into the mixer and never come out?
I don't know what the answers are to these questions, but my guess is that it'll be impossible to prevent mixing in the future, so you'll always have the option to do it (at a possibly higher price) if it's an attractive option.

If Bitcoin's USD exchange rate goes up, you'll be even worse off than if it stays stable. As a thought experiment, imagine two scenarios where the exchange rate increases perfectly linearly from $800 today to $4,000 in June 2014. Assume $100 BFL shipping charges (in reality, running a miner is much more expensive than that).
Scenario 1: You take the $2,200 you were going to spend and buy 2.75 BTC today. In June 2014 you own BTC worth $11,000.
Scenario 2: You send off your money to BFL. In March your hardware arrives. USD/BTC by then is $2,400, and difficulty is 9.3 billion. You mine about 0.85 BTC before throwing the machine away in July because it produces 0.00003 BTC/day (12 cents USD) at difficulty 14 billion. You now have BTC worth $3,400. The chump in you says "wow, I'm awesome because I turned $2,200 into $3,400." But this other little voice inside you wonders why you paid $2,200 for less than one bitcoin back in December 2013.

In the short term, you can use email or even Reddit messages. Have a receiving Bitcoin address ready, and when people message you, tell them to send Bitcoin to the address and to message you their shipping address. When the Bitcoin arrives, ship the honey, and message the buyer back to say it's on its way.
This won't work at large scale because you'll eventually have trouble telling who paid you -- and worse you'll get people viewing the public Bitcoin transactions and saying falsely "yup, that payment you just got, that was from me."
But here's the thing: you have no idea whether you'll ever reach large scale. Selling honey for Bitcoin over the internet might not even work. You might sell one pound a week or a hundred pounds a day. You could spend a lot of time and money building a website, only to find out you could have handled it all by email. Why not run an experiment for a couple weeks for free, and see how it goes? If it's successful, not only will you know a whole lot more about Bitcoin by then, but you'll be very confident that the website you're building is something your business actually needs, rather than flushing money down the drain.

Don't worry about it. If the malware can't phone home, your secrets are still safe (though the moment you reconnect your machine to the internet, even a year later, you're owned).
A different class of threat is malware that causes you to think you're generating your own private keys, but instead you generate one that the attacker already controls. That attack is immune to being permanently offline. Unfortunately, you're vulnerable to it unless you inspect all source code and build it yourself -- not practical in the case of an Ubuntu download.

If I'm the government, I make Bitcoin illegal or at least too painful to use. I form a dedicated IRS team that punitively audits anyone transacting on the blockchain in an identifiable way. I decree that any blockchain transaction constitutes foreign money transmission, and I require paperwork for each transaction to be filed within 30 days. I require all addresses controlled by a taxpayer to be declared on income tax forms, and throw a few noteworthy Bitcoin advocates in jail for noncompliance or imperfect compliance. Then I enter into AML treaties with other countries to make them do the same thing.
If I'm a payment processor, I update the merchant agreement to prohibit competing non-cash payment methods, and when the antitrust lawsuit rolls around, I'll assume Bitcoin will have starved by then and settle the lawsuit quickly.

The paper wallet part is correct. With the Casascius coin, though, the idea is you can't see the private key without visibly destroying the coin. So as long as you believe the coin is genuine, you don't need to sweep (and thereby destroy) it. Nor do you even need to verify its balance.
If someone can figure out how to make an inexpensive physical token with the same attributes as a Casascius coin, it'll completely solve OP's problem. However, I don't see how to make it inexpensive to manufacture without also making it inexpensive to counterfeit. Governments succeed in doing so by making it illegal to counterfeit and by controlling access to manufacturing processes.

It's a good question. Many of the people who are interested in Bitcoin naturally trust computers a lot more than they trust people (or at least people in positions of authority), so it's an almost unspoken value that a system not depending on appointed humans is better than one that does. You're questioning that value, which is fair.
But in order to have a more interesting discussion than one that concludes we share different values, it would be helpful if you brought up examples in which either required identity verification or human enforcement of rules is preventing crime. In every case I can think of, crime -- or whichever threat is supposedly being addressed -- still happens:
* September 11. Every hijacker was a legal resident of the U.S. and traveled with valid identification. We've reacted, paradoxically, with strict ID checking and by trying to tighten up immigration. We now have the identity verification you speak of, and we've tried to rid the population of illegals. But neither of those factors had anything to do with 9/11, and we've had attacks since then (shoe bomber).
* Fingerprinting and background checks of schoolteachers. Yet sexual abuse still occurs between teachers and students.
* Facebook requires real names. But I see hate speech, obscenity, pornography, and low-quality contributions on the site all the time. I've heard that criminals even boast of their crimes to their friends on the site. Granted, it's a strawman argument that the names policy has anything to do with the quality of the site.
* There are police in every town in the world. There is also crime in every town in the world.
Other points:
* Identity theft is a problem, both in the real world (fake IDs) and online (stolen passwords). Why would an identity-based Bitcoin be any different?
* The internet works pretty well. It has crime, weird elements, bad elements, and a whole lot of great aspects to it. There is *zero* identity verification built into the internet, and with few exceptions there is no community that gets to decide whether you get to participate in it.
* Look at the security question from another angle. What if you wanted to take your net worth in cash and take its security into your own hands? How would you do that? Bury it in the back yard? Buy a huge amount of gold and a gun to guard it? Unlikely. The point is you *can't* secure your net worth on your own. You *must* trust it to a complex network of banks, insurers, pension funds, governments... and that's just to protect the number of dollars you have. If you want to preserve the *value* of your savings, you must invest it in order to keep up with inflation, and that's never risk-free. Doesn't it bother you that you **cannot** practically secure your own savings? Bitcoin makes doing so possible through something as simple as a passphrase and some laser-printed sheets of paper. Now, I'm not giving you investment or financial advice (what happens when you die and forget to tell your passphrase to your next of kin?). But before worrying about Bitcoin's security, it's helpful to agree that cash is **hardly** secure from hackers, inflation, thieves, changes in government regulation, or acts of nature. But, if done right, Bitcoin is.

No, you don't have to go crazy with security to send money to a paper wallet. Though actually it's smart if you're getting into Bitcoin at all to have a piece of crap, totally offline netbook for at least generating your keys.

Interesting idea! I've never known a successful email service to charge money to send email, but in this case, extremely small fees (like 1 Satoshi charged against a balance of 1 mBTC) would be at least practical to implement. Note that Bitcoin adopted HashCash's anti-spam proof-of-work idea for mining, so it would be quite a full-circle moment if now Bitcoin were used for spam prevention.






I'd like that to be a feature of the site, yes. But I'll have to figure out a way to pay the server bills before I can make that promise (which might bring us back to your earlier idea, above). As I said in another thread, if I can get off Heroku and get the price down to maybe $20/month, then I probably wouldn't mind running it as a completely free site indefinitely. But it would also be smart to figure out a revenue model that works for everyone so that there's more of a guarantee of longevity. If you have more good ideas, please share.

The autocomplete feature is insane. It defeats the purpose of the checksum in a Bitcoin address by changing typos into disasters. But it's also fair to allocate at least partial responsibility to anyone manually typing a Bitcoin address. That is also insane.

The most correct answer is no. The point of an offline computer is to make it *impossible* for information to leave that machine over a network. In your scenario, it's still quite possible for this to happen. Your OSX machine might have a root-level compromise that monitors keystrokes, logs file writes or clipboard usage, who knows. Or you might have installed something that's *not* malware that leaks information between accounts, and then later that information somehow finds its way into the wrong hands. All of this is possible. With a completely offline computer, on the other hand, it's impossible (physical access will always be another story).
If you're asking whether it's safer than using your normal account, sure, it's safer. But is it safe enough? Depends on the value of what you're protecting versus the inconvenience of spending more of your time figuring out the Armory issue.

It's way, way worse than that. Read the FAQ.
There is *zero* encryption involved -- only HTTPS for authenticity and ECDSA for access control. I've thought about a feature that would let a user set up an address to reject email that wasn't GPG-encrypted, but (as you say) this wouldn't stop people from accidentally sending sensitive information in the clear over the open Internet. There isn't a lot you can do about that if you want the ubiquity of email.

The bad writing is intentional. Phishing preys on the naïve. The person who doesn't recognize horrendous grammatical errors is the same person who will enter his password on a strange site, and who won't know what to do when his property is stolen.
It doesn't matter if 99.999% of phishing attempts fail. If the thief makes $50 on the remaining 0.001%, the campaign was worth it.
Reporting this kind of stuff here on Reddit doesn't really help for this reason. None of you was going to be tricked, and by the time you read this post and decide to do something like trying to get the site shut down, the phishers will already have caught someone.

Before encryption:
1. Print out your cold-storage Bitcoin and keep it on a shelf. Worthless brother-in-law finds it. Money gone.
1. Mail paper wallet to nephew as birthday gift. Postal worker holds envelope up to light. Money gone.
1. Keep $200 paper wallet in real wallet in case of emergency. Lose wallet. Money gone.
After encryption:
1. Brother-in-law posts challenge to divulging only the address with the smallest balance, figuring "winner" will reveal passphrase that will unlock the other 9,999.8875 BTC. However, scrypt makes brute-force infeasible. Money safe.
1. Postal worker doesn't know passphrase. Money safe.
1. Print out another copy of paper wallet, put back in new real wallet. Money safe.

Just to build on why this is bad: your wallet software assumes you're the only person who controls the addresses in it. So the software might cause Bitcoin to be deposited in any of those addresses, either by displaying one of them as the "send-to" address in a transaction, or by sending funds to it as a change address. If one of those addresses turns out to be a compromised address, you can bet that in a few minutes someone else will drain the balance.
An analogy might be a pocket in your pants with a hole in it. As long as you remember which pocket has the hole, you'll make sure you won't put anything in it. But it would be reasonable for your spouse or one of your kids to stick car keys or something else valuable in your pants pocket, and then you'd feel like a goof for wearing pants with a hole if you discovered that the item was now gone.

Your reasoning is at best circular. "At the current price of $100/BTC" is a valid assumption only until the asks go above $100. Which is (without my having looked at the relevant order books) likely to happen after the purchase of fewer than 1,000 BTC.
Consume the entire set of asks on all exchanges and do the math to figure out what it would take to buy all outstanding Bitcoin for sale right now. That's a very small fraction of 11m and much higher than $100/coin. You'd still be ignoring the effect of supply and demand on the order books, but at least that number would have some basis in reality.
