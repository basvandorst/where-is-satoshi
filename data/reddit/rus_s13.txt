Didn't he agree to the initial interview? There were some nicely taken photos of him; maybe i am mistaken though.

How many coins does he own?

I honestly think he was part of it. The INITIAL interview, he claimed to be a part of it, and even supplied the journalists with pictures of himself. 
THEN he denies everything, causing media mayhem.
Around the same time the MT Gox coins are moving. 
Coincidence? I cant believe how blatant this is.

Same reason any company sells any tool that would make an individual money. I don't understand what you're implying.
For instance, a company sells a lathe to an engineering firm, which starts to turn a profit after 12 months. Why did the original company sell the lathe when after a while it just prints money? 
Because they are set up in a market to make lathes, not machined parts.
Why do car companies sell cars to rental agencies, when they are just used to print money after a while?

"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says"

Please spend the rest of the day learning about bitcoin. 
In a few hours, you can learn a whole lot. This is somthing that you are going to have to understand very well - honestly it's not rocket science and will only take you a day of learning to get your hear around it all. 
I don't want to tell you that you'll be able to access his coins - you might not be able too. 
What can happen is that a stranger will say they'll 'help' you and then transfer all of your husbands bitcoins to themself, robbing you. Don't let this happen. Please read as much as you can about it, there are plenty of educational resources on the net for bitcoin.

A shopping center tried to charge me and a few other friends in high school, after doing some 'dusties' in their underground car park. 
Drawing tags in dust can be classed as vandalism; as defined by the owner. 
As long as they stick to easily removable plastic sheets, I think the public will agree no harm was done though. People hate graffiti artists, but this can be passed off as IRL viral marketing.

Also I don't think you understand how slow bitcoin mining is...

(I think) People who have invested during the media hype of the last couple of months; those have only recently found out about it
