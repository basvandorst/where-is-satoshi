Oh no, i'm in for the long hall. These coins are already in a paper wallet and stashed away to be forgotten of for at least a year. Then I'll re-assess.
I have another address that I just use for spending money/small purchases. I usually only fund it with money i intend on spending right away though.

damn you bitcoinity!
That's it, i'm removing all my bitcoin related bookmarks until such time as my verification goes through. Maybe i'll be surprised and will have dropped back down to below 500/btc....
/went from being able to buy 5 coins to just over 2... and dropping... Grrrrrrr

My plan was to stop looking at the charts and cross my fingers that the value suddenly drops right before my verification goes through. :)
As far as long term plans go, I have a paper wallet setup and waiting to be locked away and sat on for quite a while. I will add to it more slowly after initial purchase. Gonna have another online wallet with a much much smaller amount of BTC just for purchasing things with.
Solid enough plan? (That's a serious question, I'm still learning about this whole thing)

100 bucks, 1000 bucks. Don't care because i'm still waiting for my fucking account verification on cavirtex. Fuckers. Started the process when they were 400. fuck you cavirtex.
No offence to everybody, but I hope these fucking things crash through the floor soon. Then I'll feel better when I drop my money on them.
grumble grumble grumble.

Yeah, registered there early last week. Waiting on verification. Just was looking for a quicker way to "lock in" my purchase of BTC. With the market roller coastering up and down i'd feel better with my purchase said and done and put away.

Ugh, registered on canvirtex last week when they had just crossed 400. Still waiting on verification before they will let me buy anything. This is torture, I have about 3k set aside that is getting devalued every couple hours.

I opened a ticket a few days ago. To their credit, the support rep checked my application and pointed out a few problems with my identification that would have caused it to fail. 
I thought that was pretty good of them.
