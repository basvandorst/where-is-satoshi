-Bitcoin is digital money sent over the internet
-Bitcoin is free to use for anyone anywhere with an internet connection.
-The sourcecode for bitcoin can be read by anyone, anywhere with an internet connection. This means everyone can make sure no developer has made malicious changes.
-The key bitcoin technology protects against counterfeit bitcoins, and allows everyone to verify that the Bitcoins you receive are real.
-Anyone can propose changes, but they will not be accepted if they harm the technology.
-More and more shops, stores, and patrons are adding bitcoins to their portfolio.

Yeah but listen to [this]( guy. An individual isn't building the infrastructure you use everyday, no matter where in the country you are.
