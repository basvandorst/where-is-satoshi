search coinbase pro, sign up, link a bank account, and you're set. if you don't want to link a bank account/give your info then you're kinda SOL. if you don't mind it, then coinbasepro is free and the fees are quite low. although again you have to link a bank account and deposit funds from the bank which takes 5+ days usually. so plan ahead and deposit long before you intend to buy, otherwise you'll be paying closer to 1-1.5% fees.

Read this source:  then come back to me. By the way, if you decide not to read this source and comment anyway, I don't care for literally a single second anything you have to say until you back up with a source of your own. If you tell me "go look it up yourself hahaha its on the internet loser dumbass" then we're done here. 
Also, incorrect. Hydro power plants often waste power because they are not located close enough to society to actually use that electricity for other things. IF you had read the source I gave you, which I still think you won't do because you're stuck in your own ways and don't actually want to change your mind, you would know this. Hydropower plants actually are opening in larger quantities now because the previously wasted electricity is now being used on bitcoin and reduces operating costs. Transporting hydropower to useful places just wasn't easily feasible due to the costs involved. Now, with bitcoin miners being able to be set up anyway, that cost overheard is virtually gone. Even if they mine at a loss, its a smaller loss than the power being generated basically evaporating into thin air.
Other forms of renewable energy are usable for industry that do not have the barrier of entry that hydro does in that, again, hydropower cannot be easily transported as the plants producing it are often quite far from actual civilization.
Learn how to debate. Both sides of a debate provide sources, not just argue unprovable points in an attempt to win.

in all honesty, libra is a waste. paypal/venmo/cc online payments are sufficient. only way I'll use libra over cc's is if there is absolutely no fee, and provably lower costs (cc's generally have built in extra costs to offset rewards money.). but do you really believe facebook won't make some money off libra SOMEHOW?

Just did the math on it. Let's assume that he bought $100 every single month from Jan 2017 to July 2019. Now assume for December he made the mistake of saying "well it's 11k, it's way overbought, I'm not going to DCA this time" and then when it hits ATH, he says "it must be going to the moon now, surely! so I'm going to buy $100 again" at $19k. 
even shifting his dca for that month and buying at the worst possible time, he's up 148% from jan 2017 to now.
Buying $100 a month every month on the 1st and buying the $100 in December 2017 at ATH puts your average price at $5900. Which means a person having followed that strategy up until this point will break even if they sell at $5900.
Idk about you but I heavily doubt that we will see $5900 ever again, or at least for quite some time. If BTC follows previous streaks of crashing 80-85%, and previous streaks of new ATH's, then the next ATH should be something like $100K at the minimum which means after hitting the next ATH the min will be ~15-20k.

Downvote me all you want, dude. Idc. I wouldn't be posting about having that many bitcoin ANYWHERE. Sure the actual risk is probably low. But it doesn't mean that it's not possible at all that somebody would target him. If I was a hacker and thief, I definitely would consider it.
Plus, you never know. If the guy is careless enough that he has well over $1M in an untraceable asset and he's posting about it on reddit, he very well may be even more careless about it how he gets those bitcoins back, how he stores them, where he sells them, what wallet he uses, etc...
The risk you get from posting carelessly does not outweigh the benefit he might receive, especially when making an anonymous reddit account, and purchasing a $10 VPN (well worth it if this post is genuine) to ask this question could save him his life and/or his entire net worth.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to be on here saying that telling somebody you have 0.5 BTC or 1 BTC is particularly bad. But 100? Yeah, 100 is a risk I would not take myself.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:11:03
I doubt they would've hid that fact anyway.
Just because they had to disclose their assets for their etf strategy doesn't make it any less "dangerous". Your logic is a little flawed there. If a layman that had a similar amount of bitcoins revealed it, they wouldn't be in any more danger than the Winklevoss are.

that's just it though, you never know if its the "top" or not. many people sold at 8k, as doubling in price in under 3 months is fairly parabolic and yet it continued all the way past 10k to 14k and now is still at 10k. so those people thought it was time to "sell the top" and it turned out to not be the actual top.

admittedly a $50 window on $10k is fairly small and if you plan to hodl anyway that wouldn't matter much longer term.
I also want to point out that if you're trying to sell after the price rises 1% you should probably stop now. you're wasting your time and will almost certainly lose money against the bots/against the market fluctuations if you try to time sells like this.

You will also get downvoted to oblivion here for supporting BCH over BTC, what's your point lol? To be completely honest, the r/btc vs r/bitcoin shit is an exact parallel to current US politics. You go to democrat subreddit and agree with anything republican related and you get smashed with downvotes, same going to a republican subreddit and agreeing with anything democrat related.
People are so pathetically one-sided. What if, for one second consider this, that BTC is NOT digital gold? But that it set the groundwork for a digital gold to come about? Just as AOL wasn't the best internet back in it's days, but it probably helped speed up the process to get the internet where it is now?
But no, BTC is king because it was first, right? Smh.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:42:26
its more along the lines of, sure, if I put in $1000 I could easily just lose it all. but that $1000, if bitcoin gets truly adopted, could very well be worth $100K in a few years.

false. I can take a profit once and then take a bigger loss and subsequently lose money long term.

No, you're not. Your entire perception of the energy expenditures of BTC is flat wrong. Provably wrong. Most of the china miners use hydropower which does not contribute toxic gases to Beijing's air, or china's air, at all. Look it up. Something on the order of 80% of all BTC currently being mined is mined on hydropower. 
China has disgustingly bad air quality for other industries, not because of cryptocurrency. If you're going to argue about btc energy at least do some basic research on the topic, lmfao.

Except the american inflation theft system is much better, because it's not as noticeable and therefore most people don't care. What would you rather have?

Lol, ok man. I don't mind. In this subreddit, no matter how correct somebody is, it doesn't matter. If it's negative to bitcoin, even if it's true, it will get downvoted.
I like bitcoin like anybody else but guess what? Growth is a lot better when it's a slow and steady 5% a day, not when it surges 20-25%. Bitcoin surged from 12k to 13800 in 1 day, and it crashed down equally as fast. But notice how when it rose slowly from 7k to 10k that it held that value? THATS healthy. Not this extreme volatility.

if their salary is mathematically speaking becoming less but their purchasing power is the same, then the salary being less is irrelevant. but you're right that a lot of dumb ass people wouldn't understand that If they can buy the same amount of stuff (and this stays relatively stable) then it doesn't matter. however say that the price of goods is halved and wages are halved also, that's all fine and dandy until the price of goods changes.

Nice. I started in bitcoin the exact wrong way. panic sold and fomo'ed and the combination of those left me wrecked at the end of nov 2018 having been down ~$4k. admittedly most of that was because I was a noob and tried to get in on bch's pump and dumps. I got burned hard mostly on bch and eth buys. bitcoin itself didn't make me lose as much.
However I looked at all my circumstances and realized that $3k was the -85% point that bitcoin cyclically goes through, and I decided to DCA. I bought a few hundred $'s worth at ~3600 and when it went up I fomoed a large amount in at $3700 thinking that was it, and that I didn't want to miss the big moon if it happened. Nothing happened and I ultimately decided to hold it, basically with the intention to hold to at least $50K or below $3k if it dropped. I continued DCA'ing after that big buy all the way through $5K and stopped there as I needed most of my current money to buy a house. But yeah, DCA + that lucky call at $3700 has treated me quite nicely and overall right now I'm up a few hundred $'s including the losses from 2018. If I sold at ~$13k I would be up ~20% of my recent investment overall, which is significantly better than the stock market. And now I'm experienced in the swings and not an emotional trader so I would do a lot better.

I wish I could say it was enjoyable speaking with you, but it certainly wasn't. You're most likely another luddite boomer that is pissed he didn't get in on bitcoin early and so bashes it. That article literally tells you that gaming consoles and computers run through considerably more energy than bitcoin, yet I don't see your outcrys that the gaming industry is making you age prematurely! Or that cars exhaust makes you age prematurely? I mean jesus Christ, if you're so concerned with the environmental effects of bitcoin, why aren't you mad about cars? cars are the things fucking killing you.
But wait; you don't actually care about premature aging, you care about bashing bitcoin.

yeah or you have a 80% loss in 1 day. it goes both ways and sorry to tell you this but no, 170% increase in 24 hours doesn't happen in crypto unless you're investing in crazy shit. which is probably also true for stocks. so basically this guy probably got lucky in stocks and so his comment is useless but so is your response. lol

I mean, to be fair, to even purchase crypto on an exchange you have to verify arguably more than you need to verify or at the least approximately the same amount of info you have to verify to open a bank account. There's some valid points here but don't act like buying BTC through an exchange is a simple process. Just like having a bank account it is not simple until you have actually opened and set up everything. 
At this point I feel like we need some sort of "exchange" where all that crap doesn't need to be verified and you can trade person to person, but without the scare of losing your coins or being scammed.

I would like to add to your statement that he's rich af as the twitter CEO and thus it's almost irrelevant that's he invested in bitcoin. he can afford to lose it all; it's essentially a 0 risk investment to him because he has so little in it compared to his whole wealth. it's like one of us putting $1-$10 on bitcoin.
Not to mention he runs one of the most influential free speech platforms on the internet and actively censors one political side and not the other. is that not seriously ironic considering he supports bitcoin because of the decentralization aspect?

yep. bitcoin cash is arguably what has led us to the bottom and crypto winter. who the fuck wants to hold an altcoin (and some people see it as any crypto at all) when you're unable to sell it because the two sides of the fork can't agree? 
the only upside to that whole shit with the bitcoin cash fork was that it reminded us that not your keys, not your coins and to get your shit off exchanges. it completely fucked the whole market besides that
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:19:32
Most banks in the US charge various fees for various functions, and the .01% interest rate will almost be guaranteed not to surpass those fees. so in other words, it's not just you; banks in US pretty much charge fees unless if you have so much money that the abysmal interest rate outdoes them.

Yeah, but there also wasn't high speed, high tech internet existing 70 years ago either. I reckon if credit cards came about only 10 years ago they probably very much would be able to handle the traffic.
Not trying to diss bitcoin or anything but don't be disingenuous by stating that a credit card couldn't keep up with current speeds at it's release. Of course it couldn't, there wasn't efficient internet, or really internet at all, at that point in history.

@_date: 2019-03-07 12:13:43
Not that it matters if he spent $10k a week on BTC anyway, considering he's worth $5.6b. Also, some people are saying that "while he's worth 5.6b, he doesn't have 5.6b in liquid assets." That is true, but he also recently sold $80M of stock so regardless, $10k is still very little. it's like me or you spending $5-10 on bitcoin a week.
@_date: 2019-03-09 02:56:59
Did you watch the joe rogan podcast with him on it? I'll be honest I was fairly against Jack Dorsey before but after that, he does sound slightly honest about wanting to improve the platform. But the bullshit reasons that they gave for banning mostly conservatives (Especially the lawyer lady) were laughable at best.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:52:00
I don't believe this bullshit for one second. 
I always see these ridiculous advertisements on how to make it big in the stock market! or how to make it big in crypto!
all of that and more for only $499!
But you take a step back and gotta ask yourself, why the fuck is this person trying to sell me crypto and stock advice for $499 if they're so damn good at it? wouldn't they just trade and make heavy gains in the market if they were so skilled?
it doesn't make any fucking sense. it's all a scam and people like you are the ones pushing it/falling for it.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:33:12
\&gt; Why don't you just leave?
Because leaving isn't a long term solution. If all the conservatives got off twitter and made their own platform, suddenly you have a platform geared specifically 100% for the left (twitter) and another platform geared specifically 100% for the right (whatever it would be called). And now instead of having some parts of both factions debating ideas and coming to conclusions on certain issues, you've got no debate happening because everyone lives in their ideological bubbles. A better solution is to stop being so god damn hypocritical and banning conservatives for at most dull insults while leaving people like Kathy Griffin who literally called for the deaths of the Covington students to spew her hatred all she likes.
How is that a preferred solution to you? Competitors to twitter have been tried and are still being tried and are still failing, you can't just say "get off the platform" and expect that to be a solidified solution. It wouldn't work and would lead to a far bigger divide than we already currently have. Twitter is one of the most influential opinion based platforms to ever come about and to say that conservatives should just "make their own" doesn't take into account the kind of effort it would take to make such a thing and make it successful. 
Yes, Twitter is free, but who gives a shit if it's free if it's censoring one side way more heavily than the other? Even classical  libertarians care about this happening, because shutting down free speech only from one side is a dangerous precedent.
And I know what your response will be...Something like, "Twitter is a private corporation, they can do what they want". That may be the case but it's still sad to see.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:05:27
you can call it cherry picking if you want. but the fact remains that people who bought in btc in December 2017 and held until now lost a fuck ton of money. a lot more than people who held FIAT since 1980, even. and again, just because BTC had insane rallies in the past, does not mean that they will continue in the future. 
I personally believe it will and I hope it does. But again, this "fiat lost 99% of its value in 100 years" thing is ridiculous when BTC has (many times) lost 80% of its value in ONE year. at least with fiat you know you're losing 2% a year. with BTC you could lose or gain anywhere from 0-90%. and arguably if you've invested in stocks since 1990 your money has gone up against inflation, not down.
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:18:39
Income inequality isn't inherently unfair, it's more that it's unfair if they used illegal and/or immoral practices to create that inequality. If I work 80 hours a week compared to my friend working 40 and i make more money, that's not inherently unfair. If i work 20 hours a week and do illegal things that allow me to make more, then that is.

\&gt; I  don't know. Do you think you're going to convince anyone of anything by telling them their opinions are unwelcome and unhelpful?!? 
No, I don't. But my goal here never was to convince you of anything. I was merely giving my opinion on a public forum. Meanwhile, you continue to cuss at me and call me stupid, bring up other insults and then also have the audacity to state that I need to "mature about a decade"? Do you believe that mature people insult eachother and throw cuss words around in an argument that isn't even heated? I don't. The irony here is stuff that you just cannot make up. 
I never insulted you. I merely said "you act like it's so easy to change" after going on some insanely long and unneeded rant about capitalism. And when I asked you a few comments before this one to elaborate on what exactly the solution is, since you seem to believe that it's going to be easy. And you won't. You won't because you haven't thought this one out clearly. You're so anti 1% and anti capitalism yet you have no better solution, at all. None. I'll be here waiting. 
\&gt; I have little patience for your stupidity
Yeah, see, again, even if I insulted you first (which I didn't; just said I don't particularly care for your opinion after you had previously said that to me \*first\*)  you continue to spew hatred while I actually decided I did want to hear your opinion.
So, let's sum this up. You got all pissed off because I said I didn't want your opinion. You slightly convinced me that maybe I did want your opinion, and I changed my mind. But then instead of what a normal person would do, which is be civil and give me your solution/opinion, you just get even more angry and spew more bullshit and tell me that I'm stupid, etc. You should give me credit for deciding that maybe, just maybe, this fellow redditor has information that might change or alter my worldview, and being open to hear it. But no, you double down that I'm stupid, close minded (which is really ironic at this point), selfish, etc. 
How the fuck does that make any sense? You simultaneously tell me to grow up and mature yet you're the one cussing and acting like a child for the last like four responses. Now, give me a legitimate response with what your solution is or go away, because I've given you multiple chances to contribute something meaningful and you're failing repeatedly.

Also, I want to add that even in the western world, with all these bullshit ridiculously large fees Visa/MC have been adding, I wouldn't be surprised if the switch to crypto happens soon. If nothing else, businesses accepting BTC and then immediately offloading it to fiat for a 1% fee or w/e would still be better.
A google search said that for businesses, Visa/MC charge between 2.5%-3%. So the crypto option would still be better. Again this assumes they basically immediately convert to fiat (at least while BTC remains volatile. who knows when that will change) so as not to lose money due to price fluctuations.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:25:43
Of course all of this will be better when crypto gets completely adopted (which I hope it will) and we don't have to do any fiat conversions. paying in satoshis only :)

I buckled down and said screw it a few weeks ago when it was at $3700. Thinking "it will go down more, and then I'll buy a ton." but then I remembered that every time I've done that in the past I ended up missing the dip. 
I stepped back and thought "but what if it doesn't go back down again?". I also believe it won't go below $3K or if it does, it won't go below $3k by much, so I figured this is potentially my last chance to get it close to the bottom.

yea unpopular opinion here on r/btc but HODL is literally such a stupid fucking meme. it's more about: don't panic sell when the price swings $200, but make sure you have stop losses if you're trading it in the short term.
 I said fuck HODL when it began to crash from $6500 and sold at $5300 because I knew that the Btrash hard fork drama was going to fuck the market. and it did. bitcoin dropped all the way to $3500 and hasn't recovered since.

Yeah, I agree. I'm even more curious to see what will happen to the cryptospace as a whole when the US hits a recessionary period.

it's already been debunked that bitcoin is actually good for the environment because it can be mined with excessive/wasted power from hydropower plants and thus the incentive to make renewable energy in the form of hydropower plants has risen.

I don't think bitcoin is a solution to this. How do you eliminate liquidity power production just by moving to decentralization?

This is precisely the reason why interest rates go up when inflation is down and vice versa. Lender wants to make the same (or more) amount of money. If inflation is up, then interest rates go down because lenders need to remain competitive. If inflation is down, then interest rates go up because the lender won't be making as much as he was before and wants to make the same.

Still beats sinking money into a rental where you get nothing back. Would you rather:
1) "Own" a property that you own 80% of, the remaining 20% being yearly taxes to the government over the course of ownership
or 
2) Rent a property in which all the money you pay is literally gone; no equity, no potential to rent in the future, no potential to sell in the future, nothing. Just money that goes to somebody else for no work.
It is fairly clear.

Pretty much. Why should I pay other people's healthcare bills? Especially when the majority of healthcare bills are from people being unhealthy as fuck. How about we have a conversation about unhealthy processed food, rampant EMF in the atmosphere, fossil fuels being burned into the air we breathe, etc before we talk about fucking healthcare? Address unhealthyness before it turns into cancer.
Yes, 5% of my income, spread out over my entire life will absolutely cover any serious issues that I would have to pay for, and if it doesn't, I have insurance against having to pay a ton, anyway. And guess who I have insurance from? Not the fucking government. From a private institution. 
When you make $50K a year and are taxed an extra 30% of your income for healthcare, you tell me what's worse? Paying a 30% overall tax rate and then paying $5000 a year for healthcare (which is actually quite a lot if you are young and healthy, anyway, and so the actual number you'd be spending is quite smaller), or paying a 60% tax rate and having free healthcare? Have you actually made a legitimate cost-benefit analysis of any of this, lol? 
Even $30K a year that's an extra $9000 you lose to taxes for "universal healthcare". 
Nothing in life is free my friend. Socialism might make it seem like that, but at some point you run out of other peoples money, which is exactly why the tax rates in all of the countries you bring up is so much higher :)

Real estate keeps up with inflation, nothing wrong with that. It's actually a myth that house prices of the 70s has gone up relative to wages. My father had to work something like 20,000 hours to pay off his first house, and it was quite a small one. Whereas now, federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and could get you a cheap house in the same amount of time. That being said though, my dad had a legit career, not flipping burgers at mcdonalds...Minimum was never meant to be a living wage.
Anyways, houses now are also significantly bigger and come with more amenities than ever before, so why should they not also be more expensive, anyway?

Average customer? Probably would take a lot. I guess to increase adoption they could run a sale of some sort, maybe 5% off. 
I don't see it happening, though. Amazon literally offers you free money just to sign up for one of their cards. And the reason is because they make that money back in interest easily from people who fail to pay it off in time. Until people start being responsible enough to pay back credit cards on time, and not accruing all this bullshit interest, the credit card companies will continue to thrive.
What would be interesting in my opinion is if there was some way to have a crypto lend. Where you would borrow a certain amount of crypto, tagged with the fiat equivalent, and then have to pay the same fiat equivalent in crypto back, to a real person, with a smaller interest rate. Then maybe credit card companies would be scared. but I don't think they're the least bit frightened now. Although maybe the recent story with Kroger rejecting visa fees and looking into accepting crypto might tell us a different story.
Anways, I don't think the path forward is using paypal to hold BTC. The whole point is to move away from companies/exchanges. At best an exchange or paypal holding BTC should be temporary. At worst it's MTGox or QuadrigaCX all over again.

Absolutely. My only main point was that people on this subreddit always go "bank bad, therefore mortgage bad" which is silly. People are always going to need somewhere to live, so at the very worst of the economy you can at least rent a house, and at the very best you can sell it at a profit, or at a relatively low risk guarantee of keeping up with inflation. And even then, if you don't move you have eliminated a rent payment by paying off a house. 
And then if you include the fact that you can rent a house while living in it, the benefits skyrocket even farther compared to renting.

I do understand supply and demand. But I'm talking about bitcoin as a *currency*. 
Currency is defined as: a system of money in general use in a particular country
So do you believe that bitcoin is in general use by HODLers? I don't. Again, my point is that as a currency, it has to be used. That's like saying if 95% of people that owned US dollars and didn't buy anything, that the US dollar is an effective currency. It's not. Currency is what you use as a medium of exchange, so if you're not exchanging it for anything, ever...then it's not a currency. Insulting me by trying to imply I don't understand supply and demand just shows you're wrong.

@_date: 2019-03-12 11:23:01
Again, I'm not making the argument that it's not a currency because people HODL It. People HODL usd and the euro all the time. But they also use *some* of it to buy things. The vast majority of people buying BTC do *not* buy anything, in my experience. of course this is anecdotal and I could be wrong, but insofar as my experience goes with people on this sub, they aren't buying anything. Money only does so much while it's sitting around in a bank or under a mattress.

.1% isn't even keeping with inflation just so you know, so you're really getting screwed by the bank who's lending your money at a much, much higher interest rate. fair enough, if we consider a bank as a business rather than as a public service provider meant to help people store their money. hint: its a business, not the other one.
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:53:39
You own bitcoin and pay money that you're directly losing into a rental property. 
You could own a house, pay a mortgage, rent the house, be paying into equity and using the rental money to buy bitcoin, and be risk diverse. Instead, you're going too much into bitcoin and have way higher of a risk portfolio then you should have.
Agree to disagree, but we'll see 20 years down the line who's doing better. If bitcoin tanks, I will, and if bitcoin moons, I'll still profit a fair bit from it. Whereas if bitcoin tanks, you'll be fucked.

source for "almost all its value"? you BTC fanboys are crazy. I love BTC and the concept of it myself but let's not pretend like USD Fiat lost 80% of its value in a year like BTC did. and it remains to be shown if BTC will recover. if historical trends follow (and I hope they do) then it will, but theres never a guarantee of that. 
you can say what you like and dislike about USD but the fact is that even if USD lost 50% of its value since 1990, thats still a much slower change than 80% in a year, lmfao. and like i gotta say said, wages have increased, and while not exactly on par with inflation, it's still dishonest to say that "oh my god fiat's value has dropped 50% and wages are the same" because wages arent the same.

I'm invested into a house more for a long term profit generator then anything else. Currently paying off a $2150/month 15 year loan mortgage by renting to two people, and so when I move out and move somewhere else I have this property to rent for a few years and then sell at a profit.
For (potentially) higher returns I also own bitcoin and have a company matched 401k and stocks. But the rental situation with the house is the greatest return of all because the money required going in will cease to be required at one point whereas the returns will continue to come in through a rental property manager.

btc -&gt; fiat -&gt; goods is a step. but it's not where I'd actually like to be.

He's correct in that regard but incorrect in general with regards to a mortgage vs renting. Renting is only worth it if you invest the difference between renting and buying a house into the stock market, which most people will not be responsible enough to do, and even then, depending on how much you are able to rent for, this is not good enough to make it worth it. 
For example, a $300K mortgage at 3% would be worth having if you can't rent the same house for less than $1,250 a month. This assumption also includes repair costs for the house at 1%/year which is quite high if I'm being honest.

There's nothing inherently evil about being rich, anyway. It's about how you amassed such wealth. IF you did it through immoral means, then you are evil. But if you just made a series of good decisions, and with some luck, became rich, you shouldn't be hated for it.

Yes, but doesn't change the fact that it is widely held by a few, just like traditional money. Facts are facts. 
.01% of wallets hold 42% of all coins, and .06% of wallets hold 62% of all coins. 
This is actually WORSE than traditional money, where it is estimated that 50% of the wealth is held by 1% of people. So, to summarize:
In bitcoin, .01% of wallets (and this is also assuming 1 wallet = 1 person which is a terrible assumption) hold 42% of all coins, where in traditional wealth, 1% of all people hold 50% of all traditional wealth. So in fact, wealth is actually centralized in the riches hands in bitcoin 10x more than normal.
But, you can go ahead and ignore my math and sources and just say "but that's like arguing the second law of thermodynamics isn't true! reee!!!"
The ONLY benefit to bitcoin is that most of us have the chance to buy a bigger stake in it than we could possibly have in traditional wealth systems.

Exactly, because you're paying 4% in interest which is fairly easy to make more than that elsewhere. Whether it's gold, stocks, or bitcoin.

It's mostly due to overpopulation and automation, to be honest. Also, nobody ever said minimum wage was going to be a living wage. if you're struggling to live on minimum wage with a family, which most people would, then you need to work on some skill or something to produce something more valuable. Sorry, but if 99% of people in society can be a cashier or flip burgers, that wage is not going to be very large. Learn a skill that most people don't know and you set yourself higher than the least common denominator.

There are other reasons healthcare costs so much in the US, though, not because we aren't taxed enough for it. One of those being a ridiculous amount of administrative fees coming from the ridiculous amount of administrative jobs in healthcare that are often not needed.
Another being the insane cost of insurance that doctors must have because of malpractice lawsuits being on the rise.

Lol, they also used to say there was no way bitcoin would ever touch $10,000 back when it was $100 a coin, yet it near doubled that. 
Never say never. Put as much money as you don't mind losing into it, and in a few years you'll either have made a fantastic investment or a terrible one. Point is, diversify your risk portfolio.

Hard to say. There are more people in the space in general from what I've seen. IT could very well be exchanges continuing to lie about trading volume, but the coinmarketcap daily volume of bitcoin right now is close to what it was around the peak of December 2017. And the price is 25% of what it was. 
At this point, my guess is that BTC will not go back below $3500, and will continue to just slowly rally for the remaining of the year, maybe ending around $6000-$7000 in December. And then rally a bit harder in early 2020 with the next halvening.

Like bitcoin, the only people losing in the real estate game are people who either bought at stupid times (i.e. bought when the housing market prices were booming) or, like cryptocurrency bought in stupid places (i.e. shitholes like baltimore, or poor areas of chicago etc; compared to crypto would be people buying highly speculative altcoins)
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:59:26
um, not really. linear charts are irrelevant, for one. the percentage increase is what matters. if you look at a log chart you'll see a different story. for example, this rise happened in bitcoin previously:
October 14 2013, price was $141.91
December 04 2013, price was $1150.00
That's a 700% increase in price over the course of October to early December.
This most recent explosion in 2017 went from 
October 04 2017 -&gt; price of $4345
December 17 2017 -&gt; price of $19300
This is "only" an increase in price of 345%. In other words, there have actually been bigger "bubbles" percentage-wise and yet those bigger percentage bubbles weren't the last.
Again, it would be dishonest both to say that it's guaranteed to happen again, and also to say that it's guaranteed not to. Nobody actually knows what will truly happen. But history has repeated with bitcoin before, so a lot of people on here like to think it will happen again. We shall see. I don't know about you, but the possibility of losing a few grand vs the possibility of making 3-4 times the investment seems like a good risk to take.
If you even look closer at these dates, you'll see the price booms have coincided right near bitcoin halvings. That's no way possibly a coincidence.

The other guy might not be, but the guy he sold to has to be. 
Somebody has to be at a loss for somebody to make profit. 
Take a market with 1000 traders, each entering with $100. Now let that market run for a month, with nobody else allowed to come in (for simplification) or put more money in then when they started.
At the end of it, if 200 traders leave with $200, then they all profited $20k total which means that at *minimum* 20 people lost money. There's no other way mathematically for the 200 traders to leave on a profit if at least 20 people didn't leave on a loss.

lol I was making a joke on your name. I don't actually care at all about this bullshit article, not did I even necessarily say you were wrong. but just saying the argument you chose was utter garbage. 
there's proof that fasting can tackle weight problems. doesn't mean that people will do it. 
Just like in the context of your argument, even if there *is* proof that bitcoin can tackle hyperinflation, it might not for multiple reasons. Let's assume for a second that it can tackle hyperinflation. Then it still might not, because:
1) People might not have the knowledge of what bitcoin is. Lack of information.
2) It might be banned/unlawful to use in Venezuela, by violent suppression.
3) People may not have access to bitcoins because of lack of access to computers/internet. Very likely in Venezuela.
Again, not saying your argument is inherently incorrect, just the way you are going about it.

It could very well be a fair comparison. There's never a guarantee that BTC will boom another 500% in the next big bull run. Just because it happened before doesn't mean it will happen again. 
"If you bought at any time before that, you would have been fine."
Um, not really? Many people bought right before when it was 8-18k, and have lost money since if they held. And again, there IS NOT a guarantee that bitcoin will go back to those values. 
I like BTC as much as most of the people on here but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that even long term bitcoin is a 100% safe investment because it isn't. There. is. no. guarantee.

Amazon doesn't accept crypto. Also note that I said conveniently? Point me to some retail stores that don't have insane prices that accept crypto since you know so many of them. Fair enough, I wasn't aware you could buy giftcards with bitcoin and then use giftcards to buy shit. That's still not exactly the same thing, though; if I buy gift cards with bitcoin from egifter, it's not the same thing as buying goods directly with bitcoin. That's an annoying as fuck process for somebody that's actually commonly buying a lot of shit. Again, I'm talking about convenience here, because the only way that mass adoption will actually happen is if it is convenient to buy directly with crypto, not do this workaround bullshit solution that takes extra time and doesn't do anything for me as long as fiat exists.

everything he's saying works until it doesn't. you can sell the 4k highs and buy the 3800 lows over and over again until all of a sudden the price moves out of those ranges. 
which either can seriously hurt you or seriously benefit you depending on whether you bought or sold and whether it moved up or down. this is honestly the reason why trading successfully can be pretty hard.
example take when the price was stabilized at around 6k for awhile. i'm sure people were trading those margins pretty heavily. but then all of a sudden the price tanked to below $4k and now all the people that bought $5800 thinking it was a low now got screwed.

If a currency isn't fixed (as USD isn't) it can be printed out of thin air, which makes all existing USD dollars less valuable. That's why fixed vs not matters, mainly. If an economy has 100 trillion dollars circulating, and you introduce 25 trillion more the next day, the value of all dollars in that economy drops because the supply increased. This is what is happening with USD. As far as I know they aren't introducing that many but the point is still there.
Honestly people are forgetting that house prices are increasing mostly because of an increase in population. There are other problems happening, of course. But a big part of it is definitely population. Not to mention as population increases, and people who already owned a house still need somewhere to live, land to make new houses is also decreasing. When you have population increasing AND land availability decreasing, it doesn't take a scientist to understand why house prices are increasing. 
Not to say that there aren't problems with the USD inflation, there definitely is. But people act like switching to bitcoin will fix everything. I guess we'll find out.

Do you live in one of these countries now? If not, do you pay for someone elses healthcare now? why or why not?
I ask you, in a serious manner, why the FUCK I should subsidize somebody else's unhealthy ass fucking habits. Sure, we can all agree that if someone else got fucked genetically it's only fair to help pay for their healthcare costs. But the problem with this line of thinking is that this is vastly oversimplified. How do you determine people who are legitimately genetically unlucky vs. those are just living with unhealthy habits? I can tell you straight up that your socialist healthcare systems do not do this. So if some fucking prick wants to get fat as shit and eat nothing but junk food his whole life, suddenly its part of the "community" that I have to pay for his healthcare? No.
You keep bringing up this "community" idea. I say fuck the government and if you want a community where people can help eachother with healthcare costs then make one yourself. Legalized violence to force me to pay for your healthcare is complete garbage and the idea that, me being forced at gunpoint to pay for YOUR healthcare is somehow "communal" is laughably stupid. Leave charity and government separate. The government is there for inalienable rights, not for wealth distribution.
Again, why don't we talk about the problems that lead to rampant cancer, and work on solutions for those first? Such as:

3) Unhealthy breathing air from pollution
4) Excessive blue light at night disrupting circadian rhythm which has a massive impact on health and weight in general, and the fact that nobody seems to care about blue light whatsoever
5) Drinking and drugs used in excess, or really at all, increase risk of cancer
6) Vapes, smoking cigarettes, laced legal drugs (marijuana for instance)

Let's compare apples to oranges then, if you like.
Sweden has social healthcare and affordable education, while the US does not. The US also has tax rates anywhere from 10-30% for the majority of the population, while Sweden has a tax rate at 60%+.
So sure, you get free healthcare, but it's not actually free, as you have to spend 30% more of your income on it. Let me tell you this much; I don't spend any where near even 5% of my income on healthcare, and I live in the US. 
Education is another story, but even so, the problem with education costing so much has little to do with capitalism or the government's lack of funding and more to do with ridiculous amounts of administrators that are paid through the roof and not needed.
So, what would you rather have? The current US system where you actually get to take home some of your money, without or half of it being robbed by the government at gunpoint, or Sweden's system where you take home only 35-40% of the money you've earned but get "*free*" healthcare?

You can absolutely select specific instances and claim a trend if there are absolutely zero instances where a verified twitter user posting left leaning opinions was banned for any opinion whereas there are many, many, many for conservative verified twitter users. You can also just go look at their rules as it is. 
The TOS for twitter already has a rule where you cannot "misgender" people. Well the conservative opinion regarding misgendering is that misgendering isn't a concept because there are only two genders as it stands. So they already have a rule that conservatives politically don't regard as legitimate, there are no such rules for twitter's tos in the opposite direction towards democrats.

You're looking at this the wrong way. Bitcoin going from $100 to $10,000 was an increase of 100x. Bitcoin going from $10,000 to $100,000 is an increase of 10x. My only point was that if in the past it could raise 100x, why are people here acting like 10x now is impossible? Just because it's suddenly in the "mainstream"? What would you define the mainstream as, anyway? Because the amount of people that own bitcoin is far from a majority.

Why do you act like a jump from $0.001 to $1 isn't life altering? Assuming you put $10000 in when it was $0.001 and  $10000 in when it was $10,000, the more "life altering" jump is clearly $0.001 to $1.....Math is hard though, I get it :)

So, in order to make my point invalid you would have to assume a doomsday scenario? It's highly unlikely the population in our lifetimes will dwindle to such a number.
But you are absolutely correct on part 1. That being said, if you buy land and put a house on it, even though you have to pay taxes on it, you still have power over if somebody builds above you or not. So in effect, land is still limited, but perhaps not as in the same way I originally stated.

You still pretend like bitcoin is 100% guaranteed to go to $1,000,000 in 10 years, which it is not. There are MANY hurdles to such a massive price spike/adoption, that everyone on this sub blatantly ignores. 
This whole god damn sub is an echo chamber of "bitcoin moon no problem" with nobody actually discussing how to fix the current problems that it has. Sure you can say "bitcoin best investment since 2010" because you have hindsight to say so, but it also could very well have been the worst.

I don't buy what that guy is talking about. There's no logic in that post whatsoever. 


For the time being, she's not at a loss, sure. That assumes the "advice" that you never lose anything until you sell. Which in my honest opinion is fairly irrelevant because fact of the matter is, if you buy a stock and the price goes down, and never comes back up, you lost money whether you sold the stock or not. 
So this applies to Jenny. On paper she hasn't lost anything but if she sells at a lower price then she has. If she sells at a higher price then the person that bought at the higher price follows the same foot steps. That next person will lose unless the price goes up/stays the same.
This process will repeat indefinitely until somebody buys at the top and doesn't get to resell.
Sure, the stock market isn't a zero sum game as long as the price goes up indefinitely.
But that's not guaranteed

Sure, and this makes sense, but the main discussion point and point of contention is that people don't agree what is "way more then you need". What is the cap to human wealth that any one person morally should have, if any? How do we agree on such a number?
And if we even do agree on such a number, how do you actually prevent someone from getting more? If you say to this ultra rich class that they are only allowed to have assets of 10 billion, they will find ways to hide the surplus, no matter how many laws you try to implement to stop them.

The president of the USA has MASSIVE amounts of security, he does not. 
The president of the USA can do all sorts of things to anyone that touches him, that he cannot.
The president of the USA monetarily speaking has no threat whatsoever, as he has all of his money in assets and fiat which are untouchable/refundable, which bitcoin does not.
But please, keep arguing for the sake of arguing when you've been blatantly proven wrong by the countless # of bitcoin hacks happening recently, in which the vast majority of people do NOT get their money back, while when people's identities are stolen and fiat is stolen it gets almost immediately refunded by some bank.

 &gt; for example in the form of a corporate fascist state.
so let me guess, you think Donald Trump is a fascist, then? 


Sure, I can agree with that.


They don't. Define always, provide some numbers. I'm assuming you don't mean literally always = 100%, because that's definitely not how often they rule in favor of corporations.


Why should I be held liable to pay for damages when I'm not the one deciding what power to use? That's crazy. Consider this hypothetical. If I wanted an uber ride, and uber offered me a tesla ride somewhere for $15 where the driver is using electric rather than oil, and then offered me a ford f150 ride where the driver is more desperate for money and so would only take $10 but clearly is using a large amount of natural gas, which ride do you think I would take? You're saying that I should pay back the difference (and more) to some environmental agency. No, this is a free market and if all I care about is getting somewhere the cheapest then that's the option I am going to pick.
Maybe a better alternative then forcing my hand and who I have to pay reparations to is to incentivize environmental decency? I'm not going to pretend to know the best way to do so, but possibly less subsidization of oil.


And what if people don't want to pay that? And even if you legally enforce the price that way, that doesn't stop black market oil sellers from popping up. This is an ineffective solution.


Who gives a shit, dude? Healthy expectancy is still triple what it was 100 years ago thanks to medical advances. If we all gain 40 years on our lives thanks to medical expenses and lose 1.5 to bad air quality, but don't have to live in the forest where 1) you would have a lower quality of life, and 2) would have a much lower health expectancy, I don't see the issue here.


Proof? Running on the assumption that this actually happened, I agree with you here. I don't think that they should subsidize in that way. I also don't think that government bailouts were a good idea. 


You mean like the negative connotation with certain drugs/the war on drugs? If that's what you mean, then yes I agree, the war on drugs has only made the drug problem worse in America, not better. Anything the gov tries to ban gets more prevalent and worse.

Not always. There are pensions that are just given for working hard. There are also pensions that you contribute to. 
Either way, pensions that you contribute to are generally called 401ks. The literal definition of pension says nothing about where the retirement money is coming from.

You act like it's mutually exclusive to have the following two opinions at once:
1) Bitcoin might go up and therefore is worth investing in, despite the risk
2) Bitcoin might go down and not hit a new ATH ever, and therefore investing a *large* amount in it is too risky
It's not. I'm betting and mostly *hoping* that bitcoin moons. That being said I don't want my life to be ruined if it doesn't, and therefore I'm only putting in money that I'm willing to lose. And not betting on credit cards.

Cherrypicking dates to prove a point. You can cherrypick dates on either side to prove either point. But the difference is that while both have gone up since conception (or discovery, for gold's sake), bitcoin has gone up astronomically more.

You're simplifying the problem pretty pathetically.
It's more like;
Certain things that have to be used by everyone in society have to be paid for. Public roads, public water infrastructure, public schooling, etc. Who's going to pay for it? Well everyone benefits from it, so everyone should pay some into it. So, everyone agrees to pay into these services because they benefit society.
That being said, if you don't comply, you're breaking the rules of society (laws), and therefore force will be used.

Correct, you're right, it doesn't. But my only point is that, he's claiming republicans are satan for doing this, while I'm sure back when Obama was doing it, crickets. Just like the media said nothing about it. Don't complain about republicans doing something and then say nothing when democrats do the same thing. It's blatant hypocritic bullshit and isn't helping anyone.
In fact, Obama actually deported far more illegals than Trump has. So miss me with that garbage argument that Trump is inhuman scum because he wants to secure the borders, because as it turns out, (though secretively), so do the democrats. But they won't tell you that, because then they don't get your vote.

This is not factually accurate. You're assuming demand stays the same, and therefore the price. Cost to produce bitcoin is heavily correlated on the current price because of hardware costs fluctuating in relation to the current price (because if the price of BTC begins to outpace the cost to mine it, demand to mine goes up and thus the difficulty resets to correct this).
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:40:48
And here's how I know talking to you is pointless. You wouldn't pay 30% on your income in taxes if you made $500 in a year. There's a minimum amount of required income to pay taxes at all.
Millions and eventually billions will starve or overheat thanks to the ecosystem that's being destroyed by the wealthiest pillaging the world for the cheapest labor and resources in order to make the largest possible profits, which is then used to buy political power and eliminate competition.
Um, actually, no. Lab produced meat is quite close to being quite cheap, probably because the free market promotes price reduction. So, quite the opposite. As money flows into lab produced meat, a market which will never not be needed, we will see significantly less world hunger than ever before.
But again, you clearly don't have a legitimate grasp on how the tax system works if you think you have to pay income tax on $500/year income. Which makes me think you have a bit of a one-sided view of all of this. In fact, you currently have to make more than $12000 a year to owe any taxes. A simple google search and you would know this:

Exactly. The question honestly remains whether it's immoral or not for humans to ignore fixing this "issue" (whether it's an issue or not is one of the main questions, honestly). 
I would make the case that wealth inequality isn't THAT immoral. John Rawls probably has the most fair solution to it, which is that you help the bottom get out of poverty, but don't have to obliterate or limit extreme wealth either. Instead of taking the wealthiest peoples money and spreading it out until everyone is worth exactly the same, you leave the middle class relatively untouched and give them nothing, but give a small portion of the most wealthiest's money to the poorest, to level the playing field.
The problem is this sounds great on paper but generally fails because welfare systems are often abused and often don't actually bring people out of poverty but actually keep them dependent on that money, instead of making them independent.

and how do you compare the value, then? you have to have something else to compare the value to, otherwise your argument falls apart. 
say bitcoin is $10k at the beginning of 2020. say 1 year later the usd falls in value to 0.98 per original $1. then if bitcoin is $10204 at the end of 2020, it has the same "value" as it did before. but the point still remains that you NEED some other comparison. what are you going to do, compare 1 btc to how many goods it gets you? you can do that if you like, but comparing it to fiat is easier because fiat comparisons to baskets of goods are already computed quite commonly.

My point wasn't that bitcoin would be valuable. My point was that gold wouldn't be.
What would be valuable with no electricity? Copper, brass, lead (used to make bullets), water, and food.
Also, you still failed to explain what exactly would make gold valuable with no electricity. "It will be used for trade" is such a generic and unprovable assumption. Yes, gold USED to be used for trade before electricity. But since the inception of electricity there hasn't been global outages of power, so we don't know that would continue.

holding certainly is a winning strategy. look at bitcoins history, look at general stocks (for good companies) histories. it all goes back up.
if you bought bitcoin on any day of the last 98% of its history and held, you're in the green.
at this point, you basically got fucked if you bought in dec 2017, and maybe part of jan 2018. and that's about it.

He has no valid source. First of all, "mass shooting" isn't a widely accepted and rigidly defined term. What I mean by this is that many different sources reporting on "mass" shootings actually in fact do not define the same way what a mass shooting even is. So, even if he had said source, he would have to compare that to only other sources using the same definition.
According to the deadliest mass shootings, i.e. shootings with 10 or more deaths, there has been 9 under trump and 8 under Obama. Not exactly a "8 fold" increase, as he claims.
I look forward to seeing if he actually has any sources, specifically non-bias sources. If he presents CNN, NYTimes, vox, buzzfeed, any of that garbage, than I won't even bother with it. In fact, if he even cites fox I don't care. Cite something that is nonpartisan.

Well I got burned also and made a call at $3700 that it would go back up and so far that has helped recoup most of my losses, but I'm not going to pretend like it's guaranteed that it will blow past $20k. that being said, I still think the high risk is worth it because the potential gains are insane.

And what's the issue with this? Would you rather have a currency that is divisible by 100, or 100 million? This is a feature, not a bug.


The only valid point you're making here. But with LN and other improvements, this is a temporary issue at worst.


Sure, you can cherrypick your time frame to suggest bitcoin is a bad investment. But time and history tells that bitcoin has been a positive investment if you hold if you bought literally any day and held of the last 98% of the days that it has been around. Source: 
It definitely does not cost 10-15% in fees. Sure it might if you use an exchange. But what stops somebody from paying 0.15% - 0.30% fees on coinbase or another exchange and transferring it to their own hardware wallet, which costs at most $100? You're delusional.


Clearly it has an inherent value if people are willing to pay over $9000 for one of them. It has a practical use. It has the use of removing the financial middleman that has been printing money and slowly destroying the economy with fake debt, loaning 20x the reserves it holds. At any point if a recession hits hard and people do a bank run, you better believe you're first in line or suddenly you're not getting your money back. FDIC insurance is not as effective in those times as they like to spout.
Waste of electricity? Bitcoin uses upwards of 75% renewable energy and actually incentivizes renewable hydroplants to open because now those plants can use bitcoin to mine, and break even on the 90% of energy that they can't transport, rather than just lose that in overhead costs.
Over 50% of bitcoins are in a few wallets? Not even true. While it is true that ~2000 wallets have 40% of the bitcoin, a fair bit of those are the major exchanges that are dealing with it daily, not actual people. So this bitcoin is being cycled through them on a consistent basis, not held. 
"Enjoy getting dumped on and scammed if you are dumb enough to invest"? I will gladly enjoy my +350% gains since February since I was "dumb enough to invest". You enjoy losing in the next stock market recession :) Owo

You're never going to have a perfect system. Bitcoin isn't (while it's advocators may be) claiming to be perfect. There are just many attractive features that fiat doesn't have. They can and should co-exist. That being said, there are use cases for bitcoin. Like being able to transfer money amongst family members that ultimately shouldn't be the business of the government, yet is; and such transfers often take way too long. Waiting for a gift transfer from my father to help me pay for my house took well over 2 weeks, when it could've taken 1 hour with bitcoin, for instance. 
Bitcoin still has some improvements to be made. In regards to your what if my bitcoin gets stolen or what if I make an accidental transfer to the wrong address? Those things can be fixed with more convenient methods of using bitcoin, which haven't been developed yet, but shouldn't be used as valid points because eventually this problem will be mostly mitigated.

You're talking in hypotheticals. I'm talking in realities. The measured price of bitcoin in fiat accounting for inflation has still risen, quite a lot. So no, your point that "what if bitcoin is $1,000,000 USD but it still only buys a car because muh fiat tanked"? is irrelevant, because the fact is that USD has not tanked that much (in the time span that bitcoin has been around). 
I'm well aware that bitcoin is hard money and that it is scarce and cannot be mass printed. But the fact ALSO remains that everything is currently denominated in US (or euro, GBP, whatever your country is) FIAT dollars. So it's the current only way to determine the purchasing power that one bitcoin carries. 
How is it a pointless comparison? He's comparing increase in value. Not useless. Agree to disagree, please stop commenting and telling me how "you don't understand bitcoin because something something hard money". We're literally on a post talking about price denominated in US dollars, which is why I bring up price only.

@_date: 2019-10-23 10:47:42
Sure, of course it is driven by speculation. I'm not trying to deny that. That being said, though, gold could very well be worthless in the coming decades also, as many asteroids have been proven to have a ridiculously large supply of it. So if we can mine it successfully (which we will in the future, at some point) the supply will increase so much that it will effectively be worthless as a store of value and used only in industry. 
So, bitcoin has a provably finite supply whereas gold has (currently) a finite supply but eventually will effectively be infinite. What is a better bet? 
Gold enthusiasts seem to ignore this fact, though.

I hope you dont comment about how bitcoin mooned many times before and thus it will come back from the crash, then, given that you literally just said "because historyically it operated that way doesn't mean it would indefinitely do so". 
In any case, yes, you are correct. There's never a guarantee for anything. But your logic here renders your own comment completely useless. If VTSAX isn't guaranteed because "who can guarantee our economy on average would grow as much as it used to?", then neither is the S&amp;P500 guaranteed.
If you're going to go on historical trends, which really is ALL you have to go off of if we're being honest here, then VTSAX is far superior to S&amp;P500.

"Make corporations pay true prices for commodities and labor and not subsidized prices and make them clean up their shit if they pollute."
Care to clarify what exactly you mean by this instead of being extremely vague? Sure, what you're saying sounds great on paper but you're not actually quantifying any solutions whatsoever. What does "true prices" for commodities and labor mean? Are you saying that mcdonalds should pay their cashiers $20 an hour to do a job that literally anyone with a heartbeat can do? That's not a viable solution. Companies hire people at the wage they do because their labor is worth MORE. If I hired somebody at $10/hr and they are only bringing me $10 an hour in revenue, then that's a loss including overhead. So everyone who ever has a position at any job anywhere has been paid less than the company receives for their work, otherwise there would be no profit incentive to hire that person. It sucks, sure, but that's just how it has to be. Why would any company hire anyone if they took a net loss on that person?
Yes, I agree with cleaning up pollution. I was never arguing otherwise.

So killing one person is intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group? even if its a murder related to nothing else then the persons property, such as a robbery turned violent? 
You're really going to say that a political party in the US composed of 150 million people, that had a few bad incidents of bad actors killing a ton of people, is committing genocide together? That's a pretty wild assertion, and again, using evidence of one mass shooting isn't sufficient. Learn statistics, you clearly have no grasp of it whatsoever.
Antifa has caused damage and is violent ISN'T true? Okay, here we go:
$100,000 in damages caused by protesters to Milo Yiannopoulos at Berkeley: 
Antifa counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 "certainly used clubs and dyed liquids against the white supremacists". Source: 
More violence from Antifa: 
" Literally trump's latest tweet was calling just for that"
Um, he was saying Antifa is violent, not all democrats. Did you even read the tweet? Or did you extract only the fake information you wanted to prove your false point? NO mention of the word "democrat", "political party" or ANYTHING related to the democratic party whatsoever, ANYWHERE in that tweet. Try again.

Neither are you. I presented a logical argument, with sources, and you cited ONE case that supports your argument, but unfortunately, mathematics and statistics doesn't give one single solitary fuck about one case. 
Like honestly. if 40% of the country supports trump, which is ~140 million people, then of course you're going to have 10-50 nutjobs that misperceive what he is saying. The same thing happens on your side. Look at the republican baseball shooting. Look at Antifa. etc etc.
Genocide is defined as the deliberate killing of a large group of people. Historically it generally means exactly that: a LARGE group of people. Like hundreds, probably more accurate to say hundreds of thousands. No offense, but there definitely is not hoards of angry republicans killing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. There's been MAYBE 50 deaths of immigrants from words of trump? But even that is irrelevant, Antifa has caused plenty of property damage and violence themselves as well, following words of Clinton/Sanders, but do you see republicans crying that democrats are all violent, etc? No.

You literally just made the argument of why buying is better than renting, lmfao. "Rising house prices" so why would you not want to buy a house NOW and own it when 20-30 years from now the price is significantly higher? Whereas you have no clue what's going to happen with bitcoin.
On one hand, people ALWAYS need places to live/shelter, whereas this digital money (while it is brilliant) may not last or be the king. 
Hmm, I wonder which one I would prioritize.../s
"Put 5 grand in Bitcoin for 5+ years and you won't need a mortgage." Why not both?
Edit: Also, you're frankly naïve if you don't think that rent prices will increase correlatively with house prices.

didn't say the point was to make more fiat, but this is a literal thread about price termed in fiat dollars, so that's the argument. you can cherry pick December 2017 as a bad buying time but the fact remains that buying literally any other time before November 2017 (which Is roughly like ~70-75% of the entire time bitcoin has been up) has made your investment (as of today) at the very LEAST 8x. 
what's better? an 8x on your investment, or (with gold) an increase of like 30-40%?
I also want to add it's stupid to say that bitcoin is a bad investment because many people bought in December 2017. buying gold at the recent ATH of $1900 would have been an equally stupid idea and would've cost you money as well. not as much, sure, but still. buying ANY asset at its all time high or close to is generally a dumb idea and is very risky, no matter if its a crypto, stock, precious metal, or real estate.

Too bad your economics degree is highly meaningless.

For someone with so much supposed "experience" analyzing this space I find it funny that you bring up this word salad collection of statements and don't back them up with any real evidence, sources, or facts at all. If you had actually researched the topic at all you would know the main source that breaks down all the "coal and dirty energy" sources are not what is being used on bitcoin, and that lie was piloted by alex de vries (who was proven to have cited his own work multiple times, in a revolutionary tactic of circular self-referencing that nobody managed to notice...)

This guy is an idiot. There are better, more safer ways to retire young and a millionaire than gambling. 
A few come to mind here:
1) Get promoted in your job by working hard
2) Take business loans to buy shitty, broken down houses and repair them, then sell for a profit or rent them (sister does this successfully. takes some learning but the returns can be massive)
3) Invest your money while actively managing risk. Definitely not 100% into crypto like this guy is. Buy some stocks, buy some bonds, whatever. Just diversify risk and HODL (both bitcoin, and HODL stocks too)
4) Buy your own house and rent it, so you can pay off the mortgage faster, or invest that money. Don't pay rent money because that money is gone. Mortgages, while kind of shitty because the banks can charge interest on money they are loaning that they don't have, are still better than renting.

There are problems with bitcoin that fiat doesn't have. This subreddit is such a massive cuckfest of lies that bitcoin is some perfect alien tech that is immutably strong. Blatantly not true, and believe me I own quite a lot of BTC, but I'm not going to pretend that is perfect (like you all do).

So one crazy republican/trump supporter kills somebody using a Trumpism and we're committing genocide? I wasn't aware "genocide" was defined as one shooting. lmfao. Not going to mention the republican baseball shooting, or the mass spreading of Antifa violence all over the country, now are you? Right. Because only republicans cause violence. At least, that's what your narrative is telling.
Concentration camps? What would you like us to do with people that are using other peoples children/human trafficking children through the border? Also, you are aware that this situation with children being separated from their parents at the border existed long before trump? Sources:
The camps have been there for quite some time. The Obama administration did use them as well.
When Trump started his child separation policy some photos turned up of kids in similar situations back around 2014.
Politifact points out that legally Trump didn't do anything new. The law was always there. He just started actually using it when previous administration's didn't.
Long story short. Obama had camps like this for sure. Bush probably even had them. They might even predate that.
And, I ask you again. When there are many cases where the children are in fact NOT the children of the alleged parents, and just random mixes of people, what do you want to happen? Them to stay together, where they can be continually trafficked wherever they may go? Or would you rather them being separated and confirmed to be of the same family?

what's the difference between drawing all of your lines from that one week period when bitcoin was significantly more expensive than it is now, and YOU drawing lines from 2010 to 2017 and saying "look it went up infinitely in this time period, therefore it's going to go up another 300000% in the next 8 years! guaranteed!" ?

1000 is a bit ambitious. It's more like ~2070 according to this source: 
I would make the case that many people have had ample opportunity to invest in bitcoin since its inception and that that number could be more spread out, but people (like you) gave them FUD suggesting that fiat is a perfect system.

It shows that you care enough to keep on with your lies, effectively doubling down. TA has been wrong many many many times, it is not confirmed easy money, if it was, everyone would be using it. TA *screamed* overbought at 7k months ago and yet bitcoin climbed all the way to almost 14k. many TA analysts also said that when the recent drop from $10.5k to $8k happened that we would drop to $6k, yet here we are at $8.4k. 
TA is nothing but a fake "educated" guess, when in all reality, it doesn't prove anything and is just as 50 50 as anything else

All crooks, all of them. A quote I heard recently that I love is "The problem isn't that they are breaking the law. The problem is that *they don't have to*" meaning that they write the laws and will just write laws that don't include things that should be illegal that they want to do, and/or they will leave massive loopholes.

Um, no? the price began crashing at ~4:30 pm and if you look at this website that shows crypto sites being up and down:  you would see that around half way between 15:00 and 18:00 (16:30 -&gt; 3:30) is when coinbase started having issues.

yes, and 142 BTC is currently around $1.3m. If he didn't sell at 20k why would he sell now? I don't know, why don't you tell me about all the people that exist that bought at 18k and sold at 5k? Plenty of those people exist.

@_date: 2019-10-22 17:15:57
It still is useful. Buying bitcoin over 97% of its entire life and holding until now you're in profit, and you're in MASSIVE profit.
Whereas buying gold over I would imagine a similar % of its entire life you would be in profit, but you'd cap out at 5x or something whereas the early adopters of bitcoin have made out like absolute bandits.
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:01:06

yeah, and it literally crashed for no other reason than coinbase api went down yesterday around 2:40 pm for ONE hour. ONE. This is FUD, buy the dip boys.
Edit: No, in fact the crash did NOT happen just before coinbase went down. The price began crashing at 4:30 pm or so, while coinbase went down around ~3:30 or even slightly earlier than that according to this crypto tracker:
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:45:40
Not very easy to just not your money in the bank? How so? Please explain that to me.
If you're talking about in reference to getting loans from a bank, you can do that through normal people/other means. If you're talking about credit cards, you may have a point there. But the whole point of a CC is to take money out on a loan which again you can do on other peoples money than a bank's. Debit card being through a bank is probably the only thing you legitimately would lose from not using a bank, and I suppose FDIC insurance.
Yes, I was never attempting to argue that there isn't a problem with the central banking infrastructure. I was merely saying his example as an attempt to demonize fiat failed when examined logically. Of course there are problems with the current banking system (and financial system, in general). But trying to do away from them by using false examples doesn't help anyone.

With that attitude I am sure you will FOMO in at the next big rise and lose your ass when you don't sell. If you're considering it at all, now is the time. It will hardly matter if bitcoin reaches 50k whether you bought at $8.2k or $7.8k. So buy now while the dip is here, just in case it "only" goes to $15k ;)
@_date: 2019-06-11 11:40:18

OP is basically saying that the percentage increase from all time high to all time high has been (ROUGHLY) cutting in half every time.

You act like this is something I'm not aware of and that is supposed to scare me into agreeing with you. I'm all for this, because theoretically this transparency would transfer to the GOV also and we would finally be able to see just what the fuck the gov is wasting our tax money on (probably corruption, lets be real here).
If my transactions are heavily tracked then so are the governments, I'd be completely fine with that.
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:55:48
I'm not trying to argue that fiat wins. I'm only arguing that your example that "oh no!!! a fiat atm was hacked and is spewing money!" is fairly stupid considering you are saying two things here with your post + your responses to me:
1) Fiat money is inherently useless (which would seem to suggest that it doesn't matter that it's spewing out of an ATM machine, which makes me wonder why you even posted this article)
2) It's bad that fiat is spewing out of an ATM due to a hack (but wait, I thought it was inherently valueless? hmm...cognitive dissonance?)
I'm only saying that your post that an ATM got hacked is laughable. Bitcoin gets stolen and hacked way more often than fiat does, and not only that, but when bitcoin gets hacked and stolen there is 100% no possibility of you getting it back. Whereas with fiat a bank can return your money to you fairly quickly.
Example: My dumb ass got scammed online (to be fair it was advertised on a legitimate website and I thus thought it would be safe) on a Nintendo switch. Bought online with an e-check. It turned out to be a fraudulent website and so I went to the bank and had a fraud report filed and got my money back within about a month. With bitcoin I would've completely lost that money. 
So, say what you will (and I want to emphasize that I'm PRO bitcoin. But I'm not living in a fantasy land where bitcoin is currently ready; it's not.), but bitcoin has faults and it is not anywhere near ready enough for mainstream adoption and use. And stupid posts like this make it seem like bitcoin is impervious to theft, which is laughably ignorant.

It's not an expensive pizza. That's the wrong way to look at it. In that exact moment the man paid $40 in BTC for 2 pizzas. He did not pay $80M as some people would have you believe. Just because the value goes up later doesn't mean that exact purchase cost him more. That assumes a lot of things, like him holding all the way to this point which is highly unlikely.
NO ONE could've known that BTC would rise from pennies to $20k in 2017 and $8600 now. NO ONE.

Why do I need BTC? because fuck having to wait for my own god damn money, that's why. I would rather pay a small fee to get it immediately then let paypal hold it because they're investing it for massive profits that I don't see any of. Fuck that non-sense.

The reason it's probably worth investing right now is because the exact opposite could happen to what you were just talking about. If the price of bitcoin goes up in the future then your investment will be worth less and you'll get less BTC.

Sorry, but this makes you a pussy. You bought your first coin at $600, if you held until now you would've more than 10x'ed your money. Why can't you hold for more than a week or two here and there?


You had, and arguably still have, a good buying opportunity now. But you won't buy, because you're hoping it will go lower. It most likely won't drop below $6k at the least at this point, and when bitcoin hits $100k in 5-10 years, who cares whether you bought at $6k or $8k. Buy now while time is giving you this blessed opportunity.

The chance that bitcoin goes to $0 is far greater than the chance that the moon is no longer in orbit tomorrow, and that's the reason why this statement is "useful".
You bring up a relatively unrelated strawman example that simply isn't comparable. Bitcoin has been around for 10 years, the moon has been around for hundreds of millions.

it really actually doesn't, bitcoin is run about 75-80% on renewable energy (hydropower specifically) and incentivizes hydropower plants to open because previously hydropower plants would waste about 90% of the power they produced. while now it is being used to mine bitcoin at breakeven or a slight loss rather than complete waste.

this is fucking retarded. people back then didn't get asthma and were fine smoking because everyone was athletic compared to now. while yes there are chemicals in todays food that shouldn't be, you're trying to argue that smoking cigarettes is healthy which is asinine
by the way, "I never knew a kid who had asthma, and we were all exposed to secondhand smoke constantly, even in school." this is anecdotal evidence. just because YOU never knew anyone who had it, doesn't mean it wasn't a side effect of everyone smoking.

It arguably benefits society because it promotes production of hydropower in remote locations that otherwise would be wasting the power that they produce as it is. And yes, I know some people will make the case that hydropower is actually bad for the environment, not good. But its bad in a different way than traditional oil and natural gas resources in that oil and natural gas resources actually harm the atmosphere and oxygen whereas hydropower's harm comes to ecosystems, not the oxygen and air we breathe. Whether or not that's immoral is another story, though.

No, not all taxation is theft. But when you have countries pulling 60-70% taxes in the name of "universal" healthcare, it's bullshit and that IS theft. 


No. Because we don't spend as much on the military as other countries charge in taxes for "healthcare". 
Also, I want to point out that the US military largely defends all of these other countries that have "much better and [more] cost efficient [healthcare] than the USA" and thus those countries don't have to spend any taxes on the military, and can funnel that money into healthcare instead. They often also have a much smaller population too which is another factor.

Yes, but most people aren't responsible enough to invest money that is sitting around into things that actually pay interest. Normal banks used to pay decent interest, and now they don't. You essentially have to invest long-term into stock market wide mutual funds that will, over the extreme long term, pay a stable 5-7% interest. But MOST people will not do that and will just lose money in their banks. And that's part of the issue with fiat
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:20:40
And you are more than free to make that bet. And, if it goes to zero, congrats, you saved some money. But, if it goes to $150k on the next ATH, and you could've made a ton risking very little, then you'll be pissed. Or probably not, cuz you're over here bragging about your $60 an hour. Who gives a fuck, though. BTC is medium risk, potentially astronomically high reward. Seems worth it to me.
You're right, institutional money aren't dipshits. They're smart. But they're also slowly arriving in the space. Bakkt, fidelity, tdameritrade. All of em are coming in slowly but surely. Make of that what you will. I would say that's a damn good buy signal. 
"You guys talk big numbers. I'd bet your accounts aren't so big. All I'm gonna say". lol dude, nobody here is claiming they're rich. We just all like BTC. And congrats on making $60 an hour. Perhaps if you put $1 of that per hour into BTC, and get a hardware wallet, you might learn something useful. If you make so much an hour, what is another $1 per hour investment? 
It's probably nothing to you. That'd just be $2080 a year into BTC which, for all you know, could very well balloon to $37500 if BTC goes to $150k. (which has been a trending prediction as of late due to previous trends). But, honestly, I hope you don't buy BTC. I hope It balloons and I hope you kick yourself for not putting a small amount in.

What? I literally said bitcoin isn't perfect but that *it's advocators may be claiming it is perfect*. I LITERALLY said bitcoin ITSELF IS NOT PERFECT but that people that like it ADVOCATE IT AS SUCH. Op is a person. Op advocating it with this dumb post proves exactly what I said.


While you are correct in stating that the government *may not see it*, that does not mean that *legally it is allowed*, without being reported, above $15k at least. Which is still ridiculous; I should be able to receive any amount of money from any family member legally without having to pay taxes on it.


Doesn't make it any more legal for me to hand my cousin $16,000 in CASH and NOT pay taxes on it. Sure, the government "doesn't know" but if in fact they find out and you didn't file a gift tax return, you're fucked. 
Using the argument of, "the government can't and doesn't know, so who cares?" is a bad one, because while again they might not know, it's still illegal to do so and *if you are caught you face potentially serious consequences*
As far as improvements destroying the entire point of bitcoin being a trustless system...there is fundamentally never going to be a truely trustless system. But honestly, I'd rather have an economy where I am (apart from a hardware wallet company, I suppose) the sole proprietor of my own money and nobody can change that. I also enjoy the lack of privacy bitcoin brings, at least in a utopia-esque world where the government can no longer hide their shady dealings in accounting books, as it would all be on the public ledger (blockchain)

This makes a MASSIVE assumption that the person who is "in profit right now" held all the way to this point.
Do you seriously believe people that were new to bitcoin and bought at $8k in 2018 held through the lows of $3-4k up to this point? Most of them probably didn't. Most new investors didn't understand how this shit works, myself included. It's a very, very very very bold statement to assume that EVERYONE who bought below the current price held up to this point, ESPECIALLY if they bought in during 2017. Most people probably panic sold on the way down.

ETH, hell no. ETH is centralized and gives spawn to a lot of scammy shitcoins. EOS has been widely regarded as a scam also, there are many threads of the sort all over about it.
Litecoin, however, is basically silver while bitcoin is gold. Litecoin has improved bitcoin in many various ways, you should research about it.

It's almost always worth it. Even where I am, I'm paying roughly $3000 a year in property taxes. Combined with the loan, HOA fee, and everything else, I'm paying $405K for a $300K house (15 year loan). This particular house would probably rent at $2000 a month where I'm paying about $2250 a month.
So in my case, the mortgage is slightly more expensive than rent, but effectively 20 years down the line if I wanted to move, I have money from selling that house that would go to the next one, and pay most of it. 
Whereas if I had rented the entire time, that money is down the drain. So the comparison is *OVERWHELMINGLY* in favor of a mortgage. 
Personally I would opt for a 20 year loan if I could go back, calculate the payment if it was a 15 year loan, and invest the difference (in stocks, crypto, and gold/silver). That probably gives you the best return with a lower risk portfolio then literally throwing all of your money into a fire with renting.
Also, you can buy a house and rent out spare rooms for extra money. And then you're doing EVEN BETTER. Just make sure to background check and meet potential new roommates so you don't get crazies.

@_date: 2019-06-02 13:50:22
No not as far as I'm aware. It's a normal internet website.
If you're against giving certain information it won't be great for you, they're heavily KYC/AML regulated and in order to use GDAX you have to have your bank account linked and then make a deposit which can take a few business days. I know some people are super against stuff like this and are big about privacy so it's not for everyone. For me I don't mind it. It is a little annoying that you have to make a bank deposit and it takes up to a week to clear, which for buying RIGHT NOW isn't great. But if you're dollar cost averaging like me then it's good enough.
I would buy a hardware wallet if I was you, it's well worth the peace of mind of not losing your keys to an exchange potentially which could happen with any of them.

@_date: 2019-08-06 15:37:20
Not entirely. Halving matters. If the coins demanded per 10 minutes stays the same, then the halving means that the price will go up. If the coins demanded per 10 minutes increases proportionally, then the halving won't matter and the price will stay the same. If the coins demanded per 10 minutes decreases, then it depends on how much because a small decrease in demand will leave the price the same since the change in supply after the halvening is half.

You're right...BTC price crashing literally 1 hour after coinbase, one of the bigger and more prominent exchanges for crypto going down, is not related. Especially when there was absolutely no signs of it slowing down whatsoever. Absolutely. That makes total fucking sense, to use the same word choice you went for. :)
You're probably one of them that said in nov2018 that the price crash from $6k to $3200 was only because it was bound to happen eventually, it was bound to correct to -80% because that's what it's done in the past. Nothing to do with the hard fork of bcash that divided the community and sent the entire cryptosphere into a panic when hoards of people couldn't withdraw their bcash that crashed from $630 to $200 in like two weeks. That DEFINITELY had nothing to do deal with bitcoin going from $6k to $3200, right? No, it was just DUE FOR A CORRECTION.

I'm hodling myself but to be honest nobody can say for sure that this halving cycle will continue. I like bitcoin but i'm not going to pretend that just because bitcoin mooned 3-4 times followed by an 80-90% value loss that it will do this ad infinitum until all of it has been mined. There's no objective way to prove that this will continue to happen. That being said, I think it's highly possible and I think it might happen and thus will HODL myself. 
But let's assume this doesn't happen, and BTC stays at $10k under. Then your argument no longer is true because people who bought at $15k and FOMO'ed and have hodled since will have lost money. 
TLDR; *There is not a guarantee that just because bitcoin behaved in a cyclical fashion 3 times already that it will continue to do so in the future*

Honestly it's true though. Slow and steady into stable is much better growth than that 2017 garbage. I'd rather BTC go up ~$500 a month for the next 30 years then go up $10k in 2 months and then crash farther below.
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:10:34
That's one of the issues with economies. Individuals can save, and benefit themselves, while benefitting actively from the spending of others. A balanced economy will have a good enough amount on each side that growth is still possible, but allowing smart people to save. The problem is this balancing can get out of wack quite quickly once even a minor recession starts to hit, if people panic.
Also, all assets combined have estimated to be $280 trillion. Not 200. But I won't nitpick
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:22:39
let's see... something that's virtually a guaranteed +10%/year LONG TERM as well as something like 50% match vs. something that is never guaranteed to go up? ya gotta invest in different risk portfolios man. don't go all in one thing.
Right now my 401k at new job that I've had since august last year I've put in around $4500 and it's sitting at $11K because of stock market growth + employer match. Sure, if I took that money and threw it into BTC in the range of 4k- it would have 3x'ed at this point. But we couldn't have known for sure BTC would pump this hard, or at all, so I'll take it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:31:05

Litecoin is more efficient for actual transactional usage. And it's usable to make bitcoin faster also.
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:26:31
That depends mostly on how the rich got their wealth. I'm not trying to argue that rich people that worked their asses off to get to that point don't deserve it, they definitely do. But a lot of them either inherited wealth or had an easier time getting there. Also, there's a certain point where money gain exponentially increases power gain. Think about it this way:
If I'm making $70K a year, I can save a fair bit over the average person making $40K, but not an insanely larger amount. If I'm making $100K a year, more of that $30K will be savable then the previous jump from 40 to 70, as bills won't change THAT much. When you keep going up like this you see that the difference in pay, though linear, results in a non-linear difference in power gain. Somebody making $70k vs $40k has, say, 15K more they could save, while $100K could theoretically save more of that money, like 20k. Then $100k to $130k they could save 25k, etc. 
So while net income jumps $30k every time, net savable income is actually increasing, giving them more money to invest in stocks, crypto, oil, gold, silver, platinum etc. Which basically means they will have an easier leg up as they make more and more money. And we all know more liquid money / money to invest = more power.
This is the unfair part. The average person doesn't have enough wealth to move the market as they choose, while those that make quite a bit more by economic design will have more power.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:34:27
Or you could have a system where neither can just influence the market single handedly. A market where the big jumps are caused only by massive influxes of people making similar decisions. 
I don't claim to have the solution to make a market like this, but it probably should be something we should consider somewhat. 
I'm all for capitalism but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's okay that a few select people with billions of dollars can swing a stock or crypto literally at any point that they decide to.

@_date: 2019-06-10 11:26:03
1000% at the start of the every year is a bad figure, and whoever quoted it is intentionally trying to mislead you. That being said, the biggest rallies did produce phenomenal gains. For one, bitcoin went from a low of roughly $22 (source;  to a high towards the end of the year at $1155 (source:  That is absolutely parabolic gains, in fact that is gains much more than 1000%. That is gains of 52172%. 
And then it went from a low of around $905 to a high of around $19500 (source:  which again is 21446% gains. 
Now, these are over the course of the entire year, not the "start" of every year. But those gains are very real and still stupid good for any asset on the planet and is essentially entirely unmatched.

not really, it leaves quite a lot of important details out. like why anyone would want to use the bitcoin ledger over the bank ledger. add "bitcoin is better because there is no middleman like there always has to be with the bank, or credit card company, or paypal, and thus the ledger is public and not private to a certain centralized entity" and it would be great.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:06:57
I read it. 
A surge of 25% in one day will most likely have a correction. But saying that it dropped 16% from that daily ATH in one hour because "MUH CORRECTION!" when it happened literally one hour after coinbase goes down. Cmon now.
Sure, some people took profit. But enough to send the price down $2000 in 15 mins? You're fucking mad.
I KNOW coinbase played a role because this exact drop happened with the binance garbage a few months ago. With a similar time interval. Within the hour of news breaking the price fell.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:55:06
Absolutely. from $0.003 to $10 is still $60 into $200K. NOBODY would hold all of their coins that far. Some would hold some but most non-rich/middle class people would sell at least a small portion or even a big portion by $10 at the latest.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:06:13
That's all well and dandy, but the price is absolutely important for most average people's use case for it. Regardless of it's ability to evade the requirement of a middleman, that is completely irrelevant for a currency when the currency in question shifts anywhere from +-70% in a few months. Currencies should be stable, not volatile.

Because hydropower *does* replace non-renewable sources; but the actual infrastructure that builds hydropower often wastes up to 90% of the power it produces because it is not close enough to real civilization to use it and it is often not worth it economically to transfer it to farther locations. 
In other words, say that 300 units of power (I'm not well versed in units for power production and consumption) are created by the hydropower plant. Then maybe 240-270 aren't used because it's not worth it to transfer. But if you can use that 240-270 to even break even on mining bitcoin (which can be located anywhere; all you need is some PC hardware and a PC) or other cryptocurrencies, now all of a sudden you make a lot more on a hydropower plant because that power isn't being wasted and thus you can increase the profit margin.
I'm paraphrasing the best I can because I read those studies awhile ago, but if you want to, I would suggest looking into the r/bitcoin reddit. I read a paper about all of this from an article posted there debunking the "bitcoin is terrible for the environment" myth. I can't seem to find it at the moment with google searches.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:18:18
Lol, new. Nice one. You lost the argument so you go with an arbitrary and meaningless insult.
Sure, bitcoin crashes like this. But recently? Not really. Look at the price history for the past 3 months. Biggest drops:
5600 to 5200. Binance illiquidity/tether FUD occurred here and the price dropped literally under an hour after this happened.
7800 to 7200. This is only 8% so it's not a huge crash (16% is literally double, I think this is fair. 
8500 to 7500. This is a bigger one, but this is a slower crash, over the course of 2 days. so if your argument is that drops occur within hourly periods often, no.
These are the only ones. One is a longer time period drop, one is a much smaller drop, and then you have binance FUD tied to the other.
And the next one just happens to coincide directly 1 hour after coinbase goes down? "Bitcoin drops happen constantly! nothing new here!!"
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:47:56
You can consider price irrelevant all you want, but the only way we have currently to determine purchasing power of bitcoin is the fiat converted price. That's really the only way we currently have to determine if the value of bitcoin is going up. 
Even if you don't use fiat, there's still some "price" you have to use. Whether you say bitcoin is worth 2.8 baskets of goods while 4 months ago it was worth 1 basket of good, it doesn't matter. You have to use some sort of conversion to something we all are familiar with to determine if the value of bitcoin has since gone up or not.

Why not? A doctor is a profession. Who pays the hospital/doctor's office to run? The government? We all know anything the government touches goes to ruin. I ask you again, though, who pays for the doctor's office to run? Money doesn't come out of thin air. That doctor doesn't spend years in med school for fun or to help people. Some might, but most don't. That doctor, like everyone else, has bills to pay. You think that they can just be a doctor for free? 
What's the fundamental difference between a doctor and a grocery store clerk? There is none. Both work to pay bills, both have their salaries paid by the businesses that they work in. The only difference you are saying is that people should pay for food but not for healthcare. Which is fairly asinine considering that both require people to work, materials, rent costs, knowledge, etc. I have no right to walk into a doctor's office and demand his labor and time to serve me if I decide that it's my damn right to have healthcare even if I don't want to pay for it. That's literally theft.

Well, yeah. of course most people don't immediately own the house. most people (at least, for America) don't make enough money to pay for a house very quickly, and thus you have a mortgage. But once the mortgage is paid off, then you do own the house. I would extend my argument by saying that most people do make enough to reasonably pay off a house in 15-30 years but they are just irresponsible with saving and/or choose a house that is functionally out of their budget/takes forever to pay off.
I can definitely agree most of the value is in the land; Do you have any sources suggesting that the government actually acts like a monopoly and restricts the market artificially?

No, it's not. Admittedly, I thought he said that he had three whales because I only read part of the comment (I was in an out of reddit constantly today so wasn't able to read everything). I only just noticed now that he said on his way to a whale. So I thought he meant he had $25k. 
Either way, it's not great to mention, $2.5k or not. If he holds for years and years that amount could add up. And you never know the effort people will go to hack you for that money. If somebody could spend 20 hours to hack him for $2.5k that's quite a good hourly return and would be worth it for a lot of hackers out there.

he's just another one of them "NEVER GIVE UP BTC FOR FIAT!!!111" losers. let's be honest here, yes, bitcoin could potentially be the future of money. but at the same time, we are FAR from being able to equate bitcoins with actual real goods/services.  Nobody on this entire subreddit could tell me off hand how much bitcoins they would give for a gallon of milk without first converting it to fiat. so yes, the current price (or fiat to btc conversion, whatever way you want to look at it) does matter. Without a fiat to btc conversion you don't actually have any real conception of what your btc is worth relative to real goods. and as a currency you need to have that.

I read a book called freakonomics that explored this issue. funnily enough (regardless of your political opinion) it seems that legalized abortion might have been the reason. I'm against abortion myself but the book kind of showed that it could've been the reason for the sharp decline in crime because a decade or so before abortion was legalized and there was a lot of studies suggesting that babies that otherwise would've been aborted were born into bad circumstances (where the mother didn't want the kid and/or was not financially ready) and thus they grew up poorly and more likely to become a criminal. you should check out this book, it was quite an interesting read.

this is fucking massively concerning.
Let me break this down for you. The point of a log scale is to show percentage movements between time dates. Do you really believe that a linear scale would show ANYTHING meaningful? It would basically only show the last 2 years as any price below that would be a blip with the y axis going from 0 to ATH (~$19400). Log scale is necessary. It concerns me greatly that someone that does financial analytics as a career doesn't understand the reason for a log scale.

Energy consuming fee? 80% of bitcoin mining and transaction authorizing occur with renewable energy. This is factually provable.

You really believe this? Drugs are illegal in the US but exist literally *Everywhere*, prohibition proved inadequate to stop alcohol from being pervasive, etc. Ban something and it grows stronger.

You should take SOME profits. But I would never exit the space completely.
That being said, there is not "bound" to be a pullback anywhere. I bought at 7750 recently, thinking that it would rise a little more and then pullback, just like you. I sold the amount that I bought at 8250 and sure enough it went pretty much straight from 8250 all the way to 9800.

People on this sub are so retarded. People act like having a small amount of bitcoin is worse than either having none or going all in. Not all of us are expecting bitcoin to moon inevitably, and a lot of us are hedging our risk so we don't (potentially) get burned as hard as a lot of the other people here.
Managing and reducing risk is basic investment advice. Why the fuck would you go all in on something as risky as bitcoin? Past results do not always predict the future.

You guys joke but you are actually retarded. The entire point of bitcoin is decentralization. The "single planet controls 100%" is such a simplistic and dishonest view of what this post is trying to get at. If china controls 54% (which they do), it would be easier for people of the same nationality to agree to 51% attack it. Which essentially means if china does so, we are all fucked. 
These jokes may be funny but they really don't do the justice of telling us how serious this actually is. If you really wanted bitcoin to succeed you would know this is terrible news, lol. See u/bondiblues comment about how this is a convergence to bitcoin cash (which I'm sure you all hate)

Bitcoin in essence is closer to paper socialism then executed socialism. I.e. it actually is good for the community and society, like socialism tends to be *in theory*, but never in *execution*. Socialism is a massively failed experiment every time it gets tried, even though it theoretically sounds fantastic. While not perfect, bitcoin has done far better and is far closer to theoretical socialism than any country's government has/is.

No, you need to have something to compare to. Even the US dollar is a meaningless number if you don't have baskets of goods to compare to. you just do the conversion of that in your head unconsciously at this point because you're used to fiat forever. As bitcoin slowly adopts (if it even does, who knows), that conversion will slowly become normal. Though I'd say it will happen more in sats than btcs.

sub 4k was definitely a good call; it was -85% roughly from 20k, a number that previously had been common for it to drop from ATH's to. That was a fantastic call you made.

Well put. The irony of a financial analyst trying to tell us a linear scale for a stock/asset's entire price history is appropriate.
Honestly, stocks get represented in a linear scale because most people are too fucking stupid to understand the difference between a log scale and a linear scale, and also the simple fact that most (all, really) stocks have not risen percentage-wise enough to need a log scale. A log scale for a stock would probably show very little growth and turn people off from investing.
With bitcoin, its a massively different story.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:51:26


Oh nice, i responded to one comment and you called me a fucking prick. Imagine how that works. Literally just began to conversate and you resort to insults already. Shows how weak your argument truly actually is.
Let me ask you this question; you would allow anyone in your home, without question? If they knocked on your door and said they needed a place to stay, and some food, you would let them in, no questions asked? Because that's basically the argument you're making here.


No, I actually don't. Of course the people who are good people should be let in. But nobody actually knows who that is and isn't. And again, saying this because you conveniently ignore it, there IS a PROCESS to get here legally and to stay here. Follow that, or try to come here illegally and face the consequences. 
Should we change the process and make it easier? Sure, I agree with that. But until that happens you can't just let anyone you want into the country. For obvious reasons.

That was not your original point. I was never attempting to argue that they aren't useful to society, only that your comment about them retaining gains they had made is factually inaccurate.
That being said, yes, in fact it does matter if they are profitable or not. Do you think Uber will exist as a private enterprise forever if it doesn't eventually profit? No. Not unless it is funded by the government. As a private enterprise with no profit, the only reason it hasn't gone under already is because a lot of wealthy investors believe it will eventually have large profits. That remains to be seen.

Taxation to a certain extent may not be theft, but there is and always will be some level of taxation that you don't agree with or don't like, or don't want to pay. So where's the cut off? Is the max amount of tax you're willing to pay, 50%? 60%? 70%? Where is the line drawn? For some people that line is significantly lower than what is actually being taken.

You're forgetting the part of your story where you were about to buy bitcoin from mtgox. You wouldn't have a million dollars. You'd have $0 dollars, assuming you kept on Mtgox. If you moved it off mtgox and held elsewhere, for literally years, after seeing the price go to $100, and then $1000, and STILL didn't sell, all the way to now...then you'd have a million dollars. But the likelihood of you doing all of those things is near 0.
Don't beat yourself up.

What did you expect? That it was just going to keep rising forever? No asset class in history does this. There are peaks and valleys to everything. If it just continued rising permanently, everyone would be buying it. But theres a risk in all investments.

Maybe not but this "ok boomer" meme is so pathetically lazy that I don't even know where to begin. It's just a way for young people to avoid advice from knowledgeable older people. 
This is coming from a 25 year old (myself) who actively ignored advice of older people at my own detriment. I realize now that I shouldn't have. And I'm not trying to say listen to anything they say, either. They can be wrong of course. I just see it more as a means for lazy millennials to discount legitimately good advice by claiming it's from a "boomer" which has now essentially become an insult.
And before reddit downvotes me for this, yes I am a millennial myself.

There's no actual proof of this whatsoever. You can't prove one way or the other that manipulation is or is not happening. I only gave you my opinion that it does happen. 
That being said, though, there's a lot of studies relating tether to the 2017 bitcoin boom, with real data backing that up. I forget which way it went, but it was either print a lot more tether and the price rises, or print less tether and the price rises. There are tons of graphs of this that are undoubtedly correlated.

Pretty much!
I knew about bitcoin far back in 2013 but only knew about it from it's association to the dark web. Thought it was used largely for criminal purposes (at that point that was probably true). Never once stopped to consider that a means of exchanging wealth with no middleman while also being a mathematically fixed supply with a mathematically programmed stable daily difference in supply was a revolutionary idea. If I had I definitely would have put some money into it.
I mean they could've literally put $5-$10 on it and just held permanently to see where it would go. If they had they would have a cool 5000% return and could've had as high as a 20000% return. :P

Well, you brought bipartisan politics into this (For some reason), so here we go.


The thing that you might not realize is that most people aren't deniers of climate change, they just disagree on the severity, as well as the data. I would surmise also that most of the people (millennials, mainly) that try to say with undeniable fact that humans are ruining the world with an incomprehensible amount of greenhouse gases and what have you, haven't actually read any legitimate studies about climate change at all, and just take at face value what the media tells them is fact. I ask people all the time what EXACTLY these studies are telling them, and they mostly fail to answer or revert back to "CO2 production levels are too high" or something. You know, in all honesty, it's not far off from people believing evolution without reading studies/scientific publications about it. Always sunny did a funny take of evolution but actually had a damn good point. Most people believe in evolution because of the studies that exist, but simultaneously (and seemingly paradoxically) haven't actually read or seen *any* of these studies. It's the exact same with climate change. There is actually data supporting both sides, it's not a clear black and white. Which is why there is a debate.
What other ancient ideas are boomers ruining the political landscape with, if you don't mind clarifying?

The problem with " 'ICO bans.' There were way too many scams though right? Isn't this a good thing?" is that who gets to decide what is and is not a scam? Shouldn't the free market be left to decide that? While you think BCASH might be a scam, others do not, and they aren't directly ripping or stealing money from people. A scam investment is still an investment; as long as the way you get your money back is by selling to someone else who wants it back, and the way you get your money back is not from someone that doesn't have it (like the case of bernie madoff, for instance), then it isn't a scam. It's just a bad investment.
The GOV should not be able to just shut down your ICO because they think its a scam, even if it isn't. That's like the GOV shutting down your cupcake shop without tangible evidence that it's a scam, only saying "look at all the other scam cupcake shops that've been around".

Make the time scale the fucking same, dude.
Also, "who bought bitcoin at $100? nobody" is pretty close to "who bought Netflix when it first started up and destroyed blockbuster?" the answer is, not surprisingly, "almost nobody".

In fact, even then, it's only really the last 2 years. Bitcoin has still soared 8x since jan 2017 and at its peak 20x. So if you bought and sold at smart times or even held until now you're doing alright. You're just making a bad investment when you buy at the top which happens in a lot of other places as well...
That being said, yes, bitcoin is volatile and is speculative. I'm not disagreeing with the premise to diversify. I'm disagreeing with the notion that stocks have outperformed bitcoin in the last decade. It's just mathematically not true.
One question for you, though. If you're so against bitcoin (which it very much seems like you are), why do you even frequent this subreddit? Why waste your time here if bitcoin is (in your mind) such a terrible investment? It makes no sense.

I'm not trolling. I asked for a direct time comparison between stocks and bitcoin. You would give me a stock that went 32x in 10 years as the stock that's supposed to be better than bitcoin as an investment, and would compare that 10 year stock to the last 5 years of bitcoin. And you did this multiple times. The only point where you were actually correct is the last 2 years of bitcoin to some stocks. But again, this ALL ASSUMES YOU PICKED THE CORRECT STOCKS. Which, according to many studies, MOST PEOPLE DO NOT. So try to undermine bitcoin as an investment by saying stocks are better, but all of this is hindsight 2020 and the chance that you (or anyone else) actually invested in the stocks that did better is slim to none. 
Frankly dude, I don't care about you at this point. I already told you that I agree with diversifying, but you keep rambling on about how stocks did better than bitcoin in the last 10 years which is just factually inaccurate, even for the absolute best stocks.

I don't consider that a valid metric either, which is why I didn't choose a starting price point of $0. But you also don't have penny stocks that trade at 1c/share balloon to $100 and then go "see, it's not actually up 100000% because it started basically worthless, thats not a valid metric"


IF you bought at the all time high. You repeatedly pull the absolute worst time to buy it as the price point and say, "look!!! it's down from the absolute all time high pricest ever seen, it's doing terribly!" yet also ignore the fact that 2.8 years ago, it was $1000 and it is now $7000. Please, go find me a company that went 7x in the last 2.8 years. Good luck. 
If you find one, chances are it's a penny stock anyway. And then you'll just revert back to your dumb logic of "well it technically is up 100000% but I don't like this metric because it started off so cheap".
by the way, I'm not disagreeing with your initial statement to diversify. It's definitely better risk-wise to diversify. But it's just flatout inaccurate to say that bitcoin has been doing "terribly" in the last few years. (And again, yes, you said years plural. It's essentially only doing terrible years-wise if you pick a very cherrypicked window of time :) )

Sure it's not accessible to everyone, but do you really think the solution is just throw money at ghettos? This has been tried time and time again and proven to do nothing. We spent billions in the "war on poverty" and poverty is still here. We spent billions in the "war on drugs" and the drug problem got worse.
How about instead of making the government the other fucking parent that every one parent kid in a ghetto thinks they needs, we actually focus on stressing the importance of family and sticking together? Why do we like to ignore that black communities have a 70-75% one parent rate, while whites and asians 20-25% and 15% respectively? Do you believe being raised under one parent is equivalent to being raised under two? That is damn sure as shit not true.

Of course it matters? How dense are you? If he's in a different first world country and his banks suck in comparison than that matters more to him than if your European banks don't.

Bitcoin is up from essentially being worth nothing, or less than a penny each, to now being worth $7000. And you're telling me that bitcoin isn't doing well? Really? Just because bitcoin crashed down from an arguably way overpriced coin? FOMO brought the price to 20k, not fundamentals. fundamentals and institutional investment have brought it up to 10k. people like you panicing after the fall from 14k to 10k are the reason its 7k now, not because its doing badly. just so many noobs in the market.

Honestly would rather be here than in those "socialist countries", where even if it is true they have better healthcare, it doesn't matter that much. It's not hard at all to have better healthcare when your country has 30% higher tax rates and a significantly smaller military and defense budget (mind you mostly this is the case due to the US being your defender essentially). So while you may get cheaper healthcare, it's not actually cheaper at all; you're paying double the tax rate, which for even the middle class comes out to way, way more money per year than paying out of pocket costs in the US.
And I would like to add even further that the countries like the Uk you are describing are only getting worse with increased censorship and punishment for speech that, while is offensive, shouldn't ruin someone's life given that teenagers often make crude jokes with their friends and could have their entire lives ruined by posting a vulgar tweet. Who wants to live in a country like that?
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:42:31
It doesn't make sense for different reasons. Company or not you can essentially view bitcoin in direct comparison to stocks. companies make big announcements on their products and revenue and the stocks go up or down. 
Same with bitcoin, except it's based around the technology improvements or news around regulation. There's not a big enough difference to view BTC any differently than just an expensive stock really. It's more volatile because most people believe/agree that it's more speculative.
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:50:48

But you're missing the point that it's very likely that CC's existing in the first place raises prices of products and services because the merchant wants to pass some of that cost on to the consumer. 
It's a logical argument to make, and so is the logical response being that the economic system is more complex than just the merchant passing the entire cost on. Nobody really knows exactly how it actually happens, but I surmise that it's a bit of both. I wouldn't be surprised if because of CC fees being passed on (maybe not all of the fee but I digress) that you had actually a net gain/loss of nothing from cash back. But in effect this would mean you are actually possibly buying a bunch of shit you don't need in order to gain the "cash back".
That being said if you are buying necessities and keep this is in mind explicitly when shopping, then sure the "cash back" is a good perk, I guess. I'd still have to see some data showing which side is right, though.
@_date: 2019-12-17 03:34:15
My point is that you comparing a country where 80% of the people are in the top 10% of the world as being "third world" is laughably ignorant. If that's your actual view of the US then you better be believing that 90% of the world is a third world country. Which I bet you don't and are therefore contradicting yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:56:17
You can but many of them often don't allow you to do this over the weekend, or maybe not instantly, and one of the main reasons for this is because they are using your money to invest and make money on interest. So if you wanted to pull your money at any moment they would take a hit on getting it back, which is why there are delays generally.
It's the same reason that paypal stores and allows you to transfer money for NO fee. Because there are often long delays that allow them to profit in investing your money. This happened to me when I received a $14k gift from my father; took paypal well over a week to confirm and transfer the money to my bank because they were using it to gain interest.

it's consuming a ton of power that is produced through renewable energy meanwhile cars are running on natural gas and oil which is rapidly running out...if you did any research into the energy consumption of bitcoin whatsoever you would know that upwards of 75% of the energy it uses is actually going to be wasted anyway (hydroelectric powerplants) and actually INCENTIVIZES renewable plants like those to open because less power is wasted and thus profit increases.

Actually, no. It just makes a lot more sense to get paid bi-weekly or weekly. Why would I want to wait all the way until the end of the month to get my money? In all honesty being paid day by day makes the most sense but that would take a lot more effort for HR/payroll.
It has absolutely nothing to do with me being "surprised the whole world doesn't work the exact same as America" and more to do with being surprised that the whole world is fine not getting paid for an entire month.
But thank you for down voting me because you have this weird perception that all Americans think the entire world revolves around them. 
By the way, it's "you're" when you're trying to say "you are" and "your" when using as a possessive verb. Also, America is capitalized as it a place, and it's spelled "surprised", with an R before the p. :)

Coinstar would be if they refused to offer the service to people, because it could be used as a laundering mechanism. That was what I was getting at.
KYC already harms the masses as it is right now in the name of preventing criminal money laundering. One of the biggest benefits of BTC arguably was the privacy attached to it which you are directly losing by buying through exchanges. I buy through exchanges myself and I'm not super stoked about having to provide them all this god damn information. Luckily I don't do anything illegal but that doesn't change the fact that they are completely ignoring my privacy.

So the median wage in the US is ~$50,000. You're under the impression that when I turn 65 and will have put away $12,500 (25%) a year for future healthcare, that ALL of that money will be needed for healthcare? 40 years of $12,500 a year, including investing that in stocks and other markets, say at 3% a year, comes out to around $940,000 at the end of a 40 year period. And 3% a year is a quite low expected return, honestly.

And just to re-iterate: I lost a ton of money on bcash and don't buy that shitcoin anymore. I was a noob then. But even so, I realize that the gains from bottom to now are much higher on bcash. You maximalists really love to ignore facts, now don't you?

This is exactly true. It's the same with buying a house; there's a billion small extra fees that stack up quick and suddenly the house you thought was $100k is more like $103k+. 
Or the same with how the interest rate over a 30 year loan is 4% and so people think they are paying 4% of the total cost of the house to borrow that money. But math is a bitch and so is compound interest, and it ends up being closer to anywhere from 30-70% of the loan being interest.

I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying here, or even what OP is saying here. Why are you talking about unable to vacation? You're completely missing the point. 
OP wanted to send the money directly in that moment, on the weekend. The money would not be cleared until Monday. He didn't want to take vacation time in order to go to the bank on Monday morning to initiate the transfer. We're not talking about physically taking a beach vacation or some shit, we're talking about using paid time off/vacation time to do menial tasks like going to the bank.
There was no option for OP to begin the transfer during the weekend. If there was, that's what he would've done. He wouldn't be posting about BTC being better if HE had the option to do what you are saying.

I lost a lot of money to it already so I'm careful.

Also, I didn't even mention stocks. But you'd be kidding yourself to suggest that stocks aren't a SAFER bet than bitcoin. Big companies stocks definitely are significantly safer.
NO ONE knows if bitcoin will continue to skyrocket. NO ONE even knows if BTC will be worth anything after quantum computing comes out. It's RISKY. But I AGREE that it is probably a damn good return for that risk. But I still am aware that the risk is there. Seems like you aren't frankly.

True but you can't just cherrypick the bad currencies and suggest there's a problem with fiat. There's a problem with fiat for different reasons than inflation, at least insofar as this post goes. His example showing how volatile BTC is compared to more stable fiat's (at least in the short term) like the USD or EURO definitely has to be considered.
Fiat in the short term wins for inflation but in the long term BTC does. Hopefully we'll eventually hit a point where BTC wins on both fronts.

Not necessarily. You're forgetting that most cc's charge merchants 4% higher prices on purchases with cc's, who in turn increase purchase prices for people using cc's. They do generally pass some of the cost on to you. I've seen more gas stations charging extra for credit card payment than not. Or other places that have credit card minimums because they actually could lose money on purchases that cost less due to cc companies having minimum fee requirements.
Do you really believe that credit cards exist just to give out free money in cashback? you could make that claim, and you could say that some benefit off the interest they charge to the other people that don't pay back their bills on time, but idk. i'd have to see numbers to believe it.

BCHSV is getting slammed because it's being delisted and people are worrying about not being able to sell it if all exchanges suddenly delist it. has nothing to do at all with bitcoin. the only thing that may result in BTC changing in price is people dumping BCHSV for it.

not necessarily true. you're running under the assumption that the person/people buying it OTC wouldn't sell on an exchange. depending on what the price was that they bought for as well as the price on different exchanges they very well might.

No, this is a terrible comparison. He probably didn't even think about wire transfers because he didn't think he ever would have to make one, as most people probably don't. 
MOST banks (in the US) do not do instant wire transfer on weekends or on certain off times. This is because of garbage KYC rules trying to stop money laundering (which they don't)
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:52:13
Yes, the dollar is fluctuating too. [
But it's not fluctuating nearly as much in the long term as BTC does in the short term. 
That being said, countries like venezuela definitely prepare to hold BTC or USD than their bolivares. BTC definitely wins out against hardcore socialist countries with increasingly worthless currencies, but it still (in the short term) has not won against the USD dollar.
I mean as far as adoption goes, imagine trying to persuade somebody to hold BTC that knows nothing about it. All you can really say is that 1 will fluctuate between -80% and +500% over the short term with no definite proof that it will even continue to do this, and simultaneously could very well be worhtless in years from now, or another that will pretty much be a constant -2% rate per year. I'm betting on BTC personally for adoption for other reasons than just that it beats inflation long term, but a lot of people who don't do a risk evaluation will see USD as the clear winner.
So we definitely need to tackle volatility at least a little bit before we hit true adoption

Because historically, for any heavily demanded asset (the exact definition of heavily demanded can vary by person, but given that bitcoin is worth billions, and billions, it separates it from other cases of rarity like dog shit or something stupid), that is also relatively restricted supply-wise and also has a known accumulation rate, can be modeled by a S2F regression analysis, and the price of said asset is directly related to the S2F number. It can be better explained at this link:
However, the summary is that those numbers are calculated using S2F are at mins and maxes for predictions of the price that have historically been very accurate. That being said, with anything, past trends do not necessarily predict future results, but there is a lot of solid math here, and given bitcoin's increase in solidarity on fundamentals, it's a very very good sign for bitcoin.

You would never deal with this problem even occurring with BTC though as you would be the one picking how much you send. Sure, if you fuck up the math conversion from BTC to fiat you could have an issue, but that would almost definitely be your own fault. 
The only dispute that is even valid mentioning here that can and does occur relatively frequently rather than the cases you are mentioning where you get overcharged are times when you get double charged. When you swipe a cc and the machine tells you it was declined but it wasn't and you get charged twice, then you can go to the bank and they will fix it. But that wouldn't really happen with BTC unless you were being stupid and didn't confirm the transaction went through AND went where it was supposed to.

An ounce of gold to now, adjusted for inflation, is roughly a gain of about 700%.
Now look at bitcoin from inception to now. It gained, relative to inflation, 2199900%. Which is a better investment? Even if you take the last 4 years, the answer is clear.
Now I want to re-iterate past trends do not predict future results. But the same could be said of gold. What about those asteroids that have a massive amount of gold on them? Do you think that human civilization won't be eventually able to mine them, and increase the gold supply to an amount the economy has never seen before? It will happen, just wait. Meanwhile bitcoin has a fixed supply.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:24:01
true. regular coinbase absolutely destroys you with fees, its insane. as much as 3-5% for credit card, and they put insane holds on bank transfers because they want the fee money. coinbase pro is better, but only if you already have money ready to go, otherwise it's basically the same because you'll still have to wait like up to a week.

@_date: 2019-08-01 15:11:45
its highly possible. maximalists love to rep BTC and ignore the fact that nearly every major recent new industry has been led not by the first one but by the best. (access to)* the internet started on AOL which quickly was realized to be slow and inefficient, and left behind by those that did it better. same with limewire, napster, etc for the music industry. same with computers, same with search engines (google was NOT the first, but is probably the best now for actual search quality). 
It could be BTC, and one of the biggest reasons people love BTC over all others is that the blockchain is the longest by computer power spent, theoretically making it more secure and harder to attack. But that's honestly one of the only major advantages it has. What's to stop a group of incredibly intelligent people (180+ I.Q.) from developing a more efficient, more secure, all around better blockchain than bitcoin? Theoretically nothing, really.

Credit cards often give back money to smart consumers because the merchants often offset cc fees by increasing prices. That being said both what I'm saying is speculative as well as what you are saying, and we would need research to prove either side.
But I suspect that a merchant is absolutely not going to just eat a 5% fee. If I was a merchant, I wouldn't; I would pass at least some of it on to the consumer.
The only two things I'll give you about cc's over btc/crypto is that cc's have protections around being scammed, or being double charged, etc. As well as btc is more inconvenient to spend (this point is only temporary; with adoption, convenience will come naturally). But the first point is moot if you're intelligent about where you shop and such.

where do I even begin with this line of logic...
a better comparison to the death thing is more like this:
say you only had two options for food. one would be super convenient, quick to make, and not require much maintenance (credit card) and the other would be annoying, harder to store, require more clean up, but be a healthier option for you long term (cash). You eat the credit card food because you save time and its just easier in the short term but fundamentally it's an unhealthier option and will kill you faster. You don't notice this now because you are alive now, so you do it anyway.
But at the end of your life you die a year early or two or whatever because of it. So yes, you don't notice it now but the effect is there.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:16:18

@_date: 2019-04-30 13:43:27
"It’s pretty obvious that Bitcoin will be more stable than fiat in the future, because of its pre-known, stable supply system and complete political neutrality."
ONLY if it gets adopted and fully adopted will this be true. In the SHORT term (&lt;1 year, maybe &lt;6 months), fiat is absolutely more stable than bitcoin and if you're claiming otherwise you're insane. Even the few months where it fluctuated between 3.2k and 4.1k that is still massive swinging compared to the USD. In the long term, bitcoin has steadily gone up over time, but it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue or not.
For one, if quantum computing hits and blockchain gets brute forcable then guess where BTC will go? Probably zero or close to zero until we get a quantum computing resistant blockchain.
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:18:05

@_date: 2019-12-23 04:22:34
Stock to flow. It's a ratio of the current known supply to the approximate rate of the increase in supply. Used extensively in analysis of a hard asset that is supposed to be "finite", such as gold (which is finite, but such a high amount of it exists on the earth that it effectively kind of isn't). The larger the ratio gets the supposed higher the value of the asset. Which historically has been true for gold in some cases and obviously bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:11:39
Yeah, fair enough. Obviously never going to be smart to brag that you have a ton of any amount of any asset. But I still don't think it's as big of a deal as alot of people on here make it out to be.

Yes, it was created as a response to the 2008 US recession and mostly as a response to inflation and the double spending problem. And it certainly is significantly more important to 3rd world countries than it is to us privileged 1st world country citizens. But the main appeal for a lot of 1st world country citizens is that it allows us to bypass the parasitic banker middlemen and give us full control of our own assets. Which is the point that OP was trying to highlight on.
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:33:30
Yes, because an increase in demand definitely won't produce an increase in price and subsequently in supply..../s

LOL cuz you've never made a mistake before? what a stupid argument holy shit
@_date: 2019-04-30 11:19:12
It is illegal to my knowledge to add an extra fee for using a credit card so this is not true.
This is blatantly and provably false. In so far as the US, it is illegal in about 20% of states to charge a fee but completely fine elsewhere, which means that the general rule is that it is not illegal and that where it is illegal it is only an exception. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:59:54
Even if that is the case, a wire transfer often has large fees, for literally no other reason than they like to make money off your money.
Even transferring bitcoin, then immediately re-buying it back through regular coinbase with a credit card is more instantaneous than a wire transfer and less fees.
Also, your point that "OP has a really, really shitty bank" is not equivalent so stating that you can find a "shitty bitcoin wallet or exchange". It doesn't cost much to get a good hardware wallet (&lt;$200), and you don't have to buy BTC through exchanges. You can get market prices in various places without KYC, and thus do not have to go through an exchange at all.
So while it is necessary if you want to send a large amount of fiat to somebody through a bank, you don't need an exchange to do it through BTC.
So again, you're wrong.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:07:09

doesn't mean that it's good for the space. when all the exchanges, who as you say should be able to set their own rules, collude, now you have BSV getting slowly removed from the entire space. and while we may cheer for this because we don't like the fundamentals, what's to stop exchanges from doing this with other things, like BTC? inherently, nothing. not trying to necessarily argue for regulation, but while there are clear cut negatives to regulation, here's one of those situations where it would possibly benefit the space.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:26:32
It doesn't matter. Bitcoin is deeper than money. bitcoin is not just a piece of paper that is accepted as a form of payment. bitcoin is literally a form of technology and is more like a computer program that represents money than anything else. which makes it significantly more like a product than like the US Dollar or canadian dollar.
which is why his analogy actually makes sense. NOBODY knows if bitcoin has achieved or will achieve the best level of cryptocurrency it can be. If anything else bitcoin is like the myspace of crypto and it remains to be seen whether it will become facebook or get overtaken.
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:27:18
Yeah, and all of that is great and well, but that makes an ASSUMPTION that it will follow that same trend again. Which isn't necessarily the case.
You can say it did it 4 times or whatever, but that does not mean it will do it again.
Shit, I hope it does. I really do. I will be sitting quite pretty financially if it does. But I'm not going all in pretending that it will 100%. 
You seem to be 100% sure of yourself, so I hope you're backing up your belief with a huge investment in it. If not then you don't truly believe what you're saying. And I'm not saying all in, but you seem VERY confident that it will go to that price. So you better have at least 25%+ of your savings in if that's what you really think will happen.

Yep I agree. I'm also looking at buying a house and had to get a gift payment from my father to help out with the down payment (great dude for even offering to help but that's besides the point). He sends it to paypal, which puts a hold on it for 4 days because it's an amount &gt; $10k.
Basically the FIAT KYC equivalent bs that prevents me from receiving money that is mine. It's in there for 4 days before paypal approves it, and then takes a further 3 days to transfer to the bank after that. Meanwhile he could've transferred all of that to me within hours at a MAX with BTC.
I will say that this whole situation is due in part to two things. 1) middlemen being greedy and wanting to profit interest off your money, and 2) useless fiat KYC to stop money laundering which doesn't even get prevented and ultimately is just hurting normal citizens.

you do realize the strong inconsistencies in what you're saying, don't you? you're arguing that bitcoin should be widely adopted and then saying that the reason people can transact with it despite volatility is that it only swings relative to other currencies and that you can just trade it over to the more stable currency? Then literally in the next comment saying that the USD is not stable and that it's lost the majority of it's buying power? which is it lol? 
Yes, the US dollar lost 98% of its value in 125 years. But you're ignoring the fact that BTC (on numerous occasions, mind you) lost 80-85% of its value in MONTHS. The US dollar has never lost more than max 5% a year, and even that is uncommon. So, to the person who wants to transact on a daily basis, what are they going to use? Something that could drop in value 10-25% overnight, or in a couple of hours,, or something that will guaranteed drop 2% in value over the year but basically a negligible percent on any given day?

@_date: 2019-09-26 12:45:35
well bitcoin fell from 20k to 3k and many times people told me, it's not worth it. bitcoin is dead! bitcoin is crashing! abandon ship!
I bought at $3.7k and have more than doubled my money, at one point over TRIPLING my money.
So you tell me, is it still a good deal? Absolutely. Don't come running to me in a few years when we break $50k and you regret not buying.
Also, what? This post literally gives you like 10 different reasons why bitcoin is a good investment, most of which are related to the inevitable collapse of the current debt driven economy.
Way I see it, throw $1000 into it and wait a few years. You've either lost that $1000 (which is not the end of the world) or you could have potentially tripled, quadrupled, 5x'ed it. 
Throw that same money in the stock market and you could end up with anywhere between $300 and $2000.

my opinion always was, sure, BTC could go to $0. or it could go to $100k. nobody truly knows, but given that it's a relatively amazing technology (and VERY new) the likelihood isn't bad.
sure, I could lose a few grand, but if I'm right...I could make way more than a few grand. so it's worth the risk imo

you also cant discount the fact that population has boomed and continues to boom and as long as it continues to boom, available land will decline relative to population, which means lower supply which means higher price. housing going up in value isn't and shouldn't be surprising to anyone. my only point was that the actual relation to wages and house prices isn't as skewed as people think it is. my father gave me his wage and the price he bought his first house at, and he had to work far more to pay off his house than I will to pay off mine. just food for thought.

It's not in store owners interests right now to use crypto ONLY as compared to cash and CC's. Store owners are not going to switch to a currency explicitly or continue to use it when confirmations will take as long as they will. The store owner accepting cash will get faster service for customers and so they will win out. That's why I bring this up. Small things like this are hindering adoption heavily. Bitcoin is currently NOT scalable to the world-wide population, and if you tell me that it is you are either completely ignorant on the topic or lying to me.


I won't need to come back to you, or this reddit post/comment thread. I have plenty of bitcoin already and have been continuing to invest in it. I see the benefits of bitcoin. I see the potential. I'm just wondering where these maximalists (hem- YOU) get off by trying to tell me that in the current state, bitcoin is ready for world-wide adoption. That's such a fucking lie. It isn't even close. It doesn't scale, it isn't fast, it's definitely not convenient to use. The only thing it already does right that doesn't need major upgrades is the fast that YOU are in control of it, and any involved third parties are majority driven and not one central entity.

It is survivorship bias by the literal definition. 


People in 2014 either invested in bitcoin or did not. But we're treating it as a good decision because it went well, which is my point. We only know now that it was a good decision. It wasn't necessarily a good one back then, if bitcoin failed.

I want to add that the people that "control" bitcoin are the miners who will validate or invalidate your transactions.

Do you understand that college is as expensive as it precisely because of those loans being so lucrative, despite legitimately fucking over a large number of well meaning people?

Gold is valuable because it is both rare and because it is useful. Gold is used widely in many industries and is used also for jewelry as well (personally, I'd say this fact is less important in it's value, but the fact remains that the jewelry industry is doing alright and is using gold a fair bit of the time).
What is bitcoin used for, if not a medium of exchange? Nothing.

@_date: 2019-09-23 19:22:09
You're putting words in my mouth. I was merely making a claim that the whole reason BTC has value right now and the hope that it will in the future is because of the speculation around it becoming an actually useful currency. As it stands now it has no value apart from that. I own BTC but I'm not sitting here lying to myself that BTC is somehow useful without the entire reason for it's creation (to solve the double spending trustless ledger problem). 
You clearly have some warped perception that BTC is inherently valuable because it's rare. While it's true that rarity increases somethings value in general, it's not a blanket truth that rarity = value. You bring up gold as a comparison to BTC because "gold is rare" and because "gold is a store of value". Yes, gold is valuable as a store of value because gold is actually useful in industry...Bitcoin currently is not. Gold creates useful things in the technology industry, actual physical products that are extremely useful for many things. Bitcoin does no such thing.
So, again, I ask you...What is the current property of bitcoin that makes it so valuable, in your opinion? You keep dodging that simple question. 
Do some research for myself? I never actually explicitly said that I think bitcoin is going to become the world currency. I merely stated that THAT BELIEF IS THE REASON BITCOIN HAS VALUE NOW, AND THE ONLY REASON IT WILL RETAIN VALUE IN THE FUTURE. Because people think it will eventually be useful. Not because it is "rare" as you keep repeatedly saying. 
Gold is not valuable, as you stated, because there "is a limited supply". Gold IS ACTUALLY USED FOR REAL PHYSICAL PRODUCTS. That's why it's valuable. Not simply because it's rare. My dog's poop is quite rare but nobody would spend as much on it as they would on gold.

Yes, but many companies make products that aren't needed, are only desired (such as video games), and certain products that were needed before now are not. My point is that despite yes companies sometimes make good products that we need, the production of those is still driven by demand and nothing else. if demand for said products diminishes than so will profits, shareholder stock prices, and the company itself. 
If bitcoin is demanded for its utility, then yes it is a product that is produced by miners. 
Is future demand not meaningful? I would say future demand is quite important to consider. You think companies don't take future demand into account for the amount of something they produce?

No, most major currencies are not "volatile" as you like to put it. What's your definition of volatility? Compared to BTC in the short term, USD, euro, whatever are extremely stable.


No, no it definitely is not...The US dollar has been around for 100+ years and at no point in its history has it ever lost even more than 10% of its value in a few months. Sure, the us dollar loses value every year. But it loses a consistent 2% value a year, not 85% as you're claiming.
You literally have no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the US dollar can lose 85% of its value in a few months. Stop shilling bitcoin when there are clear problems with it. Yes, bitcoin goes up historically over time. But that doesn't matter to most people, mainly because past trends do not guarantee future cycles.

A company's profits and product sales are still entirely driven by demand. Doesn't matter how good your company has become at producing TV's if they are no longer demanded at all. Same with bitcoin, same with any product you advertise. The only slight difference is that you're saying that the demand of bitcoin is based on speculation, which is somewhat true. However, the stock price of all companies is based around the same speculation that said company will still be around and doing well. But big companies can still fail and do. Enron for example was doing quite well and then no longer was, and went bankrupt. Who is to say the very same thing can't happen to companies of similar or even bigger size? Nobody knows for sure.

Why is trying to replace fiat impossible? I think you're missing the point anyway.

Bitcoin is a good store of value precisely because of the speculation that it will be the world's currency eventually. If not for being a good medium of exchange, what else is valuable about it? Nothing. So if you're telling me that it will never be more used than fiat as a currency, I ask you what exactly makes it valuable in the first place? Satoshi wanted it to be used as a medium of exchange, not HODL'ed into irrelevance.

guys, its a log scale. if this was linearly scaled you would literally see nothing except for a straight line across the bottom from 2009 to 2017 and then a random skyrocket. 
in a financial market you care a LOT more about percentage growth than about numerical growth. $1 to $10 means a lot more than $100 to $109 despite the linear difference being the same.
So in other words this graph depicts percentage growth while retaining the physical value in dollars as the y axis, which is why a log scale had to be used.
edit: $1 to $10 = $100 to $109, not $100 to $110 xD math is hard
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:02:13
Replace long term store of value with currency, and sure. The only reason bitcoin is worth anything right now is based entirely on the speculation that it will at one point become a useful currency. Right now it's only real use case is transferring large sums of money without having to wait inexorable amounts of time (like what happens when trying to transfer money with a bank or paypal or whatever else). 
I disagree that bitcoin will be a store of value if it fails as a mowt and moe. Those are the main reasons it is useful. Running with the assumption that bitcoin fails those two, it is at that point nothing more than a receipt showing how much electricity you wasted. (or someone else and they sold that wasted electricity to you)

Of course it's vague. I don't know expressly at this moment what "Better tech" means. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Let's say someone develops something completely identical to bitcoin but with a measurably better level of scalbility. I.e. you can have 3 times the users at the same level of latency. That would be objectively better. 


Bitcoin has legitimate problems as it stands right now, problems that have been solved by other cryptos. Those cryptos fail in some other aspect relative to bitcoin, which is why bitcoin is overall still better, but those problems are still there. Scalibility being the main issue in my opinion right now. How is bitcoin supposed to be a world currency when it can't even complete under hour transactions in high-demand times? Especially when those "high-demand" times isn't even a small blip of the world's current population? I could see confirmations taking days, maybe weeks if all 7 billion people used bitcoin.

I didn't even say anywhere in my comment that I think past performance is a predictor of future performance. I was only pointing out that there are a lot of misguided comments in this thread of people believing that this graph is cherrypicking because it has a log scale, when in fact the log scale is the only reason that this graph (or any financial graph of explosive growth)  has any meaning. 
A log scale allows you to see the cyclical nature of the increases on ONE graph rather than having to break the graphs up because a linear scale would look awful.

You could also just compare coinbase volumes to exchanges known for faking. If you really care enough you'll do the research yourself. I frankly don't care enough to go down the rabbit hole of finding that by exchange source.

Seriously, giving me a logical response as to why the layman should be fine with waiting 2+ hours for bitcoin confirmations whenever he goes out shopping somewhere. I'll wait.
Also; a basic level of looking at monetary history? Dude, I couldn't give less of a shit how monetary policy was enacted 2000 years ago. We're not in that day and age anymore. Times are different. We all have jobs and shit and don't have fucking time to sit around and wait for trades to confirm with other people.

You're really unironically under the belief that if you suddenly took away these massive subsidies corporations get that they wouldn't recoup that money somehow, in the form of *slightly* higher prices to customers? You really believe they would just not care, and do nothing at all to recoup that money? 
The only thing that would happen is that everyone would get a subsidy and pay all of that money back in slightly higher prices to the exact same corporations.
Cause and effect are very real. "Just take the subsidies and give them to American people instead. nothing negative could possibly result from such an idea".
Just like socialism, giving everyone $1k or $2k or whatever SOUNDS just GREAT on paper. What could go wrong? Well, many things. The people it intends to help it really doesn't help at all. Most of the programs that the gov spends money on end up failing astronomically and just end up raising debt. Look at the war on drugs, where money was thrown at ending drug addictions, and look how that went. Look at the war on poverty, where money was thrown at poor people with the intent of reducing the amount of homeless people. Except it raised the amount of homeless people because why the fuck should I work if the government can pay for all my needs? Look at the credit given to single mothers in the 70s and 80s, which caused a massive increase in single motherhood rates. The black community it went from 25% to 70%+, the white community it went from ~15% to 25%+, etc. Literally a social incentive meant to help families in need caused a greater incidence of families in need because, now you have families that have only one parent, which disrupts a family far more than having both parents there and less money (there are many studies showing that what the parents do for their kids matters a lot more than how much money they spend on them.) 
TLDR: Throwing money at problems doesn't fix them as effectively as better tactics, like shifting bad cultural ideas to better ones.
How about maybe advocate a cultural shift to bitcoin where saving is incentivized, instead of just saying the government should fix literally everything and the only way to do that is to throw money at every problem and expect that to magically fix everything?

A few things:
Finland has an average of 50% tax rate. Avg tax rate in US is closer to 30%. 
The US spends 3x more of it's GDP on the military than finland does. So it has less to spend on other things, such as welfare and medical. That puts it at a disadvantage straight off.
Finland also has a much smaller population, and thus much less people to pay for. And again, because you have a higher tax rate, you can afford more spending on those systems.
The inmate situation is a good point. That's a massive cost to the taxpayer.
I would also make the case that we have more people in welfare in the US relative to your country, while simultaneously having less to spend on it.
So all that being said, OF COURSE your country will have stronger welfare. It's much easier to have stronger welfare when you pay more into that system, while simultaneously having less people using it. 
That combined with the ridiculously large amount of administrative costs leading to higher medical expenses leaves us with a shittier system.
I also want to point out that your country has no problem military wise even under attack because the US has such a strong military that we will protect you. So you don't have to worry about it.
All food for thought. People love to bring up the UBI of other countries being successful. But the US is a massively bigger country than most of the countries people bring up, often by a factor of 70-80x as big. So the same system probably wouldn't be successful.
That being said, automation is coming and it is coming fast. UBI will be needed eventually; not everyone in society is fit for the harder, higher level intelligence jobs. This sounds mean but it's just the truth. Finding a good balance of UBI is necessary, though. Giving too much would make people lazy and giving too little would render too many people poor.

Actually, you're wrong. Coinbase (at least, Coinbase Pro, which is what you should be using if you care about fees. regular coinbase destroys you with fees if you pay with a debit or credit card, but coinbase pro has very nice small fees if you link a bank account.) has percentage fees that don't change unless you're talking about BIG money, so it doesn't matter about number of transactions, it matters how much you're buying. If the fee is 0.3% then it doesn't matter if you spent $100 over the course of 10 transactions, or 1 transaction, you're still paying 30 cents.
The fees don't change unless you're investing over $10M a month, which I think is safe to say for somebody asking about when the right time to buy is.

It's based on total wealth in the entire world, in relation to the amount of bitcoins that will ever exist. In fact, with my original number, I was wrong. Re-calculating it now, you get a higher number. But, this analysis assumes that wealth is spread completely evenly, which of course, it isn't.
Running with these numbers that google returns (you can do deeper research if you don't trust it, but this is just an estimation anyway, so take it with a grain of salt regardless):
$280 trillion total wealth in the world.
7 million people investing, with 7.53 billion total world population. 
7 million / 7.53 billion = 0.00092961487
0.00092961487 * $280 trillion = 260292163600
260292163600 / 21m bitcoins = $12394
Now, if you readjust this calculation to be taking 7,000,000 people that make median world income, which google states is approximately $9700, and take each of these people to spend 1 year's income directly on bitcoin, then the average price becomes:
7000000*9700/21m = $3,233
Some sources state that an estimated 5% of Americans own bitcoin, which is approximately 15 million people. With a median income of roughly $60-63k, and 15 million people investing, I think it's safe to say that there is sufficiently 7 million people spread out through the first world countries spending that much on bitcoin, or definitely that there will be in the future as adoption spreads.
All of this is enough for me to confidently state that the bottom of bitcoin (~$3100) has been seen and that we're only going up slowly from here.

Purchasing power increasing regardless of whether there's inflation or not would be registered as a gain, regardless of whether you think it is or isn't.
Let's say I invest $10K into the stock market right now, and in 20 years that $10K has turned into $30K. If in that same 20 years, the value of USD has fallen by 50%, then my $30K after that 20 years is worth the same as $15K back when I invested. Which means I'm in the green $5K and have higher purchasing power. So even though the USD is inflationary, my purchasing power in that instance has increased relative to inflation, which means I have made "gains". It doesn't matter if you like the USD or not, or think its a scam or not, the truth is that my purchasing power increased therefore I have gained.
There are some dumbass people on this subreddit that claim that BTC shouldn't be looked at as a relation to the USD. Well it has to be. A comparison to SOMETHING is needed to see if the overall purchasing power of a bitcoin is going up or not. If you don't compare it to paper currencies, what else can you possibly compare it to? Eventually, sure, paper currencies might be mostly obsolete. But for right now, they aren't, and the relation is important because it's the only way to know if BTC is appreciating or depreciating in purchasing power.

There are papers written that suggest that as much as 80% of all bitcoin mining is occuring through renewable sources, so yes, most of it is indeed renewable.
btc mining also heavily encourage opening of new hydro power plants that would waste the power anyway as they are too far from society to actually use most of it. not hard to set up some PC's at a hydroplant. suddenly 90% of the power they were originally just wasting is now used to make bitcoin. even at a break even that would vastly increase profits.

It definitely is. I mostly agree on value being subjective; that being said, value in industry and in physical use cases is a little bit different, in my opinion. Gold "being shiny" shouldn't be an objective proof of value, and the fact that it's renowned for this reason, as are diamonds, is asinine to me. Gold being useful in industry is significantly more substantial. It is possible we have catastrophes occur and suddenly the last thing we have to worry about is whether or not something is shiny. In that case, the ability to use gold to produce useful tools and products is much more important.

No, because YOU are arguing that bitcoin stolen from exchanges (which isn't REALLY bitcoin, let's be honest, this is equivalent to stealing money from somebodies bank by using their bank pass, or stealing stocks from their stock account using their pass, etc) is the same as bitcoin stolen from where it SHOULD be, which is in hardware wallets. Bitcoin itself isn't to blame here, it's the fact that the person stored it improperly, however they chose to. Again going back to human ignorance and imperfection.
And let me ask you this question, how does one "securely" store gold? Any means through a bank or third party requires identification, which can be stolen, or passwords, which can also be stolen.

There absolutely can be a model that could predict what bitcoin will be after full adoption. Assume that as an absolute maximum say as far as 100 years into the future, 10% of the world (assume population of 8 billion people) puts 30% of their income into BTC.
If we assume that the total cumulative wealth of the entire world is the same then as it is now, at $280 trillion USD (according to google; don't quote me on this exact number), then this is how much  money will be put into BTC by that point:
10% of the world \* 30% of their income \* $280 trillion = $84000000000000/21m bitcoins = $400k
Using significantly more modest numbers still gets you a large price tag. Even if 10% of the world were to put 10% of their income in, that would make the price sit right at $133k.
All of this assumes also that wealth distribution is uniform (which of course it isn't); but most of the people investing into BTC have a sufficiently larger amount of money then the world's average.
So, it all depends on how strong adoption becomes and how truthfully people believe in it. If suddenly 20% of the entire world behaved exactly like a select few on this subreddit do, putting a large sum of their total wealth into it, it would skyrocket all the way past $100k EASILY. I don't think this is how it will happen, but over the next 10 decades it might happen slowly.

Also lefties: Gender isn't binary.
"A citizen is a citizen, their gender identity doesnt really matter. You've got some issues with this whole gender thing dont you? Personally I get confused by all that stuff too but people are people and its none of my goddamn business in the first place."


"You've lost any point you were trying to make. If you like dudes and chicks, right on brother your chances at getting laid have risen exponentially." 
You're completely missing the point. He's saying lefties contradict themselves by simultaneously saying that gender isn't binary and also that literally a sexuality based around on liking the "two" genders (bisexuality) exists. How can you argue that gender isn't binary but also have a classification created around gender being binary?

Okay, I shouldn't have said moral banning. That's not really what I actually meant, I meant more what you're saying here about educating. As long as people understand that gambling is almost always house odds, then it's fine. But I just don't agree with this "provably fair" bullshit because the truth is that most people do not understand or pay attention to the actual odds of the games they're playing. Provably fair, to people who aren't great at math or have little understanding of casinos and casino games, sounds like it's fair to the casino and the better, and thus it's equal chances for both. Which is NOT what provably fair is. That was the point I was making and the entire reason I do not support this LN blackjack thing. It's deceiving people of lesser intelligence into thinking they have good chances to win money when it's absolutely house edge.

Nobody really knows, and I'll give you that. But just because you don't know the bounds doesn't mean there isn't one. Obviously if you knew where all gold was on the planet, or in the solar system (if you believe efficient space travel will soon be here), then that would have a better strangle on the price. As compared to how it is now, where we know there is a physical limitation but unsure what it is exactly.
Either way, bitcoin is fixed mathematically on its supply, and even on its rate of supply increase, which is extremely attractive.

It's only a matter of time, frankly. The funny thing is that if you do the math, even if only 7 million people on the planet put money into bitcoin, it will still have a minimum price of roughly $3500. Which is fairly close to what the last bottom was and what a lot of people believe will be the lowest bottom here on out. So anyone who bought already at that level is fairly safe. 
At this point it seems to me the only major risks that are left are government banning (which is the minor of the two) and the other one being quantum computing. It remains to be seen what will happen.

And potentially 5 years from now bitcoin will be worth $100K a coin. That $1k I could have spent into BTC when it was $4k will be put onto BTC when it's like $10k, so now in the future I could've had $25K instead of $10K? Yeah, life does suck. You're right.

Yes, taxes are hell indeed.
That being said, crypto taxes are especially worse. Honestly, though, (and I may eat my words for this), it's insane what tax services charge for crypto traders. At least for me, I had only done probably 50 or so trades in all of 2017. There's only one form that you have to use to file crypto taxes, and for small amount of transactions, it doesn't take that long. Yet they charge anywhere from $150 (&lt;100 transactions) to $1000 (as much as 2000+) extra.
I'm a programmer and I considered making a program to fill out the form for me, just as a fun project. Could be useful.
I did my taxes manually this year to save that money, and I'm well glad I did. I'm considering keeping that form saved on my desktop and everytime I do a trade, logging it on that form so that next time tax season comes around I just have it already done pretty much.

I mean, uneducated people might assume that me stating bitcoin is an investment to think its a scam. But if I suggested stocks to those very same people, would they say stocks are a scam? Probably not. While it's true bitcoin is a separate entity and is a technology, it's really not all that different from investing in a tech company stock. The difference is only that bitcoin is a technology meant to be a currency and easily transferrable while stocks aren't necessarily. 
Insofar as comparing bitcoin to investments I see bitcoin as a riskier but potentially higher profit penny stock. It's similar in volatility to penny stocks but has seen much much greater returns since it was invented. Cheers for the discussion :)

How is it different? Because freedom of expression was never cemented under the constitution, for one, which is what you and your democrat friends in thist thread keep pointing to. One is protected under the constitution (freedom of speech) and one isn't (freedom of expression). 
So, if you're going to continue to use that constitution thing as an argument, don't also bring up cases of freedom of expression in addition  to that.
But yeah, you're right; having republican opinions (pro choice, anti-racism, religious views) is so terrible, meanwhile having a reddit username titled bigdaddyanustart on a public forum (reddit) where plenty of young teenagers post and read is so completely fine! You're insane.

Says who? The oldest stock currently on the stock exchange is the NYSE-BK stock which has gone from $1.40 to $47 currently. That's a 33x return in 30 years. Which is only 11% per year.
Sure, that's a good return. But that's long long long term, whereas bitcoin is shorter term and making much faster and much more explosive gains. Not to mention, the stock market hasn't been around THAT long. You can't say for sure that the stock market will forever continue an upward trajectory. What will happen when all of a sudden btc does become king, kicking other currencies out? Nobody will be buying stocks with US dollars, that's for sure. You can say I'm betting on a coin flip, but I'm up 115% in 3 months while the stock market a lot of stocks are down (including the ones that I bought). 
Either way, just like bitcoin, the stock market is never 100% going to continue going up forever. It probably will, and it will probably have peaks and valleys, but it's never truly guaranteed. That and also it may have a couple years where it has a long dip  before recovering.
I also want to point out that even though that stock went from $1.40 in 1979 to $47 now, the value of the us dollar has fallen since then by about a 4 fold increase. So in other words, $1.40 then is now equivalent to roughly $6 now. So it's more like, against inflation you gained about 8x. Over 30 YEARS. That's not great.
And yes, you could say its a coin flip that BTC goes to $1m. 125x, a mere fraction of 13780x. But that's a much quicker time span than stocks will be. For all we know BTC could go to 1m in 15 years. Whereas to make an equivalent amount of money like that on stocks you would need to sit on it for well over 50 years.

The guy does state that 25-50 years could be a wide range and could be wrong, but I don't see them going from nothing to ready to launch on such a big project in 7 years.

Social media is social media.
Um, in this context, no, there's a big difference. People go to twitter because a lot of other people go on twitter. Therefore if you want your voice to be heard, you have to do it on the platform everyone else is using. So again, not a fair comparison.
There's a reason we had to literally force businesses to allow blacks serivce.
Are you talking recently? Or way back in the day? Cuz I'm talking about recently, not 30-40+ years ago. Stay with me now. No serious businesses nowadays don't allow black people. I also want to add that most of the time, guess what happens when a baker doesn't allow gay people to buy their products? They lose business. A ton of business. Let the market weed the assholes out. It happens every time.
Whoever might be in charge of banning people, I suppose.
And who should be in charge of such things? I bet you would be quite unpleased if the person in charge of Twitter banning was far right and started banning anyone with a leftist opinion, wouldn't you? So again, for like the fourth time, I ask you: who should be in charge of determing somebodies character? who should be in charge of banning people? And who gives those people the right to be in charge of that? Who determines they are best fit and least bias enough to do such a job? I don't want only leftists being banned, or only conservatives being banned, or only whites, or only blacks, or only straights, or only gays, etc. Who determines what the "correct" opinions are, and what you can and cannot say?
"And yes, you can definitely be racist and homophobic as a gay minority.  Self-hate is very much a thing, ask so many Republican lawmakers and religious leaders found soliciting men and abusing boys."
Why are you bringing up something we weren't even talking about? I don't care about republicans right now, that's not what we're talking about.

Don't check often on keys working. They should, given that I don't change anything.
I check the price more than I care to admit. But a large part of that is because work is slow and I'm bored. Maybe something like 20 times a work day, or 10 times a weekend day.
HODL, but if you think the price will correct, and are fine with possibly losing a little, buying and re-selling. I was pissed this weekend because when I saw it was $7300 I knew it would correct but I wasn't home and didn't have access to my HW wallet so I couldn't transfer and sell. and sure enough it did.
That being said, a more relaxed strategy is just dollar cost average small buys. I was DCA'ing $100 a week every week since February and it's gone well. If you wanted to DCA even harder you could do like $15 a day at the exact same time of day.

Its a tough cookie. The media is on it like a frenzy now because it has rallied almost 100% since the low of this year. So based on your logic, with the media all over it, now would be the time to sell.
However, personally, I do not think bitcoin is done at $6k. I think it will slowly, very slowly, maybe $100-$300 a week climb from here (with some dips obviously) all the way to $8k or so and then maybe stabilize for a bit or fluctuate between $6-9k until the end of the year, and then slowly rise as the halving approaches, blowing right past the previous ATH, or maybe not. I think though, even if it doesn't touch the previous ATH or get anywhere close to it, that it will probably at least sit around $10k, for awhile.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:50:05
Indeed. Thats why after last year when I held from 10k and sold after the bcash fork at 5.5k because I was pretty sure the market was absolutely fucked, and it dropped to 3k, then stabilized, I was like this is the true dip I've been waiting for. 
I'm not missing my chance this time. I'm not going to be that guy that says when the price is high "it's too high now..it will crash soon, I'll wait to buy until then". While simultaneously saying when the price is low, "it's going to go lower. i'll wait to buy it until it does". So I chucked what I was willing to lose at BTC when it was \~$3750.

I agreed with most of this but you're insane if you think a stock is a speculative asset. A stock's price is literally tied to the profit of a company. Bitcoin is entirely speculative, mostly because who is to say that Bitcoin is really the Facebook of cryptocurrencies? Who is to say that bitcoin isn't the first of many greats, and that bitcoin is only a napster where what we truly need is iTunes?

No, people think bitcoin is a scam because they see the insane, unexplainable, and speculative growth and bubble of 2017. And see that immediately afterwards it crashed hard down to like $7k and then soon after that down to like $4k. 
Most people are used to traditional stocks which at best would swing MAYBE 30% up or down in one direction based on news but not much more than that. They also think it's a scam because they think it's fake money (had that one said to me earlier this year) as well as news like Mtgox and QuadrigaCX really doesn't help.

This really depends on what you mean by "using stats to predict the next number at roulette". If you're talking actual proven stats, like betting $1 against $1.20 that a coin will flip heads on next flip, then it's fine (I don't know the exact odds of roulette so I'm using a coin example instead). If you're talking gambler's fallacy, i.e. it just rolled black 10 times in a row, there's no way it will roll black again on this next one, then that's fallacious thinking and generally will result in somebody getting burned.

I want to add that the reason we can't let the bank continue as the solution to double spending is because it's primarily done through trust. And why should I trust that the bank won't be corrupt and allow itself to double spend without allowing anyone else to double spend? That's exactly what's currently happening. It's just not as widely known as it should be because the US dollar is the world reserve currency currently and so this double spending from the central banks isn't noticed as it isn't as quick of an inflation as socialist countries that don't have such a high demand for their currencies.

Fundamentally, if gold wasn't materially useful in many places in industry, there would be nothing separating it from being a physical "bitcoin", if you will; at least in so far as there not being an inherent intrinsic value built in. 
Has a track history of thousands of years is meaningless. In the grand scheme of the universe, thousands of years is nothing and will also be nothing to the human race at one point. Excluding uses in industry, gold is valuable, like fiat, only because we've all agreed it to be valuable. Gold's only true value in my mind is its uses in industry. It shouldn't be hoarded otherwise.

Fees at most exchanges are a percentage. You will pay the same fee buying $15 a day for 30 days and buying $450 once a day once a month. No reason to try to wait for a dip when there is never a guarantee that there will be one. With DCA at least you guaranteed buying at a relatively average price. It also prevents you from trying to time the market by saying "oh I'll just wait for the dip" because again, there is never a guarantee another "dip" will even happen.

HODL is a funny meme but it's honestly dangerous. Hindsight is ALWAYS 20 20, though. If something is crashing hard, and there's a reason for it to crash hard (like november 2018 after the BCH hard fork, fucking the entire market. reason being that BCH was crashing hard and a lot of people couldn't sell it because it was locked on exchanges, this is very scary and imo one of the biggest reasons BTC went from $6k to $3500 in one foul swoop in late 2018) then sell. 
I sold everything at $5500 and re bought most of it with the same money at \~$4000. saved myself from losing like $2k. Despite the fact that if I bought more and HODLed the original I would be up so much more now, I don't regret it, because for all we know the market could have gone even lower and stayed lower. It'd be easy for me to say now that I should have held up to this point but I'm only saying that because I know the outcome.

List of reasons why the USD is a bad currency:
1) It's not easily transferrable to other people at any given time of the day or week. 
Trying to transfer money to somebody causes the bank to ask you for what reason you want to transfer it (invasion of privacy). They will put holds on it if they determine you are transferring it to said person for an arbitrary reason that they don't like. They also don't allow you to directly transfer it on your own time; it has to be during standard business hours, or during the week, or not during holidays (this depends on the banking institution that you choose). BTC as a solution, you can send money at any time to anyone you choose without anyone telling you why you can't. No bullshit banker middleman running the show.
2) It loses value quite quickly long term. 
I know what you're thinking; but BTC went from 20k to 3k in 1 year! Yeah, great, but it also statistically from its start has risen from .3 cents to now currently $8000. Whereas in that time, if you bought something in 2009 for $1 you would now need $1.20 for that same item in 2019. Bitcoin long term rises, USD long term falls.
3) USD is largely backed by trust, bitcoin backed by mathematically rigid supply and proof of work. 
When you store money in the bank you are trusting that bank to keep it available for you to withdraw at any point. Banks run on the supposition that not everyone will go to withdraw their funds at the same time. What would happen if that did occur, though? Banks would fail your trust and a lot of people would not be able to withdraw their money. This is similar to cryptocurrency exchanges, which is why you should always keep your own private keys and not store them anywhere.
4) USD is printed in mass quantity to pay for a level of debt that will never be paid back, causing even more inflation. 
For bitcoin, though, this is impossible to do, because it has a fixed supply and control of bitcoin is not held by one single entity. Also the fact that the block chain is a public ledger that everyone can see would immediately wipe out any attempts at cheating the system.
5) USD is centralized. Bitcoin is decentralized.
One entity essentially controls it, so manipulation of it is possible. Not even possible, but commonplace. Again bitcoin is decentralized, no one entity controls it, so manipulation is impossible.
6) USD can be and has been counterfeited. GL counterfeiting bitcoin, you can't do it.
7) USD isn't highly divisible. 
You also waste a lot of resources (paper, copper, tin) to create physical coins and bills. With crypto you can divide down to 1/300th of a penny in the form of satoshi's. And the fact that bitcoin is minable creates a massive incentive to open renewable hydropower plants that previously couldn't use a lot of the energy that they were producing, because societies were too far away to move the energy to. Bitcoin is actually GOOD for the environment.
Don't get me wrong, there are still some kinks to work out of bitcoin, but I look forward to your response of why bitcoin is bad and why USD is king. Good luck :)

How is the foundation of bitcoin on trust and honor? Please tell me that, because bitcoin is doing exactly the opposite of that. You can't make the claim that bitcoin too is founded on trust and honor without giving me an explicit explanation of how that's true. 
"A peaceful protest would be a better solution". LOL. Yes, a peaceful protest will somehow persuade the corrupt bankers and government workers to suddenly give back and stop abusing their power. You clearly have no understanding of how the world works if you think that's a viable solution. But, good luck sitting in peace trying to quietly persuade the elites to suddenly give a fuck about you. It won't happen.
So, bitcoin might not be usable completely as a medium of exchange, sure. I'll give you that. But what asset would I rather hold as far as increasing my purchasing power? Definitely not the USD. Definitely bitcoin, or gold or silver.
And yes, no offense but I do not give a shit about an internet stranger's problems. Especially one who is trying to undermine bitcoin, currently the best attempt at pushing back against government and elitist greed and corruption. I would love for you to entertain the thought of just how exactly a peaceful protest would do anything.

Nope, for BTC you have to sell or transact it.  For (a rough) example, If you buy BTC currently at $6000 and then hold through next year and it's then $10K, you don't pay any taxes on it until you sell. Appreciative assets do not require tax payments until being sold (OR transacted. Which means if you were to trade that BTC Into litecoin or some altcoin or something, then you would have to pay taxes on it.)

No, not what I'm saying at all. 
If a thief/hacker found your gold in your house, there's nothing you can do. If a thief/hacker found your bitcoin wallet in your house, he would not physically be able to steal your coins without the passphrases also. So, you tell me. What's easier to steal in that case, the bitcoin, or the gold? That's like saying you find a gold bar in plain sight vs. a gold bar locked in a safe that requires 12 passphrases and an 8 digit pin to open, and isn't physically breakable, it HAS to be cracked cryptographically, and suggesting that it's equally as easy to steal both of them.
99%+ of the time bitcoin is stolen, it's stolen from an online wallet/exchange wallet, it's stolen because the keys to transfer were stored online, or etc. Nothing about BTC says that it has to be stored this way. Bitcoin can and often is stored offline, with no way for an internet hacker to gain access. 
"I guess you could say bitcoin is impossible to steal or lose if you don't make any mistakes, but that is unrealistic." No, it's not unrealistic at all, actually. Because bitcoin is stolen from exchanges (NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.) or it's stolen from any other you keep the coins ONLINE. Keeping your coins in an exchange is vastly different then keeping them in a secure cold storage wallet.
GOOD LUCK stealing bitcoin from somebodies wallet that is not internet connected, that is locked behind 12-24 word passphrases as well as an 8 digit pin code, etc.
Here's an example for you; if I had a credit card that wasn't internet connected whatsoever and the number was not online anywhere. And I told you to try to steal it, you wouldn't be able to. Now if I used my card online and stored the number in multiple places, it would be a lot easier. That's bitcoin in a cold wallet vs. bitcoin on coinbase, kraken, bitfinex, etc. BIG DIFFERENCE.
One more small thing to add; sure, if the hacker/thief found your hardware wallet, they could take it with them. But hardware wallets are quite small and much harder to find then say a gold bar. A hardware wallet can store tens of millions of USD in BTC and other currencies, while if you were trying to hide tens of millions of dollars in gold in your house it would be much easier to find. It would just be flat out much much larger. So again, BTC wins in that regard as long as it is handled and hidden properly.
Your example of human stupidity is a stupid one. Do you really believe that most people that have millions upon millions of BTC or other crypto's aren't safeguarding those funds appropriately? Sure, people will lesser funds may be a bit more careless. And people do make mistakes, but as long as enough proper precautions are taken, it's a lot easier to hide bitcoin than it is to hide gold.

The amount that I lost is removed from taxable income. The cap is roughly $3000, though, so it's not like you can bet your entire income and lose it all and then not owe taxes. But that little amount definitely helps

I don't think necessarily that there's cause for concern there, mostly because eth classic is such a small and irrelevant coin that it's a lot easier to summon the manpower to 51% attack it. It just shows you that you should be very careful what altcoins you invest in.

You're referencing private companies and peaceful protests, not peaceful protests involving government corruption and central bankers. I was not talking about private companies. 
So again, your attempt to prove that peaceful protesting will stop government corruption is incorrect. Sure, private companies will of course have to take action when workers refuse to work. Refusing to work is also a much different type of protest then "peaceful protest" implies, anyway. But good luck preventing power abuse within the government by sitting by and saying "this isn't okay, but I'm going to do nothing else then sit here and protest peacefully". 
Bitcoin has value as a currency. It is freedom from banks telling me what I can and cannot do with  my own money, in the name of "stopping money laundering" even though money laundering still very much occurs and their attempts to stop it will just ultimately be futile as criminals find other methods.
Bitcoin is far more immune to it than your fiat currencies. The US dollar is arguably the only currency that hasn't deflated in value significantly and even then, it has.

Hold is only a good strategy if there's not an obvious reason for the price to decrease. The price being $20k which was well over 15 times the low for that year probably should've been an indicator to sell. Even $15k was 10 times over the low and was probably an indicator to sell also. But those that didn't sell probably didn't sell because they were greedy.

I think it's more that this time there are a myriad of technological improvements as well as institutional money wanting to get in more and more.

At best people are more educated on why bitcoin is king and not as responsive to some of the garbage FUD articles that come out (such as binance/tether situation, CZB trying to rollback bitcoin, etc) and at worst people are the same and the reason for the climb is entirely because of technological improvements and institutional money.

because provably fair isn't the same as 50/50. provably fair only means that the results can't be rigged by anyone messing with the system, it doesn't mean that the chance to win or lose is 50%. It's really not all that different than real casino's. It's almost worse because you can do it wherever and whenever you want, with no restriction.
Also, do you really believe there haven't been ANY provably fair online casinos? I'll concede that physical casino buildings IRL maybe haven't been provably fair but there definitely have been provably fair online casinos plenty of times and still are. Most of them are just illegal in the US and possibly in other first world countries also.

This is all well and good but this is just your opinion. You can tell me all day long that adding an infinite number of zeros is zero, but that's not provable mathematically. Even if your logic makes sense, it could never be carried out in practice, because adding an infinite number of things in finite time isn't possible.
I'm siding with calculus, which is rigid and provable. Limits are quantifiable, and limits to infinity or limits of x -&gt; zero that deal with division by x are quantifiable. Your example is mere logical conjecture, but it's not provable in an algebraic sense whatsoever. Until you can come up with an algebraic/calculus proof that somehow rules out what we already know and says that infinity times zero is zero (which you won't be able to do), infinity times zero is an indeterminate form.
Do you believe that 0 divided by 0 is indeterminate? Let's assume for a second that 0/0 = 1. Then 0/(0/0) = (1/0) which gives us (0/1) = 1/0) which gives us infinity = 0? And infinity\*0 really is equivalent to saying 1/0 \* 0 = 0/0. So there's a contradiction straight up with saying that 0/0 isn't indeterminate, and saying 0/0 isn't indeterminate is the same as saying infinity\*0 isn't indeterminate. By contradiction we've proven that it has to be, otherwise all mathematical connections are thrown out the window.

Of course there will always be greed, inequality, and corruption. But this is a chance to push back on that, if the commonman invests. Which they aren't, and you aren't helping by responding with relatively obvious truths as if it's some debunkment of the utility of bitcoin. Just because there will still be greed and inequality doesn't mean reducing the inequality and stopping a lot of greed isn't a worthwhile endeavor. 
College loans and mortgage interest rates have absolutely fucking nothing to do with the USD or bitcoin anyway. Bitcoin WILL solve those issues because peer to peer lending will come about with lower interest rates, though. Right now, with the USD, there is no peer to peer lending that is trutstworthy. The banks don't allow you to do with your own money what you want to do. 
I couldn't give less of a shit if BTC solves YOUR problems or not. Bitcoin doesn't solve my problems that much either; but I recognize that for a lot of people, it does solve their problems. And eventually it will hopefully eliminate this garbage inflation-ridden USD that is the biggest hidden and successful scam ever run.

You can't claim losses on crypto unless you sell it, even if it goes down in value. If you buy 1 bitcoin in January 2020 at $10k (making prices up here for an example), and by the end of the tax year it is $5k, but you cannot claim $5k losses unless you physically sold it. Bitcoin is no different than stocks in this way. Another example would be if you bought 1 BTC at $10k in January, it dropped to $5k in the middle of the year, but rose to $15k at the end of the year. If you sold in the middle then you can claim $5k losses, if you sold at the end then you must claim $5k gains.
The IRS doesn't acknowledge it until it changes form. I.e. if you, at the end of that same year, trade the BTC for ethereum or litecoin, you will have made a transaction and you can claim gains. (Gains in this case being equivalent to how much your USD value of said asset changed)
I don't know about obtaining it through other means. I would imagine if you ran a business and were receiving BTC for goods then you would be taxed as that would be income. But as far as something much less common, like say if I were to walk my friends dog for $10 of BTC, that's probably income and you would probably be taxed immediately. But again I'm not sure on this.

Even if you don't intend to convert it back to fiat, it's still an investment. If BTC ends up being the currency of the future that everyone uses, don't you believe that it will be much higher in price relative to fiat? Or much higher in price relative to spending power? Thus even if you don't intend to convert back to fiat, your present day net worth assuming full adoption hits and nobody is using fiat anymore, will still be astronomically more than if you don't buy and hold now.
So, I think you're wrong. Let's say currently that 2 BTC buys you a decent car ($13K). In the future when fiat goes away (say this happens when 1 BTC trades for $500k usd, for example, just to make you aware of what the value could be), you will only need to spend ..03 BTC (\~$15K) For a decent car. So if you bought .03 BTC now (at 6750, this is $202.50), you have just purchased a nice car for effectively $200. Do you see my point?

"I do not see BTC reaching anywhere near the population saturation you seem to expect until its price is reasonable, the minimum transaction amount is decreased, and people stop hoarding it and instead using it"
Price is reasonable? The price doesn't have to be reasonable, bitcoin is infinitely divisible and can be sent in literally fractions of a penny if that is desired. There are already ways to decrease the minimum transaction count. Litecoin for example allows you to reduce fees for sending bitcoin by basically 400%. I agree that people should use it, but its a slow process to integrate into society in most places where people WANT to use it. Convenience is important, why should I waste my time sending BTC when I can do credit card transactions the same way that are much easier and quicker? 
"Saying there will be 21million BTC is actually a misnomer. In reality, when the last bitcoin is mined, the sum of all accounts on the bitcoin ledger will be equal to 21million. Truthfully, there is no such thing as a bitcoin, and "a bitcoin" is just as real as "a satoshi". Just because a satoshi is a decimal and a bitcoin is a whole number, doesn't mean anything."
Really? This is your actual argument? This is akin to saying the pixels on my computer screen and the data represented on them aren't real. Sure this is physically true, I guess, but it doesn't really matter all that much. Truthfully you could argue that "there is no such thing as the internet", and yet here we are, talking through the black magic of computers probably miles and miles away from eachother. So just saying "truthfully a bitcoin doesn't exist" is completely irrelevant and a very moot point. Physically it doesn't exist sure, but in every other capacity it absolutely does. It exists equally as much as the text you're reading on your screen on reddit, which is good enough because we're able to conversate through those means. Just like people are able to purchase, and send money through BTC even though you're saying it "doesn't exist". 
Your representation of $100 dollar bills as a comparison isn't quite comparable. If the $100 dollar bill was divisible and equivalently valuable, i.e. 1/2 of a $100 dollar bill was worth $50, then that would be a more fair comparison, where you could cut up a $100 dollar bill and still spend the resulting money. The only reason it isn't like this is because that's just a built in limitation of fiat currencies. One of the major points of bitcoin is that it IS divisible, as much as we pretty much like to, restricted only by the technological characteristics. If you were bartering with a chocolate bar, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't cut the chocolate bar in half and now say the chocolate bar halves are worthless. No, they are just worth half of what they were before, each, but still valuable. That's one major likable characteristic of bitcoin. That I can divide it up and use it in smaller parts, where you can't do that with fiat currencies. I'm frankly not really sure what you're saying here.

I mean, the drop isn't always concretely 90%. It has varied between 80 to 90. Usually 85 as an average as far as I know. It bottomed so far at $3100 and that's 84.5% drop from $20K.
The ATH's from each rally also haven't been 20x every time. They have been between 5-20. You should really do your research a bit more my friend.
So assuming a worst case scenario, if the cycle truly repeats itself, the next ATH will be at a minimum of $100K.
I don't think it will hit $400k. I hope so obviously but I see $200-$250k as much more reasonable.

You're actually wrong. At least in my country, it's 100% illegal to have sexual relations IN PUBLIC. If you're talking about nude sex, at least. Obviously kissing is different. 
That's the real reason people don't do it. 
There are plenty of people in other countries having sex in "public", where it is legal. 
Most people don't have sex in public because it's an intimate thing and isn't meant to be done in public.

"There’s some danger in this since its not good thing for people to become desensitized to security risks, but overall I think its a net benefit that people aren’t being quite so reactive to what amounts to obnoxious propaganda tactics."
I actually disagree somewhat. At least people that see these headlines and do proper research are seeing the risks of storing coins on an exchange, and possibly buying hardware wallets. News like this surely is good for companies like ledger and trezor. The fact that the price rebounded pretty quickly might even suggest most investors at this point are being much more careful about their coins. of course it also could mean that they are just applying the "it won't happen to me" logic.
All in all I think at the very least we should commend binance for immediately going to cover lost funds. That being said I won't use them as I already have kraken and coinbase accs but, for those using binance, at least that is a good sign

80% of all money is owned by 20% of all people, and this is not unfair, it's actually a law in nature that occurs repeatedly, and bitcoin will not change that. it's called the pareto principle and has been seen in numerous different fields, including economics but even farther out then that.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:50:05
Why? Because you have to value it against something. Sure, the USD dollar has lost 90% of it's value since 1940. But in the short term, it's not losing much of it's value and the greenback is a valid comparison. Long term, that comparison won't mean as much. But when you're comparing the value of USD today to the value of USD yesterday, there isn't much of a change.
Ideally, you could go around comparing bitcoin to prices of basic goods. But everyone has differently priced goods where they are relative to everyone else. That, and also the price of goods changes with inflation as well.
The most ideal method for comparison would be against a consumer index of sorts, but even still nobody can make that mathematical comparison in their head easily. The USD comparison is just the most convenient.
I personally could give a fuck what the price of BTC is. If my BTC gives me a larger purchase power capability in the future, then I know it's increased in value. I can make that call myself.

Still not really worth risking. Sure you may save 15-20% and sure you may have saved that much thus far but that doesn't change the fact that you very well could buy another one and lose all of whatever you paid if it gets canceled.

Honestly a DCA every single day is best if you can motivate yourself to do it. It's probably unrealistic for a lot of people. But if you want the absolute lowest risk you can get, DCA'ing every day is best.
For u/dempski if you wanted to buy $50 every two weeks, basically just buy $4 of it every single day at the same time and you'll have the most average price for that two weeks that you can get.

Low fees are the benefits of centralized shitcoins, sure. But lack of centralization definitely makes fees of 8x more worth it for BTC, in my opinion.
The whole point of BTC is to eliminate the middleman as well as to eliminate inflation. You don't eliminate the middleman with XMR. The middleman does exactly the same as central banks. In fact while they claim there is a cap to ripple, there really isn't. They can print them endlessly. They will do just that and mass sell them when the price increases to what they deem favorable. And nothing stops them from doing so.
I can only imagine how heavily ripple's price rides on speculation, even harder than BTC's.

What stocks exactly are you referencing that have logged exactly 10% per year, that aren't specifically picked individual stocks? I'm not seeing any. Dow jones went from $10k in 2004 to $25k in 2019. That's 15 years, that's not 400% gains. Fair enough, the nasdaq went from $2k in 2004 to $7700 now. A lot of people are saying the nasdaq is currently way overbought though. The stock market will crash soon and when it does, it's a crash that will last years. BTC crashes can last years but usually last less than a year. And give better buy opportunities.
Why are you lurking on when you clearly don't like it that much? You're wasting your time trying to argue how terrible bitcoin is to people that literally go on a subreddit made specifically for it.
You also assume that I'm only in BTC for the money. I like the tech, I like the idea of spending my money on what I want to, rather than what the fraudulent banksters tell me I can spend it on. Rather than it taking days of time to transfer money, like it did for my dad recently when he helped me out with a few grand. It took well over a week for the money to move through paypal and then get approved for transfer at the bank. OVER A WEEK.

And you'd be correct, obviously. But that's a testament to human stupidity, not on bitcoin being easier to steal than gold. In fact, if a hacker/thief knew I had a bitcoin cold wallet and a gold bar in my house, they would have an easier time successfully stealing the gold bar then they would the bitcoins. (at least as long as I don't have the keys written down somewhere.)
So basically, every and all bitcoin thefts are a result of people storing their keys online (whether it's an exchange or not) or being stupid about their wallets/wallet word phrases.

The new ones are at most $59 (on amazon or directly from ledger itself) and spending an extra $24 to make 100% sure that nobody (except Ledger itself) could tamper with it is well worth the money, especially if you are investing a lot. If you buy from amazon I would make sure it hasn't been tampered with, but there's still going to be a bit of trust there.

BTC at worst is an educated gamble. At best it's the opportunity of a life time. Sure, I may lose $5-$10k. But if I'm right, and if BTC goes to $1m a coin, then I'll make hundreds of thousands. 
Yeah, you're right though, it's not guaranteed. I never said it was. And even if your VTSAX is guaranteed +7% a year, that +7% a year won't even begin to compete with BTC if we're all correct. So again, while you make +7% a year, in 10 years I could be up +10000%. Or even more than that. While you sit on the sidelines making at best +300%-500% or so. And yes, you're right that your gains are much more solid and guaranteed. But that doesn't change the fact that IF I am right on this gamble, I will come out much farther ahead. I don't plan to invest an insane amount of money into it like a lot of people on here. But I do have a solid amount in it, and will be adding more. I'll also be adding more to this VTSAX you mention, because having a portfolio well diversified in risk and non-risk is important.
Who the fuck wants to deal in fiat where there's restrictions to spending? To who, what, where, when, why, and how I can spend my money? Where the middlemen central bankers that literally print fiat money (and Fed. Reserve) and create "money" out of thin air? That create inflation at an unprecedented rate and with it, debt? 
In the long future, maybe up to 50-100 years from now, I believe stocks will be purchased with bitcoin. And your VTSAX will be priced in bitcoin. And it may not be bitcoin, but it won't be us dollars, it won't be fiat currencies. It will be mathematically rigid currencies with provably lower rates of inflation that have a fixed monetary supply. Bitcoin could be the facebook, or it could be the napster of music. There may come a bigger and better king cryptocurrency, nobody can say for sure. Either way, something like bitcoin will inevitably replace us dollars. The big bankers are absolutely scared of this, because nothing will stop it.
That being said, of course Warren Buffett isn't. He's 88 years old, he's a multi-billionaire. He doesn't give a single damn about it, he's already rich and already going to die soon. It is his sole beneficiaries who should keep their eyes open to BTC. 
I care a lot more about BTC disrupting fiat and ending corruption tend to money printability and greed than I do about returns. That being said, making +90-110% purchasing power on the money that I have put in thus far has been exciting. Something that would never happen on stocks unless I went hard on call options or put options, which are arguably even more gambly than bitcoin currently is.
That being said, I appreciate the long winded response. I will definitely put any long term savings money into VTSAX or another market-wide mutual fund. But I'll still keep putting little amounts into bitcoin by DCA :) I just thoroughly believe in the tech behind it.

Yes, I'm not a fan of stopping money laundering because the vast majority of normal people aren't money laundering and these garbage practices do little to stop them and only hinder normal peoples daily lives. Don't cherrypick and state that "You are upset they try to stop money laundering...", it's deeper than that. I'm all for stopping money laundering, except when these practices are an invasion of privacy and really annoying. There's a certain price that must be paid for freedom, as well as maximal security. Guess what the price you must pay for maximal security is? Annoying invasions of privacy. A society that is 100% safe is a very monotonous society and not one that I want to live in. You can, if you want, but I'd rather sacrifice a small bout of safety to live a life where I'm not constantly required to prove my identity to people that shouldn't know that anyway.
How are governments evil? Are you actually serious with that question?
1) Doing anything that their donors want them to do for any amount of money they are given. Most politicians are completely bought. This isn't to say that companies aren't also at fault for buying politicians, but when there are endless loop holes and shit to get around the illegality of it, that's also a big part of government corruption too.
2) Pretending to have the best interest of citizens at heart when all they really fundamentally care about is their money. 
3) The US government for one actually has attacked citizens and planned to attack citizens specifically to incite war against middle eastern countries to gain oil. One of the major planned attacks that was luckily shut down by one of the better presidents we've had:   But the fact that they were even deciding to do this shows you how little they actually truly give a fuck about their populace.
4) Federal reserve having control over the money supply is relatively obvious...They can do whatever they choose essentially to artifically inflate, deflate, or stagnate the economy at will. Economic growth in a lot of ways is completely faked in this way.
5) Government bailouts, particularly in 2008 to corrupt companies that were knowingly issuing garbage mortgage loans because THEY would make money. Instead of bailing out the millions of people that got absolutely fucked by this recession they bailed out the "too big to fail" companies. Really?

You're proving exactly what I said. The demand surrounding bitcoin has nothing to do with it's limited supply, excluding the idea of it being a deflationary currency. It has to do with the mathematical prevention of double spending, and the ability to send money without a middleman. For some people, the volatility (traders, investors), for others the ability to store value (for example socialist countries like Venezuela, as some people may not have access to stable fiat such as USD, but most have access to internet/electricity), for some people the technology, etc.

Lmfao you're delusional. Fiat has in this moment value. It even has 5 years from now value. It also can be re-invested into safer options, like stocks.
NO BODY knows if bitcoin will hit a new ATH again, or even pass 20k again for that matter. History doesn't always repeat. 
All that being said, only invest what you're willing to lose. If you're going to bet everything on it skyrocketing, then by all means. But, if it does happen to go to 0, or go below what you bought at, don't be pissed off since you made that choice.

I've seen it happening on coinbase pro; where 6+ orders of a small amount of BTC, say .001 or something, get sold and immediately bought back again at virtually the exact same price. Of course, since coinbase is trading on it's own platform, it pays fees to itself. So there's no cost to doing this.

With coinbase pro you have to link a bank account and have money deposited through a transfer that way. Which often will take a week or more of time to transfer. 
If you want to use coinbase pro, google "gdax" and then go on the website and go through a signing up process. 
You really should do that. If you've been buying through regular coinbase sparsely you're just getting wrecked with fees. Regular coinbase uses flat fees as far as I remember. The only real reason for that is because on coinbase you can buy instantly with cards whereas on coinbase pro you have to use a linked bank account and wait 7+ days for a money transfer.
To put it into perspective for you, I was paying around $0.30 for a $100 purchase. If you're honestly telling me regular coinbase is $7.50 for $100, that's fucking insane and there's no way in hell I would ever do that. Regular coinbase is a massive scam. They also charge you an international fee if you're in the US and using a card.

"I guess because he was generalizing "all liberals" and couldn't specifically communicate what the logical inconsistency is  . . ."
"Yes, conservatives are trying to selectively strip the rights of gay citizens"
Pick one. You're literally getting butthurt that he generalized all liberals while actively generalizing all conservatives yourself. Please, stop virtue signalling and acting like conservatives are demons. Conservatives are merely saying that someone who is deeply religious has the right, in their own PRIVATE business, to turn away service to anyone they decide to. Conservatives aren't going after specifically minorities, its just that the specific case that keeps being brought up is the baker one. You do not get to refuse service to republicans while actively saying that I don't have a right to refuse service to who I want to refuse service to.

Well then if you are arguing that there should be restrictions, you shouldn't also be fine with the circumstances given that there aren't currently any. You don't get to say that restrictions should be there and also say that \*because there currently arent restrictions they should be able to do what they want\*. If you truly wanted restrictions, and truly believed that's what should happen, then you should also agree that this banning of milo is a bad thing.

I already corrected myself. Even if it's not tied DIRECTLY to the profit, it's a hell of a lot less speculative than bitcoin. Whether you want to believe that or not, it's the truth.

Most people don't have sufficient assets for an ISP or even trezor/ledger nano s to want to hack them. Verizon as an ISP makes hundreds of millions a year, do you really believe they would hack me for a few hundred to a few thousand $ of BTC? Im sure ledger nano and trezor probably make at least a few hundred grand a year, probably more then that, it would be insane to think they hack somebody for a miniscule fraction of that.
Now,  Never heard of such an exchange, I don't know how it operates. I don't know nearly enough about it to want to use it. I also wouldn't even consider using it unless I had heard about it from a lot of people and had good reviews from pretty much all of them. So nah, I'm good.

Very few not necessarily because people are dumb but because tax laws are intentionally complex. Many people have been arguing for simpler tax laws for decades now. More recently this has been lobbied against by companies like turbotax, taxact, HR block, etc. 
Even when I went to do it manually because of crypto it was still a bitch, the instructions the IRS gives you are misleading and not at all clear.
That being said, I don't think the adoption phase of bitcoin is targetting your grandma...but thank you for cherrypicking the most obvious example of sombody not wanting to use trezor, lol. That being said, with sufficient instructions, the entire process absolutely could be done by a grandmother.

I mean, you can say that but I have plenty of liberal friends who were super happy about alex jones banning (I actually don't give a fuck about alex jones or his stupid ass opinions, but his banning was pretty silly), while also up in arms if I said a religious baker should be able to refuse service to gay people, or ANYONE for that matter (republicans included).

Again, you like talking about the right wing terrorism but ignore the repeated rapings and murderings that occur from illegal immigrants that you cry so badly to let into the country.
I despise all the right wing terrorism. I'll agree that it's fucked up. Any sane republican will. Sure, there are some that are extremely far right and terrible fucking people that might be happy about it. But, I'm not, and none of my republican friends are. So stop fucking saying that I support this shit, or that the majority of republicans do. Because they fucking don't. At least I recognize that these are wildcard actors. You're ignoring that fact for your narrative, though. If even a small percentage of right wing/republican/conservative people acted in these terroristic ways that you believe they already do, there would be a LOT more damage. A LOT more cases of terrorism. But there aren't.
But please, keep crying about the few cases of right wing terrorism while actively trying to say that all cops are bad, and that all illegal immigrants are good. You lefties do a fantastic job of applying the "all bad apples" where it's convenient for you, and ignoring it where it's convenient. Hilarious stuff, really.
Is there right wing terrorism? Absolutely. Is it directly caused by speech from people like Milo, Ben Shapiro? I don't believe so. Some mental ill people, sure. But that's a hell of a lot different then the average person.
Do you also believe that teenagers that play grand theft auto are going to be motivated to go kill people, steal cars and rape prostitutes? You're insane.

Meh, it's not literally no one. Most of the successful people on wall street cheer when certain stocks drop and rally behind those falls being buying opportunities. For example when apple declined in December last year and the price dropped down to 140, everyone was freaking out and meanwhile wallstreet was saying that buying apple at that point was a good opportunity. They were correct, apple climbed slowly back to 200 over a little under half a year which is almost 35% gains. Obviously this pales in comparison to crypto but the basic idea that they were happy that it was dropping is the same.
Your logic is interesting because you claim that if everyone sold when the price dropped below $6k that it would go all the way to $100. Well clearly there are some people in stocks that also HODL, because there have been massive drops for certain stocks that didn't go basically all the way to 0. Look at BLNK stock, for example, which dropped from $7.08 to $3 from June 1 to July 31. That's an equivalent drop you're stating here from $7000 to $3000, and yet the price didn't go to $.10 for BLNK because some people held. 
I think it's a bit disingenuous to state that nobody in stocks HODLs when their asset is depreciating. There definitely are people that do, and there are definitely people in stocks that are buying dips also. Otherwise every major slight drop in a stock would catapult it to 0.

Arguing for regulations against corporations, preventing them from doing whatever they want, yet also arguing that they should be able to ban whoever they want, is inconsistent logic.
You guys sure love to force the baker to make a wedding cake for a gay wedding, but all of a sudden you're also allowed to ban conservative speakers or whoever else you may deem fit? How is that logically consistent?
And really? Are you really suggesting that I don't think the synagogue shootings were cruel and terrible? Most conservatives agree they are, I'm not sure what opinions you think we have, lol.

My problem mainly is that a lot of people have serious addictions to it, and a place where you can gamble money that isn't traceable is even more dangerous than others. At least in so far because it allows somebody to access this website completely unopposed by anything that might normally stop them from gambling, such as distance to casino, lack of ability to withdraw large funds by banks (this is one of the few cases where bank delay on withdraw would benefit somebody.), etc.

How is that pathetic? If Tom Brady consistently keeps missing field goal kicks, not getting tackles, not pushing the ball down the field, missing throws, etc (I really don't know much about football. I'm not really a fan) then I think the fat guy with nachos is perfectly within his right to say Brady is sucking that game.
It's such a ridiculous cop out to just be like "yeah you can't criticize them because you can't do better". Well no shit, nobody on this earth can do everything perfectly or even close to perfectly. That being said, I recognize, for example, that a lowly IM (international master; a chess term) is worse than Magnus Carlsen (world chess champion) despite the fact that I'm not as good as an IM myself.
Also, if you're going to say that I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance (hello lmfao) then I am perfectly within my right to call you insane. That is all. :)

The quran literally calls for direct violence against people. Milo hasn't done such things. If you can bring up evidence, then I'll change my mind. But I can give you literal verses of the quran that can't possibly be percevied to not be violent. Examples:
Telling them to kill anyone that they believe has persecuted them, because apparently killing somebody is more acceptable than not liking their opinions?
"And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter... and fight them until fitnah is no more, and religion is for Allah"
"And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world; and in the Hereafter, theirs shall be the torment of the Fire"
Kill those that aren't muslim:
"Then when the sacred months \[after the [Hajj]( have passed, kill these Idolaters wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent and establish the prayer, and give Zakah, then leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
I'll wait for examples where Milo directly called for violence against people. And please, bring up examples that aren't clearly jokes. Milo is a provocateur and it wouldn't be surprising to me if he had said such things intentionally to provoke people, not for actually calling real violence.

I mean thats your call man. People constantly ask for "is it a good time to buy?" and nobody ever actually truly knows the answer to this question. 
Your best bet is to buy slowly and steadily so that the average price you bought at evens out and you reduce risk. Timing the market is hard and often can leave you burned. That being said you can also profit big if you do it right.
If you spend all your time thinking "if i had bought more before i would have $x more" you will almost definitely not buy the next time it dips, so stop focusing on that and be ready to buy when it dips. don't be a pussy and get scared when it drops a little.
In all fairness, everyone was screaming overbought at 6k and then 7k. and now we're 15% the way from 8k to 9k.

No financial instrument has costed that much. But that doesn't mean there isn't a possibility one can't cost that much in the future. 
Ripple is a centralized shitcoin, literally not mined whatsoever. Pre-made by the company that runs ripple and sold in small distributions. And they choose when to do this. Do you really believe they won't just sell every bit of ripple that they have when it hits like $5?
Do yourself a favor and do some research. If you're into the main ideas behind bitcoin you should not be backing ripple.

He can't supply the reason he sees no value in it though. He often says I dont like investment because of such and such reasons. But when asked about bitcoin he doesn't give such reasons. 
He is an old luddite fool that doesn't understand what bitcoin is or what it could become. He's repeatedly dodged questions about why he doesn't like bitcoin.
