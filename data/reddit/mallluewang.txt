Still afraid to open the modlogs. Have the guts to call people coward apparently you're the one who is afraid. Anyway, thanks lemme note everything you said here.

Okay so I tried to read the whole thing, you have a fair amount of good arguments, however, it doesn't change the fact that you guys don't want to be call out whenever something wrong if the modlog is open, I mean why won't you let your community see it? If you think it will be something good in the future, why dont you make that future now? It will not affect your moderation negatively actually you will prove to them that you people are moderating fairly, if you're really doing it fair, and please stop this "we want to talk about only bitcoin in this subreddit" dude bitcoin is open-source for a reason. The main point of this argument is *why don't you open the modlog and let the community see it*, TRANSPARENCY in short

this is one of the flaw, why no mods for this debate, still so philosophical and somewhat out turned the supposed to be topic

Uhhh.... You see, aside on the first and second paragraph, the rest are irrelevant to me, (to me only, I don't care about this r/bitcoin and r/btc mods mud fight). I was only asking why the mod log is private simple, but I don't think the reasoning are clear in fact some of it are   uhhh how do I say this, Yes, "Bullshit". The possible reason why you don't want to disclosed the modlogs is because you wanted to protect some personalities to their wrong doing, aka, censorship, because if you open that modlog, some people will dig on the past right? some shitty history that you hide for so long will come out and will begin to become a "drama" right? Its like mining a good information against "these people" about their wrong doing and stuffed. It's really simple to admit that you guys wanted to protect someone lol. But yeah I like the way you play ;)

so why the r/bitcoin modlog is not on public then? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:03:39
really, hmm, have you tried coinex or binance?
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:27:08
You guys are afraid to be criticized of what you're are doing, you are not answering the question, you're avoiding it. Coz if you really wanted to prove all your point and you guys will open it to let them stfu. Btw way you should also acknowledged the bitcoin is open source, seems like you misquoted it. :) 
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:12:04
that's a supposed to be a civilize date and yet we have a fallacious comment like this, \*clap clap\*
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:23:22
So asking a legit question is a troll?
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:00:15
If bitcoin (btc) increases block size limit, will it still be compatible to LN?
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:58:39
Nah, I just wanted you to explain the link, to long to read when you're on mobile so don't blame me, anyway since you said that you made a cross-analysis for both subreddits then why dont you open the modlogs for u/memorydealers and fam to make a cross-analysing to your subreddit also? hmm?
@_date: 2018-09-11 09:40:47


ad hominem
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:42:27
Uhh so you're admitting that the reason you guys don't want to disclose the modlog is because you people are protecting personalities? and to avoid digging some crucial information from the past?
P.S, I called it bullshit because you analyzed their modlogs but you don't want to analyzed yours ^^_~
