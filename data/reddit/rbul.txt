Thanks for keeping us updated. Your service is great, for sure you will clean the mess up! The most serious issue to me sounds the German government involment! It would be desirable if at least you will manage to payout BTC as soon as possible so that at least these are secure and they won't be able to confiscate them or charge you for their fiat equivalent.

Simon advertised to publish up a form today for withdrawing these amounts together with BTC, but he didn't.

ACK. I only hope he manages to do the roll back before the German authority detains him or confiscates hard disks (private keys) because of the other issue about money laundering, which obviously is not Simon's fault, but which may delay the interest of the users to get their money. I think it's a question of fate now which event takes place first...

Thinking about it, it sounds astonishing to me that a German entity is able to freeze money on a Polish bank account of a British company with international customers. The suspicion is money laundering, which certainly applies to less than 5% of the amounts held on the account, while all the other amounts are property of normal users, many of them *foreigners* with no relation to Germany at all.
I just cannot believe that this is rightful. The action should be questioned with all diligence!
Also, a petition to the responsible German authority might be effective. Probably they just don't know that they froze 95% money of legimitate private small investors. Actually, the German state's task should be to *protect* private persons.

most part of the discussion has moved to btc24-help.com, but no, there are no news except of the fact that simon is still alive, still in germany and repeating the same again and again ("funds are save")
