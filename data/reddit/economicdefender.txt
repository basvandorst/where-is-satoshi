I've linked to a general website, but can confirm that a recruiter for financial firms has emailed about this job opening.

Perhaps this is what you mean, but particularly the log scale charts show the growth as less volatile. Banking people will get that when things grow by percentages, log scales can be useful.

Just throwing this out there. You studied finance, invest on your own, and "love research". And it seems like you are going to do good work for these people. Would you be interested in working for them? They found you interesting as well as what you know, otherwise they would have just gone back to their office to read more about it on the internet. If you feel bored of being a bartender and the "other things", I would suggest considering not asking for payment, and instead saying you would love to come back again and tell them more, or learn about what sort of other opportunities they might have at their firm. The altcoins and various apps are one hook you could mention at the end to show there is still a lot you haven't told them. They also don't mind having lunch with you which means they would consider introducing you to other people. I get that people think bankers are rich and greedy, but they might have other value to give you that I wouldn't risk right away by asking for some small amount of money, if you're interested in the relationships in the first place. Have fun and good luck.
