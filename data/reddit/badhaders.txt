Ah, Coinbase looks quite good actually! I'll have to check this out, thanks!

One does not simply analyse the value of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin only has 2 states in its value, at the moon, and not at the moon.

Is this not old news already?

This is great! Been looking for some hosting for a while, I'll look through your site and probably purchase some hosting :)
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:23:05
Great, really nice website btw :)

Planning on keeping it in Bitcoin for a while, then splitting into 0.01 lots and selling for 170% of market value on eBay, making about 140% of their worth after fees, which I'll then use to reinvest into Bitcoin. Should work out quite nicely :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:56:50
Oh look, price is rising again.

For anyone that's trying it out: it appears that the hi/low game is massively pointed towards low, could just be a luck spree though.

Wait for it to go up... like it always does...  
You should never have taken such a stupid investment in the first place.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:50:46
A huge return if they wait. If they start panic selling they're not going to get a return. Its only their fault.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:05:29
Yep, exactly what to do.  
The best advice I could give you is to ONLY cash out if you absolutely need the money. Bitcoin is going mainstream, there's going to be a higher demand for the coin, and because of the limited amount it can only rise in value. Just wait, you'll get your return.  
My friend bought in the day before the crash early this year, at 120$ per coin, it dropped to 60$ per coin, and within a few months he was up to 250$ per coin and sold them on to me. I luckily bought the day before the massive price surge, and they quadrupled in a week.

And? Those people crashed the price for us, so we can invest even more then sit on it when the price goes back up again. Regardless of what people say, you shouldn't invest in anything even if they promise a return, if you know nothing about economics.

The price is only falling because those bandwagoners who don't understand the currency at ALL are panic selling, causing a chain reaction. It will recover and continue to rise above 800 USD very soon.

This is what the result of that US hearing looks like I believe.  
I'm not genius with this, but I think the verdict was that there are more positive benefits than negative (yes, I just watched the whole thing).
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:34:47
Hmm, possibly. I just hit .00001200 by spamming the low button on a bet of 0.00000064 and winning 70% of the time.. then lost it all. Hay ho.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:28:25
Ah this is awesome! There's a seller with his own shop set up in my city centre, I can catch a bus in and buy coins from him, perfect :)
Thanks a lot man.

Not gonna happen, iirc eBay owns PayPal (or vice-versa) and the hefty fees on both PayPal and eBay allow the eBay bigwigs to make up to 20% on a sale. The fees are getting way out of hand, they're continuing to rise.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:03:30
Seems pretty decent. Signed up under your referal.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:13:49
That's an interesting way to look at it. If you can afford to experiment with Bitcoin that's a great thing to do. Good luck.

Not quite sure how a bank transfer works, not really used my account too much. I generally use PayPal for all cash flow.
Do I essentially point money to somebody's account number via my online banking?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:05:23
If I recall correctly its a combination of the Chinese suddenly joining the gold rush, and the US labeling it as "legitimate" just ahead of their conference/thing to discuss it further.  
Don't bet your house on it, but I believe that's what's going on.

Well technically speaking the first global currency would have been gold, or even something like wheat. Currency is a tangible word.
