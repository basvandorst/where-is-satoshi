$1.00 =$1.00
Investing in BTC or crypto in general is a smart move but taking profits in USD is smarter end game. Other you don’t actually make “money” 
USD controls the world.

True. In any healthy economic growth pattern people earn more money. People build bigger and better versions or create something. We entirely. Costs will change. They increase. Nothing stays the same. Change is required.

This fake argument has never made any sense let alone been true in the sense that $1.00 = .05 - It's simply bullshit. 
If something I want is $10 and I have ten $1,00 bills then I can buy (taxes as well of course) - That has never changed. This will never change. 
This is not a reason to buy bitcoin. The \*ONLY\* reason to buy Bitcoin is to make / profit and sell it for USD. 
USD is fucking king and will remain so. Slapdicks.

means absolutely. noting Australia doesn't bear any weight on earth. 
If it doesn't happen in the United States then it doesn't matter.  nothing will change because of this. crypto not go up or down because of it. this is the same vapor news click bait that people thrive on and end up empty.

It’s just CashApp.

This won’t happen for at least 30 years or more. The rich in America control everything. It’ll take physical force to , mutiny to make this happen. 
With this current generation of weak liberal vegan soy boys we’re not any closer until being gay is no longer the cool thing to do. 
It will take men, guns and force.

They will. Samsungs wallet is a hot wallet. Android kids are notorious for hacking, flashing ROMs. XDA developers are going to have a HAY DAY with this phone.
I's only a matter of time before some poor moron loses EVERYTHING. Samsung will be responsible in the public opinion and BTC will unfortunately suffer because of "theft or loss by moron"

It’s just bitcoin dude that’s it
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:28:18
Crypto to Crypto the IRS can try to touch. They only deal in USD. I’ll nuke them if they try.

It asks the name of your employer. Who the fuck they think they are? Tell them to go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:15:48
Can someone explain how this works? Why does "time" move faster or slower on a different planet?
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:18:23
We’re not people accumulate bitcoin it’s that simple.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:13:51
This isn’t a dip. But ok ... February was the dip. $3200.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:01:52
Can’t do shit with it you ain’t rich but if you cash out to USD then it means something you can spend that anywhere people want it it has value
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:13:08
They are keeping THEIR money safe
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:11:30
This isn’t game of thrones. You’re not jailed for debt. Lmao.. think it’s 1578?
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:27:07
No. USD is king and the only thing that gives BTC value. It’s why and what people cash out for. It’s endgame.

Weak little kid. Knows nothing pretends to be something.  Lock your doors baby girl.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:26:48
Ledger Nano or Trezor are the only two viable tested options.
But yes always a cold wallet
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:54:56
Because amazon doesn’t take bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:42:58
Because US dollar is king and that’s the only reason to buy bitcoin is to make more US dollars don’t play dumb there’s no other reason to get into it
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:04:33
Oh well then whatever currency you use there lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:46:47
That works too but it’s lesser known.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:59:53
Coinbase is your best bet if you don’t know how.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:23:14
LOL you dumb cunt. You’re not as smart as you think baby girl. 
Be careful. I suggest you stand down before you regret it. 
Lol.. basement jokes. So weak and old.

Fuck XRP and the cult that follows that 30 cent shitcoin. It’s had 7 yrs. it’s not going anyway. Grow up
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:14:38
You just ignore them. They didn’t earn any of my money. It’s not there’s to take. Especially in crypto form.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:59:45
They will try.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:08:45
Blockchain cannot be turned off. It’s immutable.
Can always ask North Korea to attack us with an EMP.
