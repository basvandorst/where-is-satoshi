Manipulation indeed. When you know the impact of your words on the market it is really easy to make a lot of money. Its a crime though. Like foreknowledge!

How about retail client services? Focus on the big ones and neglect those who made YOU big. Guess that's what's going to happen. Those BTC signs in the eyes.....

So now they have BTC signs in their eyes
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:12:34
Their only way to make some money perhaps
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:06:37
I am not a "nae-sayer". I invest in crypto and just think there is a lot of work to be done in this field. But I do believe in it. Just don't like the moon and lambo types.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:05:16
Sounds good, like give 0,5 BTC and get 5 in return:))

@_date: 2018-06-15 20:36:35
Don't give a shit. Sometimes too much money make people dumb in the end. I know a lot of rich people I would not consider an example. Are you suggesting that rich people can't say/do stupid things? So the more $$$$ you have the more you are able to predict anything in this world? That's a good reason to listen to old Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and follow their advice. Get out of crypto's now!
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:50:36
He Satoshi, where are you when the world really needs you bro
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:33:10
Then they should have bought years ago. That would have been smart
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:07:38
Lambo is so unpractical. Just like bitcoin.

Ask yourself, if he really believes his own 'prediction', why broadcasting it and don't just lay back and get richer? Maybe he is trying to have some influence on ignorant people like you and others. In other words, trying to manipulate. My prediction is that the markets will keep going up and diwn for as long they exist. I don't need to be a billionaire to be right about that

@_date: 2018-06-12 21:34:43
I have heard too many "predictions". Predicting has no added value. It's dumb and misleading. He should know better. Be a role model and focus on the possibilities of the technology and stop throwing with price "predictions". Anyonone could take a shot at where it will be in 2020 or 2027.

On the long term we all (except the day traders) know that hodlers are better off than day traders. I'd rather be a sheep in the herd without the stress of looking at my screen all day than spending all day thinking what's the best moment to buy or sell. You can beat the markets sometimes,  
but don't get too self confident about that. 
By the way, how about putting your money in something you really believe in.

@_date: 2018-07-04 14:56:53
So then it goes up to 20, 30, 40, 50. 100k. What are you going to do? Back to fiat and buy a Lambo? The Lambo dealer probably ain't going to accept any crypto. And then you have this Lambo and no BTC left. That's it? That's cool. There goes the ex-crypto investor in his brand new Lambo. Look how happy he is����. The thing is when you get to the point that you can afford a Lambo, you'll be left with no BTC if you buy the fucking Lambo. If you don't buy the Lambo at that point, BTC might go down again and there goes your Lambo. What's next? Buying a scooter
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:03:41
Your word choice tells a lot. You must be very frustrated about something here. What's your reason to say this? Are you enjoying your wealth as a sub $1 btc investor yourself? Then why spending time posting this crap. Go do something useful in your life smartass
