so is that what people are doing.  Day trading with the trends.  buy at 77 and hope it gets to 115 to sell?  rinse and repeat?
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:39:05
thanks.  There are no naysayers here..remarkable, because the rest of the world is such downers.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:58:55
can we still go lower.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:52
wtf do  people troll this shit. \
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:27:27
thanks for your warm welcome.  I have a bit of ocd and have been reading the forums pretty incessantly.  I hate noobs trying to move in on a scene they are just trying to hear about.  I have a hard time conceptualizing people making stupid cash.  Like are there proven millionaires out there?  It is difficult to have your eyes attached to the computer 24/7.  These news agencies reporting on bc are really digging their heels in.  I guess I was reluctant before because of all of the things mentioned against it.  
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:40:16
 no difference: where the transaction takes place.
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:40:11
any thoughts on how an older guy can recall login information?  what do you guys do? keep it in a binder.  God I wish I was 19.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:02:54
how much?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:49:16
that dude is funny looking.  must like men.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:16:57
It will fall.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:30:13
dont say it if you dont mean it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:06:03
That sucks.  What is going to happen, though?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:44:27
How much is it at?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:32:34
Of course it seems like hype.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:50:01
thank you.  Great post.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:31:02
what do you mean.  trades are free.  so where does that leave a buyer?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:31:35
you guys who are being cautious seem to be winning out.  I was cautious at 40.  I was cautions at 140.  I could not believe what I heard.  It finally appeared in business section in paper in midwest.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:35:10
why intersting?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:18:24
you sound like you know nothing at all.  The price will fall.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:11:25
this is bad news.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:50:18
I do not understand your lingo.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:29:07
as an attorney, I'd say, in the country where the transaction was entered into--unless the exchanges state something different in their agreement.  Karma please?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:34:11
103 eh.  It is going to fall I think.  This is bipolar.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:52:20
wtf does that mean?  
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:02:34
no.  get a new idea.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:58:21
you can provide services or mine it.  You should be asking questions related to money though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:40:47
alot of negative stuff.  I think it is good to wait another day at least.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:43
I think you are right.  thanks for your post.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:25:31
this shit is crazy dudes...
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:13:31
nothing at all.  this post is all the money.  those with large holdings are crashing the market.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:01:28
why are you reposting same post.  the battle of 300 was bs anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:51:16
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:57:18
No, you need only concern yourself with your own transaction and with whom.  That will dictate transaction.  You may be able to sue them in your country's jurisdiction (do not rely on this though) if you can prove that they advertised in your jurisdiction.  For now though, I would rely on the info that you sue in the jurisdiction where the transaction was entered into...MT Goxx from what I understand is Japan.  PM if you ever have any other questions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:12
troll.  It is at 100.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:41:31
