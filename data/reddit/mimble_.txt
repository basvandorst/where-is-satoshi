Who leaked to the press? 
Can the CFTC demonstrate that they are not responsible?  And that no CFTC employee has an inside position in the market?.

A question - who or what maintains the routing tables for various hubs? Edit. Networking layer - if the channel is not direct between two peers, how does the transaction get routed.

Well the pressure on fees is alleviated by users going to other projects and loss of market share. So it's possible to appreciate the concern.

US regulator responsible for market surveillance discovered manipulating market sentiment, through selective press releases.

Won't the fee depend on how many utxos are included in the transfer? 
There is no-way to know if the fee is excessive without more information.

I wonder how many government insiders are trading the press-release.

Indirectly via creating compliance risk for US mainland banks. Tether was created after US banks began refusing transactions from Bitfinex's Taiwanese and HK banks.

That's not inflation and deflation. It's appreciation and depreciation.

Do you know what happens if a channel advertises ability to route a transaction, in a multi-hop tx - but then fails to do so? Does  that tie up the funds and for how long? 
This was the issue I saw, when playing with a cli client a few months ago. A client that lies or drops offline could cause a lot of issues.

Excellent. I intend to use this service, next time I travel.

I waste a lot of effort converting bitcoin/crypto to fiat/paypal in order to shop on ebay and amazon. I would really appreciate this service, and would substantially increase my spending.

How does Lightning handle the case of a node that lies about its abililty to route a transaction, or lies about having sufficient funds to route a specific transaction?

A question - will the accountant that files, accept the spread-sheet? Presumably - it can just be treated as a separate asset ledger similar to foreign currencies?

Good point about the shift from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation being intentional and dependent upon solvency. I had previously considered that it was contested behind the scenes, but that's probably not the case.
