Watch “Banking on Bitcoin” on Netflix. It’s already regulated in the US.

So if I send BTC from my Electrum wallet, it's going to tell me there is a fee for it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:35:46
Cool, this eases my mind about keeping it on the Coinbase wallet. I wanted to keep it in my wallet, but I guess coinbase is still technically my wallet. I'm the only one that can access it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:57:46
I guess at this point I'll just leave with Coinbase. I trust my bank with my real money...why not trust another one.
I don't see why they'd seize my money unless I was transferring to gambling websites. I don't intend on transferring any BTC out of my coinbase wallet, so I don't see why they'd take my BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:05:33
Ok, well...the only option is to skip for now. So, I don't see how it's not mandatory.

Thanks

Probably because the person is sending you the money and saying they are paying for a good or service. This allows them to dispute it later if they don't get what you're supposed to spend.
That's where I'm saying the honor system comes in. As long as you trust whoever you're sending or receiving from, you pay 0 fees because when they send it they need to choose the sending money to a friend option. I send and receive money on PayPal fairly often. Never once paid a fee. Ever.

What is this November fork you speak of?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:09:56
Only thing that concerned me was an article I just read, 
Regarding the collapse of Mt. Gox and how everyone lost their BTC. Was Mt. Gox not insured?

Help me understand one input, two output. I don't get that.
What are the outputs if I'm simply sending BTC from my Electrum wallet, to another user's wallet? Whether it be Electrum, Coinbase, etc. ANY BTC receiving address.

Asking price is a lot different than selling price.

Just signing up for a GDAX account and it looks like I'm supposed to own a business to do it? It's asking for my business name, and it's mandatory?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:42:32
Geez...yeah, $13 is the cheapest fee.
So, I don't quite get this. The fees are so high with BTC, how is it worth it? With only $100 investment, I've lost 20-30% of my investment before I even get the money to where I want it to go.
I understand it's not a good idea to keep your BTC on coinbase...but holy crap the fees are so ridiculous what makes it worth it to transfer it? I don't see how it's worth it for me to transfer it to my Electrum wallet if it's just going to cost me $13 to transfer it back out of Electrum one day.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:00:51
I legit just read this article... 
and almost decided to sell my BTC. Mainly because it said when Mt. Gox collapsed, everyone lost their BTC.
I can't imagine if I had a few thousand in there, and Coinbase failed, and I lost it all.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:22:00
Ok cool, so I'll transfer over the money before November 1. You mention keys.
Do I need to do anything other than transfer it to my Electrum wallet? Do I need to write down some key?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:43:07
ahhh, gotcha. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:27:30
How would I be charged anything? I send and receive money on paypal frequently with 0 fees.
I'm talking.....find someone online who has BTC...obviously there would have to be a bit of trust involved. I send that guy $ on Paypal...not for goods and services...just sending it to a friend. Then that guy sends me his BTC.
I don't see where I'd be charged anything.

I'd think if hackers collapsed one exchange, they could do it again.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:01:58
This is what I'm stuck on. I don't feel right unless I have a bitcoin, the whole thing. But when would I ever need to pay someone an entire bitcoin? I need to get that out of my mind and be ok with the "fractional shares" if you will.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:49:30
Ok, yeah I see where you can change the fee now. To get it picked up within 25 blocks and using dynamic fees is why it was $13.
If I changed it to manual fees, I can get it down to like $1 and some change fee.
Approximately how long do those things take to transfer with little to no fees? They still get done?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:44:05
ok, so then I avoid all those fees...but then once I want to send them from Electrum to somewhere else, it's $13 to do that. I just don't understand all the fees associated with BTC and how it's worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:40:08
It looks like Electrum has a fee slider, and the lowest fee you can get is .003. which is $13 right now.
So, not only do I pay a fee to buy, I pay a fee to send it to my wallet...then another fee to send it somewhere else.
By the time you get done sending it where you want it to go, you've lost a solid 30% of what you just bought. (At $100 investment anyway)
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:12:15
So it's like a stock split. So if that BTC is transferred to your wallet, and then you transfer it back after the split, is it now worth more? Or worth something different?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:25:47
Soooooo....I toyed around with BTC several years ago...never actually got any mined myself, and never bought any because...well...I thought it was a fad, or I was too late to the game, now with this....I DEFINITELY feel like it's too late to the game.
What do we realistically see this doing? I feel like $4k is insane and it won't stay that high...but then again I just don't know enough about it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:42:37
Not familiar with 4chan. Just asking a question about something a friend told me about. He's selling because he thinks there might be something to it. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:46:16
Well, I get hold....but WHY is everyone saying hodl?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:21:40
What is all this hodl stuff?
