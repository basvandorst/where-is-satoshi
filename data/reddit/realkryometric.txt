I kind of want to buy something on Amazon while it's on sale, but I get my credit card some time this week. So I will pay with bitcoin on purse.io or something

Good on you OP. I wish I could help, perhaps I'll do the same.

 Do the people who mine or confirm the block get the fees? How does this work?

What about the sites that force you to turn off adblocker? Will there be any effect?

Here are some horror stories: 
But seriously, CoinBase is horrible. The support is bad, really bad. People post on reddit about their problems and then what do you know, support actually answers.

I'm waiting on the bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:37:46

@_date: 2016-07-09 00:48:19
Cool, thanks!
