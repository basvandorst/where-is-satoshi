Have the same problem. The link doesn't work or it has a virus cause my browser (chrome) thinks that "This Connection is not trusted"

Can't expect a country like Bangladesh to embrace technology innovation.
Some people prefer to be remain staying in the cave or on the tree. Let them.

I am so surprised to read about Ukraine! Have never thought about them to be one of the first countries who will legalize BTC.

Do I get you right - you think that this two attacks are related? 
Did you use the same password in kickstarter as in gox account?

Just watched it, I really like the part where you can't see what the pin you type looks like. And also that you can pay to several addresses in just one go.

The supply of BTC decreases due to BTC loss but at present it is an unknown value of BTC lost. Only when adoption and supply management for BTC happens we will understand how much is lost and not in circulation.

JP Morgan just realized bitcoin is making them useless so they are trying to influence on us not to use bitcoin.

Totally agree with you! if it was so easy and any prediction  you can create using past performance than we would be ready to every future scenario but retrospective analysis is not good  instrument when you make a deal with Btc

I'm sure they can neither confirm nor deny it.

Excuse me, how much exactly was that "low fees" for these transaction?

If I ran a pool, or had a big solo rig, I'd have an ongoing auction for each block to see what premium can be raised.
Each bidder would send a requested address and (25btc + premium) to an address provided. This is the only way you could guarantee the block is paid. They can request a refund at any time and if they don't win the bid is held over to the next block.
At block discovery the highest bid is used for generation address and the bidders deposit is used for pool payout.
Of course, with many virgin blocks like this, the specialness factor would go way down quickly and presumably the premium.

I think it will never end as it is life and everyday is differ from another days so the best advice is to get used to it and don't worry so  much! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:22:21
That's the best advice I've heard this week. That's true the best decision right now is to wait till it's less entangled.

The logo is really confusing. I like the rest of the design, though.
