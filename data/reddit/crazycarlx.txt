I agree with that. Just thought it was kind of funny in the moment
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:08:09
Glad it wasn't a centerpiece.  Stay under the radar

Satoshi gets the last laugh.  That's how the story ends lol
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:24:02
They're investigating potential criminal activities. That's a good thing. How does that translate to "it seems they're beginning to strangle crpto and exchanges"?

Taking bitcoin to the grave.  Even if it hits 0. F it
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:23:05
Yes but isn't that true for bitcoin as well. Centralized or not it's still a database? Sorry just trying to learn more
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:30:02
I like where your head is at ��
@_date: 2019-07-18 03:45:08
I can't agree man it's really hard to even consider your direction,  but I respect your opinion.  It's no secret at all that a ton of alts will die out and that this has actually  been expected in the crypto community for a long time my dude. A long time... As far as bitcoin being the worst performing asset you must be making this up man.  Really? Are you just trying to get a rise out of all of us.  It's working tho but it's hard to take it seriously.  I hope youre just messing around.  Some of your post seem somewhat knowledgeable though but this is ridiculous in my opinion
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:52:30
We had that quick shoot up to around 13.8k where the top blew off  and the consequences weren't so bad, but now it seems bitcoin is currently back at a comfortable position again until another overshoot happens of course. Overall the long trend remains in tact. Interesting comparison to historic tragectory  of gold as well . Pretty similar
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:15:46
Government has concerns  over bitcoin in regards to its use for illicit and illegal activities. Is this a joke? The US dollar is the most corrupt and the same political elites bashing bitcoin are the ones abusing the US dollar. Mind blown....I'll take bitcoin to the grave with me. Don't care
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:06:19
Whale Steve... Damn you!!!
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:14:51
Interesting you differentiate  "feelings" and "emotions" and can you explain what you mean? I think you may have a good point here
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:45:51
Not sure I agree with this. Let me sleep on it
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:23:24
A 20% drop is nothing when it comes to bitcoin. Get comfortable with the drops but long term overall is still in tact
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:16:44
 The overall value in bitcoin is still so small compared to other assets. The volatility is a reflection of the of the immaturity of the market. Its amazing all the hype day to day bitcoin gets but really bitcoin has a long way to go before it matures. Great opportunity I'd say but expect a very bumpy ride up
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:29:28
I honestly don't know him to well. I agree with keeping the crypto space free of criminal activity, but does this Roubini guy have any credit when it comes to his understanding and knowledge of Bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-07-27 18:24:11
Thank you sir.  Appreciate it
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:04:26
People pay to much attention to daily/weekly price. If it reaches 20k in 2 years so what.  That's healthier then another sudden/drastic spike albeit less exciting.
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:38:44
Bitcoin sure is interesting but really,  what do you think about the American economy?
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:53:54

Dude,  how long you been in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:12:09
About a month ago price was around 7900. Feels like that was an eternity ago, everyone is blasting to the moon I guess. Would be nice if it retest that level one more time though. Don't know
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:09:28
Honestly dude this makes me lose respect for him not the other way around lol
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:49:57
Just don't  be so emotional bro. Sounds a bit irrational what you say and so does 1 million right now so I agree with u on that
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:16:16
Thanks for your insights regarding this space and for taking the time to share these thoughts. I value them because you seem to have a solid understanding of the space. I honestly share many of your opinions as well and continue to educate myself as much as I can. your re right in that bitcoin has everything to prove still which I believe gives it a huge upside. For me there is no reason not to invest whatever you can manage as long as you can afford to lose that money and be ok. Thanks again
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:29:43
Can't wait for the dip after the dip :$
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:03:54
Bitcoin drops to 9800 again Ill buy, price drops $7200 after that I don't panic I buy more at $7200 then Hodl because its very likely going to go up up away again. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:57:11
Buy some bitcoin,  transfer to offline wallet,  and forget about it. Either way remember to make other time for yourself,  friends,  family.  Have other hobbies.  Take care of yourself. Passion is good obsession is not
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:57:00
You really think people are that clueless on here? Then again,  many people still think bitcoin is an actual physical coin.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:04:54
This is a well thought out explanation and thank you for sharing your thoughts. I agree on many of your points, especially in regards to its use case in Venezuela which has been overstated (yes it had helped some which is great but its not going to save their economy). Many consider bitcoin as a store of value and have compared it to gold, even calling it digital gold. Do you view bitcoin more as an asset like gold?
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:01:59
WTF lol
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:39:43
Don't know if I would post this.  Interesting and funny but remember to double check yourself brother. Be careful
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:28:44
I mean I agree with you.  Remm you actually have some interesting thoughts regarding the space but you shouldn't post this article to be honest man . Not enough reliability,  validity to take this article serious
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:59:09
Dude this is not groundbreaking news at all lol how long have you been following crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:31:30
Where did you come up with this?
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:02:11
Haha come on man.  That's a bit harsh
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:55:46
Well I definitely wouldn't be going to you to learn about my monies lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:40:16
Well sir I completely agree with you on that.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:57:52
I agree with you that nobody really understands anything, including you haha... Not sure why you're so salty buddy. Not every person who has interest in bitcoin is thinking the way you presume they are. I appreciate much of your response but I would argue that you aren't 100 % correct in your own interpretation of these issues
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:42:43
If youre ever having a hard time and seeing red on the daily, weekly chart,   zoooooom out and capture the long term trend.  You'll feel much better

@_date: 2019-07-03 05:15:43
Isn't Facebook using blockchain though with Libra? Maybe I'm naive here.  What it sounds like though is that it's going to be a stable coin and centralized which is why bitcoin becomes even better. Bitcoins blockchain is decentralized and always will be. I agree it's kind of funny when you think of it considering facebooks reputation and lack of privacy . Can only be good for bitcoin right
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:39:20
Thanks for sharing the video my dude.  Good content not the best debate I've seen  IMO.  I don't agree with you're interpretation of the market though. Sounds a lot like the same FUD that comes and goes and has been so throughout bitcoins 10 year existence.
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:32:10
a $100. really?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:07:04
I thought there was a mistake regarding this survey and the numbers were not accurate at 11 percent.  It was a lower estimation because they also accounted for "people who have heard of bitcoin" as owning bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:57:55
What's the purpose of even having money stored in tether?
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:59:20
I don't know of bitcoin will ever have an absolute price or if that's even possible.  I will say that any extreme in price up or down is further away from its intrinsic value.  So a quick jump to 20k is just as off as a down swing to 3100. Both are extremes and the closest to the true value is somewhere in between.  Peoples psychology and emotions  have a lot to do with price change as well as peoples  confidence
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:25:47
Who is this whale guy everyone is talking about? I need to have a word with him
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:51:47
Please... Please...  Do your due diligence my dude. Appreciate you but make sure you spend enough time before post
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:53:31
Hopefully one day we can say that we will likely never see 20k again as the bottom.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:03:01
Dude why you selling???? Bills? The bull trend is still in tact
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:28:19
Don't think that would push it to full on go mode.  Bitcoin does what it wants,  when it wants. Illegal activity will always be an issue regardless but bitcoin is meant for good and hopefully we can continue to eliminate the negative over time.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:06:23
Doubtful that you have anything to worry about. The price may actually go lower by the time you get home. Consider yourself lucky then

@_date: 2019-07-11 04:49:02
It's ok man that's how we learn. I've been in the game for 2 years are this past year I finally started to see good gains. Happens to everyone and I'm sure you can recover if you give it some time and stay the course if youre long on bitcoin. More importantly keep learning and educating yourself. risk what you would be ok losing
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:02:41

@_date: 2019-07-19 03:36:10
Yeah dude I don't mess with technical ANALysis  myself but you seem irrationally against it.
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:09:11
Last night I had a dream bitcoin was at 3100. It was beautiful. Hoping to catch around 7.2-8k again : /
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:40:28
Its a false signal of the market that indicates a reversal from bearish (downward) to bullish (upward) trend. Traders or investors who buy at this signal may get burned long because it was actually never a bullish reversal
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:13:02
This thread has been pretty cool since joining.  A lot of people on here have good opinions and information.  Some people not so much but overall I've been happy with it.  I hope the space continues to grow and we can all continue help each other through this process.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:16:10
Why are you investing in bitcoin? I would suggest that you read the white paper,  spend time understanding the technology, and educating yourself instead of listening to people who know nothing about it
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:54:39
Why? Because we can ;)
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:14:52
I appreciate this community so much. I honestly don't have a single friend or family member who take bitcoin seriously. Its amazing how many people are yet on board or understand what's happening. I guess more opportunity for us
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:45:26
We had such excitement when it broke 10k again. That was less then a month ago lol all is good in bitcoin world
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:07:04
Oh ok that's responsible haha yeah man you have to open a coinbase account for instance and transfer your funds from binance to that account and then you can cash out. it doesn;t take too much work to transfer as I've done it from binance to coinbase
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:29:20
Dude 20k is not really that extreme at this point. Whatever happens beyond 20k could be interesting tho

Technical analysis
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:13:34
I can appreciate your rationality here, although I usually just ignore the outlandish comments (good or bad) on this forum. I'm curious what your take on bitcoin is though having said you are pro cypto? I know that may be a tough question to sum up quickly, but I would appreciate some insight you may in regards to where you think crypto fits
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:48:51
a lot of support levels need to be broken before that happens. Yes, anything is possible though. My gut feeling is telling me that we could see 10.5k again but not much lower. But again, its possible
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:45:13
Dude how long have you been following crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:51:55
Would be nice to break through 11.5k. Could also see a scenario where 10.5k is next support level if we continue downward trend in short term
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:45:32
From what I understand regarding cold storage is that as long as you have your security keys written down or some place safe you can always buy another cold wallet and load your crypto again. You are in complete charge of your money from that standpoint and I don't think FDIC is applied in these circumstances
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:17:38
I appreciate, to some degree, the information and conversation that could happen as a result of you sharing this, but don't you think you're being a bit extreme as well and playing the same type of games. Can't you talk about this in a more neutral way instead of with such certainty and without the use of certain words (absolutely shocking, disaster, etc). A lot of it is also your opinion and you may have done some type of research but that doesn't mean its completely accurate either. I think its good to share your thoughts regarding what you think you know, but also understand that many people share different opinions, and yes I can find someone who will claim the exact opposite of what you're saying with there own set of facts.  Just share what you think and leave it open for discussion if you want. Your choice in the end .
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:30:51
Awesome. I'm going to buy today then. Thanks
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:53:45
I guess bitcoin to the moon ��
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:00:24
I feel you man.  To expect it to go up up up is not healthy.  It happens in bitcoin and may happen again but extremes are never good.  That's why it went from 20k in a month to 3100. Both are extremes and we don't want that.  Bitcoin seems to be steadily going up the over time which is good.  But you need patience and can't buy when the price goes extreme unless it's to the down side.  Then buy
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:29:49
Unless it was Satoshi himself, take it all with a grain of salt

Plan long term and pay less attention to short term price movements.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:39:08
it depends what you're purpose is and if you're investing short or long. I think 12k is fine if you plan on leaving it for a while (5 months-3 years, don't really know exactly when), but right when you buy it may just go down again so if you can stomach that you should be good long term. Let me be clear that I don't own a single bitcoin yet and have invested gradually in the space for around 2 years. I have not sold any of my bitcoin though and I've been up in gains for a while now. Yes the price goes down and my balance fluctuates but overall my position has increased gradually over the 2 years along with the money I gradually put in by DCA
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:54:53

@_date: 2019-07-03 06:54:29
Thank you for the source.
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:00:19
Thanks for the info.  Definitely worth looking at many perspectives on short term price action.  Going to look for a pump to 11.5 K in the next few weeks though. Still seems like a weak assessment of the current price action in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:16:26
Its up around 53% on the year. Not sure what you're looking for here
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:00:07
I can't imagine that $100 will make that much of a difference
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:26:22
Is bitcoin and crypto running out of steam? What makes you think that way?
Seems like nobody gives a fuck about this stuff anymore? What people are you referring to? 
I think your statement likely reflects your feelings due to seemingly lack of price movement upwards, even though the price has steadily been doing well considering where we started. Don;t get caught up in the irrational and do your research. Learn as much as you can
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:25:47
Maybe Bitcoin is just annoyed with humans at this point constantly feeling the pressure to go up or maybe down. Bitcoin is crying out, "just let me be", "live your life"
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:37:25
Why are you currently in the space at this time at all (assuming you are)? Just curious? Do you believe in bitcoin and its underlying potential (beyond price) or not?
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:18:35
The only strange thing I see is that only bitcoin "loose" more value.
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:32:58
Take a deep breath........count to ten.....now sell all your bitcoin. This might not be right for you
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:20:07
Fuck it bro, downvotes for all
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:55:08
Yes I agree to some extent about the marketing but I also think that BTC is meant to flourish on it's own terms and doesn't need people to embellish for that to happen. It just needs time/patience and these days it seems like a lot of us can't handle that lol I also think that memes can also work against actual adoption for something like BTC because people may continue to see it as a joke or not something to take serious
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:17:36
Monday was the right answer until the next dip
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:08:39

Either bitcoin takes over the world or it doesn't?  That's a rigid way to look that things.  Doesn't need to be that way for it to succeed
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:34:05
did you honestly think it would just continue upwards ? I'm not trying to be sarcastic just asking
@_date: 2019-11-15 23:03:51
Do you believe in bitcoin or not? It's that simple
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:15:32
Coinbase isn't bad. For a ledger I would go with a Nano x or Nano s

-4.51% is nothing. I'd say get out if your concerned with that type of pull back

Why don't you just sell now before it goes to zero
@_date: 2019-11-04 02:28:15
That was a pretty weak explanation
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:53:04
You actually take time out of your day to say this. Um alright
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:40:15
At the end of the day I don't think BTC will be judged by it's memes lol  So I could care less, although some are pretty funny
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:35:15
You bought at 10? That's not that stupid man.  It's really not.

@_date: 2019-11-27 18:26:01
I love memes too but a lot of the time i laugh at it and then move on. Personally I don't think it will help adoption but it will help the meme adoption lol

That's fine but if you put so much money in to the point where it stresses you out that's not a good at all.

Good thinking haha We all need a little of that my friend.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:51:49
First you say "The cryptomarket is ruled by a bunch if cowboys/criminals that manipulate the whole market on a daily basis" (extreme, not a well thought out response)
but then you go on to a agree with someone else's reasonable/logical statement regarding the markets and market behavior. Why not just make a well thought out response to begin with instead of going on a rant that's a bit off
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:52:49

I hate to break it to you but you don't sound like an investor at all or at least I wouldn't use the term investor when describing your position here.  You sound like more of a speculator not an investor.

yeah when he comes to the conclusion that we are still in a bear market because we haven't eclipsed the ATH it just sounds really really stupid.  The Irrationally of that extreme run up can't be overstated and the same goes for the swing down to $3100, although that was a great buy opportunity nonetheless
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:22:53

That's crazy talk.  I don't know shit about TA but definitely not horse shit in and of itself.  Sometimes the people using TA are horseshit but not the methodology behind using TA.  Definitely something that has been useful for a long time but it's not the end all be all either

I hope they would get exposed if true but the right people can find ways to make sure people keep quite, atleast for some time.

I completely disagree respectfully sir.  I've personally kept up to date on 3 people who I trust doing TA for a year and they have great understanding of the market.  They don't claim to be perfect and sometimes get it wrong but I'd say about 75 percent of time they are spot in with their hypothesis.  I listen to them everyday.  They have made a lit of people happy $ but they aren't perfect

12 K was busted a while ago . But let's do it again and stay above
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:08:29
IMO I don't think it matters a whole lot short term what impact Something like Bakkt has on the price or any news about any developments and how it will effect short term price (good or bad). Manipulation of the market is always considered but I don't think it matters much for long term  Hodlers. If you trade or deal more in short term then I would be more concerned about these things and how they may effect price action.
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:30:02
Remember when Bitcoin was $100. Yeah... not that long ago. Greed is a Bit*h. Bitcoin is a beast. Stay patient and be in this for the right reasons and you will learn a lot regardless

Damn it.  I was hoping to wake up this morning and be filthy rich. Bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2019-08-17 06:15:22
This is an interesting question.  I personally don't think that it will effect price it short-term  3 6 months.  However it may have a say at some point will be hard to tell.  The problem is that everyone is expecting it,  however,  we should realize that bitcoin doesn't work like that and it might actually work the opposite of what we expect
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:12:55
and we should believe you because?????
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:43:01
The price soars? Really?
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:36:44
Nothing is certain so I hope you could afford to lose that money if Bitcoin went to zero, which the chances are sooooooo unbelievably slim that this happens IMO. I know some well respected people who I value and they believe that within the next major bull run bitcoin price could range from 250k-350k. That's not going to happen overnight though and the healthiest way is through corrections and steady growth. Bitcoin does what it wants though and has a track record of these hyperbolic run ups as well. Be prepared for what you will do if that happens again. Your BTC might go from 20k to 100k quickly but you have to be prepared for a blowoff top and an extreme come down as well if it spikes in such an irrational way
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:52:45
Don't talk about bitcoin like that
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:07:46
Bitcoin has been the ultimate test of character.  Has taught me better self control,  humility,  patience, and resiliency. Some may not be so lucky. I've Enjoyed this thread and will continue to be apart of this journey.  Cheers and happy Sunday!

Yeah Im planning on making another purchase soon and then going to store the ledger away for a while and not worry about it.  I'll buy bitcoin and continue to DCA on exchange but going to chill out for a while and see what happens
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:49:55
Whose fault is that? Not bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:06:40
Second guessing? really? Zoom out and look at the long term chart.
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:20:34
I don't think it matters much at all. Personally, I could care less and wouldn't expect news like that to effect the price all that much. Maybe a few years ago it would've created some mass FUD.Oh how we've matured
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:59:57
Gap fill 8830
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:39:25
Bitcoin futures gap likely will need to fill around that mark and then good possibility of moving upwards towards 11.5 11.8k. it may be a good entry point around 8830 but that's just my two cents.  It's bitcoin after all
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:37:28
You sound butt hurt. What happened? This small dump got you down?
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:05:34
You obsess over bitcoin all the while bitcoin gives you the middle finger. Go bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:07:23
Good point.  Seems to be yearning for more and more attention
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:03:21
You seem on point until you said, "  though tbf all TA is pretty much guessing at the future psychology of markets" I mean any respected TA is more than just a guessing game, you seem rational enough to know the kind of work they put in and the overall method behind it
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:20:05
You likely wouldn't close your position yet my friend. That wouldn't make much sense
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:18:25
IMO..Bitcoin hasn't been around long enough nor has it been through a economic crisis, so I don't think people will have the confidence yet. Thus, I think that initially it will go down like most everything else during a crisis. Money won't just flow into Bitcoin like some people think will happen. Bitcoin simply needs more time and confidence which seems likely IMO, but that could take a while until that happens. I think its going in the right direction, people just need more patience and rationality
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:24:35
I don't bring up bitcoin often. I just keep quite and slowly accumulate more. It's either too complicated for people or they still think it's a scam or something.  If you put in the work and try to gain as much knowledge as you can then you will understand the implications.  Many won't care until it reaches 20k again and then suddenly they will care again.  My guess is that bitcoin thinks that's just disrespectful
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:26:14
Lol seems a bit extreme dude
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:30:40
Good morning everyone! Nice to wake up to some bullish sentiment on the sub. Stay Bitcoin my friends

Don't overthink it
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:36:01
I can no longer even imagine a world without Bitcoin. I think I've gone mad
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:21:01
Negative publicity which can create Fear, Uncertinity, and Doubt in the psychology of the market
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:03:03
 Some find TA beneficial and have had success and others find it useless I guess. who's right and who's wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-18 06:11:33
Honestly though it could go either way.  Bitcoin may increase in value during a recession due to the confidence in it being a good hedge,  however,  I could also see a scenario where the price gets hit along with most other assets.  The problem I see is that bitcoin has only been around for 10 years so I don't know if a majority of people will have the confidence yet to play it as a hedge Vs.  something like gold for example which has a solid history to date. No matter what happens I think bitcoin is here to stay and will survive long term regardless
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:59:01
everyone is biased to some degree. I don't use TA but my point is that to say it's useless is one sided thinking and clearly illogical. Its better to say that "I don;t agree with TA and I find it useless for me" instead of saying it's "useless" in general. I know I'm being picky here
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:19:29

I'm telling you man once u distribute your btc to stocks that's when the stock market tanks and btc starts to recover.  Happens a lot but for your sake I hope it doesn't. For anyone's sake I hope it doesnt. You may want to diversify and keep a small portion in btc just in case

I take it you haven't been in crypto very long?
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:54:11
Yeah I dont think it's good timing either.  People have a hard enough time understanding bitcoin why would they want to join Hex and play that game. I don't see how it will increase adoption either.  I'll stick to BTC
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:43:02
Let me call satoshi

I'm so sick of this kind of crap. Lol smh

I would just sell all your BTC with a comment like that
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:13:32
I agree completely but why would anyone be buying bitcoin, especially everyday people who invest in stocks. To them, things are going great . Seems like a lot of people think the economy is doing great . We know better than this
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:59:25
I appreciate your view as well, however, I would urge you to learn more about the space. It doesn't seem like you have a very good understanding, although you always have the right to voice your opinion at any time. It's healthy to talk about the cons, but I would encourage you to take more time to learn in which your comments may have even more validity.
@_date: 2019-12-20 14:44:00
I mean a price prediction from 10k to 8k just isn't that impressive of a call
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:50:45
This guy bought at the top. He's clearly salty as hell and just going on tangents

Scientific evidence?  Are you being serious?
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:00:14
Could take some time but that would  be a good sign.  Seems to have some nice support right now off the bounce which is a good sign but who really knows
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:10:34
Dude that bull run was completely irrational and extremely overbought.  The interest was pure speculation. That's not even worth taking serious in terms of healthy growth and interest

@_date: 2019-12-24 19:42:32
I'm just saying anytime anyone begins a sentence with, "many experts expecting HUGE price drop" and whatever else about the halvening you said it just sounds off. I'm not saying we shouldn't take information in from other sources but you have to know by now how much BS is out there, especially in crypto. Maybe provide some resources and that will help the validity a bit.

Oh you mean tricky dicky

Are you trading Btc?
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:36:10
Manage your emotions better.  All I can say
@_date: 2019-12-27 14:16:17
Educate, learn as much as you can, do the work, and hopefully you will no longer need to ask the question.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:48:10
Really? smh
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:55:47
While I appreciate some of the things you say here I don't personally believe that you have a good grasp of this subject matter.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:50:42
Significant debt,  continued abuse of money printing,  inflated assets,  fake assets,  fake entitlements,  inflation,  devaluation of dollar

Everything has an ending buddy.  Except.... Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:28:54
According to who?
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:14:15
I could see why you would get annoyed by the constant moon predictions. However,  I'd have to ask why are you in the space to begin with? Why are you investing in bitcoin, assuming you are? If you believe in the underlying value and potential than I would think that those price predictions, good or bad,  would make no difference for you
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:53:37
 Lord help us. Smh
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:28:35
and you're making comments like that?  I'm a bit surprised
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:52:01
Better in what way? be more specific
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:28:57
Now that's a well educated response. You must have spent years researching this topic
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:36:19
I got you haha cheers!
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:26:29
I mean if youve done you're time/ research and believe in the product and underlying value long term I'd consider it investing.  If you've taken no time to learn and just hope to get rich quick due to hype  I'd say that's more speculation and equate that to gambling.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:20:21
and who are you?
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:03:29
Not really.  The stock market is bullish as hell. Why change.    Although,  it's been artificially pumped.  Who knows what comes next
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:08:32
Volume is still pretty low
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:03:24
So is Bitcoin just getting started?
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:54:13

Always stay humble my friend ; )
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:05:41
I mean there is upside to both stocks and bitcoin. Bitcoin has performed better over the last few years but it's volatile and doesn't have the historical support that stocks have.    Some would say it's even irresponsible to not have some bitcoin as apart of your entire portfolio at this time. Both can coexist and offer balance/diversification.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:45:03
I'm just extreme man. no left no right JUST EXTREMEEEEE

Go to hex.win
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:47:42
Another well informed response /s
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:36:38
but I'm not normal
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:42:22
Yes but you also have to ask yourself if the loses are due to the product itself being crap ....or is it the person who is simply speculating with little understanding of cryptocurrency to begin with. I'm not saying that's you just trying to distinguish between investing and speculating. Either way there is risk involved and I get that but it seems to me that investing takes into account as much information about the product /education and makes an informed decision based on that vs. throwing money in to get a quick buck with little to no understanding of the market.
@_date: 2019-12-12 02:37:36
Don't talk to bitcoin like that
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:41:22
And yet still you also sound very naive
@_date: 2019-12-14 01:37:25
I like gold and bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-21 02:43:32
I guess if u want to give me a valid analysis of a price prediction that's cool
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:58:28
1)Take some time to learn about bitcoin and Blockchain so you have an informed response or criticism. 2)Unless you have huge amount of money/percentage in any company's stock you really don't own shit lets face it.
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:40:01
At the end of the day its the most secure computer network ever. Pretty big deal
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:56:26
I mean I guess I can't argue with that ; )

@_date: 2019-12-16 17:30:01
Lol what in the actual fu Smh
@_date: 2019-12-27 17:13:19
remember it's just as important to have a plan/strategy for when this happens...., just like it's important to have a plan for bear markets
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:40:27
@_date: 2019-12-04 04:01:21
Why does it seem like people always blame bitcoin for the reason they lost money. Did you ever think to look in the mirror
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:02:56
Once you sell. We are waiting.....
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:30:32
And people should believe you because?
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:33:18
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:34:03
Less than a year ago bitcoin was around $3100. Stay patient.  We all want growth and profit but you have to believe in the technology and purpose of what your investing in.  Educate yourself as much as you can and learn about how money works.  The education alone will be worth it .....and if you decide to invest or not in bitcoin at least you will have opened your mind
@_date: 2019-09-14 19:04:58
Bakkt off bro
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:07:34
Interesting. Nice find
@_date: 2019-09-27 04:51:39
You sound so sure of your view.   What makes your beliefs about bitcoin so valid?
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:07:30
I just think that saying it's meaningless and useless is to far one wAy which is your opinion and I respect that, however, I can't agree with such one sided thinking.  You can likely find several articles and historical studies confirming TA is good practice as well. Who's right who's wrong?  I'm not here saying that TA is an exact science or glorifying it my dude. But it has some upside if done respectfully but far from perfect . The 3 guys I'm referring to are some of the most well established and respected in the crypto community at proving valuable information regarding price action. It's more useful for everyday traders and I'm not one of those.
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:17:12

You can't do anything with it? That's false
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:25:59
Do you believe in the vision or not? It's that simple
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:10:09
I'd say ASAP. Buy from the main company though and not from third party . It's around $60 usd
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:51:32
Naw man.  Good TAs don't predict like that or claim they do.  They just give there opinion based on there understanding and you take what you want from it.  To dismiss it completely is a bit irrational,  although you have every right to think that way.  It has to much history behind it to consider it horse shit IMO.
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:18:22
What about the ladies
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:42:11

I'd expect some violent moves soon but could be blood in the streets instead of moon. That's ok hope you have cash on hand to buy more

What I'm trying to understand about bitcoin is when I go to the club, how will I be able to make it rain SATS
