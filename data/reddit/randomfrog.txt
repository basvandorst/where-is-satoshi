But why? What about the fees?

Works fine here in France

I asked the agent, had no clue wtf I was talking about.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:40:55
Yes I did, I asked them for the fees and can out limit. Waiting for an answer

OK thank you. So would you recommend me to withdraw the money after the transfer is confirmed or to buy btc and send them to another address?
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:57:15
I made a SEPA deposit Friday or Saturday which isn't completed yet, is there a risk for me to lose the money I sent? What should I do?
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:43:09
I didn't know this app, looks great! And I found someone near me who may help me.

I have 3.15$ in Singapore right now, unfortunately Bitcoin is not mainstream yet
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:27:39
Not yet! I read some banks ask for a proof of address. Not sure if I can open one without.

The very first channel connects 2 people. Then every new UTXO cannot onboard more than 1 new person. So he's definitely right.

You can use Purse.io to shop on Amazon.com and have a discount on what you buy.

Not yet. It will be deflating when more coins are lost than created. Which isn't the case right now.

I don't think the technology will survive this long. It will probably be replaced by something even more innovative and which will solve more problems.

1) ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency with better features that gains massive traction (maybe Dash, Monero, Zcash, or one that is not yet created).
2) Hard fork. If the new coin gets more than 50% of the hash power, new blocks on the old chain will take forever to be mined, the difficulty will never adjust and the bitcoins will be frozen forever, making it worthless. Thus the miners can effectively define on their own what the bitcoin must become.
3) State regulations and bitcoin control. Something like antipiracy laws where the States can request the identity of someone to the ISP (because the IP address was not hidden). They could do the same with exchanges, and monitor everyone's bitcoin.

It is [both](
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:45:43
The best answer
@_date: 2015-10-17 01:57:02
I think you are wrong, there is no clear relation between price (high or low) and the price variation as you seemed to suggest. It means that having a 10% increase or decrease between day t and day t+1 is as likely if the price is at $20 or as if it is at $200.
Proof (I computed data from  ):

I missed a Bitcoin meetup this week because of a big hangover :(
I tried to find the only two-way bitcoin ATM here but the place doesn't exist anymore. There are few people active on localbitcoins.com but only one on mycelium. I have never found a shop accepting bitcoin since I came here after last Christmas, but I never actively looked for them.
There are actually several exchange platforms to trade in SGD: itbit, coinhacko, coinrepublic, fybsg. So there seem to be some kind of interest for bitcoin here but I have not been able to witness it directly, except from who kindly helped me to get SGD in cash when I arrived.

Thank you for spreading the good words 1$ @_date: 2015-03-24 22:15:28
I just registered to ChangeTip today for r/millionairemakers and I am waiting for my tips to be collected. Do YouTubers bother to create an account to collect the tips? How to make them to do so?

I was selling bitcoins at market price for more than two months, not a single trade. Now I have a local bank account but I have to use itBit to get money cheaply. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:28:15
When the price is increasing it proves that Bitcoin is going soon "to the moon". When the price is decreasing, "price doesn't matter".

What about deposit fees? Up to 1% for BTC-e. This article is so inaccurate...
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:33:47
Yes they are. If you own your private key and don't tell anybody how to recover your bitcoins, they will probably be lost forever.
But if they are stored on an exchange wallet I guess there is a possibility for the family to get them back

I am a new user but it seems quite secure thanks to 2FA, login notifications and min 24-72h money holding after a request. But it is not convenient at all to withdraw your money or cash as it can take a while. The support is answering quickly during business days.
You should look at this page to make your own opinion: 
I think fees are OK, 0.50 or 0.40%: 
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:20:56
My understanding is that, if fees get higher, LN channels will reserve the same value to cover the cost in case of the channel closing. Is it true?

Getting​ verified BEFORE depositing €1M is crucial though. Or the founds may be stuck for days/weeks.
