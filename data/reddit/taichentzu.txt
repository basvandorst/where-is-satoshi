You can crack the keys using shors algorithm running on a quantum computer if the wallet has ever sent bitcoin. And you can do it off network, and when your done just put the right answer in. Key reuse is important to avoid, and lack thereof on old wallets is what the hack is all about. The first cracks will take months or weeks, but as qubits increase, and the speed of setting up and interpreting results increases, the attack time can be brought down. If it can be brought below block time, attackers can spend out of a victims wallet before the victim has time to move to a new address. That's the problem.

because when adding transactions to a block, miners check that you have enough money to send the transaction! Also, the miners with the losing transaction also now have the winning transaction in the latest block.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:36:57
Your asking about which transaction is in the mempool. The factor for that is geometric progression. If two spends are pushed at the exact same second, both will start spreading amongst the miners and reside in the mempool of transactions waiting to be mined. The miners will accept or reject one of the transactions depending on which came first. In practice, one of the transactions will win because of the way geometric progression works. Even if you fire them within a second of each other, the first one fired will beat the second due to the exponential nature of the geometric progression and the path. But, let's say you could somehow fire them perfectly so that half the network got one transaction, and the other half got the other transaction. The block would be mined, and the transaction that didn't make it into the block would be caught as an invalid transaction. That is why people wait for confirmations of the block to trust the transaction.

They have a database that has your address in it. Its built up from the blockchain, block by block. Now technically its possible to have an empty bitcoin address that isn't in the database, but the moment someone sends it bitcoin or it mines bitcoin is the moment that it joins the blockchain, and therefore the database that every miner builds from the blockchain.

This would take a hard fork, and would probably be contentious.

cnn may be biased but here is an actual objective comparison of false statements by both fox and cnn
This is an independent site that dings news networks for lying. You can clearly see that fox news has made more than 3 times as many provably and factually incorrect statements as cnn. Cnn is biased left, but as far as "fake news" or should I say "factually incorrect news and statements" Fox news is at least a 3x worse offender than cnn. News organizations that publish unflattering information about someone you like or publish a flattering story about someone you dislike are not fake news. Fake news is when you actually lie, and this is why having reviews of news organizations by independent bodies matters.

The reason that bitcoin is the price it is at currently... for the record, $3400 not $708. is because of the market. The market is based on sellers and buyers. Sellers are not willing to sell their bitcoins at a specific price, and then the buyer offers a higher price than the surrounding value, and the seller says yes because they anticipate they can rebuy at a lower price. On the other hand, we have people who hodl their bitcoin and will not sell, taking it off the market. And then we have people who will not sell for a price below the price they bought it for. 
But what drives the desire to buy bitcoin?
1. The widespread recognition. There are a million other clones, and some of them have serious technical work put in. However, none of them have the widespread recognition as bitcoin does, and as a result, bitcoin is king.
2. The fact that bitcoin is immutable. This makes bitcoin a scarce and finite resource. This makes it suitable to be a store of value. 
3. The fact that btc can be transacted cross borders outside the banking system at speed. Government overreach is a big thing. The overreach is well intentioned, but it has made it difficult to send money to people. This includes things such as remittances. For example, china takes a big cut of your money if you try to move it out of their banking system into another banking system. The US imposes all kinds of monetary restrictions and anti money laundering laws in order to combat drugs. Bitcoin bypasses the entire system, and this is a good thing. If the government is upset about money laundering, they should be going after the money launderers with open book systems like bitcoin instead of making life slow for the rest of us. 
4. The fact that btc can only be controlled by the person who holds the keys. The government is a big fan of the concept of ownership without control, and many people seem to believe that control is a derivative property of ownership. Not true. Ownership is a derivative property of control. Case in point, see how the bank of england is maintaining that venezuela owns the gold in the british vaults, but is also not allowing maduro to withdraw the gold to pay venezuelan debts to russia. Also case in point, see how courts enforce court orders through freezing assets at banks, despite the ownership of assets staying the same. Ownership in modern society is a myth. If the government wants to they can send in armed goons to kick you out of your home and take it from you with asset forfeiture, and if they plant a little baggie of weed, the court will let them. They can go to google and pry open your email inbox. Your text messages can be intercepted. The only things they cannot steal are well defended private keys, and for most americans, bitcoin is the first thing they have ever truly had full control over without governments, 3rd party financial institutions, or any other system intervening.

No they aren't. They are unbiased fact checkers, and they don't publish news, they check them. Your using the term fake news exactly like trump uses it. If it doesn't fit your personal tastes you call it fake. That's is dangerous, because the word fake news is the same as accusing them of lying. The reason news exists and is called the fourth estate is because of its role as fact checker. Obama got his share of bad press, but did democrats call the news fake? No! The only ones going around with the actual fake news are small foreign run operations that make lots of add  revenue and the Russian internet research agency and its associated troll farms.

If it's your money, you should move it once every hundred years, and if you so much as moved it to a new address, and then moved it back just once it would reset the clock.
If 99% of all btc were to be forever lost to living humanity, that would be terrible. Yes, we would be trading 1 satoshi = 1,000,000 dollars, and yes we could add subdivisions to the satoshi, but all those leading zeros are plain ugly! 
Also, it creates an odd scenario where if you can crack the old wallets with quantum or if you somehow by luck stumble onto one, even if it only contains what we would today consider to be dust, you win the cosmic lottery.

Deep state. Please. Give it a freaking break. 
Deep state is a political term that the orange clown made up. The US government is a big, slow, inefficient behemoth that is trying to hold a country of three hundred million people across 50 states with different laws together. There is alot of work that needs to be done by the state and federal government, and the government agencies are important organs of survival for the united states.

Well, the pump over 15 minutes to 5k was its own thing. It was brought about by that initial massive buy order that then forced liquidations. It was not a natural move, it was a war between a bunch of bears and a single chungus of a whale who forced them to liquidate positions and buy bitcoin. They lost a lot of money. The pump to 5300 was normal market exuberance. The pullback to 5000 was normal as small time traders took profit. I think we will trade flat for several days, and even if our chungus whale exits the market, we won't do a full bart, because chungus forced shorts to liquidate, and right now they are burned and don't have the dough to short btc. They are at 0 btc and 0 dollars.   
So, if big chungus exits, we could see a drop to 4500. That would be ok. But I don't think big chungus wants to exit in a dramatic fashion like that. I think big chungus is an OTC whale who has bought up a monster amount of btc OTC and entered the market in the way they did to force liquidations and force the price to move higher. But where can big chungus sell his fat gains safely after he forced the shorters to liquidate? OTC sales. Because OTC sales track with the market spot price of btc.   
If big chungus is smart, he will offload his loot to dollars OTC, up the ante, and as soon as the shorters are out in force again, force them to liquidate again, driving up the price and allowing him to sell OTC at a higher price than he bought for even more profit. Rinse and repeat until the shorters are so numb and in such shock they stop being bearish and just buy btc, and hodl and nurse their losses and cry.   
But, on the day that happens, big chungus will have to use the opposite strategy against people who have long positions with leverage on btc. And that will be a painful day for hodlers, but it won't come for many moons yet. Right now, big chungus is our friend.

Deep fakes are an existential threat even blockchain cannot fully counter. The problem is that many people today have had their faith in the big news institutions broken by Trump continuously calling them fake, and the rise of actual fake news. 
The problem is that many people are idiots and equate the two terms, where one is libel, and the other is true. This gets worse, because there is no way to properly do decentralized news reporting without opening up the floodgates to anyone with a bunch of sock puppet accounts and a camera to do multiple shots of the same incident. They can stage it if they want to. They can deepfake it afterwards, and if the masses see bunches of deepfakes of the same event from various posters on various platforms it rings true to them. 
What is worse, studies have shown people put alot of merit on gossip, even if the source is untrustworthy. Combine gossip with deepfaked evidence and anyone with a vendetta to get anything done can manipulate the mass opinion easily.   
But it gets worse. What if I deepfake video of you with a prostitute and threaten to show your wife unless you pay 10k? All I need is a prostitute, an actor that is your body build, and a bunch of videocards to manufacture convincing fake evidence that can be delivered via anonymous email to force you to give up your money via monero? 
And after that it gets even more worse. Spam campaigns. Facebook friend lists. Twitter followers. Nuclear fake threats. Incitement to war. Fake murders by fake people of a race you dislike because of skin tone. And even if you can somehow restore faith in big news organizations, there is not much you can do about new from outside the country being pushed into the country.   
  
Fighting Deepfakes will require an absolute trust in centralized bastions of truth until a decentralized method of determining truth is found. Blockchain can solve decentralization in a closed environment where all facts are known and recorded to the blockchain, but saying that blockchain can secure deepfakes is like saying that bitcoin could be used to secure monero transactions. Monero transactions are not on the bitcoin blockchain, and although someone may buy monero with btc, once they step off, btc has no way to verify anything.
Same story with deepfakes. You can put a video hash on the blockchain, but unless faith in the centralized organizations is restored, you cannot have the initial conversation. I think the only way to even start is to outlaw slanted journalism, and force news organizations to stop playing fast and loose with news and opinion pieces. Fox news is the worst offender in america by far, but there are political slants on the other side as well. Jail time for talking heads who don't retract false statements is a start, but possible jail time for execs as well along with monetary fines framed in terms of % of wealth is also a start.

I would argue that monero could in theory be broken with a quantum computer, and that zcash zk-snarks are immune to quantum attack. 
10 years from now, I would feel more secure if a nsa bot were sniffing my old z-cash transactions with assistance of a quantum computer than my monero transaction. 
That said, if I ever have to cover my tracks, I do both, and wrap the monero transaction inside two zcash transactions, with multiple exchanges involved. 
I have high hopes for grin though. I might add it to my mixing strats for personal use, but I will admit that once you are using 3 cryptos for security that is being paranoid. In ten years, nobody will care about your darknet transactions if they were under 100 million, and weren't being used nefariously in the future. That kind of expertise requires serious political will, and no small expense, and is not something even the IRS could throw down currently.

This machine is not a threat to bitcoin now. However next years version will be better. And the version after that will be even better. And then there will be competition. And in 3-4 years we will have a quantum computer that can crack bitcoin. 
This is not hyperbole. Bitcoin had better get its act together on the quantum front. Same for ethereum. They should look to iota's key signing process for inspiration, because iota is already quantum proof. The real scary part is what happens if someone cracks satoshi's original keys and then claims to be satoshi? That could throw real monkey wrenches various places. Anyways, btc as it currently functions is dead on arrival vs a dedicated quantum attacker with adequate qubits. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:16:36
Oh someone most definitely will. They already have in the iota and qrl spaces, but the problem with btc is how fractious the community is when it comes to stuff like this.

It's not what comes after quantum computers. It's how good does the quantum computers get. The quantum computer they are showing off is the computer equivalent to a digital calculator. We all know how computing took off after that. The real question is what comes after public/private asymmetric key cryptography is broken. I think we will move to one time use keys or the seed with infinite permutation one time use keys like iota has. Not to plug iota for anything else, but that is one reason it is a serious contender to bitcoin, and a leader in the cryptocurrency space, even though its not in the top ten by price. I can see iota price staying where its at, but the iota signature model could end up being copied in essence by every single other blockchain (not their tangle though) And in that way at least, iota would have been the thought leader in the crypto world. QRL is another perfectly good quantum secure blockchain, although it has its own problems with heavy signatures and scaling issues and blocksize/propogation due to the heaviness of the signature.

Bitcoin can certainly die. Here is a plausible scenariojanuary 2019: microsoft unveils a quantum computer for commercial use (already just happened)
September 2019: Some smart computer scientists figure out how to split quantum computation problems across multiple quantum computers
January 2020: Bitcoin is still rejecting a contentious fork that would grant quantum resistance, but would also increase block size by a factor of 10.
June 2020: Satoshi nakamoto's bitcoins have mysteriously started moving. Nobody knows why or even how. They were all dumped on coinbase, causing the price of bitcoin to drop from recent highs of 10,000 to a low of 1,500. There are numerous panic sellers.
august 2020: Bitcoin panic increases as multiple large wallets that have sent transactions in the past are drained. It is rumored that quantum attacks are involved.
december 2020: As large investors dump the bitcoin for a safer store of value, less known and quantum resistant cryptos have taken the lead. One of which, a well known DAG instead of a blockchain has seen a meteroic price rise in the wake of bitcoin's fall. Up from its 2017 high of $5, its now trading at $75.
January 2021:The last bitcoin miners have given up. As bitcoin fell in price, the mining hash share it enjoyed dropped. As a result, bitcoin itself experienced multiple 51% attacks that resulted in coinbase delisting it.
Yeah. It can happen to the best of coins when they don't take quantum tech into account.
Cracking a private/public key in under 10 minutes is forecast to be here by 2025, possibly sooner. We bet quantum computers were 10 years out last year. IBM released one this year. Iota and qrl are quantum safe. few to no other cryptocurrencies can survive a quantum attack.

Not sure if coinbase has chanalysis software up and running, but they probably do. Bitcoin is HIGHLY traceable. If alphabay's btc address is 1 hop away in a chain of transactions, and they see it, they KNOW without a shadow of a doubt that you are sending alphabay money to coinbase.   
So, here is an introduction on how to properly clean crypto!  
Step 1. Get yourself to a DEX. Bisq is a good start. 
Step 2. Tumble your btc in a btc tumbler and withdraw to your bread wallet. 
Safer step 2. Buy monero, do a monero -&gt; monero transaction and then rebuy btc with your monero and transfer the btc to your breadwallet. 
You can reexecute safer step 2 with any privacy coin (zcash is a good alternative) however monero is the most noob friendly. Grin is an interesting newcomer to the show.

Correct, right now, normal people have no influence in politics. The way to change that is to introduce several measures. 
1. ranked choice voting. This breaks the spoiler and the wasted vote effects. By doing this, people in the last election could have voted for one of the third party candidates and still have been able to cast their vote against trump or hillary. If gary johnson had won, think about how our system would have been. And, with ranked choice voting, people could have voted for gary johnson while at the same time ranking trump or hillary lowest (whichever they considered worst. In addition, bernie could have run, and he wouldn't have split the vote of the democratic party. In a way, the ranked choice vote makes party primaries pointless, because although the party can select someone, if someone else wants to run against the party candidate, they can do so without splitting the vote. Lastly, it makes it impossible to run spoiler candidates to split major party votes. If this is done for all presidential and congressional candidates, political party importance will fade dramatically. 
2. Outlawing gerrymandering. It is easy to spot gerrymanderring, but difficult to prove it. There is a mathematical proof involved in how many "wasted votes" there were per district. Forcing all maps to be drawn by a non partisan party with oversight is a great start to removing gerrymandering. Once this happens the knock on effects of having your party in power will get reduced. 
3. Reversing citizen's united. Right now, big political parties make big promises to big companies in return for lots of free money. They shill their party, and corrupt their way to power. By outlawing all corporate donations, and limiting individuals to donate $250 or less, you break the political/money power of the political parties. Once you do that, the party influence will be dramatically reduced. 
America needs less political partisanship. It is breaking our unity and our consensus. It has led to cruelty, and many people think of their fellow americans as stupid or as the enemy. It is not your fellow people who are the enemy. It is the people who corrupt public discourse, corrupt public finances, steal votes, manipulate elections and who take donations from foreign states who are the enemy. And to be clear: those specific folks really ought to be marched en masse to the guillotine. They have caused to much suffering and heartache for others to deserve any less. And they aren't the politicians in all cases. They are the people who are pulling the politician's strings.

Bitcoin is both for socialists and capitalists. The ONLY goal of bitcoin is to prevent the uncontrolled printing of money by the government, the unilateral seizure of funds, and the unilateral freezing of payments. That's it.
If people want to get together and share risk, and appoint other people whose sole job is to manage societal risks.... good for them. It works. It's called taxes and government.
If people want to pool together their money to prevent problems that cause other problems, good for them, it is called risk mitigation.
Here is an example of these types of problems: sexually transmitted disease epidemics. kids too soon epidemics. poverty epidemics. Homelessness epidemics. These are all conditions that are interrelated. Mom fucks random people, unprotected sex, and causes diseases to spread. She gets a kid. She can't afford a kid, so she becomes homeless. Well what does she do? She fucks people for money and keeps spreading diseases.
The smart solution for the good of all is to step in and break the cycle. Not just for the people who are helpless and trapped in the poverty cycle, but for other people who will be sucked into the cycle, either through their own poor judgement, or the actions of those around them. But who steps in with free housing to alleviate the poverty that is forcing the mom to become a sex worker because that is the only job she is qualified for that makes enough money? Surely not any individual, the cost is too great, and there is very little reward. That is why people pool their money. Taxes are a way to buy stability in our lives. Its a way to buy the infrastructure we depend upon. It's too expensive for corporations or individuals because the rate of return per user is abysmal. You need millions of users, before those intangible benefits start to outweigh the costs. And that is why government exists. It serves as a way to split the cost between all members of society for things like roads, military, etc. And to the moms situation: add in free childcare and free education and before you know it, she will be producing more than enough value to not only pay for the childcare + education investment, but her taxes will pay to prevent another person from falling into the same trap she did.
Now does the state sometimes over reach? YES! and that is wrong! Can the state's over reach be curbed? Well, that is why politics exists. To control the state. However, people are participating in identity politics instead of voting who they know is the right guy.
If you want to fix/fight/restrict the state, bitcoin is not your answer. The proper answer is to campaign in your local state for things like ranked choice voting, anti gerrymandering laws, and laws prohibiting the large sums of money to be donated by special interest groups to essentially buy elections.
If we fix the underlying rot that has corrupted politics, and corrupted the state, then we can have common sense laws. We won't be continuously at war. We can push for science, green tech, and liberty from oppressive rules and regulations designed for a pre-token economy. But we cannot do that until we have cut the two major political parties down. They are the corruptors of politics, and Trump and the last two years of the republican party have been the most corruptive of all.

1. I disagree with the whole "zionist hoaxes = war on terror" first, the zionists are done as being a movement. They have been replaced by pro israeli war hawks, and the reason those ware hawks are pro israel is because israel gives them free airbases, supply etc. The term "zionism" reeks of judaism and jews and paints jewish people as these super control freaks out to control the world, and they are not. The term zionism is needlessly loaded with racism and bigotry, and misguides those who use the term away from the actual ones propping up israel and perpetuating the palestinian conflict which are an extreme right wing sect of the gop and the israeli government. If you actually retarget away from "zionists" to specific names, and start referring to the military industrial complex properly, and president bush who listened to said complex, then you go from conspiracy theorist to woke motherfucker. That said 9/11 did happen it did kill a bunch of people, it was muslims who did it, it was a terrorist act, and jet fuel burning for hours does soften steel beams. We were right to hunt osama bin laden to the ends of the earth but he is dead now, so we should have gone home when that happened.
2. You are absolutely correct in questioning who defines terrorism. Anyone in the government with the authority to do so can arbitrarily add you to the terrorist list for any reason they want. Even if it was because you pissed them off by shooting off fireworks in your backyard, you can be added to the list. 
3. Good call on pulling out all money from everything and going off grid. I would add a caveat: Open up a massive line of unsecured credit, and transfer it out to your main account and use it to buy bitcoin. Pay on the line for a few months, and then claim bankruptcy. This is a good way to stick it to the surveillance state in a parting jab, but its gonna ruin your credit. However, since your off grid, that doesn't matter much anyway now does it?
4. You are right that banks are not worth it. See point 3 in how to stick it to them. However, when you leave make sure to diversify to other projects not just btc. Keep some money in all projects that have a good shot at scalability or stealing bitcoin's lightning in the future. Projects to watch out for would be iota, eth, ada, and possibly neo. Do keep the majority of your coin in btc though. You do not need more than 10% of your investment in another currency to completely hedge your main btc stack against a flippening of that currency.

Its a rough guestimate of how much btc has been outright lost. As long as it is in a wallet that sent transactions, it can be stolen by quantum attack. Quantum would be best at raiding cold storage.

I'm mad about trump for the following reasons: 
1. He cheated in the election by colluding with multiple foreign powers. He conducted foreign policy diplomacy with Russia while Obama was president, and in return he got money from foreign governments funnelled through the NRA to him. He sold us out in order to win, and he has kept selling out american interests and foreign leverage for personal profit. Leaving Syria when Isis is still alive and kicking is a prime example.
2. He has put the future of humanity at risk by trashing the Paris climate accords. It was our best shot get China to comply with lowering emissions. The consensus of 95% of all scientists is that the next 12-20 years are the last chance before global warming becomes global heating. The jetstream is already fucked up. The north pole used to be solid, its now liquid. Hurricanes are getting worse, just like was predicted 30 years ago. Those same predictions detail killing heatwaves of 125*+ by 2050 at our current rate. 
3. Of less importance in the grand scheme of geopolitics and life, he has divided america, and has promoted racial hatred and hatred based on religion. We have always had racial tensions, but trump has enflamed them. In addition his cruelty to immigrants through family separation (and sometimes losing the children) is evil. Its the definition of genocide under the law definition of the crime. It tarnishes Americas name, and takes the moral high ground from us. 
To add insult to injury is lesser trespasses like the emoluments, cheating on his wife with pornstars and then lying about it and paying hushmoney, not taking decisive action when Russians hack united states powerplants, and not censuring Saudi Arabia over kashoggis live butchering.

Can we not link that ugly as sin red hat with bitcoin? Redhats symbolize everything bitcoin was meant to stop. They symbolize worship in a centralized figure, centralized control, corporate greed, fucking the poor whil giving to the rich, and extreme tackiness. Redhats suck.

Eth has PoS coming up, and Iota is not currently possible to attack (due to coordinator milestones) and once iota rolls out decentralized coordinators as a constellation along with their coordicide, they will still be just as secure as btc is. 
And both iota and eth have future planning. However, I think that iota is thinking farther down the line than either btc or eth is. What happens when quantum computing comes out? Iota is already quantum proof. BTC and eth are not.

Read Mueller's court filings. That's not theory.
And on the scientific front, those "theories" have been remarkably accurate. 
And at this point, your definition of theory also fits the idea that the sun rising tomorrow is a  theory. Just because your worldview doesn't match actual reality doesn't make reality a theory.

EOS doesn't deserve to be on the ship. Iota and Eth are not shitcoins. 
Shitcoin definition:  
1. Centralization, and the ability to reverse transactions or freeze funds. Technically, iota could freeze funds currently, but doing so would freeze their entire network. EOS by this definition is a shitcoin due to its block producers reversing transactions and buying votes. It is also why ripple is a shitcoin.
2. Lack of innovation. Take a few variables of btc flip a couple numbers and poof you have yourselves a shitcoin! Prime examples are dogecoin and litecoin. Bleck. 
3. have you been 51% attacked? If you can be 51% attacked, you're a shitcoin. For examples of that, take a look at verge and vertcoin. 
Replace EOS with something else. Zcash is a good contender. Bitcoin has its place as store of value, iota is the king of microtransactions, eth is where the smart contracts are at and zcash is the name of the game in privacy.

Best way to go about it is to buy lots of coins, then set sells on them for other coins at prespecified prices. Rinse/repeat. Always make sure to stick with relatively stable trading pairs. A good example of a stable trading pair is both doge/btc and iota/eth. The market will ALWAYS give you your price sooner or later.

1. How the fuck is the tax man going to catch you? They are already shortstaffed, and plus, there are plenty of countries where cryptos aren't taxed. If you don't have enough crypto to consider moving to a country with friendly crypto taxation, and renouncing united states (o whatever other citizenship you are) you are doing crypto wrong. 
2. Paying taxes to the united states government is IMMORAL. 54 cents out of every dollar goes to bomb school kids in yemen, murder people in africa, and prop up oil barons in the middle east via mass murder. Oh, and its all done quid pro quo to cover up journalist deaths like jamal kashoggis death. You are more of a patriot if you donated your money to the local animal shelter or homeless shelter than if you give a dime of it to the united states government. 
3. How the fuck is the tax man going to catch you if you are trading unverified on platforms that don't require you to be verified? VPN once a week, check your trades and away you go. Of course, don't keep all your eggs in one basket, trade on multiple platforms, do due diligence, all that jazz. Taxman cannot catch you if you follow proper blockchain anonymity. Always cut your trail with monero. Always make sure your exchange does not verify you. 
4. Even if you do want to pay taxes and such, congress has a pending bill for crypto that includes an exception for crypto-&gt; crypto trades. :O
5. If you do decide to cash out into the bank, your dumb. You SPEND your crypto. NEver cash out into dollars. Ever. And, if you do, just claim your profits/losses there. No IRS agent will go after that. The potential money is too small. 
6. If your one of the guys that paid taxes and then got gigantic losses in 2017 and ended up owing more in taxes than you had in crypto, go to the tax dude right now and ask about refiling your taxes. Because you can file your 2017 losses into the previous years gains to cancel them all out, and maybe even collect some tax $$$. 
But seriously. If you can, do stiff the tax man. The faster america goes broke, the fast the dollar goes to 0. The faster the bitcoin goes to infinity as world reserve currency. The faster that the warmongering murderers for hire known as the us military stops murdering civilians and little children, and selling their weapons to others who do as well.

Anything evoking trumpism really shouldn't be associated with btc. Trumpism is about power and control by trump, not decentralized choice and free will. Would you associate the soviet flag or the nazi flag with btc? I wouldn't, and associating the red hats with btc is the same. Btc represents so much more and to associate it with an ideology that 50% of americans and over 50% of the rest of the world loathes is divisive, and is bad for bitcoin.

Bitcoin is really hard to truly value. However, my rule of thumb for valuing cryptocurrency is as follows:   
1. We know that at least 50% of the population needs some aspect of crypto (immune to bank freezing, low fees, cross country transfers, privacy etc)
2. I am going to discount the drug using population because their primary need is privacy, and audit protection, and backtracking resistance. 
3. I am going to include Low income workers who send remittances, and rich people who are at risk of potential US sanctions, legal actions, etc. 
4. I am going to include all divorcing husbands who have wives who want to take as much property they can in a lawsuit. 
So, the real value of btc is the aggregate float value. The divorce rate per year in the united states is 3.2 citizens per 1000 people. Current global population is 7.7 billion. That is  **7,700,000,000,000** people. 24640000000 people get divorced every year. 12320000000 (half of them) are the partner with the money, wanting to save some of their assets from a divorce preceding. The average net worth of a person in the US is  $301,000. Now, worldwide that is of course much lower. But, lets run the numbers with the us pop of  **327,797,944.**  1048953 people per year are getting divorces. 524476 of them are the richer half. If those people used bitcoins to deny the courts power in asset forfeiture, they would add the following number of dollars to the bitcoin ecosystem: 157,867,489,830. That is before speculation and people refusing to sell at lower prices drives market cap up. Current market cap is  $59,523,372,025. However, this money wouldn't just hit bitcoin, it would splash over into alts as well. Especially alts offering privacy and secrecy like monero and zcash.  
But that is just divorcing adults. And converting 100% of net worth into btc (like houses and cars) just isn't feasible. They just aren't liquid enough, and what I am painting is an overly rosy picture if you want to just take the US into account. But remember, the US is a drop in the bucket. We have divorces in china and russia and europe as well, and although they might not be as wealthy as the average american... there are far more of them.   
In short, bitcoin is very very undervalued just from the asset protection from court seizure market. And that is one of the things I like about bitcoin. It allows a defendant who has properly prepared to whether a legal storm to deny the requests of a judge, and take the knowledge of how to unlock the bitcoins with them to the grave. The only way to extract he bitcoin from an uncooperative person is to torture them and force them to give it up, or somehow do some sort of brain scan that can pick up words floating around in the brain.

Except these other ideologies have much smaller tents. The moment you bring trumpism into the bitcoin tent, the people from mexico who are using btc as a form of cross border remittance payment start to have second thoughts about btc. As soon as you bring communists in, rich people think twice about dumping alot of their wealth into btc. The moment you invite nazis in, everyone who is jewish or black starts to think twice. These ideologies are poisonous, and we should keep btc free from them. Even if it was a joke about wanting to buy the hat for a dollar, its in very poor taste. Trumpism has its place in the world with a certain group of americans, but its not a be all end all unto itself like bitcoin is.
