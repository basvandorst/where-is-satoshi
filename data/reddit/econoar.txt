If it's legal to do in China as some claim (even past the Jan 31st deadline) then why is BTCChina committing company suicide by not accepting bank deposits?  Really hoping for a legit answer on this.

This is the worst news of the week for bitcoin.  US regulations coming, probably including crackdown on US banks dealing with foreign exchanges due to AML laws and consumer protection.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:05:52
One with "goxxed" too...
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:49:22
Lol, good story bro.  Considering you couldn't send coins from Gox to Stamp.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:14:41
I'd like to know this too. However the non spike up for Huobi still seems suspicious. And compare to BBTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:54:56
 IRC if you are into trading.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:05:51
I'm sure Gox is fine.  Just down due to media speculation.  Mark is currently recovering the coins from his cat.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:51:04
You can't use 1 indicator to judge a price increase.  For example, the StochRSI's would tell us we are overbought and should be going down.
Also the MACD is subject to what time frame you are trading.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:45:06
There isn't one
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:01:46
Price speculation is the worst thing that happened to true BTC believers. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:59:35
They are actually in 200+ now and the smallest are 40btc
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:34:36
Best bargin since 750!
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:42:30
Deflation alone does not cause value to rise.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:56:57
This wouldn't prove anything.  Coins can be traded back and forth an unlimited amount of times, and the whole point is these exchanges could be fractional reserve banking, letting people trade what they don't have.
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:50:12
What's max leverage in margin?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:26:00
So this would then confirm the 750k coins lost.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:18:51
0.74 is worth 2.10 in 2014 dollars.  So about 3x.  Not the 166x most in this subreddit expect
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:39:42
This is some pretty drastic optimism by GMaxwell.  There is a bankruptcy case taking place, it's not like Gox is going to just open the doors with a fraction of the Bitcoin they lost and start handing out coin.  This could take a lot of time still.  And what's to say this isn't Mark attempting to liquidate these for cash in the bankruptcy hearing and the splitting mechanism was just left on?
Also, this comment says Gox API shows all transactions on the network, so it could be BS. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:36:44
If you're actively watching the markets you can tell stamp is being manipulated up by a select few.  Constant giant buy walls put in place and any real volume up have been very large buys.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:16:53
This is a pretty awful article.  In fact, they are still taxing them and not letting banks handle them like the news the other day.  Trading platforms can exist however.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:07:45
My post is about the public image of bitcoin. Saying Gox will be forgotten faster than a drug exchange pretty much proves my entire point about this community right now. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:08:23
I think this is probably good news
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:53:04
Yup. Great news that they confirmed they lost 850k btc. I'm sure you're GOXBTC are just weeks away!!!

r/bitcoinmarkets will offer you a more unbiased/trading view
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:31:17
Most daunting part of the article to me:
Banks will be prohibited from handling them, and securities firms will be barred from brokering Bitcoin trades.
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:58:26
Especially when it's pulling the BTC price around on a leash
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:50:48
It hasn't blown past 600-1200 highs, hah.  Just saying to say history repeats itself on a tradeable asset is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:00:18
This doesn't really answer the question of why Huobi's traffic is actually down since Mid-December.  Nor does it answer why it beats Stamp volume by 6x when Stamp has 8x the traffic.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:59:23
They pumped all weekend to gain coin.  Did you not see the 10k wall on stamp last night?
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:49:31
Wouldn't this mean one central authority is running the operation then?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:43:29
I can't possibly think of worse investment advise than telling someone a trade-able asset will always return to its previous high.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:59:11
Again it's irrelevant what mtgox might mean to us true bitcoin users. Just wait for the press today. Right or wrong that's what drives people away.

Swarm City is doing this on Ethereum: 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:50:30
Well you can make slower and more expensive money transfers than venmo so that must have some value.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:09:34
Well it's one use case of swarm city, but agreed their site isn't very good.

Use wolfram alpha.  Here you go 
Just put in your public wallet code followed by "qr code" and it'll give you the QR.  Click on larger image then download it and upload it to the image on the gear you want.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:37:07
Good point.  What are the top ones?  Just curious, new to the sub.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:32:44
I'll look into it!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:52:18
open to better price suggestions

Being compared to cell phone innovation...good start.
