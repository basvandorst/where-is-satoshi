Stop using that link as reference. You can also ask turbo tax who's had Bitcoin guidelines since 2014, trading between cryptos is not a like kind exchange. Never has been. So you might as well declare them... NOW WITH THAT SAID... If you put it in binance, and assuming you didn't submit an ID there, there's really no proof of you trading your coins for another one. Only proof is you sent it to binance, period. Could it be your brother you "gifted" them to, and he did the trading then he'll cash them in a year for you? Sure. That's plausible

@_date: 2018-01-29 02:56:45
Real-life examples by Anyone working on any of these? ��
 Tokens
I have a carwash and I want to give out "John's CarwashCoin" - 1 Carwashcoin is valid for a wash of your car. I can emit 1000 of these and give them away or sell them. People could even "trade" them, but that won't be of much use. If they came to my carwash they could pay the Carwashcoin back to me, and get a washed car. This is preferred above a Magneticcard system or a "10 Rides Card" - those are easy to counterfeit and I need equipment to handle it. Now I can just run it on the blockchain.
 festival coins
When running a music festival in the future you could use Colored Coins as a token for buying drinks. Emit a few thousand tokens "Good for 1 Beer/Wine" and sell them at the entrance. People can now pay Colored Coins instead of those little plastic tokens you see at festivals.
(This would however, lead to drunk people using a Colored Coin wallet, so might not work just yet without wallets that require no action from the user at all)
 tokens
A casino can emit millions of tokens, worth what they say it does. People can buy and trade them back in, without the need to buy plastic tokens or possible counterfeits possible. Zap the QR at the one-armed-bandit and play.
 at supermarkets
Wallmart could emit WallMartCoins that would give 1% discount for every 1000 Coins on a sale. No need to print, lick, cut out, etc. - And Wallmart does not have to check for people that try to scam the system. It also works online (The great feature of Bitcoin - zero-trust tokens).
 overtime ledger for payroll
A company could emit "Overtime Coins" for every hour an employee works outside of normal business hours. Those could be interchangeable (on the Company Intranet) to buy a days off, or to trade in for money (Through Payroll - payed out at the rate of the employee).

Mostly it's the fees. Coinbase charges 2% per sell/buy(?), that's not flat rate. At Gdax, you can set a limit buy and not pay anything at all and sell at 0.25% fee only or even less. Check their schedule for the updated figures. Coinbase is a wallet service, with additional buy/sell feature convenience; Gdax is their proper exchange service website where you can also do margin trading

Secondly, since it takes a very long time for drugs to be approved, would it be much better if you converge with medical practitioners, hospitals, private institutions to expedite the process of testing?

I'm sorry but I would HAVE to disagree, CNBC's at the first few minutes, already has captured what Bitcoin is. I just saw your documentary on YouTube and there was not even an explicit mention that Bitcoin is also a public ledger for verifying digitized contracts, not just a network, not just a currency or commodity, which CNBC has done, as much as I HATE to admit it. One VC guy there in your piece even said there are no fees in BTC transactions which is false. Not always, but true, sending BTC may have mining fees attached to it albeit minimal. 
Still, there were a lot of info to be learnt from your version. I just wished it was a bit more polished because it really reminded me of a college project we did cram when I was 18, just extended a lengthy amount of time of people's mugs talking.
Again the objective of making a "documentary" to begin with is to ENGAGE the audience. I was so engaged in yours but the audience is supposed to be the ones who know little about the technology since you said yourself you knew nothing and/or was very skeptical about Bitcoin to begin with.

Yes, I do know that for a fact for a long time.

major retailer? After that, the fee is FLAT RATE of 30-3000$, and NOT 2% PER TRANSACTION like credit cards. If the merchant sells an item worth USD1,000,000, the credit card payments processor will take out $20,000 on top of that, instead of a FLAT yearly fee that BitPay charges.

 Thank you for articulating this so very well, but I'm so scared of using coldcard, even the documentation seems a little too advanced for my stupid brain - like, does the coldcard require a separate wallet software for you to send your coins like electrum? You can't bring your coins straight from an exchange then send directly to your coldcard? Did I get it right? Also I keep reading the term partial signing over and over but I don't seem to get what it is. I feel so lost. Thank you you gave me hope

The real comparison op should be deciding on:
A. The chances of paying off their debt eventually via a regular job; or
B. the chances of doubling or even tripling (200-300%!!!) investments in 5-10yrs when S&amp;P 500 only yields ~16% return in 5 years with the help of quantitative easing at that
B is much much more improbable to happen in our lifetime ever again and must be taken as such rare opportunity. Scenario A, op can settle in regular income in due time. So unless the loan is a very bad high interest, op shouldn't be paying that all off today.

If you immediately sold your coins within a year of buying them, you need to report regardless of the amount. That's considered taxable income tax. If you hodled for more than a year, and then you sold, you can \*probably\* get away not reporting but only if it were less than around 38k after adding your earned income for the year. If the total exceeds, you otherwise really have to report.

Here's the answer from Quora: Mr. Soros did what hedge fund managers do when they see an opportunity— he took a chance, and he profited from it. But as I said, he was NOT the only one, nor was he even the biggest one.
The Asian Financial Crisis began with problems in Thailand, as you probably know, and the problems then spread throughout Asia. Signs of trouble began around July 1997, a time when there was an economic bubble (that ultimately burst). It was also a time when the Thai banks had decided to no longer peg their currency (the baht) to the US dollar. After they stopped doing that, problems began to emerge, as the baht began to depreciate. (I am not an economist, so if I am getting any of the terminology wrong, I apologize.) A wave of speculation had begun to take place, not just against the baht but against other Asian currencies— in Indonesia and Malaysia, to cite two examples. Their currencies also depreciated.
Meanwhile, keeping an eye on this were various hedge fund managers, including Mr. Soros, who was the head of the Quantum Fund at that time. According to sources I’ve read, he made a large bet (close to $1 billion) against the baht; but what is puzzling to me is that as I said, he was NOT the only hedge fund manager to do this, and not even the one who did the most speculating. For example, a hedge fund manager named Julian Robertson of the Tiger Fund made an even larger bet (nearly $3 billion against the baht). Both men profited, as did several others, yet only Mr. Soros was blamed. Economists have said the crisis was actually exacerbated (made worse) by the reactions of the bank of Thailand, which even ran out of money, and seemed to have no strategy to stabilize their currency. But to this day, some people still believe it was Mr. Soros and only Mr. Soros who was the cause of the crisis. This does not seem to be true.

This was a little emotional to see after Bitcoin believers have been called crazy, loony, Ponzi schemers for years and years. It just seems more "legitimate" now that the naysayers are halfway there

Actually what I've been reviewing is it's AAPL driving the DJIA, s&amp;p 500 and consequently the rest of the market most of the time. When it's down, it shows significantly in the index.

I would take a library website reference. You linked a partisan blog

How does blockstrem make money aside from licensing out ln nodes in the future? Coinbase it's pretty obvious but relatively smaller companies I'm very curious

So the best move is to transfer the old ones to a SegWit address immediately..?

Did he commit something illegal

Margin trading with bitcoin. Riskception. They have bwalls.

I would just buy at dump because for every sell I would need to incur higher taxes if it's less than a year, assuming gains...

Make the B and outlines in Bitcoin less desaturated imo. Amazing design
@_date: 2015-11-05 05:53:39
You're not considering the very high CGT if you dump &lt;1 year. This will simply keep fluctuating and eventually go back up again a year from now.
