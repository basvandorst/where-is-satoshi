Thanks, I wasn't too sure about that. Good luck to you !

It's not a meme unless it goes viral, which it won't. It's just you on a rainy night in San Fransisco recording yourself while "picking trash off the street"
I'm new to crypto and, as it happens, I like to go on video game boards sometimes, despite the console warriors and their petty fanboyism. The crypto community is A LOT worse than those *kids*. Posts like yours largely contribute to that. Think about it please.

I'll be buying around 300€ so that's a pretty small amount yeah. I don't really know if I should expect fees around 5€ or 20€ or 50€+, if you know what I mean.

OK I realize that now, thanks for replying

It's true and from what I've read since last night most users are happy with Revolut but I've slept on it and I'm just going to stick to my initial plan, which was to add funds to my exchange via SEPA. I know it's slow and I might miss a relatively low price on BTC but I'm just not ready to invest right now. I don't think later is too late so I will just wait for another dip. 
If I didn't think BTC couldn't go higher than the current ATH, I wouldn't be investing at all so I believe there will be other opportunities, which I will be ready for.
Also, I'd like to avoid yet another third party as much as I can. SEPA is slow but free and safe which are more important to me.

Now that I think about it, Bitstamp doesn't allow deposits from third parties so I don't think Revolut would work. 
I might make a SEPA transfer, it takes time but it's free...
Bitstamp charges 8% for a deposit by credit card I think. It could be worth it this time though. I was thinking about sending a small amount for testing and then around 300€. 8% on that doesn't hurt a lot.

Thanks a lot for taking the time, it's a very helpful post. I've never heard of Revolut but I'm definitely going to check it out, it could be a cheap solution. I'd pretty much heard that the fees (on the Bitcoin network) were so high right now that it wasn't really worth buying BTC despite the dip. It was very confusing.
Bitstamp is the exchange I use. They're based in the EU, solid enough I believe and they have standard rates. I'm going to read on Revolut now and see  what I can I do.
It's a steep learning curve indeed and I appreciate your help, cheers !

Revolut seems great but I think I'll use a debit card for 250€ on Bitstamp in case I need funds in the coming days. And I'll send some with a SEPA later, for another deposit. I don't want to rush things anyway, especially because I want to see if the dip goes lower.

Ah...yes ! it rings a bell now that you say it :)

Can I ask you something ? I want to buy Bitcoin for the first time (from Euro to Bitcoin), I'll be sending my SEPA deposit on the exchange tomorrow. But I read buying BTC like that costs too much atm, because of the fees, is this true ? Also, transactions apparently take a long time currently and I'm worried that, even if I buy BTC at a low price, I'll end up with a significantly higher price once the transaction goes through. Is that a possibility ?
