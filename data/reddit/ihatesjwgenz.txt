Are you still conflating a retort with mindless dribble?
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:54:12
Look who is wrong again.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:54:21
What the hell are ***true believers.***
Are they people who rely on faith, and faith alone?

Yet both chains have the same blocks, transactions, accounts, up until the fork, so they both came from your "original" bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:57:21
When you actually have an argument and information to back it up, make it.
...any day now.

Yeah I guess vitalik buterin doesn't understand bitcoin.
**“Right now, bitcoin transactions cost five cents [in USD], which is fine right now because Paypal fees are even stupider but the internet of money should not cost more than five cents per transaction. It is kind of absurd.”**

Lol, LTC IS A SCAM, ETH IS A SCAM, BCH IS A SCAM!
Just some history from "bitcoin" maximalist.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:05:06
100% loved by this very same now very different community from 2009~2017

So, after each fork, they renamed it? After each upgrade, they started over?
What exactly is bitcoin to you, because your definition isn't exactly in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:25:56
Enough with the memes maximalist.
Let's actually have a real discussion for once.
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:18:09
It's not ready for scale, it still has bugs and routing to work out. The Devs have said this themselves.
If you think it's perfect, it's not. It will take a lot of work to make it scale for the next wave of users that is definitely coming.
If you can't take criticism then you have no hope of making it better, and if anything it could be better.
If you find this statement controversial, why don't you step back and examine your life.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:02:15
You didn't give one because your argument is baseless, and ideas are stupid.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:12:51
What exactly is keeping you from making money, or should I say serrrious money!
If BCH was stopping you, then so is every other coin. That isn't true, and what exactly is death? It's still working and being traded. Just keep lying to yourself if that is all you need to convince yourself what reality is.
Be as ignorant as you want, because the best performing coin in 2019 will not be bitcoin.

Because there was not consensus on scaling. This is the point of decentralized development and platforms. It's truly a freedom you don't understand, but is needed in a world where special interest may want to take over currency like fiat. Central banks control the Dollar, and because of it, it has lost 95% of it's value. They control man by artfully taking advantage of scarcities of money. It's why you work to pay debt. If you didn't then you couldn't afford the things you need. Just another form of servitude, peasant, or should I say, slave.
If there is ever an entity that is trying to control development and direction without the networks desire or permission, then it should be your freedom to consent to where the network goes development wise. If enough people agree, then you have another form of a nearly identical coin.
People like you don't understand the economics at hand.
If core owned bitcoin, the government could just force core to develop it like fiat so that banks could once again, control currency and crash the market for their benefit.
It's sad seeing people like you trying to control bitcoin.
...Only here can you get down voted for stating facts that bitcoin was created to free people from banks. Forking is a feature, not a flaw.
I can't wait till Lightning Nodes get regulated as money exchangers.
When you're peer to peer, no regulation can stop a network that works around the world, unless the world is ruled by one government.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:12:14
Then why don't you call bitcoin, bitcore. Since there is no bitcoin, pal.
What's your disorder?
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:06:46
Depends on what you call the fork. It's all about perspective. Is a fork a major code change? Is a fork relatively little code change. Does anyone know what the fork is or can tell right away? What if it takes years to determine what the fork is?
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:49:17


Your definition of bitcoin... what is bitcoin? What defines it?
Do you care to enlighten us?
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:37:56
There is no spoon... Or corporation for that matter.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:24:02
Let's see if you still sing the same tune by july 2019.
It's not over till it's over and the chain still exist despite your best efforts to demoralize people.
If you feel the need to attack it, it's not dead is it?
Fake consensus by ignorant pricks means nothing to no one.
There is a reason conversation over there is much more thought provoking and stimulating.
All r/bitcoin is, is a circle jerk and meme fest.
Get on with it and wipe off your chests.
