Today, August 10th, 2016, at 16:00:00 UTC we will be enabling additional platform features as we continue to restore service after the incident on August 2nd. Exchange trading will be enabled for all currencies and pairs, while deposits and withdrawals will be enabled for BTC, ETC, ETH, and USD – with LTC and Tether to follow shortly thereafter. Exchange trading will also be enabled for the BFX token on pairs BFXUSD and BFXBTC. We are working on tokenizing BFX via the Omni Layer to allow withdrawals for the BFX token, but we are still working out some protocol level details. Please note that U.S. residents will only be able to sell—not buy—BFX tokens at this time. Terms for the BFX token are available here. Requirements for token transfers are here. Parameters for assigning Margin Trading will be re-enabled for non-U.S. residents later this week.
 
In the past week, we have taken significant steps to ensure that we can restore service in a secure environment. We have added additional platform and infrastructure security checks; regenerated all encrypted services, including wallets, security tokens, and passwords; moved funds to multisig cold storage; re-evaluated all third-party integrations; performed a comprehensive system audit in order to identify vulnerabilities; and, rebuilt our entire platform on new infrastructure.
 
Please note that we have invalidated all deposit addresses that were generated before August 9 19:00:00 UTC for all cryptocurrencies except Tether USDT. Please do not deposit to these older addresses as this will cause substantial delay in deposit processing. All deposit addresses now shown on the site or generated by the API are the new addresses. Please be sure to use these new deposit addresses when depositing cryptocurrencies.
 
We are aware that many questions remain and we intend to discuss the theft, the distribution of losses, and our recovery plan in follow-up announcements. We are trying to be as transparent as we can be while we continue to try to make the best of a terrible situation. We regret the loss that took place, but we continue to remain confident in Bitcoin, the trading community, and our plan to compensate our customers. As always, we remain open to constructive commentary and suggestions from all sides.

Interim Announcement
August 6, 2016
 
Following the theft on August 2nd, the Bitfinex team has been working tirelessly towards bringing the platform back online in a secure and controlled manner. We have finalized the accounting of losses incurred and are currently coordinating strategic plans for compensating customers.
 
We intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations. We appreciate that our customers and the public want this handled quickly, but it needs to be done a way in which all assets are secure and immune from vulnerabilities. Every resource is being leveraged to make that happen in a safe and optimal way.
 
As disclosed in earlier announcements, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers have been cancelled and all financed positions have been settled. Exact settlement prices were published on August 3rd.
 
After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses.
 
We are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out. In the meantime, In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customer’s discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged—upon the creditor’s request and Bitfinex’s acceptance—for shares of iFinex Inc. We are still sorting out many details on this; we will post further updates in the coming days.
 
Thank you for your continued patience and for the many generous offers of support that we have received over the last several days. Notwithstanding this attack, we continue to believe in the possibilities associated with bitcoin. We will continue to update our customers and the public as and when we can.

I will try reddit gold if I can collect enough tip :D
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:24:53
If I have more bits, I will donate through ChangeTip for sure :)
This process will be important for bitcoin adaptation.

Thank you! There are no major shops accept bitcoin yet. People just want to earn money from bitcoin with trading, they don't want to use..

@_date: 2014-11-06 14:41:28
Yes, I know changetip gives $50 for finding a bug but I want to learn user-user.

Nothing, first crash than mooon :) I don't think any theory behind it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:59:53
Tip can be good idea, at least 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-08 18:50:44
litetip? How can I collect them, via change tip?
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:24:12
changetip is awesome, I always read reddit but I've just signed up now because of changetip.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:55:47

@_date: 2014-11-08 23:42:07

@_date: 2014-11-07 00:05:14
One more time I checked bitcoin price and saw $350, I can go to sleep, I know it will rise tomorrow again.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:35:13
Satoshi Spam is problem of course but 100bits can be high for some users, I think 25 bits more suitable.
Don't worry about fake tipping, moderator will ban or they will do something like that. We have another topic for fake tipping. Also I know you have lots of works but iOS and Android App can be huge news. Another topic is mail notification, when I sent tip I receive mail notification but when I collect tip, there is no notification. I think small bug appears.
Keep up your good work, we love you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 09:41:41

Yes I have interactions with academics but believe or not they don't know bitcoin very well. I will talk 4 people tomorrow for bitcoin documentary in Istanbul, we opened topic on bitcointalk. I will inform you later, promise.
On the other hand " What does "Tip Error" Mean?"
The most likely cause is a tip amount greater than the maximum we allow. The default limit right now is $25 per tip.
I was shocked when I saw 92582.23 bits but I could not collect them because of change tip limit :(
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:36:33

From reddit rules;
sometimes bad timing, a bad title, or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting story to fail to get noticed. Feel free to post something again if you feel that the earlier posting didn't get the attention it deserved and you think you can do better.
I think, maybe I can second chance..
