Whatever you do make sure to get verified BEFORE you send them any coins. They all pull all sort of crap to non verified ppl

This sucks if true...
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:07:19
funny haha
Yeah kraken website is so unreliable I don't know why they don't invest more money to get it fixed?

I made two deposits 3 days ago and the third one gets declined like yours without my bank seeing it. Tried different cards and the same issue. Bitstamp hasn't responded to my email yet.

@_date: 2017-12-16 03:23:20

Use gemini they credit your USD instantly and can get BTC right away but it takes 4-5 days confirmation of the ACH then you will be able to withdraw your btc.

$10 of bitcoin in 2014 is worth more than $400 today! insane!

@_date: 2017-12-28 22:59:02
it been that price for at least 2 weeks. What are you taking about?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:44
Buying the dip too. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:03:03
fees. Also you talking about is called arbitrage.

Stay away from hitbtc. They seem to have a lot of issues lately.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:13
true. I'm buying this $16k dip and got a little bit for $15k yesterday.
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:34:53
They got asked the question and they answered. It's not like they go out of their way to say they don't like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:13:41
I didn't have any crypto there or money thanks my lucky stars.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:05:52
My account was closed this week and they couldnt provide me with a reason. No I did not send money to dark web or did anything remotely illegal with it. I bough at the ath in december and sold at the all time low in april and lost lot of money and never bought any bitcoint back so I dont know why they banned me to be honest. Fuck coinbase

Never used the service outside usa in the 3 years ive had my account open.
It was verified account with high limits never and issue depositing or withdrawing money
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:44:37
This 100%. My account got closed with nothing remotely criminal going on.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:42:43
 Account was inactive for more than a year before I bought my first btc and just a month and a half later after I sold all my btc it got closed? Logged in to check prices almost every day for the past 6 months. Inactivity has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2018-06-17 04:14:01
Never sent btc to any gambling site. Only places I sent btc where to gemini and kraken. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:00:36
probably :D
But sucks tho. I honestly don't know why they closed my account
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:31:46
Never used vpn services in my life
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:15:16
No shady stuff on my account and it got closed. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:44:56
