Is there such thing as a bitcoin ATM where you can send the machine your BTC and withdraw USD?

I wonder why they haven't started up in the US yet? I can only imagine it's some anti-laundering laws.

As an online business owner, this is my biggest fear. This is also why I absolutely love bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. You NEVER have to deal with this rage inducing BS!
Did they give you any word on your $20,000 reserve they placed? Will they give it back or will they hold it for months on end?

You are basically giving them your money as long as they agree to give it back whenever you ask *IF certain conditions which are outlined in the terms are met. Want to have some nightmares? Read any bank's Terms and Conditions contract. It'll take you a few hours but you'll be glad you did it. Cliffs- they can do whatever the fuck they want and you can't really do much about it. Every action they take is covered, in depth, in the Terms. This is one of the biggest selling points of Cryptocurrency for me, IMO. Don't have to deal with that BS.

Only reddit would miss the entire point of the post and rage at an 8th grader for thinking abortion is bad. 
I thought the paper was good, especially for an 8th grader.

I never said they didn't need to have money to cover your deposit. What I was saying was that once you give them the money it becomes their money until you ask for it back again. That come directly from the terms and conditions of my contract with a bank that I just went over with my lawyer not even 2 months ago.

This will be amazing! I really like the design and have been wanting to implement something similar on my site for a while now.
