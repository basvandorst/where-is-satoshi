And now, in today's episode of "things I've heard before"...

I've been DCA-ing for a few weeks now and the amount of ease it's given me is staggering. It's miles less stressful than fretting over when exactly to make a large investment in either direction.

It's a new initiative he's trying called "late voting".

The rainbow is a completely artificial thing that someone layered on top of the price graph in such a way that most of the price line is within the rainbow. The price is not "following" the rainbow; if the line leaves the rainbow, then the rainbow is no longer providing an accurate set of bounds for the price.
tldr I'd say the thing you heard was right.

How many times have we said this before?
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:43:54
That's a very big if.

I'm in the same position. Withdrawal request last Monday, still nothing. I created a ticket on their support site and haven't got a reply from there, either.

They're Exponential Moving Averages: [Investopedia has the lowdown.](
Specifically, they're [21-period and 9-period]( EMAs. Blue is the 21, yellow is the 9.

*All* of the bugs? That's a pretty bold claim.

I bought €2500 worth of btc when the price was €104, and despite the fact that the price is now a LOT lower, I don't regret it. Why? Because I didn't invest what I couldn't afford to lose. Follow the same advice - if it literally *wouldn't matter* if all your money got wiped, then go for it.

Got this from the semi-official [bitcoin-24 help board](

How about you don't try to nag someone into doing something they don't want to? "No but you really should" when they've already said they're not interested isn't going to make you or the community look very good. Move on, and at some point in the future, they might hear of it again, remember they heard it somewhere before, and pay more attention this time.

Just wanted to add my experience - I withdrew on the 29th. Still nothing.

Mt.Gox is close to hitting $250. I assume everyone wants a screenshot.

I emailed their lawyers yesterday afternoon and got my BTC back this morning. Hooray!

Having read [the recent update]( I can confirm that I've got my bitcoins back by firing an email out to his lawyer.
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:25:41
I sent all my bitcoins to the wallet listed and now they're not in my wallet any more. Can anyone help me get them back?
@_date: 2013-08-19 08:23:51
Bitcoin is still risky. However, if you can afford to lose 10% of your income - go for it. I would strongly advise having an escape plan if it all goes south (again), though.

Man, the dollar has fallen in value a *lot*.
