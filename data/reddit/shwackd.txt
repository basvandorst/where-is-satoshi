Am I free to keep my finances private?

Rest assured that all the money flowing to Coinbase is coming through my one fiat bank. All this money plus the money for the rest of my life and they still aren't asking any questions. Only Coinbase. hmmmm. I respect how you included "by whatever their standards are."  Thank you for this, it is becoming clear to me that Coinbase's standards are way more strict than any fiat bank's. I'm never going back.

I guess you're right. Sorry I called you an authority lover you don't really seem like one I was just mad. You seem like somebody who is just used to this and has moved on like I need to. Thank you for the advice I will try my best to not let this anger me.

I was only using them to buy. I do not store coins online.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:29:00
They needed to ask me these questions before selling me the coins. You don't just sell something to somebody and then call them up later and ask them about their intentions. Imagine if guns were sold like this?

Thank you.  I suppose the problem I have is that my regular bank DID move all the same money Coinbase saw, plus more for all my life activities. This bank asked me nothing.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:28:50
I don't know. I haven't bought much in the past few months so I was surprised to get the e-mail. Still they should have asked me before the fact.

I haven't used the Bitcoins for anything. They are still where they always have been. Asking me what I'm using my money for is an invasion of my privacy, maybe not yours. Now that you know I haven't used Bitcoins for hookers and blow can you help me? Or was that just a figure of speech?
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:51:12
Thank you. That's how I feel.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:36:48
If you read what I wrote you would note that my regular fiat bank is not this invasive. Coinbase is going above and beyond at the expense of my privacy. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:26:59
I mentioned not even my fiat bank is this invasive you asshat.
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:30:43
As if that's the only other option.  I think you're being silly. I closed my account and will get them somewhere else.  Why do you put quotes around the word "privacy."  Are you suggesting it's not a real thing?  You sound like an authority loving boot licker. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 06:03:05
I haven't bought hundreds, but they are all in the same place they've always been. Why they are asking me this now is beyond me. I appreciate the fact that you wouldn't get upset about it. I guess I am more private than most.
@_date: 2015-12-21 02:12:36
Thank you Dude-Lebowski

Exactly. Thank you brickfrog2

cptmcclain, the issue is that they sold me something and then asked me about my intentions for it way later. Can you imagine if guns were sold like this?  Sure we'll sell you a gun as long as we can call you up 2 months later and ask you what you plan to do with it. There's a reason you have to jump through the hoops first. Coinbase does not relieve any of its responsibility by asking for customer intentions after the fact. If they want to mitigate their responsibility they need to do their due diligence before making the sale. Simple as that. That's how it works with other sensitive purchases such as weapons and prescription drugs. The pharmacy doesn't call you up after you got home and ask you for your prescription.

It's been 9 business days, still no card in the mail.

Great analogy given the nation just went crazy over their holiday cups.

I did not answer the survey. And yes, they  are invading my privacy by asking the questions.
@_date: 2015-12-23 07:52:06
They just sent me another letter saying if I didn't fill out the survey they would close my account within 3 days.
@_date: 2015-12-21 05:24:13
I appreciate your opinion, but I could have done without the "uh." What was the "uh" meant to signify? You sound like an authority lover. Maybe you would rather opt for the less fortunate of two scenarios but I wouldn't opt for either. When it comes to politics do you automatically vote for the lesser of two evils too? I would rather they don't ask or spy on me. It's sad that you assume people must choose.
@_date: 2015-12-21 05:17:48
I've only used my SHIFT card. So they should know exactly when, where, and on what type of merchant I used my BTC. This is just invasive bullshit and it lost them a customer.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:57:43
Of those, have any required you to fill out a survey about what you intend to do with your money in order to keep your account?
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:18:13
Bitcoin has opened doors for people that were previously closed.  At least you admit we have a way to go, but the fact that the world isn't Disneyland yet doesn't mean we can't celebrate positive things. Bitcoin's recent developments are huge and I think you're being slightly negative.

Other altcoins will exist along side Bitcoin and that is a good thing. Competition breeds healthy markets.

Did you really think the point of this post was to highlight how rare and hard it is to obtain a Zimbabwe $100 trillion note?   Did the importance of a Bitcoin Embassy being discussed in a magazine just magically slip past you? I am amazed.

"first and foremost, I am not here to promote the site..." stopped reading immediately as you are most obviously here to promote some site.

This is completely wrong. It's very hard to do this with Bitcoin and much easier with cash -- like Luke said.
