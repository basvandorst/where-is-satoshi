Yoooo I would HIGHLY recommend increasing your cache size in the bitcoin core settings. If your computer can handle it, it speeds up initial block sync significantly. I took 20 days to sync and then learned about this, and was able to do a full re-sync in about 8 hours.
Go to the Bitcoin Core tab -&gt; Preferences. Then set "Size of database cache" to something higher. The max is 16384 MB i believe. You'll have to close the application and reopen it for this to take effect.  I maxed out the cache for the initial sync, then put it back to 4000 once i was fully synced.
Edit: one downside is if the app has been running for a while with a large dbcache size, then it can take a \*long\* time to shut down. It's taken mine up to 30 mins to shut down after i did the resync. Makes sense as I believe it is transferring 16GB worth of data from the cache to its permanent storage place. Worth it imo for speeding up the initial sync.

A lot of the actual people who work at banks buy bitcoin on the side

alternative ending: there is no bubble and the bitcoin infrastructure remains, forever steadily increasing in value. And like the DNA in our human cells, Bitcoin becomes a genetic code of trust that powers the Great Organism

the reward has been claimed!
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:02:04
for those who want to learn how this was claimed, check out this site: [
\- enter the 12 words into the "Bip39 Mnemonic" field
\- the hint "path emzero nested" means Derivation Path m/0, and address type "P2WPKH nested in P2SH" (this is also called "wrapped segwit"
\- scroll down to the "Derivation Path" tab and select the "Bip141" Tab
\- for "Bip32 Derivation path" enter "m"
\- for "Script Semantics" select "P2WPKH nested in P2SH"
\- scroll down and you'll see the path "m/0" corresponds to the address "[38FYk8pTJUCCwhQaqUA6sBPhvtwf7xsJZo](

bitcoin is money

Alternatively, would sell for land/property, or an income-producing asset or business

This guy was very outspoken against JP Morgan's manipulation in the metals market, and very outspoken against wall st corruption in general

personally I just buy some BTC with every paycheck. still have usd in a checking account for short term funds. I see BTC as my long term store of wealth. With the amount of total debt in government money around the world and slowing economic growth, I just don’t see a way out other than printing money and inflation.

If it went to 100k quickly and I thought a correction was coming, I’d probably sell a chunk of BTC for gold and silver bullion
