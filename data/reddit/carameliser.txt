Too volatile bud. No one knows what it's going to do. It could go to 30k by the end of the year and crash straight after. If I shorted it and they asked me to buy the shares at a loss in the mean time, I'd be fucked.
Safest way is to stay out of it.

But the curve of people adopting the internet was never exponential? How could it be? 
Someone that doesn't understand maths, the world, or the term 'exponential' like you really shouldn't be fucking around with high risk/high reward investments.

If anyone is being paid to comment it will be PR agencies employed by wallstreet giants who encourage buying whilst they're pumping and preparing to dump. And then when the crash comes there will be paid people on here encouraging dumping so that the price is as low as possible for when they start pumping again.

LOL how you look at that graph and don't see a bubble is beyond me. Price is rising exponentially right now. It's so unsustainable and it will come down, big time.

Well no, because the risk is SO high with shorting something as volatile as bitcoin. Even higher risk than investing in it.
Why? Because when you short, if the stock you shorted increases in value, the bank can force you to pay for that difference.
Whereas just buying a risky stock you'll never owe more money than you initially put in. 
So shorting something that can jump 7k in a week is clearly a bad idea. Even though we know the crash is coming, we don't know if it's tomorrow, next week, or a month away. And the price could increase to 30k in that time. IN which case someone that shorted will have their life ruined.

Because they up suicide rates. A lot. Especially for heat of the moment stuff like a losing-your-life-savings-surprise.
If there are no guns about you've got to find some train tracks or a bridge or something. Seeing all the nature and getting out in the sun would probably improve your move and discourage you from killing yourself by the time you found a good bridge or set of train tracks. And the shock wears off.

So when was the last time bills increased 70% in value in a week?
Why are you even comparing bitcoin to some generic currency when BC clearly isn't a functional currency. People are treating it as a high reward stock and not a currency.
Paper bills are backed by the activity in an economy and the constant exchanging of those paper bills, that is why the value is relatively stable and why people use it as a means of exchange. What is Bitcoin backed by? Absolutely nothing.
It's Tulip Speculation all over again. Buying bitcoin makes sense because you know next week the price will double again. But nothing is driving this rise in value, the only value it has is that people perceive it as a good investment. And when people inevitably start cashing out the whole rotten structure will collapse.

What's your murder rate compared to Europe? What's your rate of cops killing citizens compared to Europe?
Yeh mate enjoy your obscene death rates from guns. 


What? This doesn't even make sense. Think about the grades you got in middle school and then realise that your opinion on anything is totally worthless bud.

Can you not see the impending dump by wall street? Prices have reached new levels of volatility. This guy has performed perfectly. Got in and got out before peak volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:16
It could crash tomorrow at 20k or it could crash next month at 100k. Who knows when the bubble will burst. But I know that in the interim they can ask for your money back and that if they do that and BC has risen another 1000%, then you're fucked. 
Basically, it's so volatile that it's not a good idea to touch it with a 10 foot pole at this point.

People pump their life savings into this shit. People with debts to pay and financial obligations. And suddenly the giant lump of money they put into this scheme, the only hope they had to rid themselves of debt, is poofed into nothingness. And now they're worse off than they were before...
Easy access to guns, I see why people do it in the heat of the moment.

Bitcoin has been getting pumped by big players. It's become unstable and it will get dumped soon. It's gone from $10k to 17k in a week. And it has no tangible value, it's a textbook speculation bubble. Time to cash out before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:16:38
Yes... it's just like the dotcom bubble.
The dotcom bubble wasn't the end of the internet or tech companies. It was just a bubble that over inflated the value of tech companies whilst the internet was still maturing as a medium for transfer of goods and services.
Bitcoin is set up for a huge fall. It will fall to less than 1k. It's not the end of bitcoin or crypto. But a lot people, especially recent investors, are going to lose a lot of money when BC starts getting dumped by the big buyers that have driven the price up in the first place.
And a lot of people like the mugs in this thread, that have invested instead of paying student loans, and still refuse to cash out, will probably end up killing themselves when all that money they invested is worth 5% what they thought it was.

People are buying bitcoin because they see it like a stock. A commodity to be bought and sold unto itself. Not as a currency to be used as a tool to buy and sell actual goods and services.
You've admitted its speculation and that it's not a currency. And who cares what you personally think about selling/using bitcoin. Vast majority see it as buying/selling, not using.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:15
Well it's a bubble so they're buying *to* sell. Not buying and selling.
