What day?

I would like to know this as well.

This contradicts what you had been stating before.

How much Bitfinex capital and profits are being contributed to the socialization of losses?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:52:54
I expect Bitfinex to make up any difference between the total amount lost and the socialized losses with Bitfinex capital.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:03:58
I understand your point but I think that is a false distinction. Money is property.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:23:16
Good points. I was thinking of the BFX tokens as being equity/dividend paying.

Opening the site is "read only" and just to check post hack balances.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:38:56
I asked this elsewhere with no answer: Will Bitfinex be taking any steps to compensate losses not covered via socialization?

"The trading of BFX tokens may be restricted for US customers." They have no value for US customers then.

Including ETH, ETC and USD (non-margin lent USD)?
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:02:13
Equity doesn't mean voting rights. They could issue non-voting, dividend paying equity. Is the token like a bond, with a set maturity and value? Is it like an IOU, with no set maturity, only a future value? Is it like a stock, with or without dividend payments? These are outstanding questions.

Looks like not 5 August 2016 EST.

So if I had $100 lent out as margin funding before the hack I would have $64 left?
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:17:10
I would think the tokens would have a price in ETH, BTC, USD, etc.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:02:59
I would expect Bitfinex to make up as much of the losses they can from their own capital. I would expect equity for losses beyond that. It's immoral for Bitfinex to continue financially unaffected while your customers take haircuts because you didn't provide a secure platform.
