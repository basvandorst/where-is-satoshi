OH MY GOD! ANARCHISTS?
Are they the bomb throwing kind or the "bore you to death with political theory" kinds of anarchists?
I do NOT want anarchists anywhere near Bitcoin. I like getting fucked by the IRS and Bank Of America waaaay too much.

That will change with the next generation. Bitcoin was designed to unwind until at least 2140.

Your bitcoins are **never** safe unless you have them in your possession.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:16:24
The same was said of the internet, the web and bit torrent. 
Ha ha.

The MSM is about to engage in the dirtiest game they can play: BITCOIN 24/7! People will be sick of Bitcoin and will hate hearing about it by June.

I held my nose and joined the foundation to support development. That was the choice given.
I have other ways of promoting and supporting Bitcoin that may help the community. Only time will tell if all of our collective efforts will benefit or hurt us as a community and a network.

Bitcoin has already passed "fad" stage.
What else do you have? Is that it?
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:05:48


This up and down shit is a result of using a decentralized currency in a centralized power structure. 
Bitcoin doesn't need the mainstream to succeed. The mainstream will find itself conforming to Bitcoin in the next couple of years. ;)

You should tell that to the small, non-IT industry businesses that use Bitpay now.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:33:56


That's what Bitpay and similar services are for. They shield the merchant from Bitcoin's volatility.

Don't keep your bitcoins or your money on exchanges at all. They'll end up getting "hacked".
Bitcoin is about Bitcoin, not about exchanges. Get bitcoins however you can, exchanges included, but never keep your btc on someone else's wallet.

Crashes make no difference to the functioning of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin will always have value. 
My interest is in getting Bitcoin out to the world, not on people wanting to make a profit from Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is only worth a dollar, we'll just be getting more to conduct our business. That would probably drive the perceived value up.
Bitcoin will be better off when we find a new way to trade them that doesn't involve the Stone Age method of throwing everything in a big, central pile at an exchange.

Let it crash. I love cheap coins.

Buy gold instead. Sell gold for cash in small quantities at local coin shops. There's no need to bother the IRS. It would be a very inefficient use of taxpayer dollars to report such small amounts. They're very busy taxing large banks and corporations. 
The safest means of buying PMs with bitcoins that I know of:

You obviously don't understand how Bitpay works.
Merchants only care about the transactional value of Bitcoin at the time of purchase. Bitpay guarantees the value of Bitcoin for 15 minutes so that the customer and the merchant are protected during the time of the sale.

Hence, hiring a service like Bitpay.
If Bitcoin scares people more than Ben Bernanke does, that's fine with me. It allows me to collect cheap coins until people realize that Bitcoin is superior to fiat, volatile or not.
People are slow to learn. Bitcoin's not going anywhere so it'll be there when they figure it out.

Consistency is a trait.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:55:33
You're "high risk" because they risk not making quite as much money on you as they thought they would so they'll find another mark.
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:43:34


Then why does the Bitcoin foundation and this PR project exist? They're trying to lead.
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:21:36


Just as long as you know the risk of having your btc/cash "hacked" from the exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:45:00
Let them sell. Cheap coins for stronger hands!
