Thank you!!!

I’ve been thinking about this lately as well. I keep trying to think of ways to make money, and realize I’ve made more on BTC than any side gig I could have done in the past few months. 
We are excited when we get a 20% return on conventional investments, and I’m at @ a 90% return on BTC rn.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:51:58
Why even bother with BTC then, TOM?
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:57:04
I bought at $3500-$4000 &amp; I’m holding steady. Also, I’m probably older than all of you :)

I have a Ledger Nano. My son helped me out :)
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:20:06
This is the time frame I bought. I am very happy I did, and wish I would have bought more.

Thank you so much for posting this information! I'm just getting started, and trying to learn all I can. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

I think it is for a bag of roasted beans.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:54:13
I think that makes three of us!  LOL

Does it say somewhere that I'm from Trinity? I'm not, but preettty close!

One of the best song ever!
@_date: 2019-08-31 03:10:47
Oh, LOL! I was checking my profile to see what it says about me haha
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:46:24
It says a serious financial crisis would hurt BTC. I thought the opposite. I thought if the stock market crashes, BTC would benefit. I guess I’m wrong bc I’ve been watching to see if it rises with the big drops the past couple of days, and nothing so far.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:17:55
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:20:20
Right?? I didn’t think I needed to clarify that.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:22:03
For sure. There is no way anyone here would pay $12 for a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:31:37
I’m on a road trip, so can’t watch the news today. Just keep asking Siri about the price every ten minutes LOL
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:45:45
I didn’t like it at all. I’m sick of the way MSM covers Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:35:31
I think it’s both.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:21:45
Which one? There are several with that in the title.

@_date: 2019-06-26 20:39:59
OMG!! WTH
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:38:16
I see. Thanks. Yes, I can understand this now that I finally have a good amount of profit. I’ve been rethinking my strategy all day. It is certainly tempting to sell to pay for some things I would like to get taken care of. My initial goal was to hold for a few years no matter what. (I didn’t invest more than I can afford to lose).  Now I am also thinking of other strategies. It’s pretty fun for me right now, as it is for everyone else I’m sure. I’m no whale, but I’m pretty proud of my choice so far ;)

@_date: 2019-06-27 22:31:40
Thanks, that’s the one I started watching :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:42:21
May The Lord open.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:30:09
Wonder if the media will be talking about this today?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:24:24
Mom here. Thank you very much!!
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:05:06
Thank you for these links!
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:59:46
I’ve gotten nothing done today, except eating everything in sight &amp; hitting refresh.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:43:34
WELL, HELLOOOO DOLLY!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:26:35
Why would they dump, when it’s going up like crazy?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:25:48
Just want y’all to know, I FELT that rollercoaster today.

Winklevii interview on CBS Sunday Morning today.

Me, but I'm delayed bc I was on the phone when it started.
@_date: 2019-04-16 21:23:45
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:07:24
I bet you are right!
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:51:06
Ok everybody, be cool &amp; act natural!
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:03:15
I keep showing the price to my hubs, who doesn’t get it. He’s feigning excitement. But I can’t stop giggling, even tho I’m sitting in the waiting room about to have a freaking epidural in my neck ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:40:10
I didn't think the story on 60 minutes was bad. They covered the past, and addressed the uncertainty of the future. I see that on this thread every day. I think people that want to take a chance will be purchasing some bitcoin, if they take the time to figure it out.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:07:33
My husband just got a call from some lady wanting to tell him about "Bitcoin Opportunities". Wow. Really pisses me off bc that is not going to help at all, only cause more skepticism.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:43:40
This was helpful to me, thanks everyone!
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:35:48
I like the positive energy I’m seeing today :)
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:49:55
Agree. I just think telemarketing scams will not help. I'm actually good with most commentary on BTC. The more people talk about it, the more it gets engrained in our minds as something solid.
