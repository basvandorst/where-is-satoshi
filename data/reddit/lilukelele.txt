Come on, it doesn't take a test to see that, for example, BIPs 148 and 149/8 are in essence a (deliberate?) chainsplit vulnerability, yet see which people were seemingly okay with them, even vouched for them:  Clearly there are deeper issues at play.
To anyone reading this: if you are even merely a decent developer and, more importantly, a sensible human being, but you felt deterred from working on a Bitcoin (BTC) full node client (there's more than one out there) thinking that the incumbent developers are some sort of gods, confusing their long experience with general wisdom, virtue or trustworthiness, please think again. These things are uncorrelated. Good work will find its place and will eventually be recognized. If your interests are aligned with the good of Bitcoin (BTC), please consider working on this or another Bitcoin full node client.

UASF wasn't about getting segwit, most people know this, even UASF scammers admit it. A normal soft fork with the voluntary participation of miners is what gets us segwit, like all soft forks before. UASF was really all about forking off, away from Bitcoin. "Force activation of Segwit" really means your UASF node forks off, like airdrops do. But it gets worse, it had no replay protection to work as an airdrop, so its users could lose their BTC. How could you believe their bullshit narrative?
Yes you are missing something. Once again I will post what their (failed) plan was (from 


















@_date: 2018-08-01 13:51:47
It was a scam software, you sucker (or are you one of the scammers yourself?). Ironically, now you can thank the miners for letting you keep your bitcoins after running that scam software.
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:18:07






Most (admittedly not all) of the UASF shills said that UASF was a way to get segwit. Do you agree that those particular shills were dishonest? Why insist on a bit if it doesn't do shit to get you to segwit?


If they really wanted this to happen then why didn't they do a normal soft fork, only lowering the 95% to 51% or whatever instead. If 51% of the miners switched to it then the old chain dies, and if they didn't then absolutely NOTHING happens. Quite superior, wouldn't you say? How didn't anyone think of it /s
But they didn't do that. Clearly it wasn't about getting segwit with more than half of the miners. It was all about forking off with less than half of the miners.


Okay, so UASF miners lose their work because they trusted the shills who promised that it won't happen? And therefore the remaining miners win more bitcoins, because the difficulty goes lower. Isn't that already a little... scammy? Each block was worth something like $100k. I mean, perhaps people were planning different scams. Perhaps some scammers wanted to do one scam, some wanted to do another scam, some wanted to see just any of the scams which are enabled by a UASF. Do you think that none of the scammers (we know they are many) saw the scam opportunities and jumped on the bandwagon (if they didn't create the bandwagon themselves) just to scam others?


That is true. I'm getting contradicting statements from UASF supporters about this though. Luke Daesh jr. (who wrote the damn thing and was saying shit like "there's no risk") was saying that he intends to stay on the 148 chain no matter what. No matter the hashpower. He would never go back to the original Bitcoin. As you may remember, he literally said he would start an altcoin (his words) with a hard fork for lower difficulty, different proof of work algo (his wet dream) and so on (


Now remember that apart from the 148 UASF they also had the 149 UASF. It was actually their first idea (before it was a BIP) and they were astroturfing it just as much as 148 later on. Like 90% of the accounts posting favourable things about UASF would switch between shilling for 149 and 148 several times, in unison. Exceptions being Luke's and Gregory Maxwell's primary accounts which were insisting on 148 and 149, respectively. Now, 149 differs in a crucial way. All this time to activate segwit would be gone. 149 would activate segwit straight away without giving users any indication if successful and safe or not. It's like, let's blind the users and not let them know whether the miners are going to go along with it or not. So with 149 the steps are a little different: 1; then 2; then at activation date nothing interesting happens and it goes straight to step 5; then a miner (any miner!) gets the first segwit coins from a 149 sucker and this causes the fork, so steps 3 and 6 happen at the same time, which is more stealthy; and finally 7. The coin stealing scam looks a lot more dangerous and likely the 149 way, doesn't it? Now why do you think people were shilling for 149? Tell me.


Realistically this whole UASF coin stealing scam plan had very little chance of success, especially the 148 version. That doesn't mean that evil people weren't hoping that it happened and that they weren't working towards it. For at least a few weeks in the beginning the original UASF scammers thought they might just pull it off, especially the 149 version. Other scammers piled in looking for ways to profit.
Do you consider this particular step with "segwit party! Let's use segwit now!" an implausible thing to attempt though? Shills were promising that you can get segwit with this software. They never said "this software doesn't really do shit about getting segwit, it doesn't do anything good over what a normal soft fork can do, but it can fail disastrously". They were advertising UASF as a magic that gets you segwit and some of them wanted people to use segwit with it, knowing that it was like telling them to throw away their money. But they had already conditioned fools (however few) to believe that it was safe. And the "segwit party! Let's use segwit now!" kind of happened after the real segwit activation, so it's not implausible that they'd say that. Successfully fooling people is another matter.


Do tell me. What is your understanding of that? Who do you think wanted there to be a UASF and what did they want to happen? What do you think that they were thinking? What about Luke, Greg, etc?

a.k.a. USAF (United Scammers Airdrop Farce) a.k.a. UASF
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:33:37










The plan of the UASF scam was the following:
1. Get users to install UASF with the fake promise that it is safe and they will be able to use segwit if they do.
2. Talk shit to the miners, antagonize them, try to get them to oppose segwit or not activate it yet. (this is where the scammers failed because the miners activated segwit)
3. If enough miners don't activate segwit in time then UASF nodes automatically fork off into a chain of their own.
4. Get the UASF chain to an activation of segwit (while the BTC chain does not activate segwit yet).
5. Shill on social media shit like "let's have a segwit party! Let's use segwit now! Shuffle all your coins through it!!1". Some suckers use segwit.
6. Things get more knotty here. To get more technical see here:  Basically, get those segwit transactions, drop the witness part (remember, it's called segregated witness), change the destination address to your own address and replay this changed transaction on the BTC chain. Remember, the BTC chain does not enforce segwit yet! Only the UASF chain enforces segwit! So the changed transactions are valid on the BTC chain. As a BTC miner you can get the suckers BTC that way. Probably all miners would be doing this.
7. When there are no more suckers to rob miners can activate segwit on the BTC chain the normal way. The UASF chain is now pointless (might as well abandon it and return to BTC).

Why not reject the shitfork proposals and refuse to prop them up at all, from the start? Why not let them die on their own, see what happens, and if the forkcoins are really about to happen and live on, work on splitting the coins only then? Or why not try to implement built-in replay protection at the protocol level, within a fork proposal itself, rather than trying to make a flawed proposal work just for you? Why not have sensible proposals from the start, or try to improve them, rather than shill for proposals which you know to be flawed, and then let others get burned while your company profits at their expense? Why not let other users be protected, or at least informed?
I would understand trying to facilitate selling shitforks, but why enable that only for a company that seems to cheer on and pump every shitfork? It doesn't look like BitGo was ever concerned with preventing shitforks or even not helping them, but quite the opposite, and you were part of that.

I just jumped into the conversation, but alright, so you are saying that DesignerAccount, CosmicHemorroid and the other authority-crybabies are neither cypherpunks or bitcoin people (said "Very cypherpunk/bitcoin of you"). That may be true but how would you know? Who's to say anyway? What's a bitcoin person? Suppose a speculator happens to be long Bitcoin. Is he a bitcoin person? If he has been around a lot but happens to be neutral or short, is he still a bitcoin person? If he's doing things detrimental to bitcoin out of stupidity while still believing in bitcoin, is he a bitcoin person? Is any person who follows bitcoin matters and often comments on them a bitcoin person? I'm just wondering how a bitcoin person should be defined.
Regardless, if those people really are not cypherpunk/bitcoin people then comment retains its sarcasm. Whether because their action is not really cypherpunk/bitcoin-person-like, or because they are simply not really cypherpunk/bitcoin people, the sarcasm is there. When you are pointing out something conflicting, usually you can find more than one possible conflict within it. That's normal. It's just reaffirming the point that there is definitely some conflict there.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:45:40


I think that *you* started an argument against a strawman. You misjudged what had and didn't have in mind with that short comment.
Reading your previous comment, this is what I get as part of your assumptions (please correct me if I'm wrong):
You seem to assume that someone seeking help from a government does jack shit to protect Bitcoin. It didn't seem to have crossed your mind that it could possibly only do more harm than good in the long run.
And these assumptions I disagree with. I think that seeking help from a government can at best do nothing to protect Bitcoin, and at worst be counterproductive. Did you consider the possibility that might have likewise considered government involvement as a negative thing?
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:53:26
I read and re-read your comments and it turns out we mostly agree, and there are a lot of common understandings, but there are also some points which I think you might be missing.


That's right, but there's consequences for those *people* who facilitate it. It's not about bitcoin, it's about behaving in society. Those who get authorities involved, no matter how, can't be trusted for certain things. Cooperating with authorities shows that those people have some faith and trust in those authorities. Well, I have none, therefore: 1. I wouldn't give those people anything that I don't want to end up in the hands/control of authorities because those people decided to pass it on to the authorities; and 2. I wouldn't accept anything from them which may be coming from authorities who are trying to have some influence. I wouldn't trust them for anything I can't verify.
I believe that there are many like me who think the same way and know what's the right attitude towards those authority-believers and statists.
There may be nothing we can do about the fact that there will be government involvement, but I believe that there are things at least some of us can, and would want to do about the people who facilitate and do the involvement. Like **name them and shame them**, for starters. In this thread those people would be **and In other instances authority involvement has been advocated, solicited or threatened by: **Gregory Maxwell, Luke Dashjr, Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Tone Vays** (ask me if you need help finding their public statements proving this) among many many others. 
When their names are mentioned like that, and their positive attitude towards governments and other authorities is made known, people like me know what to do. We want to at least distance ourselves from them (this is also what did) and, once again, shame them, adjust our attitude towards them, among other things. I'd like to learn who the authority-believers and statists are.


You are talking about different kinds of involvement, with opposing goals. I'm saying that no matter what kind of authority involvement some people are advocating or seeking, we should name and shame those people. Their motivations or intentions don't matter. I don't care about their short term "victories" or "achievements" either. I get the incentives, and I know that *someone* is going to do these things anyway, but they shouldn't expect other people to thank them for it, commend them for it, join them or trust them.

You can choose to do business with whichever miner. You can choose the cheapest Bitcoin miner; you can choose a shitcoin for their miners; you can create your own forkcoin shitcoin with whatever miners, or even no miners (like UASF); or you can choose to send your transactions only to your most favored miner and tell them not to broadcast it before they mine a block with it. Plenty of choices (be they all dumb, except the first one). But your statement is bullshit. If you want to buy a particular piece of real estate or art, you have no choice of seller. No two properties or works of art are the same. Saying that this is not a market is dumb.
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:04:51
Lol you had like 0.2% of hashpower. Hard to make a loss as a BTC chain miner if UASF users are giving you all their BTC for free. The UASF chain would either be DOA, or be rekt once fools started using segwit on it. No difficulty adjustment or replay protection either.
But you didn't read my other comment. They had the power to keep the chain together *and* block segwit, if they wanted to. Like just doing another soft fork to disable segwit. They have the power to do that any time, even now (they don't want to though). You can't change shit if the majority of the miners don't agree. Better learn to get along with them.

Wow I wonder how feels about you equating UASF and segwit, which he created.


Only this is true, of all that you just said.

This is wrong and I explained why in another comment:

Yeah? That choice very much suggests that the original intent was different, perhaps malicious. That's dishonesty, at least. Promoting something which doesn't do as advertised. Potentially causing innocent people to lose their money. You are partly responsible for that, you know.


No, that's not merely risky, that's suicidal. Why do it? To attract attention? To get whining rights to play the victim?
You could get that guarantee of safe segwit use if you wanted it, but you chose not to. You insisted on the UASF idea.


Here -  - no empty blocks. Just protecting UASF suckers from forking off and/or losing their bitcoins.


So you created a contentious fake soft fork which creates alt shit fork scam coins. Genius.


Yeah, and shooting oneself in the head can hurt you, but this *can*^1 be non-fatal.
We are talking about UASF, not a normal soft fork.
^1 but most likely won't. It's inadvisable.


Great game theory, especially the part where users of segwit on 148Coin practically donate their BTC for the miners to mine the competing BTC chain. That should teach them miners!


Only if miners didn't know or care about what's going on. They could invalidate the UASF blocks or do double UASF to protect themselves.


That possibility existed on the UASF chain in case a double UASF was done.


So you are admitting that you caused hazards for miners and others. It's not okay to do that, you know. You are a criminal. It's not okay to threaten them either, even if your threat is fake. It's not okay to attack them even if they have good defensive measures. And no, you have not yet admitted to knowing all the risks and definite harms to innocent victims that were talked about.






We know for a fact that several people lied about UASF. I'm sure about several fraudsters. They didn't want segwit so much as they wanted to steal bitcoins, cause a chainsplit, cause chaos to push a PoW change shitcoin, manipulate prices or do other schemes. Innocent ignorant people probably got sucked in too, so called useful idiots. You making such generalizations:


about things you can't possibly know to be true tells me that you're not being sincere.


You have homework to do yourself. Here's just one example - Daesh jr. lying and making it appear that UASF was an update from Core - 


Once again, UASF advertisements omitted the part where you'd lose your BTC if you used segwit.
But assuming miners wanted to block segwit they could do that easy and safe with double UASF rather than empty blocks.


In other words, fud. Yet another Hearnia.
I'm guessing you're probably another one of those still butthurt over being goxed too, even though gox being a fractional reserve scam was known since 2011 (if only you looked around and used common sense). Of course you want Bitcoin to burn. It's gonna be "broken" for you no matter what, because you don't have nearly enough of it.
I'm watching you UASF supporters and waiting for a confession. Either you were being naive, stupid, confused, ignorant, incompetent, or you were being malicious. Either way, you owe us a confession and an apology if you advertised UASF. You can't ever be trusted without going through that.

Your lies that "UASF is Bitcoin" or "UASF is SegWit" are only part of the problem, and I do blame you for it, and I ridicule the absurdity of it. You supported a forkcoin that was gonna let its users lose all their bitcoins and then fail miserably, leaving them with nothing.

So you're saying you'd be using segwit on your UASF 148 scamcoin fork of the blockchain. Okay. So you'd be making a gift to the miners, through the mechanism explained there (did you read the thing from the link?). And you're suggesting that this somehow pressured the miners? Okay. Maybe they didn't want to see you lose your bitcoins, out of misguided pity or something. Maybe there weren't enough of you to make it worthwhile for them. What do you think the reason was? Are you going to count on it next time? What if next time the majority of the miners would rather have your bitcoins instead?


You already are, seemingly for free, so you've driven the price to zero. I appreciate you revealing your evil mind, though.

@_date: 2018-02-10 17:52:03


If your intention really was to fork off to create a segwit chain, with or without majority hash power, 148 would be an illogical choice to attempt that. You seem to think that it would guarantee that the mining majority wouldn't be able to stop you from enabling and using segwit on your nodes (if the mining majority really wanted to, which I don't think they did) but you're wrong. They could stay on the same chain as your nodes by enforcing a soft fork of their own, disabling segwit, also known as "double UASF" (google it). Segwit would technically be "active" but no such transactions would be accepted. UASF would be a fake segwit. If you really wanted to be on a separate blockchain where you can do whatever you want, you might as well do a hard fork (I don't advise it).
But suppose that they let you fork off. 148 didn't even add replay protection of any kind. It wouldn't be a viable altcoin. You might have been okay with losing your BTC when using segwit on 148Coin, but others might not. It takes more than one to have a currency. If no one else wants to use segwit for fear of losing their BTC, then it's not really a "segwit chain". It's a never ever segwit chain. It's a fake segwit chain.


Look at the promises by the UASF author shaolinfry (whoever they are). He advertised it as a way to get segwit and it was a lie. He tried to manipulate exchanges and users to ignore the BTC chain. The UASF implementer, Daesh jr, said "there are no risks" and that was a lie. Gmax said 149 won't even cause a chainsplit even though the consensus rules are different, and that was lunacy at best, and fraud at worst, too (he knows how things work technically). The chainsplit, replay, coin loss, double UASF and so on were well known but were deliberately ignored. So many other people vouched for UASF and staked their reputations on it. They either didn't know wtf they were doing or they did know and were complicit to the fraud. At best, a UASF chain would be just another Bcash shitcoin, good only for small pumps and mostly for dumps. Meanwhile, BTC would be able to activate segwit at any time the normal way, with mining majority, with no fear of chainsplit or not being able to use segwit. In the end we got a real segwit activation, because 141 (normal segwit), not so much 148 (fake segwit), was widely deployed by users, and then over 80% of the miners agreed to enforce it.


Do you really know what everyone else intended to do? People scam others for bitcoins all the time. Why would UASF supporters lie in relation to UASF if it was not to scam others? Do you want me to find all the exact quotes where UASF supporters lie about UASF?
So now let's hear your reason for choosing to support 148 of all things. How do you think it would have worked out if the majority of the miners really didn't want to enable segwit anyway?
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:28:51
UASF was a scam to steal your Bitcoins. The way it worked was explained by those who warned you about it early on: 
Only idiots would consider such a scamcoin to be Bitcoin. Why don't you try to explain why you think UASF deserves credit for enabling segwit and how? See how it goes.

And then what? Not use segwit, ever? "Activate" but not really enable? So UASF 148 was actually about ***not*** being able to ever use segwit? Genius. At least you are admitting that it was all a lie. Cause if anyone under UASF ever put money in a segwit wallet, guess what, the other chain (reorged or not) would get mined again to get the free bitcoins and all normal nodes (non UASF) would accept that chain.
I'm glad we established that you are a shill for a forkcoin that was a fraud, a fake segwit coin.

Next thing you'll say is that it stems from that other one, "Bitcoin insert-shitfork-name-here". Why are you trying to remove the "BTC" reference from the name? Keep your shitforks to your playground please.

Liar. Daesh jr. did attempt to unilaterally change the consensus rules by creating and promoting UASF 148 (also known as fake segwit). You know this very well because you were promoting the same fraudulent fork.
He did it for dishonest purposes. He knew very well that there was a good chance that miners wouldn't have activated segwit by the trigger date, at which point UASF was gonna fail spectacularly, with much butthurt. And this is when he planned to launch the pow change shitcoin of his wet dreams, as the supposed solution to the problem that he himself created (of course he would have blamed the miners) as he laid it out himself -

This is as bad as calling the aborted UASF (also known as fake segwit) shitcoin "Bitcoin". In fact, Roger seemed to be emboldened by seeing certain people trying to get people to fork off with UASF to scam them, and Roger wanted to be first. Those fraudsters can't be trusted for anything.

This is good and necessary, and we need to go further. Fake satoshi is easy to spot, and not very dangerous. Bonus points for the ones able to spot more stealthy fraud attempts, such as the fake segwit coin-stealing fraud (hint: four letter word, starts with a 'U', ends with a 'F'). A coin-stealing fraud seems more dangerous, and so we better call out the people who attempted it and not let them scam again.

I hope that it makes amputation inevitable.

Trying to dictate consensus rules changes (what Luke Daesh jr. is doing, e.g. with the UASF 148 contentious fork, also known as "fake segwit") is itself an attempt to centralize Bitcoin. It's a futile attempt, as it doesn't work as advertised, but it nevertheless shows their evil intention. UASF by definition is an attempt to change the consensus rules without consensus. If it worked, then one would be able to change Bitcoin completely and turn it into anything they want, under their complete central control. Luke Daesh jr. wants to do this. In fact, he thought that he'd found some magical key to change Bitcoin to anything he wants, whatever other people do. He thought that he'd be able to push his stupid/evil ideas in case UASF 148 failed, too. He thought, or wanted other people to think, that he'd be in control whatever the miners did. Here's what he said -

First you say that people are too dumb to think of fractions and then you say that instead of teaching them we should change our unit to some cheap unit, like in a shitcoin, to accommodate their alleged stupidity? You're a scornful hypocrite.

Good. Call out the frauds. The same thing needs to happen to the people who pushed fake segwit ("UASF" 148 and 149) such as Samson Mow on that stage, and most (but not all) of the rest of the former and current Blockstream employees and contractors, BTCDrak, Eric Lombrozo, and many others. Fraud is fraud. Better fess up. Maybe not all of them knew what they were doing.

Yeah, but he heard similar-sounding accusations against himself (which were actually correct).

Yes, because what you mentioned has anything to do with what UASF actually does. Mind you, I'm talking about UASF, NOT real segwit, for which you should show some respect to the people who actually made it happen instead of trying to steal credit for it.


No one was against segwit except for the same old big block shills which no one cared about. Miners had publicly agreed years ago in Hong Kong to activate segwit exactly until the month in which they did activate it.


Speak for yourself. I'm a Bitcoin user and I wasn't fooled by this scam fork. I never ran that scam node software. Same with &gt;99% of us. Your scam really never caught on.
All that users needed to do and did was to run the real segwit client, which is Bitcoin Core, and let the miners activate segwit when they may. UASF looks more like an attempt to allure miners to disable or delay segwit, which failed, partly because not enough users like you were dumb enough to put their bitcoins up for grabs. You guys tried to insult miners, promise things to them and then betray them, allure miners with free bitcoins through a UASF fork and attacks, and all this failed to divert them from their course of activating the real segwit when they promised.


HAHAHA tell me how bitcoin works on a technical level, let's hear the idiotic misconceptions. According to you, consensus rules changes can be dictated by some random central idol figure and his few worshippers and then everyone else has no choice but to follow them. You speak of decentralization and then promote ideas of central planning for bitcoin, which don't work anyway, on a *technical level*. Hypocrite. But you know how bitcoin works on a *technical level*, right?


Right, and forking bitcoin into a shitcoin, as you attempted with UASF, is not part of this. *We* (apparently not you, that's why you said "they") want real segwit on the real bitcoin, not on some worthless forsaken shitcoin. You were forced not to fork off through UASF only because miners activated the real segwit on their own and your UASF shitcoin was ill conceived. Let that not hold you "hostage" to the bitcoin miners that you so hate. Go play with your other shitcoins and scamcoins and scam your other scammer buddies there and leave honest bitcoin users alone. Funny you try to insinuate that I'd be into some altcoin when you yourself attempted to create an altcoin with UASF and failed.

Okay, should we call it "x1000 lesser definite spam relative to satoshidice's arguable spam"? Would that make you happy? He's just a "no less than 1/1000 hypocrite".
