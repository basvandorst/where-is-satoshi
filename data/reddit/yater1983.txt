I’m dying right now wishing I had an extra 3k laying around so I could own a whole coin. I’m glad I got .25 but I’m greedy lol.

I’ve gone back and forth with them over this. They straight up quit trying. The last email I got asked for my credentials to validate my identity through their support team and and after I sent them everything nothing ever happened and I got no response. I emailed them since with no response. I just ended up selling back the little bit  I bought and I’m done with them.

At least I know she loves me for me. When we married I didn’t have shit.

I remember thinking that right before life slapped me with her. Lmao. Seriously. I was soo happy being single and then out of nowhere, here is the one woman you’ll actually leave the toilet seat down for.

And people who have nothing better to do than talk shit about strangers on the internet are the shining beacon of our society.

At this point if it didn’t work out I could never marry again.

It’s a little thing called marriage.
