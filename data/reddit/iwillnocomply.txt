I have to disagree here. The simplest and quickest way is sending your circle of friends/family a BTC wallet link (whichever you prefer) followed by dollar in BTC.

i'd do it with 100BTC.

goddamnit! i hoped the prices would stay low for another couple of weeks when i get my paycheck :P

my guess is that he's a comedian and some of what he says is a joke.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:40:43
not cool.

How far away are we from a multicoin wallet? all these wallets are driving me nuts.

oh snap, didn't know skateistan is accepting BTC! fuck yes.

everyone unsubscribe!

glad to see the list growing.

travel around the world for a year trying to only use BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:52:42
damn, that's some bullshit. the price varies sooooooooo much during that time.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:07:30
Done.

if that's true, what the fuck am i watching on fiatleak.com right now? they bought 12K coins in the last 2 hours.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:29:07
that's amazing. i hope they use it more often as bitcoins popularity increases. if it makes it to season 2, we might even have bitcoin as the default payment method in this series which is HUGE.

it's über frustrating to try to sell bitcoins and get cash. i wonder how long it takes before that is settled. it's the barrier keeping the masses from BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:03:59
I'm glad there's a discussion. I have a few coins from way back when and i'm holding on to them. My problem is the price spikes. If they occur every time someone just dumps money in, how can it ever be stable for a long enough term for it to be maintainable for business owners? one day you get 0.1 BTC which is 60$, the next day you get 0.07 for 60$ (rough examples). Are they all supposed to just go with the flow and hope that it keeps going up instead of down? or will they have to cash out their bitcoins every day because of the quick changes in price?

i would even consider CEX.IO over this deal... at the current difficulty your idea seems kinda strange.
2014 is the terrahash era and you're buying 20gh/s?
i hope you get some money back.

someone should combine kickstarter and bitcoin so that you could easily donate to a noble cause of your choice. if we get legit people who are vouched for to actually deliver the aid locally that would incredible.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:09:39
You guys are amazing for doing this. Thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:19:55
Anyone from europe perhaps? i would like to cash out on 1.3 BTC in euro's. I think it's probably considered a small sum, anyone try that the last few weeks?
Greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:44:26
thank you very much for your comment.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:27:53
i wish they would deliver to germany. i'd love a bbq burger.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:44:34
this starts next year... its a huge risk and probably a waste of money especially considering we're talking BFL here. your hope is basically that BTC will have a big increase in price. 
like many said, why not spend the 200$ on BTC on a low day?
