Last time I checked you aren’t automatic signed up to reddit when you purchase bitcoins. Regardless, I created a second account.

Even if you were paid in bitcoin you couldn’t survive with just bitcoin, even in New York.

Would it be wise to use a daily exchange rate for my customers if I were to use a currency exchange service.

When you use the banking system you must comply with the banking systems’ rules. Just like anything else in the world.
Nothing to do with bitcoin or the sellers, they’re just forced to comply with AML laws that have been put in place by nearly all governments.

That doesn’t make any sense. If an economy switched to cryptos they would still have to comply with AML laws that the government has set (just like you said). It has nothing to do with Visa, MasterCard, SWIFT, etc. It is purely set by the government to avoid fraudulent transactions and money laundering. 
Bitcoin is not above the law!

“Know your customer (alternatively know your client or 'KYC') is the process of a business verifying the identity of its clients and assessing potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship.”
Using a third party to Liquidity and exchange currency without verifying either party over a certain amount is against the law for any (firm&lt;&gt;customer or firm&lt;&gt;firm) transaction, bitcoin or not.
You give your pal £30 for some bitcoins isn’t a transaction where you need to comply with KYC as you already know your customer and just isn’t isn’t practical.
On the other hand, a business that’s main function is to exchange currency will have to comply with KYC and AML regulations. You would be insane to think a business that exchange currency without asking who you are. 
If you owned a bank and a customer asked to open an account without telling you who he is or where he lives?
Hell a customer doesn’t even have to comply with KYC until he deposits more than £$€200 with a prepaid card.
