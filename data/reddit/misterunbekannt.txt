I have a question. New to Cryptos, and i do not understand this hole Coinbase fiasco. As far as i know, they just now added the option to buy BCH on their exchange, which they announced they would do back in August. Why is this such a big problem? And is BCH not just BTC with a bigger blocksize to make it more scalable, which is basiclally the make or break it point in every single digital currency?

So let me get this straight. Some people make a bad investment, and then other very well off people should just pay the debt for them? wtf? Why?

Yeah, but 1mb block size is still super low. Mass adoption can not happen this way. Or i am totally wrong about that? Please correct me! But increasing the core technical aspect of BTC like segwit or Lightning seems like a lot, and wouldn't it require way more expenses in means of processing power etc... I mean, increasing the blocksize costs almost nothing, a 1TB hdd is like 50 bucks and cost of digital storage drops day to day...

Yeah, but the recipient is public right?
Lets say i make 3 BTC through some illegal service. The police knows about it, so it knows where the 3BTC are. On which account. Then i move the BTC around, from "hand to hand", but that is all public. They can just look it up, or have a script that tracks the original bitcoin address the 3BTC are in, and when they, or parts of them, get moved, they track that. So at some point, after a lot of hands changing, i buy something online for BTC. They can tell which company it is, because i would guess a big firm doesn't have a different bitcoin adress for every transaction. So they know that transaction X for product Y was paid for by the money they have been watching. Then they just contact the company and request the buyers information...
Just seems like it would be a really stupid idea to do something illegal with BTC. At least to the point until someone gets caught or there is a connection to your real self. Lets say someone big gets busted, and they know his BTC adress. Then they also know every BTC adress that has done business with him. Then they can just look up what those adresses did with their BTC. Maybe check every big company that takes BTC, cross reference their account with the account they got from someone they caught and get all the buyers info. I mean, with a bank at least you need a warant :-)!
Maybe i have a giant thinking error here, i suspect that is the case.

Well, the btc adress of the new owner is known though! So when, at some point, he buys something with BTC from that adress, that is connected to him. So he is not anonymous anymore.

Well, he was stupid... At least he was a stupid criminal and not very versed technically. His password for the biggest drug empire was "trytocrackthisnsa"!!!??? WTF? My trashmail account has a better password. Since he was imprisoned for running a website for people who liked to participate in free commerce, I don't see how you could send him to prison. If they would have charged him for "murder" or whatever, sure send him to prison. But they didn't. He ran a website, selling drugs. If he just wanted to make money, he should have got a degree in chemistry and sold drugs legally, and not a degree in physics and sell them without a licence. That was his real crime...
