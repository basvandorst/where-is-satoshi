Oh ok thanks forbthe ingo on the transac ID I had no idea. But I guess like mentionned it may due from this huge volume maybe. I will just wait a couple dsys untill I see it arrived on my bittrex account. But I CHOCK with the fees %50 transactions fees worst than a Bank wire!

First under your BTC on your Coinsquare you go to Fund change CAD for BTC click on Adress you will obtain your Wallet adress. Copy this Adress. Open your Coinbase after go to Send under BTC and Paste your Coinsquare BTC adress. Hit send, they might ask you to re-enter your password again. Start with a test first ,like send $5. Dot forget this take like 30min up to an hour for the funds to arrived. There is some Coinsquare/Coinbase videos on Youtube.

Man all Canadians are using Coinsquare (based in Toronto) simple,safe,easy to use! Opening an account takes couple days verification required Passport or Driver liscense and Utility bill or proof of residence. Direct deposit from your bank 2-3  days deposit snd withdraw. Have a look.
