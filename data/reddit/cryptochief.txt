Your not getting downvoted for making an honest and reasonable comment. All living beings tend to choose the path of least resistance.

Traditionally, high interest rates have incentivized people to save money in banks. When banks have more savings/capital, they can lend it out to business which use it for production purposes(buying equipment, building factories, etc). The more production there is in the economy, the cheaper goods are and the more people are willing to consume.

Thanks for so eloquently arguing the merits of saving over consumption :) Post saved.

Sounds like groupthink. If nobody wants to rock the boat, then I would have to assume they know in their heart of hearts what they're doing is insane. They value their status in life more than the type of world they live in and their children will grow up in. They're self-interest is so strong that it's to the point of being evil.

True but if you want to get extra cynical about it, what if it's not their money? What if it's laundered/sourced from printed money? The futures price impacts the spot price. If the spot price is pushed down, less people will be interested in buying that asset.

How would it fail to keep up with inflation if it's gone up almost 5 fold since 2000? It's not a horrible investment. It's a safe investment. I'm betting Bitcoin will appreciate far more in the coming decades but Bitcoin is way more speculative. In contrast, Gold is an element on the periodic table and will always have other uses besides being a traditional store of value. It's not going anywhere.

Sure asteroids are full of precious metals but they're also full of the other more common ones like iron and copper. I think all metals would be diluted just as much if asteroid mining was real. Would Bitcoins, securities, and other non-tangible assets benefit in such a scenario? I think so but they're not permanent.

So do the miners forever own the block they mined?  Why do the older coins have a higher transaction fee associated with them?
