Because no sane person would want to transact with such fees; and they won't go for LN, its a convoluted solution turing bitcoin itself in a settlement network. People would rather go back to fiat or other cryptocurrency


You might want to (re)read [this](
If every business is running a full node, it certainly is decentralized (contrary to populist disbelieve). But with this transaction limit (block size limit), that is not going to happen. LN+small blocks is a dangerous concoction straying from this original vision.
the so called core requirement for every end user to be able to run a full node is nonsensical, its not going to make things more secure and its crippling adoption and usability by limiting transactions.

and what is too low? 50ct? $1? you're gonna explain that to someone who is considering using bitcoin? It's embarrassing to say the least.
And what happens if everyone upped their fee? Higher fees don't allow or attract more transactions, a larger blocksize does.


It is instant over here when transfer between accounts of the same bank, or 1 office day to other bank. BTC is not winning a beauty contest here at all.
