buffet only owns one stock? Look up Berkshire hathaway its a diversified holding company that operates cross sector. If buffets gonna be your poster boy for this maybe learn about him. Also he didn’t get rich riding just one stock to the top.

I think your understating the potential upside. 2.5 years is a long time in cryptoville.

The second part of this statement is false. Of course you look for asymmetric return potential. Thats just a fancy way of saying invest in things with a big up side. But whats false is that the wealthy dont diversify. No one knows which investments will take off. So you need to spread your investments around.

For the vast majority putting all your eggs in one basket will keep you poor. But hey go put all your money in scratch tickets. They are a highly asymmetrical investment. Or you could chose two or three things like bitcoin, real-estate, some value stocks and you will do much better.

Automobiles and horses had to coexist on the same roadways, designed for horses, for many decades. It was hard for cars to run on these horse roads. Many weird hybrid cars were invented to deal with unsuitable roads. Like libra they exist to bridge the transition. Eventually we started building roads for cars and started a new paradigm.

They cant make more without taking in fiat. When you give them a unit of fiat there is a set amount of libra that is created based on an exchange rate they set. When you cash out to a fiat that libra is burned.

Get out you’re Che Guevara tshirts its another bitcoin “revolution” post. 
If bitcoin is successful it will be very boring from a geopolitical perspective. It will be based on convenience, efficiency and global standardization. Like the 1949 bar code revolution. I remember marching on washington demanding bar codes dont you?

You can continue to just use coinbase to buy then transfer to brd.
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:48:07
You can buy btc directly in brd. That will save you the tx fee if thats where your btc will get stored.
