Better to have slept through 5 years than have those coins become lost for all eternity. More bitcoins in circulation becomes more chances to have it reach others

There's no reason to hate an early adopter who hasn't come around to understand all the inner workings of Bitcoin. By encouraging early adopters to learn, you're helping more people engage with the network and promoting use, which is good for everyone. Any transaction you encourage users to perform allows coins to circulate around the network (let's not forget your mining fees effectively helps distribute Bitcoins fairly to everyone that has a stake in the system)
Or you can go the other route and use your superior knowledge to lie and cheat early adopters.(bch is a great example) Depends how you want to use your knowledge!

Keeping private keys safe for 5 years requires more than just blind luck, it is an effort that may not seem much to you but to the sleeper you'd have no idea if keeping those keys safe required effort or work
A sleeper's coin Could have easily ended up in a hard drive in a landfill, or stayed on Mt.gox, or belong to a hot wallet service that no longer works without backups, or a cold storage that isn't redeemed properly.  When you consider these factors, there's really not that many sleeper's in relation to the overall Bitcoin userbase.  They're more likely to be in the same numbers as early adopters because there's all sorts of possibilities of losing coins in the last 5 years, the difference between them being sleepers need to catch up on studying. (Have you considered those sleepers just haven't had a chance to produce the discipline to get to studying and practice?) It takes time and effort to learn about Bitcoin, a luxury not many people have. Perhaps a sleeper has been on the sidelines because he is waiting until the value of his couns raises enough so that he doesn't have to worry about his other obligations. After it reaches a threshold, then he can study Bitcoin all day. By having the faith Bitcoin will continue to succeed so many years ago to believe one-day this project will bring him to that point, does that decision not belong in the definition of an early adopter?
Either way, don't view them as lucky, there's no reason to be envious or jealous, help them, work together!
In short, helping others understand Bitcoin may not directly benefit you today but in the long run it'll benefit everyone. We'll all be grateful for your efforts, and you'll stop feeling like an asshole because you will have contributed to the success of Bitcoin through every mind you touch and inspire.

My answer is no to both I'm certainly not delusional to expect those business to continue. But in that world I'd still use Bitcoin and transact with anyone still willing to accept it to keep the network alive so it's important to get more people/businesses to accept it today rather than run the risk of a regulation coming down like that, that's why we're here, no?

I have an idea, why not take his Bitcoin onto a paper wallet and stick it to your wall "this bitcoiner dined and dashed! Paid nothing and cursed me out" And wait for someone down the road to settle his bill in cash in exchange for the paper wallet?

While I understand this sentiment, I don't want him in jail but for someone who opens, advertises ,and promotes Bitcoin I find it hard to believe that a good business person doesn't know how to navigate themselves around regulations that really have no business in existing in the first place.

Does he run a bank? Last I checked restaurants aren't being monitored like financial institutions and Thailand certainly doesn't have the resources to monitor to the degree that would be necessary to enforce any crypto trading (the resources they have are probably not even adequate enough to monitor Bitcoin exchanges). Even China couldn't lock this down, Japan and Korea barely tried, what makes you think Thailand (arguably an even more cash-heavy society with a larger black currency market) could do it better? 
This is easier than you think, You could look at it this way, customer one goes ahead and gets a meal for 0.01BTC ($60 or however many baht you wanna play with) restaurant eats the cost until customer 2 comes in that wants BTC and pays for the same meal for $120 and gets 0.01 BTC as change. The restaurant's accounting doesn't change (money coming in ends up with the same totals) and he doesn't break any laws.
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:15:07
Sucks that he wasn't the best customer no one deserves to be cursed at in a restaurant, but I'm curious why you wouldn't consider letting him settle the bill in Bitcoin, do you not believe in it yet want to use the name? Your government won't let your banks change Bitcoins to cash but you have a community right here that'd make that exchange in cash in a heartbeat when they visit Thailand next. You could have made free karma from it 
Like really, unless your margins are so slim that you go out of business floating a few bitcoin-paid bills, I don't see how this is a huge risk for you (rename your restaurant when it doesn't work), we need more establishments exchanging their goods and services for Bitcoin no matter what direction the price goes. The "community" took a risk in believing in Bitcoin, you have to do the same.

I think it depends on where the adoption is coming from, full adoption should be viewed as the moon.  
When a bunch of speculating billionaires jump in we'll see a huge spike but it wouldnt be sustainable until adoption catches up.  This would be the same as the money in the stock market trading hands with other speculators.  The billionaire investors wont be taking everyone to the moon, just a few lambos for misguided people.
Bitcoin's growth (outside of its fiat value) is dependent on how easy it is to get people to act in the bitcoin economy, not necessarily the price. The quicker the public gets into the Bitcoin economy, the faster we reach the moon
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:43:52
Volatility won't be solved by a few billionaires shooting up the price. Adoption is the only factor that reduces volatility, not the imaginary ticker price. 
Bitcoin is more valuable at $1 BTC with a million people in the network vs Bitcoin at $100K BTC with only handful of rich assholes passing around money in exchanges and smart contracts. GDAX can report Bitcoin is $1,000,000/BTC right now and it wouldn't make Bitcoin a better store of value if not enough players are using the Bitcoin network.
Bitcoin is already the BEST currency. Open up OpenBazaar or any e-commerce site that takes bitcoin. Bitcoin allows anyone to buy shit that you can't normally buy, sell shit you can't normally sell on the internet using centralized payment processors. Not only focusing only on black or grey market goods, but rather focus on the removal of the middleman of payment processors now that payments are p2p.  This opens up international commerce in a very special way that anyone can help with growing. Or if e-commerce doesn't seem that exciting, Travel somewhere and sell Bitcoin for local currency to a local and take the ATM withdrawal fees and foreign transaction fees away from the banks
I'm not saying to spend it for the sake of spending it, spend it on something that only makes the most sense paying in bitcoin and tell your friends and family about that advantage. Thats one way we can reach the moon.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:25:18
maybe a better solution would be using Bitcoin to fund building out networks in areas with poor internet connections. It would be really cool to see the economic activity in those areas, and the blockchain could do that!
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:02:34
We'll be dead by the time deflation starts, inflation of the Bitcoin supply is written in the protocol. Only way to force deflation is if someone verifiably destroyed more bitcoin than what is available left to mine, after 9 years of mining I think we're pretty safe (not completely) this scenario is becoming less likely each day. 
Edit: The other option would be a theoretical evil miner that took control of significant hashpower and refused to release any new coinbases until the end of time. This theoretical evil miner would have to win majority of the block rewards for the rest of time. The economic incentive to be this evil miner is terrible though, as control of this significant hashpower would be much more valuable following consensus and it's a pretty long game to play
Now if you're shouting deflation because of the rapid rise of it's fiat price... thats not necessarily because Bitcoin is deflationary, it's just the nature of useless currency vs Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is still finding it's value across all market participants

How would you know the eventual ~0.5BTC block reward decades down the road wouldn't cover the growth of the global economy? 
While that may lead to a silly answer, in a theoretical world where the entire world's economy is based in Bitcoin,to prevent inflation or deflation it would be necessary that the "value" of the block reward would tie with the growth of the bit-econony

So basically there exists an amount an appraiser can submit that is lower than the fair market value that wont piss off the taxing authority.  As long as its not too far below fair market value, I highly doubt that it will arouse much suspicion.  So instead of $600K, $850K probably wont rustle any feathers.  Thats still considerable tax savings on a $1 million dollar house.  Bitcoin Real Estate is going to have lots of opportunities to be shady as hell (which may be a good thing, who knows)

it would be pretty amazing if chat programs such as whatsapp, line, hangouts, fb messenger, or qq integrated bitcoin into these programs.  
have them host online wallets tied to the user
interchat transactions can be off chain to save on transaction fees
Adds additional revenue over traditional ad-serving by charging transaction fees for each interchat transfer.
These networks have users already connected to each other that share messages, images and files.  Its like an ready-made payment system already once they start allowing users to share money.

why is there no transactions available on the blockchain for the addresses for the charities?
when i selected Salvation Army it said it was sending to 1CgzM9Xop2JxvD89kDaZxTXdhAGrC8cS5q
but theres no transactions to this address at all
edit: ahh, theres a link for "How's this work" on the donation page:
text from trybtc.com: How do donations work?
To donate your μBTC, we will move 2 μBTC directly from your Bitcoin address to a wallet we have set up on behalf of your selected charity.
At the end of every day (00:00 GMT), we transfer this money over to the charity. This is done to minimize processing charge (less than 1¢ per transaction).
100% of the bitcoins donated are sent to the charity.
It would be cool to see this on the blockchain..though  I would very much like to see how much uBTC's have been sent

for double spend to work, your double spend transaction needs to be in the transaction pool before your original transaction completely propagates through the network. Once it propagates to the entire network, nodes will not relay already-spent inputs
Lets say you have a 30 second window to do this, it is still difficult and will not always succeed.
The way to go around this is if you control over half the nodes in the network that will reliably relay your double spend transaction for miners to process, this means you have an indefinite window to attempt to doublespend.  This is impractical and expensive
For the merchant, if he uses a payment processor like bitpay or coinbase, he probably doesnt have to worry about these things at all as they probably utilize many nodes already.  If the merchant decides to be his own payment processor, the way to protect himself is by setting up outside nodes to monitor the transaction pool to look for doublespend to his address
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:54:00
honestly, I suggest you actually buy some bitcoins, you'll learn a few things
1. It's a pain in the ass
2. You have to wait a few days (unless you go for localbitcoins)
Then after you get your own bitcoins, transfer them around to other wallets (ie. if you bought from coinbase, setup a blockchain.info wallet and send some there). Or run your wallet on your own computer (bitcoin-qt)
-You've just become your own bank
Now that you have bitcoins that only you can spend.... try spending some on Overstock, Tiger Direct, or Gyft
-Realize that buying stuff with bitcoins makes a crap ton more sense than grabbing your wallet and jotting down credit card numbers, if you have a smartphone that can use bitcoin apps, you will feel the magic of buying stuff through QR codes.
We can talk your ear off in but honestly for the majority of people out there, unless you use it, you aren't going to fully understand it. Everything makes a lot more sense when you start using bitcoin, things such as the blockchain, confirmations, hash rate, transaction fees, wallets, cold storage are things that you read about but wont make much sense until you actually use it.

brain wallets are incredibly unsafe because its possible for people to brute-force your brain wallet phrase.  People are not good at create pass phrases.  However if you are confident that you can outwit some dude crunching dictionary words and infinite amount of books and song lyrics on a bunch of servers until the end of time then be my guest. 
You are better off with generating a paper wallet, and then for each letter of the private key circle a word or letter in the page.  Once you are confident you can regenerate the private key from the book, destroy the paper wallet (or you know, just keep it for the sake of simplicity)

losing 6% of all bitcoins is huge. we are losing a huge chunk of supply and possibly reduced demand due to the amount of traders that traded on gox which may never come back into the market due to their personal lack of faith in the network. however if new demand increases by more than 6% due to all of this new exposure, than its reasonable to think that prices will go back up.

Instant payment network with no real infrastructure changes (although adding nodes to their servers would vastly improve user experience). Your id becomes a bitcoin address. All it requires is the platform having certain messages broadcast into the blockchain. Hell they can make money charging transaction fees for tx's they broadcast. Seriously imagine: "yo, can you pick up the tab? I'll whatsapp you back". faster than venmo, cheaper than paypal. Got a friend overseas? "Hey can you ship me xyz to china?

/i am not a professional
If i was in your position, If its not a significant amount of money to you,  i would just buy back BTCs and increase your holdings.  Any fiat or coins on Gox I would treat as lost already, but I think its far more likely that BTC withdrawals will come back eventually than getting Fiat from Gox.  Ie.  in best case, withdrawals return this week and you can send your coins elsewhere for fiat.  If you stayed in Fiat, you are looking at months before Gox returns any funds to you. (takes them about 3 months to process a USD wire before all this crap happened).  So its either you wait a week and pray that BTC withdrawals return, or wait half a year for your fiat from gox.
Although the whole thing about keeping Fiat on Gox for the possibility of suing them for damages in the future makes sense, the amount of time it would take to get fiat on Gox in this matter makes the fiat nearly worthless (i'd be surprised if you could get fiat back from Gox within a year if they go bankrupt).  
Either way I would treat any fiat or coins on gox lost already. But judging by the announcements, you probably have a better chance getting coins from gox in a timely matter than fiat.

I think I can explain this.  two lightning nodes are required to open a channel.  each lightning node needs to have access to Bitcoin to open Channels therefore the node needs to be able to access the blockchain in order to broadcast transactions
On the web service the Lightning Node is connected to its own copy of a Bitcoin full node. The mobile wallet (eclair mobile) is relying on the default setting of looking for an open electrum server.  You are correct that the mobile phone does not have a full node running on itself.  Although the mobile app holds the keys to the coins, its reliant on the default electrum node to be online to open or close channels whereas the Lightning Node for the webservice is only reliant on itself to open and close channels since it has a copy of the blockchain for itself.  If the blockchain becomes unreachable to either lightning node they lose the ability to broadcast transactions until they regain connectivity.
When considering everyday users, its possible that one day when there are enough reliable and trusted bitcoin nodes to access, we wont all need to walk around with 200GB of the blockchain around our necks .  Whether or not a user thinks that day has already come determines whether or not the user needs to run a full node or not.  It doesn't have much to do with anything regarding the Lightning Network but rather a personal choice for the user to balance the confidence of the user's personal ability with the trust in other systems.  The argument for a user to run their own Lightning Node follows the same concept
@_date: 2019-03-13 05:04:38
One thing to consider about using LN in a no-fee environment (direct channels) is that it wouldn't cost anything more to make one transaction or three so you could make it so a group of invoices have to be paid before you proceed with whatever you need to do, it really doesnt matter when you dont need to worry about transaction fees  
On the base protocol the 3-address transaction has to be written from the payer which as others have pointed out need to sign separate outputs for each destination.  Doing this isn't any more or less expensive than creating 3 separate transactions or writing it into one because it is still the same inputs/outputs being used, they dont ever overlap.  If your payer is unable to create this transaction on his own, my suggestion is to have the payer send the transaction to one address and you can have an application create the necessary multi-destination transaction, because theres transparency on the blockchain you can always prove to the payer when and how the funds were split.

you might be giving CCP's PLA too much credit, and not enough to HK.  After 70 years, the PLA still doesn't even have joint command across its militaries so its ability to conduct complex operations (especially an invasion of Taiwan) is incredibly limited, not to mention PLA does not have an impressive track record and does not perform military drills with as much discipline as its east asian neighbors (South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan).  An invasion of Taiwan would be many magnitudes harder than the Normandy landings, China has tried many times it couldn't even take the island of Kinmen (literally off the coast of the mainland).  The last military conflict China was in was '79 against the Vietnamese which militias and border guards were able to hold back the Chinese and inflict heavy losses on them while Vietnam's army handled Pol Pot in Cambodia.  The PLA is only good at killing Chinese people (Tibet, Tiananmen Massacre, and XinJiang) , it is not capable of doing anything else
Perhaps the news of IP theft and increased military spending got you worried, but like all party-controlled enterprises in China, the military budget is subjected to incredible corruption.  So much of military spending goes into personal coffers.  To give an idea of what level of corruption we're talking about, with the many billions of currency printed for military spending, China still doesn't have suitable fighter jets for any of their two carriers (cant land safely on the Liaoning, and can't launch from the Type001).  This means they spend millions on Carriers that won't have anything on their decks.  Perhaps they are really good at hiding their fighter jet development,but they have no reputation or ability to engineer their own fighter jets to make this believable.  The PLA is mismanaged, and a further example of this can be seen in the South China Sea.  Those man-made islands? Those are all strategic liabilites, they basically spent billions to build sand castles in the Sea.  Without a carrier group to protect their islands, it brings to question "How are these effective uses of their military budget?". 
I'm sure military experts know best, so lets go back to talking about money.  HK financial position is just as critical today than it was in '97, if anything China is even more reliant on HK.  Sure, HK only contributes 2.7% of China's overall GDP but it handles nearly all (80+%) of all foreign currency inflows. (the world doesnt buy goods in RMB) China never had to opportunity to build an international banking infrastructure due to revolution, famine, and more revolution whereas HK's banking relationships are a century old in some cases, those relationships can't be copied or faked unlike industry secrets. 
The question that the free world should consider is "Why CCP is choosing to move in on Hong Kong in 2019 rather than wait for 2047?"  My theory is that I think the panama papers kicked this all off.  The panama paper exposes how CCP funnels money from China's fake economy into overseas accounts. Considering the scheme that Xi's brother runs makes it not hard to connect the thought that the Belt and Road project is more of a money laundering operation rather than the beginnings of Chinese imperialism.  Simply put, China's leadership is too short-sighted, greedy, and unimaginative to be able to "do imperialism", its hard to manage colonies if one can barely keep its country in one piece.  Panama Papers exposes CCP officials to sanctions because now the whole world sees where they hide their money, therefore CCP must find a way to move their ill-gotten riches in a way where sanctions are unenforceable.  It appears it is impossible without control of Hong Kong's financial sector, which is why the CCP chooses to move now.  The CCP's greatest fear is losing the ability to escape with their ill gotten gains when lies finally see the light of day and the house of cards they've built comes crashing down.

Bitcoin ushered in a new era where immutable truth exists, therefore the age where incorruptible ideals can spread is just beginning.  The blockchain itself proves this to the world every 10 minutes
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:26:10
China is desperate for foreign currency and believes it can manipulate Bitcoin to its advantage.  I highly doubt the bone-headed regime realizes that Bitcoin stands in the exact opposite of their ideals.  Immutable truth and perfect transparency does not bode well for Xi's authoritarian regime, it will aid in its destruction.  Whichever way CCP tries to use Bitcoin, the world will be able to see it. We've already seen how the CCP reacts to when their laundering schemes are discovered (look up Panama Papers, Xi's brother), which left them no choice but to keep their ill-gotten riches away from sanctions by taking over Hong Kong Banks through dismantling One Country Two Systems in Hong Kong.  Regardless what happens, it's all good for Bitcoin. Whats great is that Bitcoin is a trustless system and theres no reason to trust the CCP, so don't transact with them or their friends (especially their shitcoins) if it can be helped!
China's economy in the last decade has been an exercise of unchecked greed.  Think the 2008 financial crisis with even LESS oversight, thats shadow banking. (instead of synthetic CDOs, they're synthetic banks)  Shadow banking is what props up China's ghost city real estate market, manipulated stock valuations, and the many many bloated shoddy infrastructure projects in China and abroad.  The middle class of China is no longer thriving, and has stagnant wages in the face of rising property values and increased costs.  The evidence is clear in the money supply China has printed in the last decade. Nearly 3x the amount the US has without anything to show for because all the construction (majority of their GDP, manufacturing and tech are much smaller) they've built is WASTE not WEALTH.  All of the money they print doesn't buy imports and can't settle debts, hence the need for foreign currency.  Majority of foreign currency that flows into China goes through Hong Kong because no one wants to deal with Chinese partners without the protections of One Country Two Systems (which is what the current protests are trying to protect with its 5 demands)

CCP needs more avenues for foreign currency going into China. China doesn't pay for imports in RMB, cant settle foreign debts in RMB, and the world doesn't buy their exports in RMB. In the face of China's slowing economy,  CCP has done nothing but print more and more money for a fake economy with a GDP propped up by empty ghost cities and bloated infrastructure projects funded by a toxic loan market (shadow banking) that operates with even less oversight than 2008. 
CCP seems to believe they will be able to manipulate Bitcoin, but seeing how they can't even handle students in 24 weeks... This looks more like a move in desperation as corrupt CCP leaders continue to look for ways to  launder their ill-gotten riches in a post-Panama Paper world where none of their wealth is safe from sanctions

I never post here but this is ridiculous, I also want 2x and ive been in bitcoin for a long time now.  Look, i get the whole point of segwit and I think its fantastic, but the stubborn nature of the last 3 fucking years of not changing the block size is ridiculous, we've been operating at capacity for over a year now, we should have raised block size before we hit our first chain of maxed out blocks, and before all of this drama.  I really felt like development was more unified when i first got into bitcoin, not entirely sure what is happening now.
Blocksize was arbitrary from the very beginning and was one of the variables that was played around with, even by satoshi himself. There is no where that says 1MB is the PERFECT, END-ALL of block sizes.
Do people forget why we even have 1MB blocks?  Its because we didnt want satoshi dice transactions spamming the network the entire time and fucking up block propagation.  The network is so much larger now, block propagation of larger blocks has already been proven in BCH and a number of altcoins that it works totally fine up to a certain limit.  Bitcoin being the blockchain with the highest hashrate and the largest network could definitely handle it.
Again, segwit is fantastic and i think its going to help, but the network (esp Core)  needs some sort of flexibility with consensus because not everyone is going to want to use segwit or lightning.  Developers need to stop swinging their dicks around (on all the many sides ) and work together and set egos aside, theres so many use cases that are lost when we live with full blocks.  I hated some of the proposals in the past (Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin-ABC) but seriously those projects are starting up because this is all just developer drama, theres an entire subreddit because bitcoin users aren't being heard by their community.  I dont believe in a blockstream conspiracy or a Jihan-takes-over-bitcoin, because this is just ego.  We're all fabulously wealthy with bitcoin, but this is bringing out the worst in us. The music will stop if we dont work together.  BCH wouldn't exist if we worked better together, i dont want to see segwit2x as another coin its already been proven that a considerable amount of Hashrate wont follow just because "Core said so".
I understand the value of a $3 transaction fee, but $3 transactions are retarded. period.  I dont expect to make instant transactions across the blockchain for less than that, but I at least would like to be able to send dust again without having to wait for peope to make new transaction layers. At the moment it could take weeks for any low-fee/no-fee transaction to get going. Exactly why can't I send dust anymore? Because Core said so? Because thats a "spam" transaction?  I'd like to be able to say "i can send $5 around the world for pennies in a day".  Remember before when we could pay for someone's bar tab around the world? Its basically unfeasible to do it now, its not even economically viable to do that demonstration anymore.  I really dont understand why people say "we dont want coffee transactions on the blockchain" especially with new users working with such tiny amounts of bitcoin.
tl dr; Segwit, Lightning are all great and im excited for it too, but seriously, not everyone is going to use it, all the time. Core needs to stop alienating competing proposals, and the censorship on needs to be toned down.

RMB will have collapsed for weeks before the HK dollar peg breaks. RMB doesn't buy imports and is unable to be used to pay off foreign investments/loans. The demand for foreign currency is incredibly high in China regardless of what the media reports for this reason, contrast this with how laughably easy to get loans in China in RMB and it's pretty clear what's happening (think 2008, but with even less oversight)
RMB needs foreign capital to keep the music playing of the fake Chinese economy going. Chinese and foreign investors alike seem to not realize all the chairs have already been stolen away by party officials and their friends years ago while they wait for the music to stop. (I.e. $1 trillion exchanged hands for 1 belt 1 road and all there is to show for it after 6 years are broken bridges, halted or empty construction sites, and propaganda videos) 70+million units of real estate scattered across empty ghost cities being bought and sold show how people continue to try to 'outsmart' each other when the heist has already mostly happened.

I was at a start-up that got bought out by Chinese investors and there was all sorts of funky business getting money out of China to complete the purchase. (Bribery). I'm not a financial expert, but that doesn't mean anything for this topic because there's too much incentive to lie rather than tell the truth. I interpret the facts I gather and thus far I haven't encountered anything to debunk my claims.
There's lots of indicators, just look at the growth of China's money supply compared to the US in the last 10 years against GDP growth. China has outprinted US nearly 3-to-1 and the growth of GDP doesn't make up the difference. The question to ask is: "where did all the wealth go?" Because there's not enough tech companies (alibabas, tencenrs, baidus, huaweis, etc) to make up the difference and it certainly didn't go to the struggling lower and middle class of china. All the GDP is in concrete and steel for construction and real estate (like every other country). Ghost cities have been talked about for so many years, and they're real, look them up on Google. The scale is incredible to quickly realize the naked truth, they're WASTE not wealth. (When was the last time you heard about a ghost city becoming a world class city?��) If China is willing to lie about real estate, then why not other infrastructure projects? So then you look at the progress of world's most ambitious 1 belt 1 road, sure these mega projects are expected to take years, but money already exchanged hands, where's the progress?? All I've found was a broken bridge in Kenya which was way overpriced for what was built a trend that follows with Chinese business practices. With all the contracts for these projects being solely given to Chinese construction companies rather than building partnerships with countries it feels like the goal is more about the price tag than building foreign trade.  Everything else about 1 belt 1 road? Propaganda videos (even PBS newshour played one this week for the rail project in Indonesia!). Let's not forget, like ghost cities, 1 belt 1 road projects are building infrastructure in places with no demand......
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck..... Do I need to be a duck expert? My hope is that others can draw the same conclusions and I'll feel like less of a conspiracy theorist

Keep up with China? You realize their economy is fake right? Bulk of their GDP is in ghost cities and shoddy infrastructure projects. They build WASTE not WEALTH because theyre built in areas with NO DEMAND. Chinese construction's purpose is to hit economic targets not for the sake of long-term economic growth because many ghost cities have already fallen apart from reckless build quality and lack of upkeep. It's like the 2008 bubble all over again but with even less oversight and worse in every way because shadow banking has been out of control and construction is shoddier than ever. China in 2019 is not like the China of 2008, the last decade has seen China running off a cliff and all they do is print more money. In the same decade China printed nearly 3x the money supply than the US, it all went into pockets of CCP officials to launder overseas, not back into the Chinese economy
Tech? It's literally stolen. Manufacturing? It was a decade-long race to the bottom and consumer demand never grew to make up the difference. Companies are too afraid to post losses so they invest in other failed businesses, and  when that doesn't work out they borrow money from shadow banks, just like the struggling middle class with stagnant wages and rising property prices. Or they just fake their numbers, all the official numbers we see in the west aren't even trusted by the Chinese.

Yeah one can change USD to RMB all day because the demand for foreign currency is high when the supply for RMB is unlimited.   It doesn't go the other way because its monopoly money.  Shenzhen will never replace Hong Kong, can Shenzhen or Shanghai guarantee an independent judiciary if foreign investors encounter contract disputes? Nope.  How is that a replacement? Its not.  
If Hong Kong really produced nothing, then a bunch of students wouldn't have a bigger impact on the Chinese Economy than the CCP in the last 17/18 weeks.  Chinese state media wants to paint a narrative that Hong Kong protests is a mess, but really the CCP made the mess, not Hong Kong.  China will face isolation if it decides to move to dismantle One Country Two Systems, in US and UK alone they are already looking to remove Hong Kong's special trade status (which again, doesnt exist anywhere else in China) and will cut off China from foreign capital

Sure, and China will continue to build upon its fake economy as long as westerners want to remain greedy.  There's certainly no shortage of greed in the world.  CCP enjoys every moment the music keeps playing while the Chinese workers bear the cost.
However as a Chinese person you might want to think about this: For every dollar CCP officials make from exploiting Chinese workers, westerners steal much more than the dollar because western powers are the reasons behind the irreversible environmental damage to many parts of industrialized China which has made air unsafe to breathe, and food and water to become unsafe to drink.  The west reaps the benefits from the environments it destroys all because the CCP is willing to sacrifice its people for profit to maintain power and the slaves of China have no choice to change their fate

Oh man, a lot to unpack here.
At 17 weeks you really should stop bringing up narratives for foreign interference, it just paints the picture that Chinese Intelligence is so terrible that it cant even catch spies to stop these protests from happening.  It's like signaling to the world that CCP has no capability to perform counter-intelligence which just makes the rest of the world wonder if the PLA has actually been funded properly.
The protests have been about 5 demands. A withdrawal of the Extradition bill because its current form violates Hong Kong's autonomy in One Country Two Systems. A recategorization of 'non-violent protests' to no longer be called 'riots' because by allowing the government to mislabel peaceful civil demonstration it violates the right to assembly. An independent investigation of all incidents of police brutality because the police need to be held accountable for their criminal behavior during these protests and treatment of their prisoners. A release of all arrested protesters with guarantee of no re-prosecution because protesters should not arrested for demanding their human rights. And last, the implementation of universal suffrage as guaranteed because its about time Hong Kong people get to make their own decisions.
None of those demands mention independence, the Hong Kong people just want those 5 things.
The Opium war is great to bring up because it is a story of how a corrupted merchant and imperial class started to exploit their workers more and more for personal gain and started to cheat their trade partners to ultimately face humiliating punishment?

Satoshi created humanity's first immutable record when he announced the Genesis Block.  The turning point is the ability to maintain a perfect history due to the existence of universal consensus, which did not exist prior to Jan 3rd 2009.  We live in a time today where inefficiencies exist because people don't trust one another, therefore it makes it hard for people to come together.  With Bitcoin, theres finally something everyone can agree on, a universal truth that gets updated every 10 minutes secured by the laws of mathematics and propagated by human will.

HKD can move in an out of foreign currency with relative ease as many banks around the world are able to transact in it directly.
 the biggest issue in the Hong Kong saga are for the Chinese holding onto RMB which has no avenue to be used in the outside world and it becomes harder and harder to move out of (already at 10 year lows). Hong kong protests puts pressure on the Chinese economy which relies on a healthy inflow of capital into China which majority comes through Hong Kong. CCP (China's leadership) has no option but to print more and more money into their alreadt-bloated money supply(reduced capital requirements for bank holdings 4 weeks ago) to stave off collapse from the debt bomb created by shadow banking, so if anything, Chinese people really should be learning about Bitcoin as the risk for hyperinflation continues to grow

If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why is the PLA in Hong Kong masquerading as Police Officers or agent provocateurs ?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why do triad thugs get paid for terrorizing protesters with violence?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why does Chinese state media continue to run stories to a smear students?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why claim foreign interference?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why reduce reserve requirements in Chinese state banks?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why pressure the MTR (Hong Kong metro) to endanger their customers?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why force companies to make public statements condemning protesters and fire employees for supporting Hong Kong (i.e. Cathy Pacific)
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why are images of peaceful marches where millions of people from all ages standing together censored on the Chinese internet?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why are there social media accounts being used by state actors to such a degree that Twitter had to come out and announce it?
If Beijing doesnt need to do anything, then why are people in China not allowed to discuss it openly?
Oh this can go on forever, but see how this is different from whataboutism? These are evidence-based claims that show how you are wrong, not random claims to muddy conversations to get away from the issues.
Everything CCP has done for Hong Kong protests is wrong because what needs to happen for the sake of China is for someone to take responsibility and suffer the consequences for the mistakes made for the sake of lying. The leadership refuses to do so and just finds more and more ways to avoid it, China might not remember who Mao truly was, but plenty of people from around the world certainly do.
If only Beijing didnt do anything at all, thats what they wish for right now.  They really could have done nothing and waited for 2047, but they didnt.. and thats another can of worms if you start to ask "why?".  Ever hear of the Panama Papers? I'd like to think that's what really started this whole mess.  Look up Xi's brother (a US citizen BTW).  CCP officials wanted to hide direct evidence on how party officials directly exploit Chinese workers and needed banks to look the other way when they stuff their ill-gotten gains into overseas accounts and used firms like Mossack and others to do so.  Fearing inevitable sanctions from Panama Paper investigations after the leak, they start  to scramble for banks that wont freeze foreign assets.... now do see how being able to control Hong Kong is tied to the survival of the CCP now?
Try not to get shot for this knowledge. Cheers!

As a portion of China's overall GDP? Hong Kong certainly doesnt hold the same proportion as it did during the '97 handover, but thats not what's being discussed here.  
The world doesnt pay for Chinese goods in RMB and China doesn't buy imports in RMB either, all of that is made possible through the century-old international banking infrastructure in Hong Kong that China hasn't been able to build because of civil war, revolution, and famine.  Shenzhen and not even Shanghai could replace Hong Kong for a VERY long time, banking relationships are built on trust and reputation, those things can't be copied or faked
Unless you think the world is going to start paying for chinese goods with cash at the docks, you really need to reconsider the reading you've done to claim that Shenzhen is an actual alternative

Wealth inequality perpetuates when fairness becomes out of reach from lack of transparency. Bitcoin offers ultimate transparency through the blockchain's immutable past and secure future to produce a system of exchange that is entirely dependent on transparency and fairness.  it only takes convincing one mind at a time to help others recognize that the solution to a majority of economic woes lies in the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin can solve any number of issues of any imaginable scale as long as more people become aware of it and use it.

If you believe SHA256 hashing is inefficient for blockchains, there has been 10 years of opportunity to propose a better solution with nothing to show for, many others have come up with call_me_mr_rightCoin and produce only waste because there is no better solution. (i stand behind you that every other crypto is producing electric waste, butthe scale of power consumption of those blockchains are not worth mentioning)  It may "seem" wasteful, but Hashes are checked millions and millions of times because it is necessary.  It is necessary because it is too easy to produce SHA256 hashes (since anyone can do it) therefore in order to maintain security, millions and even billions of hashes are required.  It may be a bit weird to accept it, but Bitcoin is the most efficient means of producing truth today and every new block that is found with all the exahashes of work behind it, continues to drive home that point
Hell no it is not more smart to trust good actors in regards to climate.  Time and time again corruption eventually takes hold,  why else do you think animal agriculture and fossil fuels are still heavily subsidized even after countless studies that show that those subsidies are bad for the environment/climate?   Those subsidized resources could be used to build renewable energy infrastructure and help fund research into lab-meat and other solutions, but they dont because the people who make those decisions have unseen motivations(corruption).  Why do you think rainforests are constantly being laid flat for livestock and oil drilling continues while ice caps are melting? Climate change is the result of corruption in centralized powers, and we need a change away from centralized powers if we hope to make better progress.  Decentralized systems have shown better efficiencies than centralized ones (bittorrent, distributed generation powering smart power grids) so it makes complete sense for Bitcoin which does not nearly have the same overhead as the systems it will eventually replace, be actively considered as a driving force to make this change away from centralized power/corruption possible. When Satoshi kicked off the Genesis Block he taught us the valuable lesson that trust is pointless when truth is available

Bitcoin's resource use is the cost of security, there's no need to compare it to financial institutions which are not built on the same principles. You're setting your sights way too low on what Bitcoin will be able to address, Bitcoin is special, one of a kind.  Another way to consider this, the electric cost of Bitcoin is the cost of immutable truth. With Bitcoin, truth is now quantifiable for the first time in human history. Consider that no one knows how much it will cost to maintain truthfulness (remember, Bitcoin's electric use does not need to continue to go up for it to continue to work, there will be a day where the cost-benefit of producing more hashes won't make bitcoin-economic sense) as that question has never been asked and there's no other system or organization that can produce absolute truth that Bitcoin is able to

You need to look at what are the real polluters of the climate change. They rank as follows: structural cooling, meat consumption/animal agricultural, and then transportation and so on. In the grand scheme of things Bitcoin is not a concern at all compared to the top 3. All the air-conditioning running in empty buildings and cow farts to make hamburgers are bigger polluting factors than a bunch of people playing with Bitcoin software for the last decade. Furthermore, Non blockchain infrastructure is but a fraction of mining activity, your understanding of Bitcoins power consumption is poor to bring up the surrounding infrastructure.
I agree that Capitalism has certainly ruined the planet because it encouraged profits to be made while ignoring the costs to the planet. This greed is due to lack of accountability of that damage and governments have not been able to regulate effectively because corporations continue to undermine those regulations. Drilling down to it, Climate change is an accountability problem caused by lack of data. Those responsible for polluting aren't paying for the environmental costs as they don't recognize the evidence right in front of them.  Capitalism in the industrial era has made it a habit to hide environmental data in the name of profit which brought us into the mess we are in today. Will capitalism still exist?  whether or not it is around won't solve climate change. Forcing corporations and consumers to react to the data of environmental damage is the way forward, that information must be made available cheaply and accurately. Transparency is necessary in order to combat climate change, and the blockchain is built to do that
I suggest you watch the Jeremy Rifkin lecture, it breaks it down much better than I could.

If you have space on your machine why not just run a node alongside your webserver (or a pruned one)? The Bitcoin RPC is easy to use with Python (python-bitcoinprc) and I think it works great. You can have your application make calls to it in order to create addresses for invoices and so far I havent encountered a situation where Python gave me any trouble.  By running your own node it easy to extend when you decide to support Lightning Payments as generating invoices works similarly, and its probably best to control your own node when you decide to go that route

The logic behind NOT destroying a coin is obviously each coin has required a crap ton of work to produce and lots of energy is used to maintain it's existence in the blockchain. To destroy it is to waste the energy put into it, and I can't imagine there's a Fiat value that can ever replace energy

If you measure benefit in dollars and scale to only payments than yeah there's not much benefit. (You'd be putting Bitcoin next to Apple pay, Alipay, venmo or ehatever) The benefit of Bitcoin are the features that can't be mimic'ed such as irreversibility, non duplication, and freedom to transact with any party on the network. A platform generating absolute truth thats secured globally has a lot more value in preserving global consensus than it's ability to NFC-swipe for coffee a few seconds faster than a bank payment
I totally get your point, it's just that you're trying to tell me about better carriages for horses when we're already launching rockets. Your carriage might get us to local destinations all the same, (even faster because rocket science is hard) but this trip is to the moon, (not the lambo moon)  a world where global consensus of truth can be agreed upon so we can tackle global problems efficiently.
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:08:10
Perhaps I'm thinking about this differently. I can see Bitcoin's worth derived from the costs and energy used to produce and maintain it (i.e. it probably is possible to calculate energy produced by a barrel of oil to an X amount of satoshis, completely accounting for the resource). whereas in Fiat, the relation between the energy produced from oil and the dollar is pretty arbitrary, no?

BCH and BSV are for those that need the lesson on what it means to follow the wrong chain, a lesson that some people will learn the hard way. There's a freedom to go against global consensus, but that freedom isn't worth anything to anyone but fools.

The faces behind these forks can only try to spin the narrative as much as they want, but there's only one conclusion once the fools run out.

Investing in Bitcoin is to put time and effort into it, not just money. It takes study, practice, and even a little faith (because we never know if the next block will ever be found). Investing for personal financial security is less about how many coins you have and more to do with how many people have coins. (It's better for you to be surrounded with 100 people with 1BTC than you having 10BTC and your community having 0) Getting sucked into looking at the price and only consider it's use as a payment system restricts the grand vision of what it means to live in a world with a global consensus for truth. The quicker you realize this, the less time you'll spend staring at price charts and start talking to people
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:08:20
Bitcoin isn't evil, everything else is debatable when they are not provably fair (and so far the only system with the history to back that up is and will always be Bitcoin). What I'm trying to say is all the time, resource, and energy used by the forks is all waste. 
Every block since the fork is a countdown to it's demise, there's no path to success for them that's any different than the altcoins, it will only get harder. Anyone can understand and take advantage of that idea when they step back and look outside the price charts. You'll still make money trading because the forks are a fantastic way to part fools with their money and their stake in the only coin that matters because it's easy to talk people in circles about an infinite amount of parameters to adjust and tinker to run a blockchain. The only parameter that can't change is being first, largest, and most trusted and Bitcoin has to disappear for any of those things to change
Arguments over forks  won't last forever,Fools will wake up one day. The wasted energy of these forks will be reclaimed once its proven that going against global consensus only ends in failure, Bitcoin will only get stronger when that happens.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:43:20
You're right, in the post modern era our perception of value is wonky (i.e. Jean beaudrillard), the value we attribute to things may not reflect the resources necessary to make it. Isn't the reason why this happens because there's no consensus on what constitutes value? Do you not feel this dynamic has room to change in the Bitcoin era? Perhaps not in a lifetime but wouldn't a system that can perfectly account for truth allow us to finally accurately attribute value?

I don't support any of the other coins. I think we can separate the alts into two categories, first one is to address an unknown weakness in Bitcoin and the second is just to scam people out of their money. 
When considering the first category, things like LTC, ETH, and maybe XMR we have to consider that mining was a lot different than it was today. I believe the fear of hardware centralization was a legitimate fear in the past so these coins (using different mining hardware) was the logical response to that. There's no one in the world that can tell you what mining will look like in the future, it is legitimate to respond in thusbway. however Now 10 years of decentralized Bitcoin Blocks, we may look at these projects and think they're useless because mining centralization doesn't exist, but the fear hasn't disappeared for some people, which is why these coins continue to hold their value.  In order for these first-category coins to differentiate themselves, (because they need to in order to survive) they have to define specific use-cases, since attempting to address broad use cases can only be done by BTC. These coins will start to fail when faith in Bitcoin becomes absolute.
This kinda slides into the second category, which are the coins by those who want to duplicate the success of Bitcoin and then be able to control it, these have no purpose other than to generate excitement through marketing in attempt to manipulate it's market price for short term profits. They are doomed to fail once the market realizes the majority of these coins are only hot air. While it is exciting to watch their prices fluctuate, it's literally trading stocks in companies that have no value outside of their marketing. (Which says a lot on where the tech industry is at)
There's also a dismissed third category (anyone remember namecoin?) Which are projects meant to be built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain, but can't because the time to address the unique use case is not here yet.  These projects will fail once Bitcoin is able to replace them (i.e. lightning network to address every coin that complains about block times)
In conclusion, nothing can beat Bitcoin but that's not to say we can't extract meaning out of the other projects to make BTC stronger

Borderless P2p is a pretty significant "gimmick" , it doesn't exist anywhere outside of Bitcoin and opens up all sorts of opportunities that would otherwise be restricted.  It takes human effort not Fiat money to utilize this gimmick. People build solutions, dollars only buy them. Stop waiting for a "killer app", and get off the price trackers and spread awareness to combat laziness. Helping others understand new concepts correctly will naturally build convenience. As we've seen, as those numbers increase, better solutions will be built. 
it's easy to say that everyone is lazy, but learning new concepts to come up with new ideas/opportunities is something everybody wants to do.  The stability of the most secure blockchain allows them to achieve that because traditionally you have to start with nothing and rely on your own connections. If anything there are people who are too lazy to navigate through the traditional system to build solutions/products/companies, and they will find that Bitcoin is easier to work with when no one can tell them "no"

you're not using your brain when doing research. Perhaps after 8 years you still don't understand how revolutionary the Bitcoin blockchain is.
There's no reasoning behind bringing up when you were "in the space" unless your mark on the Bitcoin blockchain in 2011 has anything to do with the discussion (i.e.  a txid or a blockhash).  Bringing up an arbitrary moment in which you became aware to Bitcoin holds no bearing on the facts that were presented to justify his conclusion.  The conclusion is that Bitcoin is the best bet because hard facts derived from the blockchain are presented to support that the safest option is the best option. Your 8 years of Bitcoin awareness has nothing to do with those facts because those facts are present, true, and will never cease to exist. Unless of course you're saying the knowledge in your head is more trustworthy than Bitcoin. At that point, we'd ask you to prove it

@_date: 2018-04-23 18:04:49
Isn't the end goal to eventually price everything in Bitcoin?  Price of things in Bitcoin fluctuates because of the exchange rates on exchanges change constantly, but there's no real reason why anyone has to go off of USD market price. 
Once you get closed-loop economies in Bitcoin the exchange rate of Bitcoin in USD and other fiat currencies become less important the more those economies grow. Finding a commodity to price in Bitcoin would be really significant whether it's auntie's muffins at 50k Satoshis or someone willing to risk raw material commodities for our magical internet money

Why does Gold have to continue to hold value again? It's just a shiny object we lock up in vaults that is hard to move and divide that we used 4000 years ago.
Not entirely serious, but I think it's still a possibility that we move away from Gold the same reason we moved away from seashells

Thank you for your response, I totally agree with a lot with what you are saying, Im trying to work through a new way of thinking for myself and find this discussion very valuable for what I want to pursue in Bitcoin.
I agree the price will continue to rise but Bitcoin is only deflationary when we all die in 2140.(none of us in this community will see Bitcoin in its deflationary state)  Mining awards decrease but its still inflation (in bitcoin).  We could only cause deflation today if someone controlled 100% of the hash power and never present the new coinbases to the rest of the network or we get verifiable destruction of existing coins that exceeds the remaining coins to be mined.
So considering that,
Whats stopping someone to price commodities at effectively $100K/BTC today and leave it there until it eventually happens for real?
I bring this up because i've been doing incredibly simple piece work for Bitcoin for years and i've just priced my time at $10k/btc throughout 2014 and on, losing considerable potential value but it wasn't why i picked up the piece work.  I was typically collecting $20 tasks for 200,000 satoshis (0.002, i got the math right, right?).  Theres nothing stopping anybody from doing the same with actual goods which would have real economic implications and could help create real closed-looped economies

Today it costs me $4 to order 24 plastic water bottles of water on amazon.
Lets say bitcoin is at $10k, that puts us at 40k satoshis.  
If you believe bitcoin is heading to $100K,
Would you fill up 24 plastic water bottles and not poison me for 4k satoshis? Is anyone (in the world) willing to do that? Selling water for bitcoin could happen today if this person exists

Hi Mark,
I think what you did was terrible but I cant deny that you've done so much for bitcoin.  I can't imagine what you had to go through to get here.  I wish you the best because its good to know you are trying to do the right thing. Its undeniable that what you did and what you do will affect bitcoin forever, i don't really have a question for you but curious on how you feel about your legacy in bitcoin history so far.

@_date: 2018-04-23 20:04:05
How does it work then? Not trying to be a dick but I could really use feedback.
 Obviously I'm not saying pizzas should be fixed at 30k BTCs  . There's plenty of services that work only in Bitcoin like online gambling, which can completely operate without USD these days.  
A few years ago, this conversation of pricing commodities in Bitcoin was ridiculous, but as the price continues to rise, it's not as crazy.   We should eventually see commodities (they can be commodities with tiny market caps too!) priced in Bitcoin, we don't need to wait for investors and speculators to prop up the price to do that.

there's no need, most of the animosity has been between BCH and BSV, both are cut from the same cloth,just led by different people.  BTC has no incentive and therefore no reason to address the noise from orphaned chains.  As BTC blocks are continuously found, the inevitability that both forks will disappear becomes ever more likely.  Hash Rate speaks louder than any press release or any lawsuit because that metric can't be misrepresented and the other chains will never reach the level of security of the BTC blockchain. BCH and BSV's failure is therefore inevitable, the only thing still holding up these failed-forks is the desire to cheat newcomers and those that are not well versed in what makes Bitcoin so special.

People dont get the potential because it takes time for new ideas to sink in. Nobody "gets it" on the first day, everybody should constantly study and practice in order to  better understand and utilize this technology because you can never become too familiar with Bitcoin.  Thankfully due to the immutable nature of the history of the blockchain, once a person "gets it" they'll never be able to turn back as long as the blockchain continues to fulfill the promises expected of it.  While many may see this as just a simple investment/value proposition, there's much more that the blockchain can offer than just a means of p2p exchange, it takes time to discover for themselves

i think you misunderstood him, he probably means fiat and alts will be worth less in relation to bitcoin.  unless you think any alts have an opportunity to rise above bitcoin or bitcoin being worth less than $0 i don't see how what he said is wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:28:46
even after many years I don't fully understand Bitcoin either (even though i study it all the time), what i "feel" about Bitcoin is that what Satoshi Nakamoto created was humanity's first immutable record.  It "feels" different because human beings have never been able to keep a perfect immutable record that is available universally.  It is undeniable that the Bitcoin Blockchain reaching back to the GenesisBlock is a perfect record of human history because it can never be altered. Each block found continues to build upon this history, and  participants are rewarded to maintain it, providing an incentive to record truthfully. Every transaction on the Blockchain is a legacy that can never be destroyed and will last forever as long as the Bitcoin Blockchain continues to find new blocks. Bitcoin fulfills the human desire to create an everlasting legacy. Bitcoin  provides a perfect platform to record any event, and it is available to everyone
This feeling is similar to what I felt when I utilized my first search engine as a child in 1997 and realized that encyclopedias were pointless when information is available universally.  Information and data become available to all with access to the internet.  The internet allowed us to connect with one another and access large swaths of data but we do not know whether or not the data we access is valuable or not, the Bitcoin Blockchain will help us understand that some swaths of data are more valuable than others because Bitcoin has successfully attributed value to itself.

@_date: 2019-05-11 19:29:31
Good luck. It doesn't make sense for another blockchain to ever be more valuable than Bitcoin, it will not happen in any meaningful context. Valuable not meaning dollars, there is no other blockchain that will ever contain as much historical data as one that spawns from the Genesis block. Until an alt can outpace Bitcoin, they have no probability of ever catching up. If alts ever outpace Bitcoin, everyone would see it and adjust accordingly, there's no avenue for success
You wanna narrow down your list of alts that will grow larger than Bitcoin? The length of that list is zero if you look at the facts and stop listening to idiots (including the voice in your head)

no, chinese bitpay would still be possible as it would operate as an exchange.  Its operator would have to take all the risks.  
its basically saying that the chinese state banks cannot run bitpay.  you dont want to have Chinese government printing RMB into BTC anyways
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:21:05
there is no mention that merchants cannot price things in BTC.  merchants will have no issue buying/selling stuff in BTCs. You will still be able to buy goods and services in China using BTC.  It is explicitly stated that Bitcoin commerce is OK.
the big change here is that it forbids state run financial institutions (remember, China is not like the US, all financial institutions are state run) from holding BTC. The logic they used here is because BTC is not a currency.  This hopefully can bring the market at ease that the chinese banks themselves will not be manipulating the bitcoin markets
They also explicitly declared here that bitcoin exchanges are not financial institutions. So for those that receive BTC and want RMB, they can still use the many dozen exchanges available.  (Provided the exchanges uphold all AML regulations)
@_date: 2013-10-26 01:53:05
this got me thinking, and i would love some insight from everyone.
if lets say the US government went ahead and bought all the bitcoins in existence today (11.9 million, worth about 2 billion USD)
the sum of all of US bitcoins would have to be worth the equivalent of all printed money in circulation in order for the US to retain control of all bitcoins in existence (1.2 trillion  .  Now there will still be new bitcoins being mined (until we hit the maximum) which everyone can still use (since we can always split 1BTC to however many decimal places would make sense) so each bitcoin mined after the US buys everything would be worth quite a bit. 
Now lets pretend the US takes advantage of buying all bitcoins today for 2 billion and then basically destroys all of the bitcoins (refusing to release any to the public).  What happens?  Bitcoin is dead then?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:21:05

I choose to look at this another way, which doesn't require any math.  Bitcoin accounts perfectly for all the energy and resources it consumes which is unlike every other system, corporation, or industry. Perfect accountability is a mark of high efficiency and required to tackle global problems like the environment, Bitcoin is the first of hopefully many platforms to bring about accountability because a secure blockchain provides universal transparency.  Universal transparency meaning that anyone is able to draw from the same datasets and make the same conclusions without fear that datasets are contaminated with falsified data.
Bitcoin is able to undoubtedly calculate the number of hashes it is estimated to produce a block, and there's a relatively accurate measure on how much electricity it takes to generate those Bitcoin Blocks at a given difficulty based on what hardware is available to crunch through those hashes.  Whether or not Bitcoin chooses to burn coal or utilize renewables is not that important of a factor (although i'd hope we strive toward renewables) because what is important is that Bitcoin can always be held accountable to the environmental damage it causes (when it does cause any) against what it produces (the newly discovered blocks and the tx's in them).  Heck, mining farms can calculate down to the satoshi how much pollution it creates (carbon vs satoshi's mined), while it is not dollars and cents, after 10 years of the Bitcoin Blockchain, satoshis certainly have value to the world now.  You can't say the same about your car, much less every other industry out there which has found incentive to hide environmental damage instead of having it freely analyzed in the open.  This is a big difference, and one of the reasons why Bitcoin is so special because Bitcoin is inherently built to be truthful and transparent, every other system prior to it was not build upon those principles and throughout human history those systems have always become corrupted due to the nature of centralized decision making.  We can fairly look at the environmental costs of Bitcoin because everything is perfectly accountable, it only becomes stronger when more people are using it too
I'm certainly rambling at this point,
Theres a great book and lecture by Jeremy Rifkin about the Third Industrial Revolution [ , theres a premise that renewable energy, IOT, and automated transportation will bring about new efficiencies for the next industrial revolution to build a so-called 'sharing economy' as we have hit peak efficiencies in our centralized oil-based economy.  The sharing economy is reliant on the ability to freely share information, and I believe the blockchain is able to do that every block it discovers as each Block represents freely shared data.  Bitcoin certainly paves the way for this next industrial revolution, it may even pay for it one day

i originally wasnt going to buy much, my first purchase was for honey and candy from beesbrothers.  I have to say, something "clicked" when my first bitcoin transaction went through.  It felt magical being able to buy stuff with BTC.  Seeing it propagate through the blockchain was eyeopening for me.  I decided I wanted to buy more stuff with BTC.  I went ahead and picked up coffee from Bitbrew (appears to be the only non-Bitpay merchant i used today), then I got a T-shirt from Mixed Tees, spent a few hundred for giftcards, picked up the "free" bitcoin keychain, and bought alpaca socks. It was just too much fun, i used to think 1-click Amazon shopping was as simple as it gets, but bitcoin has totally changed my outlook.  I cant wait for the day that Amazon will take BTC.
for those on the fence, i suggest you try it out, its a lot of fun!

Federal reserve in US doesn't need to be on board for bitpay to work. Bitpay is still an exchange that partners with a lot of banks to process transactions, I'm sure none of those banks are holding BTC , same would apply to a possible Chinese bitpay. Again, money can still flow between exchanges and banks, but Chinese banks are now explicitly forbidden to hold btc as part of their balance sheets (which is good!) so a Chinese bitpay is still possible as long as they carry all the risk of being an exchange(I can't imagine bitpay in US is any different)

That is not true, the distinction for bitcoin as a commodity and not a currency is only made so that financial institutions(all state run) cannot get involved with it. This does not mean that bit coin is only viewed as solely a commodity for those that are not involved with the state.  People will still be able to participate in bitcoin commerce. As stated later on in the announcement "但是，比特币交易作为一种互联网上的商品买卖行为，普通民众在自担风险的前提下拥有参与的自由。" it is pointless for them to make this distinction unless you believe this was poorly written, if they wanted to limit bitcoin to only the exchanges they would have made this distinction clearer. This states that any risk  trading with bitcoin will rely solely on the person, so there's no reason why merchants or consumers would be restricted. Chinese are free to be involved in bitcoin.  Again, this announcement was directed at state run institutions not its citizens and how the institutions should (or rather shouldn't) handle bitcoin nothing in here talks about what bitcoin is allowed or not allowed to do.
