Cool - how about a suggestion for a local wallet that doesn't require me to sacrifice two weeks of syncing and an entire hard drive's worth of space?  I used the main Core wallet up until a few months ago and have been using mainly blockchain.info and Bitstamp (for trading).

Fair point.  
The parent comment in the chain was talking about officials with institutional support.  If we talk about a home invasion, we're actually talking about a visit from someone in an official capacity, maybe even someone getting SWAT'ed - institutional support means police, gov't officials, etc.  Still wanna open fire to protect your Bitcoins?  I doubt it would go well.

True, but it stopped being effective against government force a hundred years ago.  Do you really think opening fire in an airport when a corrupt cop tries to take your stuff will prove a point?

I read it, but I still don't understand why this guy's house was raided.
He may have invented Bitcoin, but we don't know that.  
He was "running bitcoin" since 2009 but we don't know if that means he ran the currency as a whole (okay, guys), or if he just ran a mining operation.  
He talked about bitcoin in relation to taxes, but this was "unrelated" to the cryptocurrency.
...so why did he get raided?  Why do we even know this guy's name?  Did anyone get that part?

So with Coinbase you have the option to keep some of the funds in BTC?  While Bitpay makes it easy to accept Bitcoin without ever actually touching the coins, it would be nice to have the option to keep BTC directly, whether by specific transaction or perhaps just by percentage.

Just tried it, and it's great!  Is this your game, OP?  It's easy to understand and play, and it pays out in BTC!  Good stuff.
And to your question, I like the idea of simple games that pay out in BTC, even if it's only a trickle.  Still fun and it's still real money.
Now...  how does this game get its funds to begin with?  I don't want to play for however long it takes to get to the minimum payout only to have the game go tits-up for lack of funds...  That's my only concern (and it's pretty minor, really).

BTC will recover and continue to rise, I have no doubt of that.  Remember, it's "crashing" down to $500-ish USD.  I remember how crazy happy I was when it broke $100 for the first time.  
Thing is, every time something like this happens a bunch of us lose bitcoins, meaning the price MUST increase significantly before we get our investment back.  I have no doubt the value of each BTC will rise, by a lot.  I have lots of doubts about whether people will recover their money.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:35:36
"Probably"? 
This is why I'm not paying much attention to FinCEN at this point.  They're issuing vague statements that don't even qualify as guidelines, hoping people will just fall in line and go through the registration process out of fear.  
Get smart on the issue, come up with some real rules, and then we'll know what to do.  Until that happens, they're just background noise.

That's what I got from the announcement as well, was hoping to confirm.  If true, that's fine with me.  I had considered VoS and would likely only use them for coin-to-coin trades anyway.  So long as there aren't any plans to halt BTC withdrawals, then we should be good.

First of all, hello!  Thank you for taking the time to reach out to the community.
I would just like to (respectfully, of course) counter your point about payment options.
Consider the viewpoint that you're not offering multiple payment options right now.  You're offering one - fiat currency.  While there are many such currencies, they're all fundamentally different from Bitcoin.  They carry difficulties ranging from transfer fees on the simple side to privacy concerns on the paranoid side.  
Offering Bitcoin as a payment method would increase your payment offerings from one to two.  Traditional fiat currency and cryptocurrency.  That's it.  You'd open yourself to donations from young Bitcoin enthusiasts who have thousands in Bitcoin and use your services daily but  have little to no cash and can't convince their parents to send $20.  You could be supported by someone who resides in a country that politically can't or won't send fiat money.
I'm no marketing genius so I'll have to defer to you on the psychology behind overloading people with too many options, but from where I sit I don't see that offering Bitcoin will overload people.  Rather I think it will open your donation floodgates far more than accepting a new type of credit card (which I agree would be redundant).
Just a thought.  Thanks again for stopping by!
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:37:14

Well, no single player.  You're right about that.  Multiple players then?
GHash was pretty close not very long ago.  While it looks like we're all aware of and can react to the potential of a single bad actor mounting a 51% attack, would it be feasible to coopt more than one major player for a grand total of 51%?  In that scenario they're all separate pools, but if they all work together could they effectively mount a group 51% attack?  I don't even know if that's possible.
It just seems like something that if the protocol allows it, it is eminently possible given the US govt's recently publicized lack of concern for privacy and disdain for all things Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:50:59
Can I ask how you started your own coin?  I mean, I see the similarities from BTC to doge, to (insert name here); it looks like they're all based off the same reference code.  But how exactly did you get started with your own?  Did you find a template of some sort?
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:49:50
I don't know that they'll do this, especially given the recent IRS communication on the matter.  We're still researching, but he was talking about having Coinbase just exchange in realtime so it's seamless.  That's probably what we'll end up doing.
Paper wallets are good to know about anyway however.  I understand how they work but I'm not (yet) good enough with all the contingencies to explain it to the boss man.  I'd love the option of getting year end bonuses, raffle prizes, etc with preloaded paper wallets.  
At the end of the day it'll probably all be handled by Coinbase and the company itself won't ever touch the bitcoins.  Still, it's nice to have options.

I'm sure they'd find a way to twist that into your willingness to aid a criminal enterprise.  Sounds like you'd just do the trade like usual but be prepared to walk away if they start to talk about what they'll do afterward.
The abuse will start when they execute the trade normally, only then to tell you that they're going to do something illegal.  You can't reverse the transaction, so you just helped a criminal.  There's nothing you can do about it but good luck convincing a jury of that fact.

While my initial reaction is to point out how much that would make you look like a fed, it's probably not a bad idea for larger transactions.  If you're both on the level and want to trade for a large amount of cash, having the whole thing on video would make it safer for both of you.

It looks like Bitcoinity changed the default to Bitstamp, which is sufficient I think.  I'm still working on a trading bot, and while I'm now locked in to Gox, it's still useful to watch their ticker and work on the bot's logic.  I wouldn't remove them, but I support the idea of no longer using them as de-facto standard.

Sounded like she was into it, so it's likely to be the first of many transactions.  And yes, she can simply not report it, but given that it's a business and the IRS has us under the microscope these days, it won't be long before they come asking about it.

That Coinkite POS system is sweet, but pricey.  Funny that they list affordability as one of their bullet points but are roughly twice as expensive as their own example ($300 terminal, $50 case, $200 POS stand = $550, but the CoinKite preorder is just over $1k).
Still, it will be easier to digest for people used to the standard credit card swipers.  I hope it catches on.

Yeah, I'll make sure he understands that.  At the very least I'll have him run a local wallet on his PC, but I think I'll bone up on paper wallets so he can physically lock it away and keep it safe.  It will depend on how he wants to proceed (buying with it or long term speculation).
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:39:42

He's all over it.  He's going to buy 1 BTC for himself to get familiar with the process and how it all works.  Then once we have it up and running he's going to do the first purchase himself to test it.

Then why was anyone concerned when they approached 51%?  I'm aware a pool is thousands of individuals, but the nature of the pool is that the work of those thousands of individuals is organized such that it appears as a single individual to the Bitcoin network, at least as I understand it.  Following that, it seems that coopting a pool owner (or, as you pointed out, perhaps a few of them) to then work together might give a bad actor control over the network.
The question then, is whether multiple players working together can, in fact, do anything nefarious if given control of a majority of the network.

I understand that it's an issue with SSL, which would be used to encrypt certain types of internet communications.  The blockchain is not encrypted (you don't have to login to download it), so you should be fine.  Basically you can still use the internet, just assume that any account that requires you to log in has been compromised.  
So if you had an online wallet like Blockchain, for example, you'd be worried.  You're offline, so your coins should be fine.  (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong)

You mentioned coin-to-coin trading as an option, but I'm hesitant because this is exactly what happened to me at MtGox.
I never used them to convert USD --&gt; BTC, I just sent BTC so I could trade it, intending to only ever withdraw BTC.  They decided (after i deposited, of course) to require verification and everything, then shut down.  Now they've got ALL my info, the BTC I sent, and I'm sitting here wondering if the same thing will happen here.
So if I, in the US, want to trade between BTC and some other crypto, can I still do this?  Do you require verification for non-fiat deposits and withdrawals?

How exactly did you withdraw these coins?  Was your balance simply sent to you or was this the result of a BTC withdrawal request you made before they went tits up?  It's an important distinction because, assuming this is legit in the first place, it tells us whether any user action was required to initiate this (they're following up on your original withdrawal request) or if they're doing it on their own to clear their books or something.
Seems fishy, but I'm still hoping it's legit.

Quick, potentially off-topic about the warrant canary.
What's to stop them from putting something in the warrant or court order preventing you from updating that page?  I mean, a warrant canary only works if it can't be updated or modified by the party we're trying to watch out for, right?  
So, honest question for anyone with such a system in place, how do we know the warrant canary is legit?  
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:21:50


Okay, that makes good sense.  I've definitely heard of and seen warrant canaries before but never really understood how they could be useful, given that a court order could just prevent you from posting a note saying you've been compromised.  This makes sense - regularly post that you *haven't* been compromised, and whenever that fails to be updated we can assume they're tainted.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:41:29
Ok, so we can expect to see what, a date stamp on that canary?  If it's not updated, GTFO?

I like that last paragraph re-wording.  
Since each hash has the same odds of wining that particular block's payout, it's more like a lottery ticket with incredibly low odds of winning rather than a computing power pissing contest to see who wins.  
Mining pools in this context can be thought of as office lottery pools where a bunch of people go in on a ton of tickets, thereby increasing their odds of a win.  Each winning payout is then split among those who contributed, usually in proportion to the amount that each individual contributed to the pool (how many tickets they bought).  This still doesn't guarantee that they will win however, since any dude off the street can go in and buy a lottery ticket on his own and possibly win the whole thing.

@_date: 2015-04-03 18:12:58
Are you aware that this invalidates all the checksum-related methods your customers have for verifying their device's integrity?  
If this is legit, publicize the shit out of it on your website, along with any other such deals.  Not because we care who sells them, but because the checksums will be different due to customized firmware.  Understand that the only datapoint we have is a mismatched checksum, which could result from an innocuous customized footer or malicious code.  We can't tell the difference - all we know is that something changed from what you told us it would be.
Post hashes from all Mycelium-approved firmware images, whether or not they're available from you directly.  Without that, OP has nothing but this comment to assure him/her that the device they received is actually legit.
EDIT: One further point, it's important that you reference these new checksum verifications on YOUR site, as opposed to the reseller doing it.  If asicminer-shop, for example, posts a checksum for the modified image, all that does is ensure that the device wasn't reprogrammed between their warehouse and the end user.  It does nothing to reassure the user that the device was sound when YOU made it.  Post all Mycelium-approved hashes on your site directly, and this can all go away.

I studied Electrical Engineering, and never really got the point of statistics (though I know much of that is dependent upon the instructor, and mine sucked).  I think very simply - I'll build a circuit and plug it in, and it will either work or it won't.  
That said, if you love something like this, I hope you're able to dive in and go for it.  There's nothing quite like finding a field you know you were born for, and excelling at it.  
Until my interest in Bitcoin started, I never cared about any of this (statistics, that is).  I know enough to understand your explanations, but it's a completely different way of thinking and I never would have figured it out on my own.  I appreciate your taking the time to respond.

...as opposed to trying every possible combination to a password, where you will eventually run out of combinations and crack it by default.  Also, your solving a block apparently has no bearing on my success (or lack thereof).
Okay, so I guess both of my assumptions above were incorrect.  Each hash found has an equal opportunity to solve the block, and the GPU miners do better simply because they can create the hashes more quickly/often.  Same probability + higher frequency = more payouts.

The whole idea of change addresses has always confused me.  If I can pay with exact change for every purchase, why would a change address be required at all?  Your $100 purchase scenario applies to fiat because the notes are denominated in amounts that do not easily correlate to purchase prices.  If all BTC transactions are accurate down to the Satoshi, why do I need to worry about ever receiving change?

That makes good sense.  I'm paid in USD, so it makes sense that the value of a Bitcoin will always be relative to that.  Further, until an entire transaction can occur in Bitcoin (get paid in Bitcoin, then use Bitcoin to buy something that was made from parts purchased in Bitcoin, for example), it will be difficult to see this really happen.  
It's just an interesting perspective that I, as someone who lives in the world of the USD, really don't care what the exchange rate is to, for example, the Yen.  I have no need to perform this conversion, so I don't really care what the rate is.  Everything I buy and sell can be had with USD.  The same could be said of anyone using the Yen with no intent to convert it to USD.  I just look forward to the day when this can be true of BTC.

This is really the scenario I was thinking about.  I realize there are approximately one metric assload of possible addresses, but if they're each generated from a hashed seed, it stands to reason that two wallets could use the same seed ("sausage" in your example).  So, if you and I use the same seed to generate a wallet ID, I would expect that we both would have access to any funds that wallet can access.  It really is that simple, isn't it?

Actually this was confusing to me as well.  I have only one wallet.dat file but many addresses.  
As an example, if I receive four transactions at 0.5 BTC each to four unique addresses, the bitcoin client will allow me to send one big transaction in the amount of 2 BTC.  But from what you and this article are saying, it sounds like what's actually happening is that I'm conducting four small transactions from each of my four deposit addresses to the same send address, but it is presented as a single big transaction.
Am I understanding this correctly?  I sort of thought each address I give out for payment was like a funnel into a big hopper that is my "main" bitcoin wallet.  I'm starting to think this isn't entirely accurate.

BitInstant with cash at something like CVS.  When you set it up at BitInstant's site, have them send it directly to your BTC address.  I did this a couple weeks ago and the transaction was waiting for confirmations in my wallet when I got back from the store.  10/10, will use again.

FWIW in the US at least, you should talk to an EA (Enrolled Agent) before a CPA.  CPA's have a lot of very generalized knowledge which is hugely useful in a lot of situations, but the EA is specifically trained up and certified in tax.
Bonus, since no one knows this, EA's can't charge as much.  Result - better, cheaper advice.
EDIT: followup.  You're correct about the commodity metaphor.  I've explained Bitcoin to my wife (she's an EA), and the best analogy I can come up with is buying things directly with gold bars.  As far as the gub'mint is concerned it's not really worth anything until you cash it out for USD, so you don't have to report it until that point.  At least until the IRS comes up with another way to confuse the issue, that's how we're proceeding.

How do you make sure it works?  I mean, with my luck I'd go through all that and years later find that I copied the wallet address incorrectly, sending all my cold storage funds into the black.
Would you then take that bitcoin-qt computer, connect it to the internet to download the blockchain to check that your transactions are actually coming through?  
I guess I appreciate all the steps required for a true cold storage wallet, but I get nervous about the fact that I can't easily confirm that a transaction landed in my wallet.

It's great to see you guys post info like this.  I've used your service three times now without a hitch, and yet I keep hearing people on this subreddit bashing you guys for taking longer than they think you should.
The Bitcoin world is flooded with scams, so everyone is hyper sensitive to anything even smelling of impropriety.  Much like the ButterflyLabs issue, many of these so-called scams are in fact perfectly honest services run by people who are effectively learning on the job.  Nothing wrong with that, just be honest about it.  Good on you for trying to get out in front of this.  
A bit of advice:  Though they can most surely be annoying from time to time (I've worked CS and tech support), your customers are forking of sometimes very large sums of cash with nothing but your word (or more accurately, text on a web page) to assure them that you won't just take their money and run.  As the service provider, it's on you to assuage these fears and put your customers at ease.  Responsive customer service, preferably with an option to talk to a live human, perhaps a real-time order processing update ("deposit received" --&gt; "processing" --&gt; "payout sent" --&gt; "transfer complete", you get the idea), these are just a couple suggestions for ways to prevent this sort of unnecessary outrage in the future.  
When it comes to Bitcoin the old adage, "no news is good news" does not apply.
Keep up the great work!

FYI - got this to work with BFGMiner on Slush's pool.
* I registered a new worker (not sure if it was the worker name or what, but I noticed that the "password" field in the log always showed blank)
* Downloaded bfgminer into its own directory (got version 3.0.2)
* Created the batch file with this: bfgminer -o  -u [username.workername] -p [worker_password]
Ran that batch file and it worked.  I have no idea why it worked now but not before, but thanks to all of you guys for your help.  The only major thing I changed was registering the new worker.  I don't know if it just didn't like "jally1" as a password or what, but I made the worker and password both "1" and it seems happy now.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:37:37
For now, yes.  I just meant that I think there's a long term view here where someday this won't be the case.  A Bitcoin will have value in and of itself, just like your fiat currency of choice does today.

Could this approach be used with the flash drive described above?  I mean, it seems far simpler to purchase (and physically secure) a flash drive running Linux than a dedicated laptop.  
I've read about this procedure before, but the requirement for a dedicated laptop threw me.  If it worked on a flash drive, that would change everything.

That's interesting, since there are so many links to old ones.  I guess people have migrated to some other platform...?
I was hoping for something 'dead simple' like the code in the referenced blog post was supposed to be.  I had a fresh install of Python 2.7, had to go grab httplib2 and tweak the import statement for json.  Then I got stuck on the SSL cert issue.
Does [the code]( he links to work for you?  It's entirely possible I'm missing something really simple.
Perhaps another approach would be to ditch Python altogether.  I only chose it because I figured it would be easiest.  I'm open to other languages - are you aware of a simple (but working) trading bot written in another language?

Apparently he's paid some people a small fraction of their deposits, but he's not really communicating with anyone with any sort of consistency.  That's the worst part, feeling like he's just not paying attention.

@_date: 2013-06-12 22:42:08
Excellent response, thank you.  
I always figured that when an algorithm like this was cracked, it came out of nowhere from some kid in his mom's basement.  I didn't realize it was analyzed to the point where you could actually anticipate someone cracking it.
Your second point I think is especially insightful.  If they broke Bitcoin, they'd give away a huge strategic advantage (that they may or may not even have at present), so given that we're not really that much of a strategic threat, it's unlikely that they'd waste their time coming after us.  
Another thought I just had - when they freeze fiat accounts, they always seem to do it with the cooperation of the bank in question.  That is, they don't just hack in and empty the account (thus giving away their ability to crack world banking encryption systems), they strongarm the bank into freezing the account and turning over the funds.  This would strengthen the argument that they don't yet have the power to do this, or at least haven't seen fit to tip their hand to that particular ability.
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:40:49
The main reason I looked into cold storage is to secure them in case something happens to me and my wife needs to use these coins someday.  They need to be super secure because she doesn't understand the whole Bitcoin thing at all and would just need to use them as cash.
This whole process is intimidating to me, and I've been working on computers my whole life.  I don't see any way I could make up a set of instructions that anyone at the "next of kin" level would be able to follow.  And that's unfortunate.
Here's something that might help...  Can someone go through this process on a Windows 7 box and actually make screenshots of each step?  For example, how do you download software and then get it on to a Linux distro running off a pendrive?  Does it recognize your system's hard drives when it boots so that it can copy files?  For that matter, how do you install software without using apt-get?  I think the package manager can do this, but I'm pretty new to Linux so I'm not sure...
This guide is the most detailed one I've seen yet (nice work, btw), but it's only going to be useful to those who understand how to work with Linux Live CD type installations and are conversant in things like "signing" a transaction.  Most of us just fire up the -Qt client or something similar and hit "send coins".

Not at all.  They're taking proceeds from a sale and obfuscating the origin of that money.  They still control it, but it's difficult or impossible to follow the trail.  It's an honest question - how is this not money laundering?

Yeah, it's current.  I had a fresh install anyway, and then EasyMiner automatically upgrades to the latest version when it runs for the first time.  so yes, it's current.
It keeps saying it can't get work from this address.  Tried both api.bitcoin.cz:8332 and now stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333, with the same error message.  It also says I haven't specified a port or that I haven't set up workers.  I have done both of those things, and checked myself multiple times.  It's weird - I used Slush for a long time, with good results when I was GPU mining.  No idea why it's not working now.

This is good to know.  It was my first time messing with SSL at all, and the code does indeed look pretty hairy.  I think I'll stay away from it going forward.
Thanks again.

They blasted through January in like 3 days, but they've been hung up on February for a while now.  I'm just hoping they get to my order before they declare bankruptcy.

Wow.  Really?  That's...  That's actually a pretty dang good idea.  Bravo.

The only TLA I recognized in that statement was, well, "TLA".

Yes, you just can't withdraw.  This goes for BTC withdraws too, not just to a bank account.  It's annoying, but once you're verified it works like a charm.

I love when two individuals with differing viewpoints can come together with an open and honest exchange of ideas, free of hatred and vitriol.
Well done, my friend.  I would like to invite you to my daughter's birthday party.

Sweet!  I'm in the queue at 38xx, ordered in late July.  Should be right around the corner!

Thanks, bro.
I finally did get a response from TF on the matter.  He's offering to let people cash out if we redenominate the deposits in USD as of the time the deposits were made... I think.  So basically each deposit in BTC was translated to the equivalent USD value at the time it was made, and they're all added up.  It's still significant, but in terms of BTC I'm still taking a huge loss given all the recent ticker activity.  It's working out to about an 80% loss.
Oh well.  I'm not happy about it but it's better than nothing and I REALLY don't want to get the police or a lawyer involved.  Can you imagine how badly they'd screw this up?  I'll chalk it up to a learning experience.  CoinLenders sounded too good to be true, and it turns out it was.  Time to print up a couple paper wallets and bury them in an old metal box next to the giant oak tree in a Maine hayfield under a big volcanic rock.  (Shawshank Redemption?  Anyone?)
Thanks for your concern, it's much appreciated.

Thanks for this!
I'm a newbie to embedded linux and only a bit more experienced with Python, so I still had to do a fair bit of research to get this to work.  Also, I'm on the BeagleBone Black, though the fact that they both run embedded Linux seems to make them more universal than I would have thought.
No LCD on my end, but this is a complete python script that spits the result out to the command line.  Hopefully it will be useful for anyone who might need a bit more hand holding:
    
    
    # This allows handling the URL and API return data,
    # which is in JSON format
    import urllib2
    import json
    from datetime import datetime
    
    
     the actual API call
    rawdata = json.load(urllib2.urlopen('   )
    
    # The above will give us the complete JSON-formatted response
    # from MTGOX.  Time to format it, pulling only the display data we want.
    ticker = rawdata["return"]["last"]["display"]
    
    # Now for a timestamp.
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%b %d %H:%M:%S - ')
    
    # now print it.
    print timestamp + ticker
    
     a graceful exit
    exit()
    
Output from this script looks like this:  
    root python BTCPriceCheck.py
    May 30 14:37:48 - $129.00

I thought about cancelling as well, but I paid in BTC.  With the price increase over the last year I'd be so far in the hole AND have no mining equipment, it just didn't make sense.  So happy they're shipping now, I can't wait to see how these things perform.
I got that e-mail the day after Jody said she'd sent orders to production through June 3.  That means they shipped almost a month's worth of backorders in a day or so.  It'll be a while for you, but at this rate it shouldn't be as long as you're fearing.  Good luck to you...

That's good to hear.  They don't pay out very often (when compared to some other pools), but I guess the lower cluster hasnrate means fewer miners, which means higher payouts per block found.  I guess it evens itself out.
What's a DGM payment anyway?  I get pay-per-share, but DGM is new to me.

As I understand it, the problem lies in people's tendency to be unable to completely separate their personal lives from the things they buy.
For example, you're correct in saying that the only thing the bitcoin ledger will give you is bitcoin addresses.  But what if you use one of those addresses with an account at, say, MtGox, where you've proven your identity with a photo ID, bank account, blood sample or whatever else they make you do these days.  Your real info is now linked with a BTC address - poof, your anonymity is shot.  Not only that, but now they can see who you sent money to and received money from, and it becomes a bit easier to identify people tangentially related to you as well.
It's not that the bitcoin ledger can somehow finger you, it's just that you're very likely to have it touch t least some part of your personal life, and once that link is made you can consider yourself identified.

I'm in California but you had a 3-day head start.  No idea how long it takes to ship to the Netherlands.  
The race is on...
