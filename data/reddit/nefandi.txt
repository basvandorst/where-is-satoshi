More like leave your cash-filled wallet on a park bench in the New York City.  Someone sitting in Stockholm's Starbucks steals your wallet from the NYC's park bench.
Not cool.

In one case the thief has to be physically present, thus taking a personal risk and exposing oneself.  In the other case the thief can be anywhere in the world, behind 7 proxies, stealing shit pretty much risk-free.

Bitcoin faces too many technical hurdles at this point.
I think the *principle* behind the bitcoin is sound, and that's good.
The bitcoin software is not intuitive to use for the average person, and it must be stupid easy to use even for a chimp in order to get adopted widely.
Secondly and perhaps even more importantly, bitcoin client must be dramatically more secure than it is now.  As it stands it's all too easy for a hacker who has admin access to your computer to steal coins from it.  This is not acceptable.  I mean, it's not even slightly acceptable.  This is money we are talking about.
If I have a chunk of gold sitting on my desk, a hacker in Sweden cannot steal it from me.  Bitcoin has to reach that level of security to be competitive.  Bitcoin client coders must assume that bitcoin software is running on a compromised computer and make it secure with that assumption in mind.  If this cannot be done, then bitcoin goes nowhere.  I certainly won't use bitcoins if I know they can be stolen so easily and cheaply.  My guess is that bitcoin client must run inside an encrypted virtual machine to be secure in the manner I demand.  I believe some virus scanners already use such technique, but if someone knows better, please correct me.
I think current generation bitcoin software is more like a proof of concept alpha-quality software.  It's going nowhere fast.

Paypal should ideally be boycotted no matter what and this latest shenanigan is not the reason why it should be boycotted because it's just one in a long series of shenanigans Paypal engages in.  It doesn't matter what your stance on bitcoins is.  You can love bitcoins or hate em, but praypal still sucks.

So you expect aunt Tilly to burn a live-cd and then to partition a flash drive and then encrypt it and make it accessible from a live-cd bootup?
@_date: 2011-08-07 20:01:58
It's a good concept but it's obviously not ready for prime time.  Bitcoins need more work.

Screens would have to be captchas and possibly randomized between each run. :)  Not very usable.

I am a programmer.  I just don't know if it's impossible or not.  I believe virtual machines might be made very hard to manipulate.  Cryptographic cipher depends on computation required to crack it being expensive rather than absolutely impossible.  I believe similar logic might apply to virtual machines.  It might be possible to make a virtual machine that is prohibitively expensive to fiddle with.
I don't know.  I haven't researched it.  But if I was going to do some research, virtual machines would be the direction I would go in.
@_date: 2011-07-13 02:22:48
Exactly.  Even assuming we could make a hard to manipulate virtual machine, which I am not sure is possible, we still have to deal with the information that's going to be displayed on the screen.  The logic goes that if a human can read the screen and click on it, so can the computer.  Yup.
Sadness.  I think you're right and the only real path forward is some kind of read-only live-cd.  Even then, we have to hope the virus did not flash itself into CMOS, ready to pounce even when booting from clean media.
I do think security is essential.  I don't know why other people are so cavalier about it.  They keep saying how if someone steals my bitcoins it's my fault.  I am not buying it.  I can be expected to take only a reasonable amount of effort to keep my bitcoins safe.  I should not be expected to take crazy and unreasonable efforts to do it, like maintaining two separate computers, managing two wallets, etc.

And how is an encrypted home partition going to appear on aunt Tilly's computer?
@_date: 2011-07-13 09:57:16
So bitcoin is not going to be popular except with a small niche of people.  Regular people don't want to deal with this insanity.  Two computers, one offline one online, both need to have bitcoin software on it, etc...  It's a usability nightmare.
My prediction is that even savvy people are too lazy to bother with this.  Wait till we get a few more theft scandals.
@_date: 2011-07-13 02:57:15
The problem is that your setup requires an unreasonable amount of computer savvy to realize.  It fails the ease of use requirement.
As long as only the tech savvy people can use bitcoins safely, they will be niche at best.
