Exactly! People expressed same disbelief in '14 about possibility of bitcoin hitting $20k in 3-4 years. Institutional movement into this space could easily grow it another 10x beyond previous ATH.

He has more than a single lucky call. Draper was largest first round investor in Tesla. Big investor in SpaceX. Outbid everyone on first USGov bitcoin auction for 30,000 bitcoins in '14. Theranos was a strike out, but Draper's overall batting average is off the charts.

Keep race baiting you low IQ Basic. Keep endorsing Grooming Gang rape. Keep your eyes closed to whats happening. You're the racist.

You don't grasp statistical significance. You're clearly unable to recognize patterns or to acknowledge that there is an overwhelming disproportionate incidence of Muslim Grooming Gangs raping underage girls in UK. Cry racism more you low IQ Basic. That's the only word you know. Keep race baiting, and outing yourself as the NPC Basics you are.

Exposing Pakistani Grooming Gangs raping thousands of underage girls in UK is not racist. You're an ignorant race baiter. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:26:09
You don't know how many Pakistani Grooming Gangs he has brought to the public's attention. He brought it to mine. The BBC won't tell you. You aren't open to accepting it.

Keep avoiding overwhelming disproportionate rapes by Muslim Grooming Gangs in UK. Pretend it doesn't happen. Pretend the BBC is telling you what's really happening. Pretend you're not a low IQ Basic NPC.

Gov't has monopoly on educating youth, 90% in public school. Hard for private sector to compete with "fake free." The most unilinear and narrow minded way to cultivate learning in a free society. Left preaches "diversity" and "inclusion," but wants government entrusted with educating everyone according to their own slave mind ideas.

I don't think this is accurate analysis. When a traditional stock (which cannot be fractionalized) is in limited supply, this line of reasoning may have some validity ($100k+ Bershire Hathway, $300 Tesla, $1,000 Amazon etc). But with Bitcoin, and virtually unlimited divisibility... it's short sighted to think there are only 21 million fungible units. There are 21 million bitcoins x 100 million Satoshis (base units) that can be traded.
One can just as easily say that there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 QUADRILLION units within Bitcoin that are fungible (currently 17 million bitcoins in circulation is 1,700,000,000,000 QUADRILLION units).  This is certainly not "relatively few." It doesn't really matter if Satoshi had created 1 million or 1 billion bitcoins. Because of the divisibility, either one can theoretically absorb the entire fiat system, stock market, etc, etc.

Dismiss Brock all you want, I did, until I actually listened to him speak. I don't think there's a single person that understands the economics of the crypto space better. Plenty have a better grasp of certain technicals... but not the intersection between technicals and economics. He looks like a weirdo but he's got invaluable insight. The EOS "scam" has already provided a 7% dividend in 4 months to all holders and is growing the Dapp ecosystem more than anyone.

You're a race baiter. Tommy Robinson is one of the only people to stand up to the Grooming Gangs raping thousands of underage girls in the UK. You stand with Grooming Gang rapists. I stand with Tommy Robinson.

Nevada (Reno in particular) is actually a very ideal location. Nevada - No State Income Tax + Tech Industry Talent beginning to move in. Cost of living is far below Bay Area, Seattle, Los Angeles, NYC, Austin. Tesla Gigafactory, and all the supporting industry infrastructure, beginning to move in. 
Nevada will be one of the next major tech hubs.

There are thousands of girls this has happened to. One incident???? You're absolutely ignorant to what is happening in the UK.

You're the gender baiting retard, shoving identity politics into this. Calling Satoshi a "he" is fine. Typical Bay Area reactionary retard.

You're spot on. It's revealing that after the media exposure of these atrocities, purported Lefty purveyor's of women's rights and equality, won't acknowledge and overtly stand up against this. When their own daughters are affected, maybe they'll change their biased thinking. It only reveals how many on the Left are not interested in any type of equal justice. They have a more twisted agenda.

Since it's digital... being divisible means everything. Nobody wants one million Zimbabwe paper bills either, because   the currency is worthless.
.0000300 of a bitcoin will not jiggle around in your car seat. There's nothing nearly identical involved to the painstaking hassle of individually counting out 30 separate worthless pennies and putting them in stacks on the counter. There isn't any extra labor involved in storing, collecting, spending any amount of bitcoin, versus the trouble of collecting all the different denominations required to pay a cash bill of $17.38 with exact change.
