Buy 50$ worth each week for a few months (or whatever you can afford to lose).

Too bad I'm broke, it was a "what if" answer :-D
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:31:13
I wouldn't announce it. I'd just cash out 10-20 bitcoins at a time and live a good life, while donating 10% to charity, family and friends.

Yea man, fight the power!
But ... when the whisky wears off, you need to realize something about the world: It's not perfect. So greedy people will find ways to make it worse, less greedy people will find ways to make it better.
Bitcoin is a tool, and it all depends on what WE the society do with it.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:08:13
Fine, I'll shut up.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:01:07
How long have you been trading crypto-currencies ?
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:27:24
Market cap is going down as well, from 145B, to a low of 133B, and now it's at 139B.
This is insane!
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:07:27
I'm hoping this happens. I'll buy whatever drops the most (BTC/BCH/alts).
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:07:07
None of the above, since I don't have any BTC :-) (only alts)
I want to see something drop (BTC/alts/maybe BCH), and then I'll buy with $.

There are 10 kinds of people, those that understand binary, those who don't, and those who didn't expect this joke to be in base 3.

I hope that investing 100$/week will even things out  over the long term
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:34:50
All this good news about Bitcoin makes me nervous that another crash will follow
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:52:59
Every time mainstream media writes good things about Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) - it starts crashing.
And when they write that Bitcoin is dead, it start going up like crazy.
I have no idea wtf is going on, but I think I'll wait before I invest more.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:09:27
I suspect the price of BCash will drop in the next period, as exchanges allow it to be traded more and more. Then, it's possible to start seeing adoption. My 2 cents on the matter. When it drops significantly, I may think of buying (don't own BTC or BCash atm).
PS: I know, I spelled BCrap wrong
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:56:38
I doubt that BCH will fill the role of conversion between fiat and altcoins. I guess we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:25:45
That's 0.13% of the transaction amount.
I'd say it's not bad.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:15:05
How ? It's much harder in a decentralized system because there are exactly 2 participants
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:43:12
The ban is fake news man ... presumably by some criminals that want to drop the price of BTC to buy more from themselves (Wall Street, China's government).

You know phones are designed to spy on their users, right ? To offer better services, sure, but the same features used by Apple or Google can be used by 3rd party, malicious apps.
Just read [this article]( - and these are just official apps on Play store. The spyware, by the way, can contain keyloggers and app for screenshots, enough info to steal your wallet.
I also like [this talk by John McAfee]( - it's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:04:10
[This will answer your question](
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:50:05
Uhm, just rotate the bitcoin chart, you'll get something like this 
But no, I didn't find a chart for this, although you can make one using 
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:30:43
That's no longer decentralised :-) you have the coinbase middleman.
The closest thing I've seen is what an altcoin did (forgot which one). A period of time after the transaction, you can "reverse it", which basically puts it in an escrow account. For the money to reach one side, it needs the approval of the other.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:52:53
Be careful when storing money on unsecure devices (aka your phone).

I quite like [this answer by Andreas Antonopoulos]( It's mostly about China banning mining, but the answer should be also valid about trading.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:21:23
Uhm ... check any BTC graph. 1 BTC = 10^8 satoshi
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:11:40
1. If your BTC is stolen or lost, it's not recoverable. With banks you at least have a chance of getting it back.
2. Uniformity (eg. the split wouldn't have happened if BTC was centralized)
You basically want to know which are better, centralized or decentralized systems. Nature mostly works with decentralized systems, and I tend to think that they are better since nothing is infallible.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:35:20
Neah, just send them to me. I'll make sure they're not lost!
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:30:39
You can't even trust the 1% anymore !!!
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:53:42
I dunno, blocked accounts on exchanges, a weird split, mass panic. Just throwing stuff out there
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:09:27
"Not likely" should be at 3-4.
0 should be "No fucking way".
