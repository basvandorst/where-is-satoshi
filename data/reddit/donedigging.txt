All of the world keeping its savings in Bitcoin? Why would anyone keep their savings in something that's so volatile? A speculative investment, sure.

How do coins get lost? Would they get lost at anything more than a negligible rate? Especially with the value that they are.

The inherent deflationary nature of Bitcoin makes it a poor choice for currency. Look up what happens when currency becomes reliably more expensive over time. It is terrible for the financial well-being of a country.

Fair enough, but it's unlikely that many Bitcoins will be lost at this point.

There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will become widely adopted by the public. It's certainly possible but with the wild fluctuations that Bitcoin has been experiencing, I have a tough time believing large corporations or even small businesses will start paying people in Bitcoin.

So if I'm understanding correctly you're taking it as a foregone conclusion that Bitcoin will be worth 10 or 20 times what it was at the peak? Hasn't it come out relatively recently that bitcoin markets are subject to some extreme manipulation? 
They are just far too many variables that are in play. What if Bitcoin becomes extremely regulated or illegal? If ultra wealthy investors seek to crash the market? If quantum computers ruin the encryption? If another competing cryptocurrency with superior technology surpasses Bitcoin? There are literally hundreds of scenarios that would cause Bitcoin to permanently crash. To look at Bitcoin as anything other than a wildly speculative investment is foolish at best.
