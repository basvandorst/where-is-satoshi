Hard to tell really. There are more variables here in December then there were even back in Sept/Oct when it tanked by like, 40+%
So could this be another 40% dip? Sure.
 
But Bitcoin is exponentially more "known/talked about" by the general public and news than it was even 2-3 months ago.
Hell, CBS Money Watch has talked about bitcoin for a few days now and a handful of times in the last week or so. They NEVER EVER EVER mention bitcoin... and now they are back to back to back days.
Now, when they talk about it in a good light "in just 24 hours, bitcoin has gone from $10,000 to $15,000", we see a freaking $4k+ day skyrocket.
Today it's "bitcoin peaked from $15,000 to $19,000 and is now back below $15k and very volatile" 
Well, that might spread fear and force more of a sell-off. 
So you can see, more people know about it and want to buy and will see a good investment opportunity with this being a dip. However, the other side of that coin is that the more people know about it, they more people there are to sell when they hear bad things about it. 
If history can be an indicator, expect a 20-40% dip. This would mean anywhere from $3k-8k.... if you disregard that $19k "literally 1 second spike" and use the $17,700(ish) high, then at $14,500 we already see the 20% dip... but if it goes to the 40% dip, well, it might go down to $9-10k again.
But again, so many are emotional buy/sellers so human elements will absolutely be in play. So anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's. 
But mine is a semi-decent "educated guess" if one can exist for bitcoin markets. lol

Same here. 
Cost me seriously just a tad over $1k

Seeing I was trying to buy in at $4,107 and it's now damn near $4,400 again!!!! RAGE!!!!

As soon as the SEC approves it, and the government regulates/taxes it. That way they can truly treat it as collateral and take control over it. It's the only recourse (control) that a bank or financial institution has that makes your collateral worth the air you breath in order to ask the question. 
Without the ability to take ownership of it immediately, it's worthless as collateral. And banks won't touch it until/unless the IRS has clear definitions and standards and rules for it. 
Sucks, but likely true.

Well, bought and sold twice. I do it to gain more bitcoin. And it's worked nicely today. Likely HODL from here on unless I see a massive sell-off triggered again

Ah. Yeah, I get you :) 
I always just hold unless I see huge indicators like this morning to sell and then buy and then sell and then buy. 
Picked up extra coin for the same exact account value today :) So... overall a win. I don't do it often, but I do sometimes.

haha yeah.
I sold it when it got back up to $4460 for a tick there... now have limit order at $4,350 but cancelling cause might go further down.
This is more exciting than se.... nah, it's ALMOST as exciting as sex. haha But lasts longer :)

Same thing with mine.
I had random little bits worth in there.
Forgot about it for literally 2 years. It was worth a few hundred when I checked a few months ago. haha

I kept buying coins and spending them... 
I seriously remember buying $350 worth of coin and it being like, 10+ coins... only to spend them. Did that 4-5 times.
I now kick myself in the ass for spending them!!!! Ugh!!!!

to see 100 coin per minute? I don't see the specifics either, but it's reflecting on bitstamp
