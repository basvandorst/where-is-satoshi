Not anymore, they're now the most popular XT wallet.
Besides, it's hardly an argument, when did being the most popular x actually mattered in a discussion which should be based on LOGIC ?
You also mention " considerable virtues " Which are its virtues, please enlighten us, is it spending millions on advertisments a virtue nowadays? Anyone can build a pretty UI with the money they got from investors, not anyone can choose to protect their userbase against oppressive influence from govs/banks it seems.
As for OP, its not censorship, they're running an altcoin software, decision is completely justified whereas what they do with user funds...

What's wrong with hiding usernames? Maybe it would lead to better debates when there's no more pressure of one's ego reflecting through their online persona.

1) Regarding first part, I already replied to the other post but your argument holds little value as currently it appears to me that core devs already are building and working on the project they care about. Its just that this project is not the altcoin you're hoping for.
2) Are they also responsible for not speaking up against war, famine or any act of evil in the world? This is just politics, they are speaking through the code they write about censorship and preserving basic human freedoms. I don't need any clear standing from them on any other mater.
Sorry but I'll have to disagree. I don't mean clinically retarded like so many posts here would otherwise indicate, just that their general level of intelligence is below the level necessary to conduct debates on sensible subjects. I can see how that works in your favor as being the sheeple they are they do tend to follow any authority figure with mindless support.
As a matter of diplomacy empathy and principle, you should invest your energy into educating people about the great effort these guys are putting in to flourish the system while preserving its core values.
I care deeply about this project too as well as being financially invested in it that's why I'll sustain the core devs. I don't care about your coffees being recorded on the blockchain and as you're already using centralized service for sending tips over the internet I don't really get your stake in it.
I'll collect your tip and forward the btc to a core dev

I get you, software developer background myself.
No one said you shouldn't have opinions. Enforcing your political opinions to general public by abusing your position and commiting changes to a project that are not the result of consensus is a different matter.
I assume you're not in a position of taking business(read politics) calls at your company, why should it be any different for an open source project?
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:12:15
No it doesn't. 
5$ gets you 15GB
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:54:21
1) ?? Problem with bitcoin is not lack of dev talent. As soon as consensus is reached over integrating a certain change, I as well as so many other people around the world could write the code. It's not entry-level programming but ultimately bitcoin code is not really rocket science either compared to say kernel code 2) Agreed. Then stick to what they love maybe? If they love what they do and believe in it why the sudden desire to irrevocably change it into something else? 3) you answered this with nr 2)
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:35:41
Thanks for sanity check, you're right, discourse like that should be avoided
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:17:09
Make a bip on your fork to link to classic? What?
Why are you so keen on spreading this propaganda?
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:30:14
lots of transactions done at exactly 2016-01-22 13:04:50
Between 872 and 630 BTC each transaction being just slightly smaller than previous one
About 1100 transactions total lets average to about 700 
770000 BTC moved by a single person.
So who has control of so many BTC??
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:36:04
Never claimed they do. But most are on a power trip due to their position which can go bad if enough gullible people forget that devs aren't that good at other things besides... well... coding. They should leave politics for prolific business owners, investors etc
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:19:16
Your assumption about them having diverse enough set of interests is wrong. Proof can be found in the page support bitcoin classic.
I could write a whole bunch of text here but don't have the time or patience to explain why VCs are bad for an ecosystem. And I'm talking here on moral grounds not in the pure economical sense.
I have witnessed VCs influence both as a founder raising funds and by noticing the effects they have from the outside. As a founder, the moment you make a "pact" with them your company's direction will 95% of the times be steered by the VCs. There will be no more creativity or bold movements. Ever. Everything that will matter will be numbers, percentages, progression towards pre-established targets.
From the outside, it looks to me that they just want to jump ship on whatever has the potential to make more money for their investors. Which is obviously normal and sound but I personally don't think Bitcoin is about that nor do I believe that it should be a payment medium(mainly).
I don't believe in coffees on blockchain. Not if you want to keep Bitcoin decentralized, not if you want Bitcoin to resist censorship.
We already have superior systems for payments, centralized true (say Ripple) but ultimately its a trade-off to which Bitcoin should always say no

Doubtful, he just built his whole argument on bullshit rebuked thousands of times in the past and hearn's blog post.
He just pocketed some easy money from a propaganda machine paid probably by our bankster friends. 
Its becoming very clear they are organized and with many resources, infiltrators in key positions etc. Its an all out war from their end people need to open their eyes and take any info from this community with a calm cold judgement and mind for social proof, logical biases etc

You can move whole market cap into one transaction theoretically assuming all funds reside on one address. 
Practically due to funds being split in so many addresses there's no way you could fit it into a block.
It all depends on transaction sizes, how many outputs it spends etc..
Stop being lazy and use google

Did you actually fool anyone with these not even clever scam attempts?
Paypal? +5%? lol'd

Not just theymos, some big business leaders and developers are also united to produce irreparable damage to this technology
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:06:21
Not so "svbtle" pro-fork propaganda. Who else would initiate this specially after Greg made a post right today.
its almost as if this guy is paid to spread out this FUD.
Can't wait to have your classic fork and miners to realize that giving up governance to people doing drugs while having discussions of the future of the technology and paid puppets leads nowhere :)
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:47:40
More like pure money. 
We can all agree that people that want bitcoin to fail have much more money than we who want it to succeed.
Paid shills is a known tactic for diversionists employed so many times in so many different areas.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:41:43
Don't fall for this scam
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:41:36
I think their position on censorship is pretty clear since they reject changes that break decentralization in bitcoin-core. Including the hard-fork all VC's puppets are pushing for. Why don't you tell us your affiliation and reasoning for pushing this agenda? Nvm that I don't care, make a blog whatever, stop polluting online forums and leave the developers handle important problems.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:38:47
1) Who are you and why do they have to **clearly** commit to such a thing? Go make your own altcoin and stop expecting ridiculous claims from them.
2) Why do you imply core has anything to do with the censorship and why it should get into politics by making a clear stance on this when they should be focusing on developing core? Why do you believe they should care of how reddit is run. Clearly most people here are retarded, what you call "censorship" is mainly weeding out idiots following authority figures like sheep.
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:05:46
Well said, I believe most 2MB shills don't even have 10 BTC in stake, but I personally like this situation: now all the retarded sheeple that shills this subreddit and r/btc/ have found a leader in the druggie buy toomin and his "democracy".
Its just too funny to watch them fail.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:19:16
That's why you don't have even a 10$ company because then you'd know that having someone who can think for himself is more valuable than some politically correct monkey who just parades the office in a suit.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:38:38
It does in 0.12
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:45:38
An intelligent discussion can only be born out of an intelligent subject.
There are many like theymos and me who believe that a 2MB increase hard-fork with the purpose of postponing another hard-fork not only makes no sense but can have devastating effects on Bitcoin because it means that stupid won.
Theymos did the right thing, the same team behind XT is now pushing another split/hard-fork through this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:13:49
Another sad result of devs getting into politics when they should be sticking to being little code monkeys and stfu
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:58:06


Maybe read what follows after the first sentence before replying?
Of course you are taken "seriously", but you're not the one making the calls. 
I'm sure if you kept blabbering your opinions in your colleagues face, taking decisions by yourself that affect the whole company without their full consent, defrauding other companies to prove a point and spending just 0.0001% of your time writing code/doing research you'd be told to stfu and go back to doing your job or gtfo.
As you said code is king, how many lines of codes have these devs written lately? How many lines of reddit/mail?
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:19:27
Not everyone but most. Check the support list for bitcoin classic.
9/10 companies are VC sponsored. Could be a coincidence. Could be. Not the best argument I could come up with but definitely raises questions.
I don't see the relevance my name would carry in this discussion(or yours for that matter). More important is affiliation and motives.
My motives for supporting current core's plan is the main people involved(exception peter todd maybe) have proven through the code they pushed and decided not to push that they support the vision of this system(for decentralization and privacy). Yours?
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:32:24
I think in your analogy Bitcoin Classic should be the clown comittee  suddenly "elected" by the "people" to extend the original road making it twice the size. Little do they know that clowns are not very good at building roads or anything besides being goofy in general and as an effect, expansion of the road might ruin some houses that were built on the sides of the main road and potentially ruin the main road altogether by adding another layer made of shitty materials. Also due to bad mapping skills, we might end up with the road splitting in two at one point causing general confusion due to no road signs to take people to their intended destination.
Anyway, analogies are stupid to begin with when applied to sensitive matters like this but this should complete your story well.
Democracy is a failed way of governing, evidence almost every government on the planet today and the past century..
Truth is the majority cannot possibly grasp all the implications of certain matters. Its just a matter of limitation due to the level of intelligence. Therfore they cannot correctly choose between the 2 elites that have potentially the most control over their lives: the malevolent one able to easily manipulate the general public through disinformation, propaganda etc and the benevolent people who don't show their faces much because they're usually building shit and also because truth is uninteresting to masses.

Define "evolving".
XT isn't a viable alternative, neither is Unlimited - they both change the protocol.
People who want "evolution" should work for Blockstream and build sidechains. 
We need bitcoin-core to stay as close to the project's roots as possible, the only changes should be strictly performance improvements or security adjustments not things that break something that is clearly working just fine.
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:43:52
Why are people so overly dramatic? Plenty of dev talent around who gives a shit if a few people stop contributing.

Actually their exchange code is written by AlphaPoint, maybe they started out with Bitcoinica's leak but AlphaPoint lists them as customers.
Now this doesn't excuse them from this shitty situation but truth is building a scalable engine is a hard problem

If so, what do you think it will achieve (everyone knows the blocksize should be increased in the future) besides wasting 150BTC that could be for example donated to a charity or sponsoring one of the core devs.

If you want a toy to play at home sure otherwise expect heavy customer annoyance.
Just move on to a real thing - bitxatm seems to me best price/quality. Genesis also looks alright but at much higher prices. Everything else seems like toys and not a financial unit.
