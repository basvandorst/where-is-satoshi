The frustrating part is that the bank knows immediately if the cheque had cleared. They just get to lend that money out to someone else and sit on the interest accumulation for 6 weeks.

Nice to see you judging the majority by the actions of the minority.

As an Australian,  I'm not sure if Trump or Hillary will be better. Good luck in choosing your President, either way I'm sure the US will get what they deserve.

What? I just came home from work and read this news article on a reputable Australian website. Not sure where you are getting your info from.  The only reason I posted this is because I'm genuinely worried that the news could affect the price of bitcoin. I thought this was a welcoming community?

I don't see the connection. Are you downloading everything on Reddit? I realise that there are bitcoin clients that don't download the full blockchain. However, I have the full blockchain downloaded. That fact aside, surely this news will dissuade people from purchasing Bitcoins?

I just searched the front page of BTC. Bitcoin, BitcoinAll and BCH and  haven't seen anything related to this. Admittedly I haven't been on Reddit much today. Have you found any genuine answers? 
It's certainly not nice being attacked for asking questions or presenting news that might be critical of Bitcoin. Fuck me right?

Surely this news won't be good for investors, even if it isn't illegal?

I always thought it was CamelCase and Title Case.
