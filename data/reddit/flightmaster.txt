I use btcmarkets mate, definitely recommend it. Low fees, secure login, supports BPay and poli. Only issue is they don't support credit cards yet.

Only issue is their verification process uses snail mail, so takes literally forever to register

As a new investor, I very much appreciate this sort of advice. I see it a fair bit, just to HODL if you're not planning on playing the market. I'm not game to sell at all.

Yeah hell use the dip to your advantage (hopefully...)
