There is an iOS app called Shango which allows you to use a cloud node hosted on AWS. It’s in beta on testnet at the moment but you can sign up to test it. I’m also using it to remotely control my node which works great. The developer, Neogeno, is looking to release it open source this summer:

You set a minimum fee rate to route transactions but if I’ve understood it right, if it’s too high people will just choose not to route through you... Fees are super low on the network generally so I’m not expecting to make mega money through it!

Yep that’s the one!

I would second the Pi setup - complete noob but went through the guide step by step and really helped me set up my node. Spoke to Stadicus too at times and he was really helpful!

Of course! I followed this guide:  - Stadicus was an absolute gent and helped me out a couple of times throughout the process. Took a while to figure it all out but was well worth the effort. Let me know if you have any specific questions, happy to help where I can.
