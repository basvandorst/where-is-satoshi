I brought my piggy bank to coinstar a while ago.  I heard they do not accept coins for bitcoin though so you have to pay in dollar bills.

It is getting to the point where you can just save up bitcoin and spend it on something when the price goes high.  Pretty soon with the lightning network we may see more companies accepting bitcoin in general in the coming years.  I think that the need to cash out to fiat is going to be less and less as time goes by.  
It was intended to be used as a currency so I want to use it that way.  As a bitcoin customer, I do not have to worry about someone being able to drain my bank account.  It is safer than any money I could store in my safe which is pretty easily breakable.

Yeah, like when Paypal just decides to suspend your account because they do not agree with you politically.  Also like when all the major credit card payment systems tried to shut Wikileaks down.

I have a bitcoin shirt from Thinkpenguin (a linux hardware company) and a fellow bitcoiner just noticed me at a restaurant today.  It was pretty cool.

Funny coming from a scam company like JPM

People would need a compelling reason to switch.  Most people who use bitcoin love the fact that it is open source, decentralized, and owned by the people for the people.  Any corporate coin would need to meet a very high bar to make the rest of the market switch over.

Sweet, I like Domino's, I will have to try this sometime soon.  :)  So happy to see more widespread adoption of bitcoin.

yeah plus bitcoin is open source and there are already forks of it that have been tried but they have not seen widespread adoption.  If someone could make something better it would have been done and adopted by the whole market by now.  :)

It says they come with a 4 percent service fee and you probably have to do ID verification because it makes you setup an account.  You get a voucher code with the coinstar machine and you have to go to the coinstar website and input this before you get your bitcoin.

Hell the guy even looks a little like the CEO of JPMorgan.
