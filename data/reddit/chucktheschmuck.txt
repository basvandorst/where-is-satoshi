tech boom was 5 trillion dollars, adjusted for inflation thats like 8 trillion today.  Current market cap is 300 billion so we are less than 4% of the tech boom currently.  Also, I don't think most of us are questioning that a bubble is on the way, but bubbles like these are usually price outpacing value, not putting value where there is none.  Look at amazon, google, paypal and lotst of tech stocks from 2000. combined they are worth far more today than during the bubble.  Also, many of us are true believers that this is the new golbal currency.  Decentralized, deflationary , censorship proof and free from the manipulation of governments, central banks and their corporate lobbyists.

well, bcash is run by committee so what I said stands.  Are they free to do their attacks and try to push their flippining? Sure, but if their goal is a thriving crypto space and they win this fight they still lose.  If their goal is to make a quick buck in the short period where bcash would be on top before cryptos collapsed then it's a worthwhile battle for them.  
Full disclosure, I still have all my fork bcash so either way I maintain the cumulative value, but if bcash really overtook bitcoin, I would be weary of cryptocurrencies from that point on because it means ethereum could be the next flippining, then ripple then zcash after that then something we've never heard of.  I can't keep a balance in every currency and i certainly can't predict the future so I would avoid it from that point.

I'm in canada, that's what i was talking about.  Technically guns are not for self defence, but if you use a long gun you have shot of not being charged for some crime.
However; storage laws for hand guns are so insane, there is virtually no scenario where the police believe you were both storing your hand gun properly and had enough time to retrieve it to use for self defence. 
That's why I strategically store my shotgun.  I'd rather spend a few years in a cage than eternity in a box.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:47:52
I have to agree with the BCH guys on this.  A store of value I can't transact with is no store of value.  This entitled attitude that bitcoin will always be the number one game in town is terrible.  There are hundreds of alternatives waiting in the wings to overthrow bitcoin, and if another coin can do everything bitcoin can, but do it better and do more to boot, bitcoin will fade and be replaced.
The coin that wins will be the coin that most people want to use and hold, no one will want a coin that just sits there, pretty much unusable.
Before you throw the gold comparison at me, gold is a store of value compared to fiat because gold can't be endlessly inflated.  Any single coin can be made just as scarce as bitcoin, but if it has more utility it will become more valuable with time.

committee? what are you talking about?  I said that there is a natural force that will greatly favour Bitcoin if it becomes by far the biggest.  If billions of people hold their wealth in bitcoin, they will all independently try to maintain the status quo.  
Any kind of flipping would have to happen soon because there are few enough people, that the hoards of newcomers could choose something else at no loss.  Once everyone is in bitcoin there is a massive network affect that will favour it for the top spot.  Much more than say a service like a social media platform where there is virtually no cost to switching if something better or more trendy comes along.

trezor with hidden wallets feature.  I suggest at least 3.  Two decoys and one main wallet. 
1 - hidden wallet with ~ $3000-$6000 should you ever need to cross customs with all your wealth, like if you are moving to a new country.  A good chunk that would warrant the security of a hardware wallet but well below the typical declaration requirements. (if you are travelling or on vacation, get a second physical wallet that only has what you need).
2 - Another wallet with $10,000-$20,000.  This one is incase you are being physically robbed/held hostage.  A large enough amount that would be believable to be your main savings.  Also, should be enough that the robbers feel they have made a good score and happy to take their payday and GTFO.
 -3 Your "vault".  this should hold the bulk of your wealth.  Make sure it is protected by a good passphrase.

I'm saying that if it stays as just a store of value and is unusable as a payment system, it will eventually lose all it's value and be replaced by something that is both.  Essentially, without cheap, easy, frictionless payments it has no value.

I agree with this.  It's fine to say the network is going through growing pains, but that's not what I'm hearing.  I'm hearing that bitcoin is a "store of value not a payment system".  Bitcoin derives it''s utility and value from global frictionless transactions, if it's just a "store of value" like bullion sitting in fort knox then it has no value and is a ponzi scheme.
To be clear, it's the attitude and outlook I'm seeing that is concerning me, not so much that fees are high at this moment in time.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:37:07
this is exactly right.  Saying "it's the market!" is asinine.  This is the market acting within the artificial constraints of the network.  I was a no 2Xer, but now I'm questioning that decision.  We have 10% segwit adoption so, maybe 1.2mb weight on blocks.  2X would have increased the blocks to 2mb but would have probably expedited segwit adoption, block weights would have increased by a factor of 6.
Lightning isn't going to solve this problem either.  No one is using bitcoin for small transaction, this backlog is exclusively financial transactions, not retail so with lightning we will still have the same backlog and the same fee problem, and yes $20 to open a channel is unsustainable.  Right now fees are comparable to wire transfers which is the most expensive and archaic way to send money through a bank.  I've sent maybe 3 bank wires in the last 15 years. 
And god help us if the retarded media picks up on fee issues and uses that in their anti bitcoin slant.  It will be effective because it's true.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:40:08

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:48:08
excellent post, I was going to make a similar one myself.  The mantra of "store of value, not medium of exchange" is so misguided.  Bitcoin needs to be both, if not another coin will figure out how to maintain bitcoins decentralized and secure properties but will also have cheap fees, that's when it will eat bitcoin's lunch.
There is a toxic entitled attitude that bitcoin's place as the largest cryptocurrency is ordained by god.  *It is not!!* and hubris of the community will be it's downfall.
Lightning and other second layer implementations are innovative and exciting solutions, but we still need affordable on chain transactions.

I really can't see this happening, and if it does it would need to happen sooner rather than later. 
For example, the current market cap is $150 billlion, if a new more innovative currency were to replace bitcoin and send price crashing millions of people would be left holding the bag.  Not ideal, but seems certainly feasible.  However, lets say 3-5 years from now, bitcoin's cap is $5-10 trillion and a new more innovative currency usurps bitcoin and sends it's value crashing.  Billions of people would have lost much of their wealth and this would be a bad omen for cryptos as a whole.  Any asset that can be overtaken so quickly is no store of wealth.  Who would ever hold their wealth in something that is so risky?  Technological advancements are never going to stop, they are probably going to speed up so the new, innovative currency would be at the same risk of being replaced a few years late.
I see comparisons to myspace and facebook a lot, but what is the cost to switch between the two?  I sign up to facebook, upload some pictures and start adding friend.  Switching to a new crypto only favours the first few movers and everyone else is a big loser.
So what will stop this from happening?  The fundamental principal of money.  It's only worth what we collectively agree it's worth, so if billions of people are holding wealth in bitcoin, we all have a stake in making sure it keeps it's value.
This is what is so mind boggling to me about Jihan, Ver and co.  They really don't see that if they got their flippining it would be disastrous for all cryptocurrencies?

This is due to the difference between the European left and right and North American left and right.
In Europe, strong central authority is a given.  The difference is between national/ethnic central authority on the right, and international/continental/global central authority on the left.
Welfare states and wealth redistribution is a given, and I guess gun control can be on either side of the spectrum
In North America, the right is associated with little/no central authority and the left with large, powerful central authority.
Central authority covers economic issues such as welfare state and redistribution of wealth as well as social issues like gun control.  This is true both in theory and in practice

Inflation is a tax, it's called seigniorage.  As far as deflationary currencies, some theory says it's bad, some theory says it's good.  Fact is we don't know, since the advent of mintage, inflation and debasement have **always** been the practice.  from the greeks to the romans to today, there has never been a deflationary currency, not even one with natural inflation rate.  Governments will always be tempted to debase and always do.

I'm very pleased bitcoin has found a following amongst socialists.  In the end we need everybody on board.  However, if you dig deep into the goals and Ideals of socialism and leftist ideology in general, you will probably find that bitcoin is antithetical to that and simply doesn't mesh.
This will become more and more true as the privacy infrastructure of bitcoin improves.  If you can't control the distribution and flow of money you really can't finance the welfare state the left wants.  People don't pay taxes willingly, they are forced and if you can't freeze assets or garnish wages when people don't comply you are kinda screwed.

I'll learn more about how it works when it arrives, but can't you recover with the seed on any bitcoin storage device and some wallets?

attributes of money as a good
-homogenous (check)
-store of value(check)
some bonus points for BTC
(virtually??) impossible to counterfeit 
extremely cheap to store safely
I'd also like to add, on the scarcity front, while any crypto can be scarce, cryptocurrencies as a whole have no scarcity which is why if cryptos really take off there will only be one or a handful of winners.
Using this same line of reasoning I believe being a new and "better" crypto is not as advantageous as we'd expect from other technologies.  Being an IT, advances are made often and incrementally, and since constant new adoption of better cryptos mean they would not be a store of value, longer running ones have the edge.
this could be BTCs saving grace or the reason cryptos collapse as a whole

@_date: 2017-08-24 16:30:12
Gold is valuable because it has intrinsic value which it derives from the fact that it meets all the characteristics of a good money.
If you are unfamiliar those characteristics are,
 It's durable, since it doesn't oxidize or degrade.
 it's homogenous as opposed to diamonds and gems.
 it's divisible also a problem with stones.
 It's fairly portable, currently about twice as heavy as the highest denomination paper money (in USD).
 It's scarce.
 It's viewed as a store of value.
also, compared to other metals it's easily identifiable.
Bitcoin meets all these criteria as well, even better than gold which is why bitcoin has intrinsic value.  It also has some other advantages.  It is infinitely portable and divisible, it's impossible to counterfeit and it's incredibly cheap to store safely.
The main problem with bitcoin as money is it requires electricity and internet, otherwise it is unusable.  Still, a damn good solution for money

This doesn't sound right to me, it sounds like you are saying it's 30% on every crypto-crypto trade, so that's 30% on the buy and 30% on the sell?  Compare that to say stock trading where you only pay 30% on the gains when you sell.    Also,  how do losses on trades not deduct from the gains.  I find it hard to believe that any tax agency taxes you on a capital loss.  You need to figure out how much money you made total in the last calendar year trading and pay 30% on just that.  It simply seems impossible that you would be charged 30% on gains trades and 30% on loss trades, let alone 30% on every buy and sell transaction.

all very true, but that isn't what I was talking about.  I have no issue with the men who take the risk and win the battle dominating female attention.  I'm talking about men building a system, usually cooperatively, then when the rewards are clear, they use the strong arm of the state to make sure they have "50-50 female representation"
this is from one of these "need women in bitcoin" articles.
*Men make up an estimated 96% of the Bitcoin community, which means that if Bitcoin does end up succeeding, as its adherents think it will, and if the people who own Bitcoin see their holdings soar in value, then all of the profits will end up going to what Brett Scott calls the “crypto-patriarchy”*
Why is this an issue for the author?  How long until there is a movement to say "ok, time to redistribute bitcoin so more women have some" once it succeeds of course.

it sounds to me like merchants will be paying fees comparable to credit card fees.  When a merchant opens a channel directly with a hub to receive payments, that hub needs to fund the channel, essentially every cent the merchant receives will have to be fronted by the hub.  People expect payment for the time value of money.  No one is going to have essentially millions of dollars sitting idle without a good incentive.  Users probably won't be able to receive through lightning unless they too pay interest on a funded channel.  I also doubt most channels will truly have equal funds incoming and outgoing so they won't be able to be maintained for long periods of time.  essentially broadcasting to the network on a set schedule.

I don't know where you are, but where I am a huge percentage of tax dollars goes to subsidize failing businesses or large successful business that have money to spend on good lobbyists.  Money goes to talentless artists and to prop up horrible films and TV shows.  Money is thrown away on massive projects that never get finished to buy votes.  If taxes were spent properly I wouldn't have an issue.  The fact is most of my tax money gets wasted.
Edit: I almost forgot about the billions spent on locking up people who committed victimless crimes and even more billions on foreign misadventures.

Why haven't you traded your BTC for BCH? you could triple your holdings at the moment.  You haven't because you are a rational human being doing what rational human beings do.  Now imagine you are a hedge fund manager with tens of millions in bitcoin and this mess starts, are you really going to ditch a speculative investment like BTC for an even more speculative one like BCH?  chances are you would either wait it out or hedge.  So far no new money has come in or gone out, it's all shifting from one coin to the other which to me is suspicious beyond belief.  
So what's the difference between the BTC run up and this BCH run up?  BTC is a new asset class that has been making headlines on an almost daily basis, all eyes in the financial world have been on it for almost a year, BCH has been sitting quietly without a mention and suddenly billions are moving into it, literally over night? I find that hard to believe.  also, the BTC pump has been at a snails pace compared to this BCH pump which is up 500% in the last week.  
In my experience, money can move out of an asset this quick during a panic, but it can't really move into an asset this quick, not even in the craziest frenzy
I dunno, this all stinks to high hell to me.  Also, full disclosure, i have a couple orders of magnitude more coins than you and I also held on to my BCH as a hedge.  It's been pretty tempting at 30%, but i will wait in case the worst happens because i too am a rational human being

No, a good goal is for **people** to have the economic power their given profession warrants.  There are tons of jobs women do that are important, and there are tons of women who do jobs that are high paying.  The thing is, these important lower paying jobs are lower paying because of the skill and training involved.  Women and men, on average have different interests and priorities  and average wages reflect that.  But, so long as both men and women are treated/paid the same in any given profession for the same performance I see absolutely no problem

yes, the hardware wallets are designed so that if someone gets a hold of it it is still secure.  Trezor says you can leave yours in central park and not worry.  However if someone has your 24 word seed and your passphrase (if you made one) they can steal all your crypto.
to get into the hardware wallet you need the pin (and possibly passphrase)  I know with trezor, each incorrect guess of the pin doubles the time you need to wait to try again.  I think after like 20 guesses you need to wait 7 years to guess again

so how does a hub maintain these channels?  I think it's safe to assume consumers send out and merchants receive.  So a hub will need a unique channel with every merchant with funds dedicated to it.  Since no one wants money sitting idle for long periods of time they will need to reset channels with each net receiver/merchant constantly to balance this.

Do male nurses get paid far more than females?  how about male executives vs female executives?  comparing cross jobs is silly as these are market determined wages.

Far more lives are saved each year by the civil engineers that keep clean water flowing to your tap and safely removing sewage from your toilet.  Also, I'd say engineering is more difficult that most medicine but doctors get paid far more, why? market wage.  (and strong doctors unions in the form of medical association)

*All transactions take time to be processed (usually 5-30 minutes). Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the exchange rate is subject to change during the processing time, which means the final rate may be slightly different from what you expected. This happens because Changelly doesn’t fix currency rates.*

The more I look into lightning the more convinced I am that on chain scaling is an absolute neccessity for peer2peer.

Time to google "Bretton woods".  Ans as far as deflationary currency, aside from the fact that gold isn't necessarily deflationary (It was massive inflation from gold and silver in the americas that handicapped the spanish empire and allow britain to supersede it) Every central currency issuer in history ended up debasing their currency, eventually leading to collapse.

also, it's now 45%, i may have to make this gamble.  Even if by some miracle the BCH pumpers managed to permanently over take BTC, it will see a massive correction very soon, like hours to days soon, but i can tell you if i do, I will retake my BCH position after it falls.

This guy gets it.  In all seriousness, i think protecting your assets through divorce will be a major use case for cryptos.  Also, don't listen to these haters.  If they are good women then they will still reap all the benefits of your holdings and if not you are protected, it's seriously a win-win.  Also, I recommend getting a DNA test on all your kids when they are born, if everything is kosher there is exactly no harm done, if it's not you just prevented one of the worst outcomes that can happen to a man.

The problem is journalists and journalism as a field have become atrocious.  And this is not a chicken or the egg type problem.  Journalism professors have spent at least two decades teaching their students to be activists not journalists, and many (possibly most) young journalists believe activism is their duty and that unbiased, objective reporting of facts is unethical (seriously, many of them believe that)

well the claim that women get paid less for the same work and same hours is totally debunked so that part of the article is in the garbage.  It even debunks it in the article where they say women who are not married and prioritizing work like men earn the same.  
*It is logical for couples to decide that the person who earns less, usually a woman, does more of the household chores and child care, Ms. Kerr said. But it’s also a reason women earn less in the first place*
Do you have a wife and kids?  Marriage is a partnership and you go by the principle of comparative advantage.  If my wife had more earning power than me, I'd be the one leaving work when the kids are sick.  As things stand, for me to do that and my wife to prioritize her job would hurt the entire family

I'm married with kids already, I love my wife very much, but I'm not the one living with delusions.  I actually trust my wife more than most, but have seen sooo many people stray from spouses and SOs in my life that I have no delusions about human nature.
BTW, i met my wife after i struck it fairly well off by any standard, but using the same logic I kept it somewhat under wraps for a while.  Having a lot of money and flashing it can easily attract the wrong kind of woman.  I would give the same advice to any man in that situation.
Edit: Ok, clearly I don't trust my wife as much as most, but I trust as much as I could trust any human being who had the power to destroy my life and gut me at whim.

No one in this world has as much power to do that to me as my wife.  The mere fact that I took the plunge should say a lot about how I feel about her but I still did some contingency planning.

I've explained this already in other threads but I'll do it again.  Bitcoin has intrinsic value because it satisfies the requirements of a money so well. a quick list is, homogenous, divisible, durable, portable, scarce and seen as a store of value.  To add to that, bitcoin is virtually impossible to counterfeit and incredibly cheap to store safely.  Precious metals meet many of these properties, gold is the best because it is easily identifiable but you should be able to see the limitations of metals as well.  Fiat is a disaster waiting to happen for obvious reasons (hint, scarcity).  Lets not forget fiat has been around, going all the way back to the 1970s...

@_date: 2017-09-01 04:39:26
Money is a good like anything else and it has a definite function, to facilitate trade.  It can be a product or a technology.  fullfilling that function gives it intrinsic value, and every money that had applications beyond just being money have failed (tobacco, salt, etc...).  I also disagree about gold being particularly useful, especially before modern times.  It's main benefits are that it's very inert and ductile but platinum is better at both.  Titanium and alloys like bronze are both very inert as well, but so much stronger that they are preferable for almost anything.  If gold was abundant I guess it would be good to add to stainless steel.  Today the only real industrial use for gold is to plate electrical contacts but both copper and silver are more conductive.  Gold's success as money were chiefly because its scarce and inert and distinctive (compared to other metal) but has very marginal advantages over more common metals for practical uses

any chance you can give some pointers on the actual engraving?  Also, how does tungsten compare to stainless steel?  I know it has a much higher melting point, but what about oxidation?
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:11:04
Well my plan is actually to engrave or stamp on two metal plates then rivet them together, so the only way to see the seed is by drilling out the rivets.  I am trying to settle on a metal though.  I want something that's both very fire resistant and non-corrosive.  Stainless steel seems like the obvious choice but it might be too hard for stamping.  Also considering copper and bronze.  Bronze is very non corrosive but apparently house fires can be hot enough to melt or at least deform both bronze and copper and definitely hot enough to melt aluminium.  I've seen campfires do that.

Hyperinflation is not coming as the central banks are very sensitive to it.  Instead they've opted for the strategy of asset deflation, which is essentially the same thing.  Under inflation your nominal wealth remains constant while nominal prices increase, the effect is you now have less real buying power.  Under asset deflation nominal prices remain constant while your nominal wealth decreases, the effect is you now have less real buying power.  They seem to believe the latter is preferable to the former.  They may be right, or they may be wrong, time will tell.

Do you know how long ago he acquired them?  There have been several "forks" in the last year, it will be 1 year to the day tomorrow.  If he has several bitcoins that means you own the same nominal amount of other coins that are derived from bitcoin.  This can be worth as much as 15% of the current market price of your bitcoins.  Make sure not to discard any keys as you can recover these forked coins at any time, but you must have the keys that held the bitcoin on the day the forked coin was created.

You're mistaken.  When you deposit, say 10 dollars, the bank can't lend out $90 from thin air, instead they lend $9 and keep $1 in reserve.  That $9 is then deposited again and they lend out $8.10, again. That $8.10 is deposited and the cycle starts again and so on.  The length of time it takes for all the deposits and loans to happen is determined by the velocity of money.  Ultimately the bank created $90 from your $10 deposit, not 10 times that amount.
To understand why that's the case, imagine that the bank must make the loan in physical cash.  They can't create physical cash so they must go through the whole cycle many times.
