Iwas talking about mass adoption, not one random dude on internet on a forum claiming it changes something to him.
Most people dont know it, or are too scared of it.
As long as companies that control the medias, disagree with crypto in general, there will be no mass adoption, and so then no future for it.

Its not because it worked for internet, amazon and all others..that it will necessarely be the same for crypto
@_date: 2019-02-10 23:26:49
Any proofs of that ? You were talking about personal experiences ? People lie all the time, its in human nature.
The only real thing is fact, and fact is that it has no real mass adoption.

They say its the beginning of bitcoin revolution and crypto revolution since 8years..
Its still the same shit, no real adoption.

I live where there is the most ATM in general, mostly from the company instacoin.com

Link to blockchain phone ? Is it released yet ? What does it do, how will it change the adoption ? Its just a normal phone ?
Samsung integration crypto wallet link ? Is it release yet or just another "never be released project" ?
These are some of the questions that will be asked from usual people that dont know a thing about crypto.
They already have their phone with paying plans, why a new and more expansive one ? 
And how these two things you mentionned are going to change the real adoption anyway ?
People just want to pay their damn coffee ....  That will fuel in their cars, cigarettes too maybe, rent for the appartment/house, alcohols..
They dont give a shit about new crypto phone

If i was rich enough, i would just film and burn 100,000$ and post it everywhere on internet.
 So people would lose their mind ever more than they already are ....aaah...

You are lucky :( here in canada there are not so much ATM and they are all the time empty :/ , Canada is so low on adoption
