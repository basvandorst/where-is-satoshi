Serious overuse of deus ex machina

Well, I think the Sistine chapel is kind of overrated, honestly. But really, if your point is architecture maxed out then - there's gorgeous architecture now - look at Barcelona, look at Gehry buildings. 
Progress other than building? Printing a replacement semi-functional limb is pretty amazing, sequencing DNA is amazing, cloning a sheep, being able to talk to someone on the other side of the planet nigh on instantaneously....it's all pretty staggering to me.
Culturally, increased racial acceptance, increased acceptance of homosexuality, people able to crowdsource things, able to collaborate over huge distances, the globalization and plurality of the current art world. You can't think art capped out at the Sistine chapel?

Nabokov's Pale Fire, Nathan Coley's There Will Be No Miracles Here, Howl by Ginsberg, white teeth by zadie smith, numerous works by Felix Gonzalez-Torres and David wojnarowicz just kids by party smith, the intuitionist or zone one by colson whitehead....I mean - there weren't very many female artists until the last hundred years. Now we have tacita dean, Sophie calle, Janet Cardiff, vija celmins, Janine Antoni, Louise bourgeois, Kiki smith, Kara walker, faith ringgold, Rachel whiteread, marina abramovic. Even leaving out most women, nothing by gerhard richter, Anish kapoor, sol Lewitt, au weiwei, Grayson perry, mapplethorpe, mike Kelley is of note to you?
