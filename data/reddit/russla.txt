My Gemini account name isn't my real name, my bank accounts are verified on Gemini with my real name; is this going to cause a problem when I try to withdrawal USD? (U.K.  Member btw)

Nice one cheers, I actually opened the ticket right after I sold as I remembered reading some horror stories with cash stuck in limbo. Hopefully they'll just change my account name!
Out of curiosity; who denied the withdrawal? Your bank or Gemini?

Coooool, any idea how to get around it? I'm too skint for this :/

I found this too, having discovered First Direct do free international wire transfers I'm just using Gemini now as the fees are so low and the buying/selling options far exceed what Coinbase can do, plus at the actual price is what it should be and not inflated!

This is a good idea tbf, my sis is super frugal so anything she see's making more money for free would make her life ha.

I'm in the UK, account works fine..?

This day limit must be a US thing, since opening my account Ive had no limits whatsoever. FYI for a $300 purchase the fee is $0.75; how exactly is that a high fee?

Me too! Even on my FB too, people PM me all the time now :)

I'm a bit of newb with regards to mining but could be a hench warehouse with mega power starting up?

Only if the BTC was in an exchange that supports it tho ;)

Nice, been hearing more people at work mention the 'bubble', they're just jealous I bought in at $3700 ha.

Nice one thanks for the explanations!

How is it defined solely as income if you only withdrawl what you put in? 
Say you put in 30k, a year later you take out 30k, is that still classed as income? 
Obvs if you take a milli i'd expect to pay tax on that.

Hi newbie from the UK here. I have some BTC with Gemini but can't seem to find which type of BTC I have; anyone able to help? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:20:31
Thanks, that's helped! I'm kinda hoping Gemini will blog about it soon but if not i'll get myself a paper wallet asap!
