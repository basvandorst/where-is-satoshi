it's cool that you earn some money, but people here know about BTC and BCC not BJJ, it's a new currency?)))

in your case just use different wallets, under 1 BTC in each. If you have more, use hardware wallet like trezor. Or don't mind about crypto))))

@_date: 2017-08-09 09:20:52
no, man, that's a bad decision. If you want to keep your coins in safe use cold storage. For me best ones is hardwear wallet like Trezor or Ledger. Or wallet like Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:18:03
w8 few days, today SegWit was locked in. Will see how BItcoin will react. For the long term buy and hold, this thing will grow. That's my vision(i might be wrong), but that's what im going to do. We need more patience.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:59:31
What is DUST? Is that a fee for transactions? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:48:48
that's not so fast. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:35:19
w8 few days, then think what you should to do. But for the long term defenetly buy! doesent metter how expencieve is it. Buy and hold for a few years. Easy money. You need to care only about safety of your coins, and they will work for you.

Why does everyone keep suggesting hodling? Because it will not hurt you. It is [obvious]( that in long periods of time bitcoin will only rise in price.
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:35:21
Bad ICOs are just ponzi schemes, good ones - can help build incredible projects. 
It takes a while before you can [tell one from another](
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:53:15

@_date: 2017-07-05 11:09:44
I think it's necessary to tell when they expect it to raise.
At this point it is kind of obvious that bitcoin will rise to [highest tops]( but when? How long will it take?
The more people use bitcoin the higher its price.

They need keep up the illusion of control. There is a saying (I'm pretty sure I'm butchering it): if you can't fight the movement, be their leader.
But some regulation is in order. Every country cares for investors.
Even China threaten organizers of fraudulent ICOs with [death penalty](

A lot of people have [high hopes for bitcoin]( John McAfee is one of many.

But it's great that [Japan help cryptoworld]( and works to save consumers.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:19:40
Bitcoin community is not so desperate for news as you think it is.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:17:57
If SegWit will be locked that's means hardfork , but thats will be in 7th of August , many things can change during this time. And for me that was a news that's [chain split not gonna happen]( Charlie Shrem said that. I would like to  believe him))))But if BIP 148 activates before SegWit2x, then there could be an attempted activation of SegWit without majority support from miners, which would lead to a chain split (although the split could be temporary).No one can be sure about future of bitcoin for now. So you just need to w8 and see what happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:17:43
Exactly, thanks.

Only when they become a safe bet.
Plus, why would they invest in a thing that was designed to get rid of them?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:59:08
Electricity is not the only concern, as previously mentioned, you will first have to spend a significant portion of your money, and only then hope to break even.
Plus you also have the risk of getting kicked out with your gear.
Were you to live in China though.
We quite recently covered this topic in one of [our videos]( (i work for the guys who made it, full disclosure). I'll be thankful if you checked it out.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:00:26
Wonder how they will name coins if split happens?
bytecoin and quitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:23:34

@_date: 2017-06-22 14:14:09
It is personal opinion of the website creator. 
It is easy to understand where he is coming from for this matter, and since he has a certain responsibility before those who use the website, it is admirable to remove any site that does anything of questionable nature. I don't blame him.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:18:33
Exactly as mentioned before, you will never be certain for sure, you have to follow the news and the visit this subreddit more often the not (I will shamelessly plug the blockchain news [show]( I'm part of)
What is on everybodies mind right now - it is most definitely SegWit2x. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:53:04
How will you do that?
With attitude like that you will only create more of alts and splits.
Plus, I noticed that when people decide which coin the will use, they try hold to it as tight as possible, sometimes even to their own loss.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:02:54
I would say the chances are the same as getting murdered for your dollars.
If you are bragging how much money you've got you are accepting the fact that someone shady might overhear.
Be careful and try not to connect your social profiles to your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:55:39
A true hodler wouldn't even look at those pesky graphs.
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:48:19
My guess is, target market for these are people who have heard stories like [this]( and [this]( without realising that those guys basically won the lottery. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:30:03
It wears out your computer, it costs money and it doesn't guarantee that you will mine some. If you were to make a few calculation you would soon realise you are doing it at [loss](
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:34:54
Make it more convenient to use cryptocurrencies.
At this point you have to pay big fees and wait long times.
We will see more people using bitcoin as soon as it will become more or less stable. Meaning that if someone were to buy milk today for 1 btc, he has to be sure that it won't cost 2 tomorrow and 0.5 the day after.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:54:37
I think seasoned hodlers will continue hodling even if btc will cost hundreds of thousands dollars. They don't seem to know when to let go.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:56:44
I think it is good donating to charities, but the best option, in terms of future benefit, is to fully develop blockchain use for them. Develop the world without middlemen, like when you want to donate to someone you do thourgh the means of blockchain.
There are a lot of [charities]( right now that spend most of the donated money not on the charitable use, but on those men in the middle. This kind of thing is far worse than stealing imo.
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:13:03
At this point mining with little to no investement is just like playing a lottery where electricity bill is your ticket price.
[Start]( trading or hodling.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:28:41


That is a very bold statement.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:43:45
This thread is borderline bullying.
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:13:12
It is great idea, it's high time we stated doing that.
The rate at which amount of bitcoins is increasing will slow down, but the price will rise. It is only convenient.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:06:14
Did Ethereum split teach us anything?
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:49:24
I agree, we are not even nearly there with blockchain mass adoption.
It is still a niche technology and is still growing. 
Though consumer doesn't even really have to know, I doubt that a lot of people know how internet works (some of its methods are somewhat similar to blockchain by the way) but it doesn't stop millions of people from using it daily.
Best we can do right now is be intersted in the technology and interest those around us. For example, I work for a comany that organizes [conferences]( for such things (shameless plug), and I can tell you for a fact that amount of people intersted in blockchain grows exponentially.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:57:56
Agreed. As with any kind of risk investement.
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:30:51
There are a lot more video content on this matter.
If you really want to learn I would suggest watching videos from conferences of all kinds: [1]( and so on.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:27:26
It just completely sweeps the [penny debate]( under the rug and the similar ones with it.
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:35:01
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
(Every teenager who spends a lot of time behind computer screen looks like that, he just happens to be a little bit older.)
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:29:37
ICOs are just an instrument that doesn't have any safety precaution.
Of course, loud voices and opinions will be influenced by current events.
It's just like kickstarter campaigns but with no chance of getting your funds back if you were scammed.
Recently my boss was a part of a [talk]( where they dicussed this. (shamless plug, hehe)

Go on dude, I'm rooting for you.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:07:24
Speaking of ICOs, you should check out a [talk]( that a guy I work for (pretty knowledgeable guy, if you ask me) did today about the matter.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:49:55
I love headlines like these.
Cryptocurrencies are so unstable that every single thing rakes them.
ETH is going down - it's 4chan fault, they killed Vitalik
BTC is going down - it's Petya, hacking banks in god-knows-where
ETH is going up - it's Vitalik met up with [Putin](
LiteCoin is stable? - Well, everybody is hodling, where else is it supposed to move?
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:37:59
No one and everyone at the same time.
Though there are quite a few big companies and miners that have a certain power to dictate things.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:28:09
Well, first you'll have to buy a bus pass.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:36:23
Absolutely not.
Of course there were better times before, but if you are planning to get in the boat it's best to do it as early as possible.
