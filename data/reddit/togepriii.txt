No, they just didn't bother to change the name because they had already paid for it.
Not that it really mattered; MtGox was a pretty cool name, it's just too bad that it sucked so much.

The other guy just gave you a link to the proper subreddit. I don't know if it is specifically not allowed here but generally people don't like it.

working again
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:57:36
The fees will have to be lowered real soon. It used to be almost nothing but with the rising price that's not correct anymore. :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:27:49
Only on MtGox, which isn't a real exchange 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:43:08
TA is fucking bullshit anyway. Only idiot 'day traders' believe that shit. I'm not saying BTC will stay this high but using TA to predict a crash is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:54:52
Certainly no posts from since that's impossible. (is not a standard subreddit so it won't appear on the front page)
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:17:18
I have used the site last year. No problems at all :) 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:39:41
Of course you could try to use their withdrawal system but there are reasons I just explicity warned people who are planning on doing that. The most important one being that it is very unclear how much money they actually have. I'd rather lose some money but feel safe by buying at a higher price and moving all my BTC out of there than waking up one day to find MtGox disappeared with all my cash.

Very nice work. Do you still have it layered? I think it would even better with the text removed (except maybe for the We the people part)
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:53:25
This is the original. I don't think there's a high-res version available for the QR variant.
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:25:31
What is so special about address beginning with 3?
EDIT: I have found it. It is used for a 'script hash'

Now read OP's question again.
That doesn't the answer it at all. What OP is talking about is a stop loss and I don't think it's possible to set one at the major exchanges without using some kind of client.
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:54:53
You cannot withdraw from MtGox. Absolutely do not use this exchange! Use something like Bitstamp or btc-e instead.

If someone runs a full node do they also profit from the transaction costs because they verify the transaction or is it only the miners who mine the blocks who profit?
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:23:29
I don't like it but it also doesn't belong here.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:23:43
The original creator is unknown. All websites that exist are 'unofficial'. If you want Bitcoin, just buy some. Mining is impossible.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:19:02
Uh yes but that would only cost you money because they are so expensive in Gox. But if you still have cash on there I would say it would be the smartest to buy BTC even though it's highly overpriced and move it ASAP or you might lose it all in a few months. Gox is broke as fuck.

Please no TA bullshit on this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:18:35
Haha, I had exactly the same problem. Stupid Blockchain.info (and stupid me for not checking the fee). I just went too sleep and hoped it wouldn't crash to 0. It has been transferred now and luckily the price is still very high. Feels so bad to have no control over your money.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:22:04
Casinos are also risky and fun.
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:02:53
Doesn't have anything to do with the post being positive or negative. Just with the fact that some people believe drawing some lines in MS Paint will give them the ability to predict the future. I'd rather hear some real arguments before I might even consider changing my own tactics because of someone else's opinion.
