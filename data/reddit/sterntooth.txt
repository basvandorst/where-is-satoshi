Lack of memes
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:37
But I want to sell it for 9.5k! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:38:01
I personally think we are a long way off not seeing decent returns.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:48:53
Wire funds to Coinbase, move those funds to GDAX which is free, buy on GDAX using a limit order. Hey Presto, no fees!
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:11:23
Yes it could
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:53
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:19:11
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:45
Right now!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:51
Can confirm
Source: I'm an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:34:38
Bitcoin is still at the top
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:52
It's dropping because people are selling? Am I right, do I win a prize?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:02:13
Try r/shittycryptostuff
I want to see it!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:46:53
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:27:31
Ok so we've debunked it and we agree it's BS. However if it becomes widely adopted and people believe it that could affect the price, no?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:45:14
Real "n" shortage today! I woder what happeed?

From what I heard she got a baby by Roger?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:54:48
Did it? I was thinking it got close but didn't quite. Not showing going over €10k on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:44
Yeah, I just got some through on changelly. Took a while but it's there now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:43:59
Can I have a listen please? 
Guessing from your username "Diving Faces" is on it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:00:55
I have very little in GDAX now for that exact reason.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:05:02
Considering you'd only need 60 bitcoins to be a crypto millionaire (if we're talking USD) then there are a lot out there. Don't expect anyone to tell you though!
Remember, those coins were once worth less than 1 cent!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:58:34
All bets are off if there is only one ball. I'll eat something else.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:14:43
How do you find it? Wasn't there a Super coin fork recently?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:58
Still not ATH
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:37
Oh I will and it will feel like a bargain! Mwahaha
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:14:58
I've set up an alert in £'s just in case! 
Also I would expect a post-Christmas push as people trade their presents for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:40:05
Or drop like a stone?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:40:15
Use GDAX to buy. Less fees at market value and no fees if placing limit orders. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:18:13
No you didn't!
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:34:45
Memes don't live here anymore. ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:58
Seems to be going nuts now. Wonder who's woken up?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:52:23
Might even be the same people?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:23:49
I think it will poke its head over 20k today or tomorrow and then we will have a nice little dip before Monday then a post-Christmas rollercoaster to 30k. 
Cats are ungrateful shits.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:09:37
Seems to have stabilised somewhat at around 13-14k. Fuck knows what will happen tomorrow. I'm holding so probably down! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:06:18
An alternative would be to get a trusted friend or family member to buy on a uk exchange and send them to you?
These are all just ideas off the top of my head and I don't actually have any experience doing this. Like I said, I just wired the funds to myself.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:12:08
I've never seen anyone telling me all or nothing and despite my gut instincts otherwise the hodl mentality has proven to be the most sensible and fruitful mentality so far given that no-one who has bought and hodled has lost anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:01
I personally wouldn't buy in if it dropped below maybe 4. It would take serious brass balls.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:27:07
So I'd like to know what happens if my coin is in a hardware wallet during a fork and how do I claim/sell the new coin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:55
Find an ATM
Or try localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:18:15
Erm, am I missing something?
How do I sell my Bcash on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:13:05
No, thanks for that. You've really cleared things up for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:46
What do the obstacles represent?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:59
Ok, use a vpn and a different browser/email address to open another Coinbase account linked to your UK bank account? This is all guessing btw.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:04:14
If Bitcoin ever wants to face widespread adoption for daily purchases something like this would have to occur. It needs to happen for longevity of Bitcoin, wonder who will come out on top when/if it does happen. Bitpay?
EDIT: To answer your question I don't think it would have any affect on Apple's share price. Might affect Bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:04
[SLIPPAGE WARNING]( 
Major slippage incoming! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:45:24
I'm starting to believe all this fud tbh.
I've had thousands of dollars worth stuck in the mempool for several days now which I am unable to trade or cash in. All the while the value of said coin is plummeting. 
No one can persuade me that Bitcoin or crypto for that matter are currently usable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:57:26
YOU TOOK OUR N'S!
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:13:20
Check the transaction in Coinbase. It will go from pending to   Once it has received enough confirmations you will see the funds in your Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:27:08
From what I understand you can just buy another ledger and input your recovery seed which you have written down and stored somewhere safe and you will be able to access you wallet again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:37:33
Well a scammer would recognise a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:26
It was meant as a reply to the OP. He hasn't updated and has the iOS 11 glitch which replaces "I" with "⍰"
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:03:50
Is that one still going ahead? I saw somewhere it was called off. Might have been a dream!
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:52:20
Except when he's wrong
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:10:09
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:50:17
Im hoping for a dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:29
Might still happen!
Although I'd say 12 is more realistic as a low
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:51:45
I've been studying the patterns of the charts too and I predict it will go up a bit then down a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:16:03
I took a bit out of my premium bonds to invest in Bitcoin.
Nothing I can't afford to lose. It's certainly more exciting than Premium Bonds. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:42:42
I agree, however I can see it getting carried away again!
Probably sailing through 20k and then dipping.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:34:20
When future trading opens on Monday the price may or may not go up or down or stay the same.

@_date: 2017-12-16 16:33:04
I've got 5 running on mine at the moment. No limit to how much coin you can store.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:59
It's ok. Could do with a graph.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:02:44
Trust no one. 
&amp; me, trust me
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:28:07
I'd buy right....NOW!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:12:06
It has to be unlucky to call 13 before it happens
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:58
They've really done a number today! 
It's hilarious!
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:04:58
We were making love by Wednesday and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We chilled on Sunday.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:41:20
As many as you want
*other exchanges are available but Coinbase is great for newbies.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:01:54
It is
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:12
I agree with you but the same thing would have happened on January 1st, possibly worse!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:07
Bcash is currently unusable 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:18:17
What do we want? 
When do we want it? 
THE ANSWER WILL ASTONISH YOU...
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:04:49
Exactly the same thing happened on Tuesday, same price same amount.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:46
So, you're sayig it's a cospiracy?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:31
HODL the FDDO
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:12:12
Fair point, I've never seen anyone in authority spreading fear on Twitter. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:28:50
I had a buy set at 18.2 which was a pretty good guess, so far.
What alts did you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:43
I'll have em! Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:40:43
So 21k by August? HODL works then!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:52
But it didn't drop below 13k?
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:25:22
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:26:40
Nah it will become stable at around 100k
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:19
Nothing or something will happen 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:38
I'm not sure what Coinbase could have done to make this better?
They had to release the Bcash coins to everyone at some point and not announcing it seemed like the best way to avoid an even bigger panic. 
I'm not the biggest fan but if you were them what would you have done differently?
If anything it's given us all some excitement/something to talk about. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:48:14
Do you even Bitcoin bro?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:51
I've noticed that. You can't wire funds to another bank in the US without paying a transfer fee, however you can withdraw the cash and take it to the other bank and deposit it for free! 
In 2017 that is simply ridiculous.
Surely the paperwork, staff costs and cash handling makes that such a backwards practice?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:18
Somewhere closer to 10 over the next week I think/hope.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:54:25
In fairness it did jump around a bit immediately last week.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:28:55
Pre-Christmas sale? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:54
Definitely watch that film. It's a long one but it's fucking awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:51:43
EU can do it!
I'm watching in EUR at the moment hoping for a sell-off and dip at €10k
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:15
Current price is about right on track I reckon. Whatever happened on Thursday was pretty crazy but it's settled down again now. As long as people don't get scared and sell we should see steady growth from this point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:33:30
I hear you brother, I have two! One from Monday one from yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:14:35
Pretty sure it dipped down into the 13's after?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:11:38
Don't worry the excrement will hit the oscillator at some point when you least expect it!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:49
Not sure they have.
Should read "Coinbase adds transferring of Bcash"
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:49
I'd buy!
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:29:18
Ok, thanks. It was either a vivid hallucination or someone spreading nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:17:26
Long enough to smell bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:58:37
Yeah, you can delete all of them if you want and your coin will stay in the wallet. Just download the app for the coin you want to check and it'll be there. 
You could lose or damage your Nano and your coins will still be there. The most important thing is your recovery seed.
HODL just means hold on to your coins rather than spend or exchange. It stems from a mis-spelling years ago by a drunk guy on a forum. Some people think it means "hold on for dear life"
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:06:47
Most ATM's in the UK don't charge. Just sayin
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:27:36
Santa's a miner
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:08:24
Hmm, I am in a similar situation. I just wired funds from UK to US. 
Maybe you could buy Bitcoin using a UK VPN on a UK exchange and your UK current account and then send the coin to your US wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:38:41
Haha, I read "sad" in Donald Trump's voice!
I sent some Bitcoin from GDAX to a friend's wallet this afternoon and it went through in less than an hour with no fees! It was actually faster than a Bcash transfer I did earlier, maybe to do with how much is moving?
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:18:34
January 16th
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:08:54
So many people on here were saying "it will probably jump a bit and then flatten out" when futures start trading! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:53
Compare [this]( 
To [this]( 
Two wildly different peak prices from this morning?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:00
As far as I know, yes
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:28
Non-hoddling was my problem! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:51:42
Use another exchange or localbitcoins.com with a uk VPN to buy coins using your uk current account and then send them to your us Coinbase wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:31
[hmmm]( 
SELL SELL SELL!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:08:28
Ok so they could spread disinformation which may lead to reactionary dips then? Worth keeping an eye on if you ask me!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:55:12
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:18:11
I know what you mean. I've got about 8 cryptos and can only store 4/5 apps on the Nano at once. Not a huge problem as I intend to HODL but you'd think it would be easily possible to have more, they can't be very big.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:18
Dem dipz tho
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:18:16
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:28
Plummeting helplessly into the abyss?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:10:26
I bet you can get the same meal today for the same price!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:31
There's a pre-Christmas sale going on! 
Get them cheap while you can!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:54
Well, I can't sell shit on either right now! 
Have you managed to sell some?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:12:23
Would be interesting to see £10k. Wonder which currency is the most popular? I would have thought dollars or Euros. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:25:51
What about every other country in the world which doesn't celebrate thanksgiving?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:59:26
Must be GDAX [lying to me]( 
In fairness it doesn't show the real level of past dips on there either so I believe you!
EDIT: here's [Coinbase]( too
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:48:18
OMG, you were right! 
How did you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:54:20
Try localbitcoins.com
If you buy on Coinbase today you lock in the current price. You can always wire funds to your Coinbase account and buy on GDAX if you want the coins quicker.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:04
Seriously, right now! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:24:29
Ok, makes sense now. It's the same for some of the lows when it drops like a stone suddenly and then recovers. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:03:22
Same wall we had on Tuesday. Hmmm
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:23:45
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:11:38
Convenient 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:55
Still can't sell it though! Especially not at that over-inflated nonsense price.
Not sure this has gone very well for either Coinbase or Bcash!
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:50:44
If Uber jumped on board that could make things interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:52:16
I really like Coinbase, haven't heard much from them recently though!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:44
More info [here]( and if you're really paranoid [here]( 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:02:17
I'm aware of that, however people get presents for Christmas which can be money which can be invested. 
Not that that has much impact as one whale with a desire to buy/sell.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:06:13
I downvoted myself first
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:54:21
Worth a read for noobs asking that question.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:08:43
I don't trust Trevor at all! He is a scoundrel.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:30:34
Did you buy back in?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:19
Want to buy or sell or trade? Tough!
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:04:57
I don't think that's right if it's 2300 GMT?
EDIT: you changed it, you sneaky fox!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:58:08
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:43:57
I know, I was watching it too. Still no clue what's going on! I sold a bit today just in case it all kicked off , waiting to buy back in again.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:00:58
I haven't noticed but I did actualol at [this]( twitter burn earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:25:05
You could have been in a few weeks, doubled your money. Taken half out to put back into your ISA and still have Bitcoin with no real risk.
EDIT: and this is waaay more fun than savings accounts especially if you've no real risk.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:14:50
Just here to chat bare bubbles! Or as we English say TOTAL BOLLOCKS! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:15
If it drops to 8k I'll eat your left ball
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:15:29
Well it already passed 19k 9 days ago! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:14:06
Ok, [now]( you can celebrate!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:18:28
It was briefly down 6k from Thursday today!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:12:32
10% in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:33
19.3 down to 15.9 in 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT! 
Kind of glad they disable Coinbase when these things happen!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:27
Seen it now, thanks anyway! Now dip ffs! I want to get back on this bandwagon. Don't leave me behind! Arrrrgghh
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:40
I'm pretty sure they said it would go live 1st Jan. 
I want to sell my Bcash now but shockingly it's not going through! Hahaha, I thought this stuff was supposed to be fast!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:17
I was gonna buy 41
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:19
$6,000 by my calculations 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:08
Very useful! Commenting so I can post to noobs! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:29:03
He's with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:50
WHAT ARE THEY SPRAYING?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:47
SIR, it's happening again!
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:55:29
Saw that, there was 12,000 in there when I last looked
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:59:01
Hoping up or hoping down? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:57
Well I'm not suggesting buying at 19,300 would have been a great call right now, however I can seeing it surpassing that and making mad returns again.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:24:33
Get a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:02
Does anyone have experience with stop orders during these GDAX/Coinbase blackouts?
I'd be interested to know if anyone's have kicked in or is it just "tough luck" if this happens?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:36
You lucky guy. I was driving, it was either sell or die.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:31:01
I'm in the same boat. One I'm worried about is a tx from Changelly which isn't going through. Where does that bounce back to? Everytime I contact them they just say "the transfer is complete, check your wallet"
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:32
Guess so. My new technique is only to withdraw half when it doubles. I'll keep you posted! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:57:15
Mine came from Amazon with [this]( 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:38:59
There is a direct correlation between this sub Reddit's change in policy towards memes and the recent dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:09
Nope. Still playing the waiting game

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:15:37
I was wondering that myself. Do we know when BCH is going live on Coinbase and will it be immediately available in my BCH wallet?
I would suggest at least half would immediately dump for Bitcoin/altcoins/fiat.
Personally I think I'll keep it and ride it out, free money innit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:36:07
I'm in exactly the same boat mate. They show on Block cypher for 24 hours and then disappear. I have two floating around in the nether-zone!

Does anyone have experience with stop orders during these GDAX/Coinbase blackouts?
I'd be interested to know if anyone's have kicked in or is it just "tough luck" if this happens?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:58:00
I agree. Although I have managed to day trade buying dips and selling for profit I think the best thing to do is buy bits here and there and HODL. 
Then, if you can, only check BTC value once a week to save your heart and the temptation to cash-out.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:45:50
So if it doesn't actually touch Bitcoin why did it shoot up at 6pm last Sunday?

I read somewhere that it could never drop to zero? Sure you could lose a lot investing now so only speculate what you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2017-12-05 16:22:16
Surely it could warn people about potential events which would affect the price of Bitcoin. Bcash attacks, banned trading etc...?

It's teasing us, could take a while to break through this one.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:07:50
So when was it possible to buy at an ATH and still make "mad returns"?
Bitcoin has a long long way to go
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:43
Well, I agree that would be nice but this was always gonna happen it was just a question of when. It'll be interesting to see once Bcash trading reopens!

@_date: 2017-12-17 18:02:37
Some do, some don't! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:59:44
Do it on GDAX. However although you can make short gains you can also lose. Buying and holding is the way to do it. Maybe buy and hold until your initial investment has doubled and then withdraw the original investment?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:38
That's good to know!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:38:59
I have one transfer which was pending on Block Cypher and now it's not returning anything. Does this mean it'll eventually bounce back to the original wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:56
Ok, GDAX went mental Thursday, up to $19,300 then the website crashed and now it's floating around $13,500 which is probably about right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:30:46
It spent most of this week doing very little and then, out of nowhere... BOOM! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:36:12
Welcome to Bitcoin! I've had a transfer pending 3 days and counting!

Good work Roger! When are you going to resume trading on Coinbase? Haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:01:27
You can make short-term gains if you buy dips and have patience. However buy and HODL is the best advice. Better for the stress levels too if you can resist checking it every ten seconds, which I can't! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:57:29
Well there's over a million sat on Coinbase just waiting to be dumped! 
I actually moved mine to another exchange and sold them and it took 3 hours last night, go grease lightning!

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:30:23
GDAX and Coinbase are the same thing. Open up GDAX and use your CB login.
Selling on GDAX should be free, there will be a fee to withdraw to fiat though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:48:42
I would like to buy some shitcoins. Where should I head?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:42:57
One of mine was sent from ledger to GDAX and the other from Changelly, was showing as pending for 24 hours now they're just showing as unconfirmed. Sad.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:48
About what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:31:21
Ok, maybe I should say no-one who has bought and hodled sensibly has lost any money. 
At least you appear to be making a rational argument unlike the OP who seems to be staring at a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:09:23
I would advise against that. Certainly not all of it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:30:04

Coinbase and GDAX don't actually show past prices properly.
Well it sailed through $10k right up to 11.3 before it dipped. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:51
Whatever I say, the opposite will happen! That's my only prediction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:49

Hopefully for you they will see it that way. 
"Please note that the name on your bank account must match the legal name on your GDAX account for the wire to be accepted."

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:28:47
Not if you bought Thursday morning! 
I have no doubt it will bounce back but I would be a little nervous if I had got in at 18/19k.

I wonder how long it'll be until we can cash out or swap for btc on GDAX?
I'm currently trying to exchange some on Changelly too and it's not going through.
I find it funny that Bcash is currently useless and clogged up! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:24:19
Interesting article. I can see it jumping up to around 20k over the next few days and then correcting but I would say 12-14 may be a more realistic dip right now. 
Also I can't see that the investments that newbies are making affecting the price too much, this is big money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:37:25
I can honestly see it topping 20k before Christmas now, it's eating up those 1k marks like their nothing.
Just need to keep my balls and hodl! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:01:30
Thanks! Same to you.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:51:22
Yeah, it was nowhere near as scary as people were predicting. However, after the spike we did get a nice little dip to buy. Kind of hoping that happens again!
I'm calling 17.5k
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:58
Haha! Now I would lose quite a bit of money if that happens and there would be quite a few pissed off people out there. 
Thankfully I've got DOGE to fall back on.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:47
This isn't healthy, this is the endgame! SELL SELL SELL!/s
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:49:06
I can see it sailing through 20k in the next day or two then possibly another push towards 30k before the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:31:27
If the names match and the reference is correct it should be in your GDAX account within 24 hours. If it's rejected it could take 14 working days to get back to your bank.

If I want to sell how quickly can they be transferred back to Coinbase?

I'll buy in then!

Noob here, I've just bought BTC on Coinbase. Once the transactions have gone through I'd like to move it to a wallet I control. How easy is this to do and do you have any recommendations?

Is it the dip yet?

Briefly saw 7.9k

I have no intention of selling any time soon. 
Just worth knowing. 
Would it take the same amount of time to transfer from a hardware wallet like Trezor?

Neither Coinbase or GDAX shows the dip yesterday to 8.5/6 whatever it was. Did I just dream it?

I also have one coming in the mail. I have no idea how to get my coin from GDAX onto it, sure I'll figure it out. Presumably there are hideous fees involved as with every Coinbase transfer?
