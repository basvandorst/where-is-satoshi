@_date: 2014-03-18 02:10:14
hahaaaa!!! welcome new friend! 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:50:22
Ah well... it's a chance I've taken for 15 years and it's a chance I'll continue to take. Quick Google search will show you what kinda car I drive.. that's kinda neat. I love my old car. DON'T HURT IT. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:51:35
yeah there's nothing in my history that's particularly incriminating... and I don't really spout hate for the government.. in all actuality... I LOVE THE GOVERMENT.... I THINK THAT THEY DO THE THINGS THEY DO TO PROTECT... RIGHT? 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:09:29
Yeah, I'm with him on the indifference. I guess if I was a troll and pissed people off all the time... but I really don't fear the things you've mentioned. I guess people are different. I try to be civil online and trust that it's enough to keep the crazy's at bay. If Boxxy can survive doxing and come out on top... I can too, right? 
Also.. I challenge you to reset my twitter password. Good luck. Screen name is caseyfuntime.

and the geography test deal was not me. I'm 32 and have not been in school in some time. I'm curious to know who that was though... and how one might be led to that from my profile information. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:03:36
yeah... I don't do anything that would get me in shit with this account.. as I mentioned, it's my name. 
I have a throwaway for the questionable shit, and no one would ever link that account to me. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:57:30
okay.. I mean I understand it... I guess I just don't care much about people knowing about me or what I'm into or where I live or what my phone number is. I know that stuff scares a lot of people.. but my online persona isn't something many people would be interested in. hell, I use my real name as my username. 
I live in Lafayette, LA, I work at Best Buy... my phone number is 3372470933... I wonder what else could be found... I'm sure my address is out there. My twitter (which I rarely use) is caseyfuntime. I dunno. 
Edit: it's been a few hours and I have no unknown calls or texts to my phone, and my twitter account has not been hacked. guess I'm a lucky guy.

I see the downsides from over sharing... that exists in all of life.. not just online. I do not feel that I over share. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:41:52
impressive work young pallywad (sp?). 
I'm not going to address everything you mentioned.. but yeah.. it's easy to find my Facebook. but you should've also noticed I work at GNC. and pics of girls asses are actually quite appropriate in my line of work.. especially given the fact we promote healthy bodies as the result of a good workout regimen. I don't post nudes anywhere. 
I do not have a drinking problem. I like craft beer. I AM on a quest to try 200 unique beers. notice I have not accomplished that in the 6 months I've been posting beer pics. I drink a couple beers a few nights a week.... I am trying to drink less... because it's a lot of calories... and I'm trying to get back down to the weight I was in the NSFW briefs photo I've posted to reddit and Facebook.
there it is again in case you missed it. 
I do not recall using the word fag on Facebook.... possibly here a couple of times.. but it's okay.. my best friends are gay, right? 
the shot gun was a sawed off shot gun... and it wasn't just for a picture... I shot it like that.. and I suffered no consequences as a result... other than horrible aim. 
my mother is deceased.. if you dig a little further, you'll find that. check out my profile pic of me holding a super soaker I got my last Christmas with her.

Couple of questions about this portion... I rarely talk about exercising on Facebook or anywhere... what did you find that you are referring to? also... I don't think there's an employer out there who would discourage exercise.. certainly not any company I'd work for. 
Also... what injuries have I exacerbated? I had a sprained ankle a few years ago... but I didn't make a huge deal out of that. 
... and the hate on the religious.... well that was years ago as well.. when I was first coming to terms with my own atheism... I'm not proud of it. but I'm not ashamed of it.. and I won't hide it. I've grown since then, and I am proud of the atheist I've become. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:13:36
I do make a lot of posts... but I don't I piss anyone off enough to do anything with the info they could find from me here. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:52:30
ah.. cool.. yeah that was stuff I shared in fitnesscirclejerk. I knew before I started working that I was susceptible to hernias, as I had one when I was 10 years old. it was only matter of time before it'd happen again lighting heavy as an adult. but I knew it would be fixed. and the doctor told me I could continue lifting heavy while waiting for the surgery. I used a special belt while lifting to ensure my insides.. stayed.. inside for the most part. 
was it a bad idea? probably. 
is it something I'd be concerned  with potential employers seeing? 
No. Not at all. 
Interesting assessment on the lower back thing... but I never pulled or squatted heavy with a sore back. I got a hernia cause I lifted fucking heavy and by body isn't naturally built for that. 
but I always far more concerned with injuring my spine. so I never chanced pushing myself too far in that regard. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:50:04
yeah.. I mean considering I use my real name for this.. I do not deny one bit that it's easy to find my info... remember.. I'm not hiding behind a phony screen name. 
but I still don't see how it's a problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:31:00
I don't understand why people are so concerned with people finding out who they are. My account's 3 years old and I use my real name for crying out loud. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:00:49
also... you see an employer who might question my critical thinking. I see an employer who recognizes my willingness to persevere and push forward no matter the potential consequences. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:55:20
yeah... I'll probably never work a traditional 9-5...i much rather have weekdays off. 
but even if I did.. I'm not going to hide that much of who I am just for the sake of having a certain kind of job. I probably wouldn't enjoy that kind of job anyway. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:37:55
There are people you meet IRL who like to screw over people for fun and profit.. I'm not going to walk around wearing a burka because of it. I've interacted with thousands of people in person who have known my name. I don't think it would make much sense to go that far to conceal my identity. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:29:42
What's wrong with being identified? 
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:00:31
wow that's crazy.... all I found was shit attributed to me with that screen name... I can't believe there are so many pictures of my car. I'd forgotten I posted all that. I actually befriended a girl on Facebook because at one time, we possessed the same name. she got married though, so now that friendship has lost its purpose. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:10:47
Man.. back injuries are my greatest fear. I thought deadlifts would do me in.. but it was actually the feared buttwink during squats that caused me the most sustained damage... I only do squats on the Smith now. back has been free of pain since I adopted this strategy.
