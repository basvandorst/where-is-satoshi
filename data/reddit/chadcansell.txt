I used to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I don't really care anymore.  He is telling people to keep their money in an exchange so they can "run for the door".   No conspiracy theory needed.  He speaks for himself here.

Oh no.  That was a happy day.  I even became happy again when I paid taxes on those BCH earnings.  Of course I sold it as soon as I got it.

You can create a bunch of tokens on an etherium contract right?  I once thought it would be cool for my kids to start a school crypto.

Update.  I switched BTC to eth last night and they allowed eth to trans to another wallet 24 hours later after trying.  Message said 72 hours to clear but they have a button to escalate where the get dL and a selfy .  Just 30usd left to get out.

A couple of things.  I think you mean to say the genesis “block” or “first block”.  I don’t think anyone could ever deem a number of bitcoins “lost”.  I think the best one could hope for would be to get a group of clever programmers to find a way to quantify the number of bitcoins placed in immediate cold storage or never used for transaction?  As for “lost” bitcoins, it would be impossible to find out if some cold storage bitcoins are truly lost or sitting in a drawer somewhere.  This alone would make any accounting or ruling over those coins unfeasible. Perhaps some arbitrary number could be dreamed up using available data.  If everyone were convinced these coins were “lost”, you could create an alt coin.  Call it “lost coin” .  Cap it at the arbitrary amount that was determined and release it after the 21 millionth coin is mined.  Hype that coin and see if it will have any value in the marketplace.  By that time, developers could find a way to dole it out through wallet transactions vs. mining it.  Sort of like the “take a penny” tray at 7-11☺️.  Just a thought.

Fees go higher and it becomes a version of gold due to stability and support OR Lightning or another iteration will help keep fees palatable.  BTC will clear against your account like a debit card transaction.  Slow and with fees, but still an honest version of money.
@_date: 2019-06-02 02:00:16
Any business owner would be different.  A farmers market guy may wait months.  A coffee shop owner may do it once a day or week, or when rent is due.  A guy selling a Lambo may do it in an hour.  It all depends on your appetite for fees and time.  It takes time for banks to settle on transactions.  You’ll need to shop for a good exchange and perform some conversions to see what you’ll put up with.

The claim that bitcoin is nothing and the transfer of digital money known as USD is something is baseless.  Also, the notion that gold is mined and done is baseless too.  Gold has to be transported in commerce, cut, protected, stamped, conveyed, etc.  The argument that too much electricity is required to process BTC exchanges has teeth.  The only thing I would add however is that protecting the strength of the USD also takes energy.  Let’s face it.  The USD is backed by aircraft carriers, armies, nukes, etc.  Without this, our influence would diminish and our currency would become worthless.  It is said that when money crosses boarders, boots don’t.  BTC is worldwide and requires no posturing, killing, or coercion.  Also, tech tends to lessen problems.  For example, we toss aluminum cans in the trash, but when aluminum was first created, it was massively overpriced and rare,

I’ve stayed in hostels.  Money is like your only lifeline away from home. BTC is money so it has to be protected.  Not the best topic.  The important thing is to find the people that know the girls that like to party.

I own precious metal and became interested in BTC in 2013.   I bought some within 24 hours using Western Union☺️.  As a believer in metal, I knew BTC was a superior alternative to fiat immediately.  People thought I was crazy.  It pays to know history.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:50:49
Haha.  Nobody really knows.  I will say that owning it and watching go 10x twice makes one consider a trend��
@_date: 2019-06-02 02:05:18
This was a different time.  I can see a lot of parallels, but they really are two different animals if you read the history to compare crypto vs. fiat to issued notes vs. precious/semiprecious metals.  Even today precious metals for some are the only real money.  Btw, Nixon had to get us off the silver standard.  Weaker unbacked currencies were ripping us off.

In 2013 When it was at 100, I predicted 35k in 2024.  It still seems to be on track.
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:25:47
Yeah, I get that.  I made and effort to separate CCP from Chinese people in my question because I thought that was at least the present situation.   Do you think BTC poses a threat to the CCP “new communism” or is that just wishful thinking?

I view the fall out of fiat like death.  I know it is inevitable.  I just want to do it in my sleep and after the people I care about have been taken care of.  Be careful what you wish for.

Quantum computing could be a boost to transaction speed and reduced energy costs assuming the power wouldn’t be massed for a 51% take over, but think of it this way:  The first to go would be BCH, then I guess those miners would switch to BTC which (I assume) would thwart that likelihood perhaps.  As far as AI is concerned, fiat would be the soft target, so that too could boost crypto adoption and cause everyone to ramp up their security.  If all that really did happen, the risks would appear in many more places.  Crypto would certainly be a topic to discuss around the camp fire.  In future or past tense, I’m not certain☺️
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:18:21
It means that communist China is going to deliver a few more blows beforehand to stave off adoption of BTC by the Chinese people with their fake crypto.

How about correlate your diversity to market cap.  If ETH is 15% of total crypto market cap let’s say, put 15% there, give BTC the rest.  That seems fair I would think.

I think someone doing 10k in transactions over a long period of time could get a knock on the door.  A few transaction?  No.  That seems like someone selling their gold for 10K vs. setting up a storefront business to buy and sell gold.  I reported having sold a sizable quantity on my return last year.  Just pay taxes on it at the end of the year and sleep well.  Bitcoin is a digital commodity in the U.S.  it is not viewed as money by the dark overlord Uncle Sam.  (I’m not a lawyer).

Wow, he said Milton Friedman, Nobel prize winner, said central banks are like kids playing bumper cars.  One thing I do want to note however (I’m ancient compared to the average reddit dude). Japan has been doing the ZIRP thing since the 90s I think.  I don’t think most people realize how long the central banks can play these games.  Bitcoin COULD be their undoing.  I don’t think we can wait on their “stupidity” to catch up with them.  People don’t view hyperinflation in countries like Argentina as having been a systemic cause.  It’s the whole ant and the grasshopper fable.  Winter may be a long time coming...unless Bitcoin manages to gain a firmer foothold.  BTW.  I think the Japanese may have invented BTC as a financial parachute for their people.
