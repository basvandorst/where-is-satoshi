It probably doesn't matter if it goes up or down; the only bad outcome would be more sideways movement. My reasoning: if the price dumps, we can get in cheaper for later; if the price goes up -&gt; Moon :-)
Either way, a crash is good for us crypto hodlers

You could always buy BTC on the first exchange and transfer it to gdax, then wait before selling until BTC has reached your sell point. There are no guarantees though that BTC will rise in value after your transfer...

Even worse, if BCH dumps after trading starts, lots of people will be holding tax bags instead of profits!

No you only need a public address to send bitcoin to it. Splitting the private key in half would be kinda smart IMO

Np, biggest thing to remember is to stay calm and plan every move ahead before you do it.

I think it says 1 of 2 on the front. Perhaps you only have half of the available loot! Send your mom back to that place! The other possibility is that only half the private key is on that drive o_O

That depends on the previous owner. Essentially he is looking for either a wallet file or a text file with the public/private key pair. This file might be additionally encrypted or password zipped etc.... So he has to be lucky!

The theory of evolution

People seem to be forgetting that when there is a crisis, most central banks respond by printing money. When this happens, the amount of dollars in the system increases but the bitcoin supply is stable. Ergo, USD denominated bitcoin prices rise.

Nothing to worry about. Guy obviously didn't read the white paper. He is missing the fact that BTC can never have infinite velocity as there is a 10 minutes average confirmation time. So just hodl!
