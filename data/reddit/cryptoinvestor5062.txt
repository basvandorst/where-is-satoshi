Can confirm, I have a Ukraine girlfriend and visited there last month. Its like going back 20 - 30 years in time and _EVERYONE_ and their mother is taking drugs on a regular basis and its seen as uncommon to not take drugs. Its a very grey and sad country with alot of desperate people trying to get out of there by any means possible. And I see people commenting about low crime rates, yes when you can pay the police a small amount of money for them to say ok sir, have a nice day. Then ofcourse the crime rate is low. Nothing gets reported. The police there make more money on corruption than they do from their salory. In Ukraine if you have money you have power. Everyone and everything can be bought. Its one of the most corrupt countrys in the world. Edit; My girlfriend bought a driving license for 200 euros in Ukraine thats also "legal" to drive in Europe with and she does without knowing how to drive, her car is fucked up beyond mesurement because she has small crashes all the time. She also bought a license to work as a lawyer in ukraine for 1400 euros. Everything is documented and stamped. What school she went to, what grades she got and fake intern ships at companys. She never went to law school one day and has never read a law book in her life.

If you try argue with women using factual statements you will understand how angry they are for being wrong. I go sleep in the car because its easier than staying there listning to her yelling all night. Do I have a good/positive relationship. I want to say no. But we have good times and bad times. When its good its really good, when its bad its really bad. And shes a sexy girl and we have nice sex several times a day. And in my experiance thats worth staying for.

We actually had a fight yesterday because I told her the country was very cheap and the corruption is strong there, needless to say the conversation did not go well and I slept in the car tonight. She was very upset I called her country a cheap place. But seriously. If you are from a rich european country and you go to ukraine and get your hair cut for less than a milk costs in my country. How is it not cheap. TLDR: yes she knows and shes angry about it.

Because if they announced it in advance they would loose alot of profit as people would load up on BCH on other exchanges waiting for it to be released on Coinbase / Gdax so the price would go up. Hence Coinbase / Gdax would loose alot of trading profit from people not using their exchange to buy it.

Kyiv is defenetly better than rest of Ukraine, I stayed in Kryvyi Rih
And what I explained above is 100% factual atleast in that city. I was in Kyiv for 2 days and I agree its better there but still much of the same.

That last part reminds me of a quote I heard: "I sweep the streets I used to own" No clue where its from but its been stickled in my mind for the past 10 years.

Why would you ask someone who is totally unequipped to evaluate an investment about investing? Thats on you brother. Not her.

Wait a minute, did you just say investors pulled out money for the chinese new year and that caused the price to drop from 19k to 6k? Let me guess, you still believe in santa claus dont you?

This, find someone who believes in you and does not ridicule you for your decisions, even if they think its the wrong decision.

My only question is what incentive does microsoft have for buying github at the pricetag of 7,5 billion microsoft shares?

I support this, I also heard Tether is a great investment right now, only 1$. Super undervalued.

You would be better off not telling your family about your investments. No matter what you invest in they will always link you bad news about the company or currency or whatever you invested in when they have the chance. This is why most people only talk about investments to other people who are actually educated about investing and economics.

The fact that some people upvoted this 100 times says enough about this sub.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:43:40
Well obviously...
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:58:06
Sounds like the crypto community, every good or remotely positive gets upvoted, and all the bad and negative gets downvoted. Its like an echo chamber. Kind of like church. Nobody wants to listen to the people whos saying something you dont believe. "I dont think god is real" "may god help your soul" kind of thing.

You should have a DNA check of the baby to be safe, I have seen too many doctors go to jail because they inserted their own sperm to the woman instead of the actual father or sperm donor. Not saying this to be rude or in any way insult you, but just to be on the safe side.
