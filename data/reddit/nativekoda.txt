This is awesome.
Grubgo - a restaurant delivery service located in St. Louis MO started accepting bitcoin yesterday! They deliver for the best restaurants in St. Louis (which do not deliver food). You can order anything from steak to sushi and groceries to candy bars!
By there acceptance of bitcoin, indirectly many other businesses in St. Louis accept bitcoin without even realizing it!

I think Grubgo's ( acceptance of bitcoin will even have more of an impact than Housewife's episodes on bitcoin.
Through them many other businesses accept bitcoin whether the actual businesses do or not! Plus no one really accepts bitcoin in the midwest atm.

The order is calculated in dollars; then converted into BTC based on its current trading price atm. It's very unlikey that any two people who buy even the same dollar amount of food would be paying the same price in BTC. The market fluctuates too much for that to happen at this time. However, Grubgo only states a price to the fourth decimal place. If more than one person happen to be paying the exact same price, the additional decimal places would be more than enough to represent the order number. 
5.0042 could be the price of two orders
But order number 132 would be 5.00420132 and so on

 - a delivery service in St. Louis, MO. They form actual partnerships with restaurants all around St. Louis so that the customer gets the food for the same price they would in the actual restaurant. By next week you can order from 40 different locations: from steak, sushi, and ice cream to the presidents favorite pizza place, Pi!
Here is their bitcoin payment page:

Thanks, I will bring this up to them.

thats actually very true. Grubgo would need to get all kinds of licensing, plus it would be straying from its mission statement.

Here is the ultimate list for St. louis.

since grubgo I believe.

but if we had cash on us .... which we have to sometimes, maybe something like this could go down

Please post links under this comment that you think best explain bitcoin in the simplest of terms and the impact it has already have. I want to add a What is bitcoin? link to this article for people who are unaware.

You have good points. Someone on the team was warned that having the address on the page as editable text made Grubgo vulnerable to an attack. I believe this was a misunderstanding and the problem wasn't the editable text but elsewhere. I'm looking in to it.

I'm buying some Pi pizza this weekend through Grubgo with Bitcoin!!
Bitcoin!!! FUCK YEA

i agree with the real time chat session.
I have talked to many who believe in the ideal of bitcoin, but say it is not yet practical for them to get involved. I believe if those same people were going to buy food through grubgo,and they had the option of getting bitcoins within say an hour or two with virtually no fee, why would they not purchase their meal in bitcoin to strengthen the ideal they believe in?
Getting bitcoins must be both instant and cheap. The cheapness of dwolla, and the speed of bitinstant must be combined.

is it that big of an inconvenience to copy and paste an address into the "send to" tab of your wallet?
@_date: 2012-02-18 02:51:11
This is a very interesting idea. Could you expound on this a bit more?
