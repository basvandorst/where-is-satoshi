The FAQ [is] long and not clear for people just learning about bitcoin.
To describe a currency you need to start, IMO with either what its exchangeable for or why its in short supply and therefor a viable exchange media.

Its flexible - if we get a good idea that's too big for a "no reason" gift i can move it to the hollidays

Thanks.  he is older so I wonder if he might like a coinedbit to help explain the concept

Thank you.  Hopefully he can set up his own basic thumb drive  - love the idea of a couple of Ironkeys as "stocking stuffers"  Thanks again.

It not the first time a currency has not been officially exchangable - both the Russian and Chinese currencies went through a period like that. Other currencies without either security or a fiat from a government with a strong level of confidence.
In each case, private exchanges were set up - underground in authoritarian states or openly in democracies.
for predicting the future (and limits thereof) I'll defer to cryptorific - I think he nailed the uncertainty.

I understand the attachment to gold - its been around so long and has been accepted by so many different nations...
But I don't think gold is the competition - I think bitcoin's upward limit will be determined by the public's acceptance of any currency they perceive as created by a computer.
(and I'm sure the insides of the current system would scare the hell out of the public too)
