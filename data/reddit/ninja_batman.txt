They make a boat load from charging fees, not from the fees they are charged by the Bitcoin network. Any reduction in Bitcoin fees would amount to profit for Coinbase.

This is only a requirement if your wallet receive funds (since you need to be online in order to broadcast breach remedy transactions). If your wallet does support receiving funds it only needs to go online every few days (this depends upon what the channel is configured for - Eclair uses 14 days).
I believe Eclair's solution is to run in the background at a regular interval at check for these breach transactions - I believe they notify you if this fails. My assumption is that Electrum will do something similar.
Alternatively you can use watchtowers - these are still in development, but it would allow you to trustlessly have someone else broadcast the breach remedy transactions if a breach occurred. You could give these transactions to a few watchtowers, and pay them a small fee if they have to broadcast this transaction.

100% agreed. Huge bitcoin supporter, but pulling money out of your 401k is going to involve both fees and taxes. This is a terrible idea.
Before you proceed, please at least do the math on what it will cost for the early withdrawal. You will pay a fee + income taxes at your marginal rate. It will not be cheap.

Just noticed fees were down, so I used this opportunity to transfer some funds between my wallets. Paid 2 sat / byte and it confirmed in the next block.
Does anyone know of a service that will alert you when fees are under a certain threshold? I've had cases in the past where I wanted to transfer funds, but didn't need to immediately, so I was happy to wait until fees dropped.

Instead of topping off, can't someone (such as Coinbase) transfer additional funds to your existing channel?
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:02:34


This isn't true. Do some research: 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:37:22
For me the problem is less about having to do the tax calculation (I already use software for this), and more about the cost of being forced to realize gains whenever I make a purchase. If small transactions were excluded as proposed, it would give me a large incentive to use Bitcoin since I'd be realizing gains without paying taxes. It would effectively be a 15% discount on everything. 
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:15:07


The problem is that no matter how much you purchased, you're likely pissed at yourself for not purchasing more. I take solace in the fact that I likely would have already sold if I had purchased significantly more.

If you're okay with a more trader focused ui, Coinbase Pro is a great option with lower fees. Big difference is that you have to transfer USD funds in first (which take 3-10 days to arrive), but once you purchase you can immediately withdraw.

One thing I have struggled with is how to report crypto-asset trades. For example, I have traded (bots :) ) cryptokitties and mlbcryptobaseball players. I have really struggled to figure out how to tax this, how to get the data for it, etc.
For cryptokitties, for example, here are some of the questions I have:
* How do I treat the sales? As a purchase and then sale of an asset, so purchase is what I paid for the kitten, profit is sale price - price I paid - fees?
* How do I get the data necessary to calculate this information - I actually tried writing scripts to accomplish this, but it is incredibly hard to parse ERC721 transactions since bid transactions typically send a little bit of ETH back to cancel out overpayments, there are internal txs from when people pay you (that are only accessible via a custom eth node, or via scraping etherscan).
* I currently use cointracking to calculate what I owe - I could not find out how to actually import this data into the system - it seemed like I'd have to manually calculate everything with a custom spreadsheet, etc. I also looked at bitcoin.tax, which has the same issue.
I actually spent several days trying to get this data this past tax season, and just... kinda gave up and reported a lump sum (that resulted in me paying the same or more in taxes). I am really curious how people handled this, especially if I, someone with programming experience that spent several days trying to do it properly couldn't, how in the heck did *anyone* report this properly.
I want to pay my taxes, but it's incredibly hard.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:32:47

And ignoring the politics, Bitpay is a horrible UI. They have their own proprietary payment protocol that doesn't work with most wallets. I have several times now gone to donate to a project, or make a payment, but left because they use Bitpay, and my wallet (and most wallets) doesn't work with it.

I think this is moreso Kroger showing an interest in a new technology that could be helpful to them further into the future.

You're avoiding the original question. A "normal" car does not mean new, and does not have to cost anywhere near $37k. I purchased my most recent car for $9k, and I'd consider it a pretty nice car. I easily could have purchased something cheaper. My car before that was ~$5k. I've had my current car for 5 years, and I expect it to easily last me another 5.


This is absurd. If you are paying $9k in costs per year on your car, and you are making $30k / year, you are doing something wrong. I make substantially more than this, and my car costs me ~$1500 / year (I've done the math).
And before you reply that you have to buy a "new" car to avoid maintenance issues / costs - both of my cars (that were well under $10k) worked quite well with no major maintenance issues.

That's a fair point - a 51% attack allows the attacker to revert history, it doesn't allow the attacker to directly steal funds. Places like exchanges are most at risk.


One could profit by attacking an exchange. For example, deposit a bunch of BCH, wait for it to confirm, withdraw your funds via BTC, and then rewrite history to send your BCH funds back to yourself (rather than sending them to the exchange).
It's also worth pointing out that the attack cost is actually quite low for a large miner. They only need to dedicate mining resources during the attack (a few hours), and they will earn block rewards during the attack. This means a BTC miner could switch to BCH just to wreak havoc for a few hours - even if they don't do anything explicitly malicious to rewrite history to benefit themselves, they could trade their BCH for BTC after the fact and end up with a similar amount to what they would have originally earned. Their profit could come from simple PR damage to competing coins.

Does lightning support receiving funds from someone if you don't have any channels open yet? When I've looked into this, it looks like you have to have a channel open with enough money available in the direction the person is sending money. Also, I believe your node needs to be online so you can generate an invoice for an arbitrary tip amount.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:14:44
To me the ideal setup would be to allow tipping via lightning to someone's address (not sure if this is possible without generating an invoice first). If they don't have an account yet, it could fallback on a centralized model that accepts the payment on your behalf until you setup an address.

But they are going to be mining (using the energy) either way, and they still earn block rewards when carrying out a 51% attack. Assuming they are successful, they earn *all* of the rewards during the attack period.

Breez is definitely the way to go. Don't use blue wallet (it's custodial).

I agree, which is why I asked this question. I appreciate the additional context.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:05:31
This is terrible logic. You could just convert the cash you get to BTC, and make a profit + profit (or loss) on the gains.

Static file backups are 1 in review pr away. As someone trying to integrating lightning payments into a service, this is huge.
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:44:07
I also think this is what is going to happen. If you are well positioned in the network now, you can make okay money, but as the network grows, it's going to be a race to the bottom, even moreso than it is for mining, since the only 'capital cost' is locking up funds temporarily.

@_date: 2019-02-07 03:29:59
[This]( is the last remaining pr - it has a good description, but I'll attempt to summarize.
With lightning you need to backup the state of all of your channels, and these backups need to be completely up to date (if you try to close a channel with an out of date state, I believe this can be seen as an attack on the network, resulting in penalties). Currently you can manually backup your `~/.lnd` directory, but 1. you have to back this up continually (so it isn't out of date) and 2. there is no guarantee that the state on disk is fully up to date (it could be cached in memory).
The pr adds a few new options for backing up your channel state. You can receive streaming updates via an rpc interface, manually request backups over rpc, or backup the new `channels.backup` file in your ~/.lnd directory.
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:50:23


I also think the GP is correct here, but we should be able to see the whitepaper in a few days and actually figure it out.
My guess is they are going to release something halfway between Bitcoin and a centralized system like miles. I honestly expect something a lot closer to Ripple quite honestly (control split amongst n organizations). I am particularly interested to see what sort of exchanging they allow - this actually has the potential to be one of the simpler onramps to Bitcoin, etc for users.
@_date: 2019-10-05 12:40:01
Some of these fees are out of date. Ex: Coinbase has changed their fees twice since this was published.
@_date: 2019-02-17 00:44:37
Agreed. Stores pay more to accept credit cards, but they eat this cost. Until they start passing the savings back to consumers as cash back or a discount, it isn't going to make sense to pay in crypto. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:38:53
Sure, but you can sweep your funds whenever you want - at most you'll be risking $1 or so at a time.

Does this mean a company would need to register in order to even *accept* cryptocurrencies?

Eat the cost, or pass or on to consumers is all the same if there is no option for consumers to opt out.

While true, there's no reason it wouldn't be possible to have tippin point directly at your node once sphinx is a thing (invoiceless payments for lightning). Also, even if you are using their custodial service, you can transfer out at any time instantly, and with 0 fee, so your risk is pretty limited. In my experience I usually have &lt; $1 at tippin, and sweep funds once every week or so. Seems like a fair trade off for the convenience.
Everything isn't black and white (custodial always bad, non-custodial always good).

I can feel the adoption in these comments.
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:01:28
As a counterpoint - I have ~10 channels with my node (with both incoming and outgoing capacity), and I've routed a total of 2 payments over the past month earning me 2 satoshis in fees.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:26:51
The biggest risk right now is that you lose the data directory behind your node, but backup options should be improving in the next month or two.
There are a number of mobile wallets (such as Eclair) that handle backups for you, which are pretty good options if you don't need to be able to receive.

If you want to use a web based service, hwile not perfect, I'd recommend just searching for a qr code generator site, and using that, and then manually verify a few characters before sending. I personally use Pushbullet.

I'll bite. 
This is how adoption happens. Prove out the demand side using proxy services like this, and then once it's big enough retailers will start considering accepting it directly. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:04:44
I bet it's a mix of the owner being interested in Bitcoin and wanting people to use it, and a way to get people comfortable paying with it (offer a significant discount now, decrease it over time).
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:40:16
I'm not sure that's 100% true. There are definitely benefits to being early, but I think those benefits are going to be far outweighed by supply and demand pressures. Even if you're early, it's going to be a race to the bottom fee wise.
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:54:36
But that doesn't matter if they are getting synced to a server.
@_date: 2019-02-12 05:53:43
And all they can do is restrict payments through their node (and they don't know the source or destination because of onion routing). If they do decide to block your payments, it opens up an opportunity for a competitor to pop up and route for you.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:05:10
I agree with this. At this point I consider lightning to be similar to an everyday wallet that you carry in your pocket. There's some (very small) risk that you might lose your funds due to a strange bug, or other issue, but if you limit the amount of funds in that wallet, this is a manageable risk.
If you want to try it out, Breez is a great option. They'll handle backups and opening channels for you, and it's 100% non-custodial. I simply fill the wallet with ~$100, and then use it until I need to refill.
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:20:58
This. Typically merchants will set a minimum channel size, and then rebalance across their channels to fill one up before closing it out. 
Customers typically either have a channel open directly with the merchant, or they have a connection to someone else in the mesh network with channels that make it to the merchant.

Breez is a good option (they allow you to deposit onchain, and convert intoa  channel).
 is another option, but you will need inbound capacity before you can use it.
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:04:06


Exactly this. I regularly see people complain about services that accept BTC, but use payment providers that immediately convert it into Fiat, but this is exactly how adoption works. Slowly places accept BTC for payment, while others become willing to pay people in BTC. This is the bootstrapping phase. At some point you'll have wide enough adoption that providers will start considering keeping some BTC, and paying suppliers, etc directly in it.
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:09:48


I don't think you'll ever get to a point where no one is settling on layer 1. I imagine people will still use it for VERY large transfers where the extra fee is worth the guarantee. The vision in my mind is for layer 1 to become like the courts, and layer 2 to become like every day commerce. You're able to trade on 'layer 2' because 'layer 1' is there and available in case of a dispute between parties, but by moving most stuff from layer 1 to layer 2 you allow an order of magnitude increase in capacity (since very few things should have to fall back to layer 1).
Over time I imagine the percentage of trade occurring on layer 2 will increase exponentially (or at least that's what we all hope), while layer 1 will increase linearly.

I agree that this is bad practice for large amounts, but if you have a bunch of wallets, I personally don't think it is unreasonable to store the backup seed phrase in your password manager or as encrypted files on disk for the smaller ones.

I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin, and agree that the vast majority of these smaller coins are piles of garbage, but I honestly don't see any harm in accepting them as payment on websites like these. It's disappointing to see comments like these when the websites are actually fairly neat.

This is huge news for merchants accepting lightning as well. Previously you were basically risking any funds stored in channels. 
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:41:29


It sucks that they are not clear about this. On chain funds are stored using keys on your device. Lightning funds are transferred and stored on their server in their wallet. They have full control of those funds.
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:31:41

Am I reading it correctly right now - the recommended fee would be ~50 sat/byte?
What's the best way to estimate it if I want it to confirm in the next couple of hours? I opened and closed some lightning channels last night and paid ~$1-2 per transaction, which seemed crazy, but I didn't want the transaction to get stuck for days since lnd doesn't offer a way to replace by fee.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:57:15
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:30:49
Am I correct in understanding that this requires your counterparty to support channel recovery, and to not cheat you (they could choose to use an old channel state). I believe this would be a risky move though since they don't know that you no longer have your channel state, so they could lose their funds if you weren't recovering.

It really is. As is, it makes little sense to pay with crypto vs a credit card since I get cash back for spending on my credit card, but if stores started offering 3-5% off, I'd be pretty tempted to start using it.
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:11:57
I agree that it's very important for the industry to start adopting lightning network (I actually work at a place that is working on implementing it as we speak), but I do think it's still too early for widespread adoption. There is a reason channels are still limited to 0.16 BTC.
The biggest issue I ran into was the lack of a good backup option. For lnd you currently have to stop your node, and backup the entire lnd directory (I believe clightning is similar). This backup needs to be updated every time a channel changes state (every time you make, or receive a transaction, including a forwarded transaction). If you ever try to restore your node with an out of date backup, you can lose the funds in your channel (since this can be seen as an attack on the network). People currently using lightning are basically accepting this risk (or they have some custom implementation that they aren't sharing). This feels similar to bitcoin-core before bip39 seeds were a thing. There are open prs and issues where this is being discussed, so it is definitely coming down the pipeline.
Basically, I am *very* excited about lightning, but I think it's going to take another 6 months to a year for nodes to get to a state where more companies are comfortable accepting it.

This is the primary issue for me. They use an unsupported address format that most wallets don't support. It's a huge pita.
There have been several cases where I went to make a purchase, and completely bailed due to the use of Bitpay. Not due to political reasons, but because I couldn't use any of my wallets. Ledger was the most recent case (was trying to buy a Ledger X, and just gave up).

I've really been enjoying this lately. Transactions for less than a penny makes it a lot easier to try things like lightning out (since it doesn't cost much). 
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:21:39
Totally agree - openbazaar is doing some interesting work around this. I'd also love to see stores give a kickback to cover the credit card fee I'm missing out on by using cryptocurrencies. Either a percentage back in bitcoin, or a store specific coin or something.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:38:44
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:53:08
I agree, and that used to be a large blocker for me, but at this point I am tracking and submitting my crypto transactions ever year anyways, so I keep 1 wallet with funds that I use for spending. Whenever it gets under a certain amount I buy more to reload it. Taxes at the end of the year are basically downloading the transaction history and adding it to my spreadsheet. That said, lightning payments are now a huge headache for me since there aren't an easy way to track them.
If we ever have a law pass that removes tax tracking requirements for small purchases, it would be a huge boon for adoption overnight. This benefit would easily outweigh any cashback credit cards provide, would simplify taxes for people, and would likely result in a large uptick in usage overnight. I can say personally that I'd start using crypto on every transaction possible.

I don't think that rate is accurate. I spent a few hours last year figuring out their pricing and looking at my bills and I believe I figured it out. Here's the [best page that describes it]( Your price per kwh is a combination of: energy charge + power supply adjustment + community benefit charges + regulatory charges (check your bill and this will make more sense).
You are charged 2.8c + 2.936c + 3.007c + 0.561c + 1.362c = 10.667c / kwh for the first 500kwh of energy. I easily exceed that in my apartment, so my mining is in tier 2, which costs me 13.698c / kwh.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:07:15
I see $3,790.16 as the current price while it's $3,602.20 on Coinbase Pro. And I still get to maintain control of my keys since I'd transfer to my wallet right after buying. Maker fee on Coinbase is 0% and taker fee is 0.3% - [link]( Paying $50 for a $1000 deposit doesn't seem worth it vs transferring to Coinbase and manually purchasing.
That said, I will admit I might not be your target market, and this may make sense for others. Just noting that in my case this doesn't make any sense.

Interesting. If I make a wall in my house out of gold, can I include that in my house's value? What about a painting of my private keys?
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:25:47
It really depends on what they built. It's possible they have a secure chip embedded in the device (similar to the chip Ledger or Trezor uses) that stores the private keys, and signs any transactions. This way even if the phone is compromised, an attacker can't steal your funds.
Depending on how they implement it though (ex: using the same screen as the rest of the phone), this could still be vulnerable to phishing attacks at the os layer.
I do see this approach as the end game for most wallets - most of our stuff is already stored on our phones, so it makes sense to come up with a secure way to store crypto on these devices.
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:59:57

Yeah, I've come to learn that overtime. Preordering miners never seems to work out well. The vast majority of time you'd make more money with less risk by just buying the coin. 
The only time it did make sense was during the runnup the second half of last year. Graphics cards were in short supply, but I was able to get a few and do alright. Just recently sold them and basically broke even on the cost of the cards ignoring the coins I mined.

They pad their exchange rate instead. Last time I calculated it the fees were a few percent vs 0.3% taker fee for Coinbase Pro.

Are there futures markets that go that far out into the future? If so, it would be interesting to offer this as a service.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:25:39
They support both onchain and lightning, and they use normal addresses for onchain instead of a weird link that most wallets don't support.

This might be a dumb question, but how does one go about trading these futures?

What if wallets had an optional 'proposed' transaction feature? Once you get to the confirmation page, the wallet would broadcast a signed message indicating the intent to send X amount of BTC to Y address. The client would then see a 'proposed transaction' in much the same way that they currently see pending transactions.
This could easily be built as a second network that runs independently of Bitcoin that wallets can opt in to using. The hard part is figuring out how to limit spam messages in a system like this.
Edit: Lightning network actually solves a lot of these problems, albeight in a slightly round about way. You open a channel directly with another person, at which point you have only risked the cost of opening the channel. Sending funds to someone requires an invoice directly from the other party, making it harder to mess up. Plus, it's cheap enough that you can send it via several transactions, or even stream the funds over a few minute period.

Does breez charge any fees for this operation?

Is there anything like this in the US (lightning or not)?
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:03:32
I did exactly the same thing. It was a huge PITA to figure it all out, and required me to write custom code to retrieve crypto kitty trades, but I paid my hefty crypto tax bill.

Sorry if this is a little offtopic, but one question I've had about Eclair wallet. How does the app handle watching for the other side of the channel to cheat? Does it run in the background on your phone and watch for this?
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:47:58
I would love to, but Coinbase fees are substantially lower.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:55:15
Coinbase pro specifically.

How does webln differ from links prefaced with 'lightning:'? I've been using these for my app, and they seem to work with webln fairly well.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:51:51
How (I'm genuinely curious)?
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:30:22
I recently got to experience this with a mobile wallet. No sweep functionality, so I found a fee calculator online and attempted to calculate the fee. Took a few tries, but I eventually got it to work.

Or if they don't report it until after the order ships.

This is a huge part of it for me. Their BIP70 addresses don't work with most wallets, so it's a horrible experience.

If we want widespread adoption, this is how it starts. Large businesses outsourcing payment acceptance until they get big enough that it makes sense to pull it in house. It is pretty frustrating to watch this response to retailers trying to wet their toes in the crypto waters.

I believe the parent poster was referring to blue wallet. 
I agree with you though, eclair is non-custodial, and it's surprisingly user friendly with how early lightning is. You will need to understand what a channel is to use it, but Eclair has an option to open the channel with a preset node, which makes things quite a bit easier.

If you haven't tried lightning yet, setup a wallet and try  It's honestly easier to use than Domino's own site (and incidentally cheaper as well).

Does anyone know if it's possible to export transactions from the mobile electrum wallet (needed for taxes)? I know you can on desktop, but I don't see any options on mobile. I tried using the label sync plugin, but it doesn't seem to sync between desktop and mobile (or I am misunderstanding it).
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:15:18
Is anyone else struggling with slow transaction times right now? There's only been one block in the past hour -&gt; I'm guessing this won't get solved until our next mining difficulty correction?

This is pretty neat - pre-allocated allowances are a neat way to remove the friction / cognitive load of micropayments.

No. [This article]( on Stackoverflow provides a good explanation.
The shortest tldr I can come up with -&gt; A hash function provides a mapping between an arbitrary length input and a (usually) fixed length output. Encryption provides a 1:1 mapping between an arbitrary input and a an output.
