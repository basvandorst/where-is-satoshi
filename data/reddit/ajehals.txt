Not at all, the candidates are listed, the campaign is broadly funded (you have to spend quite a bit up front) but it would have left the party with very little operational cash left to do any campaigning at all.  As donations came in it could be surer (and dip into reserves) that spending on the campaign wouldn't make it impossible to operate from June.  It essentially allows the party to recoup the cost of standing candidates and whilst the party was asking for donations in the run up to the elections, people seem more willing to donate when they are sure a party is standing and actually campaigning.
Bit of a chicken and egg thing really.

They do stuff outside of the elections too.

If you are comparing it to the US then it is (there are spending limits too...) and there isn't nearly as much money in politics , which perversely seems to make it a little bit harder to raise money too.  That said, the EU campaign cost a lot more than £5000 - that's cost of the deposit. But with crowd-funding you need a target you are likely to reach, or you get nothing.

To use the pozible - yes. You can also ping the party, but because of donation rules you can't donate entirely anonymously IIRC (which makes sense I suppose)

That would be a very different story!

treasury can give you the party bitcoin address (I could too, but then it's some random bloke making claims on the internet... don't want to put anyone in that position! - that address is also listed on the party site  if that helps.).

It costs £5000.00 to stand in EU elections, £500.00 to stand in Parliamentary elections.  If you can't stand or challenge the parties that are out there, you can't change anything.

It'll be used to cover the cost of the EU campaign and then any further campaigning. The amount is the same as the deposit required to run candidates in an EU region in the UK. That could be clearer though...

Yup, in the North West region of the UK (The cost of running and campaigning is pretty high and its a small party).

If people suddenly found they couldn't convert their gold or silver into something else it would drop the value (and increase the risk of holding it).   Half the reason people seem so keen on gold is because it is almost universally convertible.

Ah, it looked interesting.  I spoke to one of their guys about it a little while back and they were interested in talking to people who had/did use and hold bitcoin..  Seemed interesting and Demos do seem to put some decent things together on this kind of stuff.  Mostly...
