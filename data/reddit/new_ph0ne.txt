They're *priced* more than gold. 
And, you seriously believe a large, lumbering, overtly expensive public ledger is the future? Maybe if they fork it a few more times they'll get the formula correct lol. Probably not but they sure can try 
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:25:27
It's pronounced gif, you heathen 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:09:40
Short term gains tax doesn't care about conversion into fiat  
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:59:52
 You must be new to crypto. Asians have a huge influence on crypto prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:58:35
 It'll further congest the network and trxs fees will skyrocket. Perhaps that's the point the author was trying to make?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:35:54
Like it or not that's exactly how BTC is functioning and will continue to function 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:23:57
Hm. This move could actually be a good thing as it would move towards the decentralized goal again. Until of course LN goes live, lol.
Either way, China is quickly approaching the 51% threshold and them killing the mining monopoly might be good. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:39:23
I actually think the username is relevant here lol
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:02:01
I don't understand how people can put money into crypto and not fully understand market cap. Market cap is such a lazy way of evaluating an asset lol
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:55:50
That's a bingo
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:56:49
That's a bingo!
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:36:54
Because they'll be worthless lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:37
Exactly, lol. 
I'd wager a lot of these people are either willingly ignoring the recent history of 1999/2000 or they aren't old enough to appreciate it. 
Once I gain my investment back, I'm out and playing with house money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:17
I actually think if BTC falls (which is will, eventually, due to it's inherently poor scaling model) the rest of crypto will fall with it. At least for a significant period of time as people get spooked.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:53:19
Would never happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:03
But... we can buy graphics cards and pizza online! That's value! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:43:59
Unlucky, you mean.
Trading futures contracts almost inevitably means that desks will be trading on leverage because they'll need capital for initial vesting. With the bullshit happening at Tether, this is just asking for a huge crash a la LTCM back in 98. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:07
It's almost entirely speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:59
That feel when you dodge IRS taxes by keeping all your dirty money in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:40
You can't be serious, right? Have you even looked the YTD trends? Or MTD? Or even WTD? 
It's above 1000%
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:28
Idk wtf im saying. I just dropped a bunch of acid and can't really focus right now
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:28
I can't tell if you're trolling or actually being serious. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:56:41
Because greed trumps critical thinking. 
The memes on this sub are insufferable and just fueling the speculation. The big trading desks are now actively pursuing trading the futures on the coin. Hello instability, goodbye security. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:57
Likely less than 1% which demonstrates a massive speculative bubble with little (if any) corresponding inherent value 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:13
Show value outside of speculation and maybe the momentum holds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:54:28
Idk wtf im saying I just dropped some acid so I'm not focused rn
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:58:21
100% guaranteed it's a base USD rate with conversion into btc. No way is there a fixed amount of BTC every fortnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:52
Tether "dollars" helped quantitatively ease that transition
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:01
Eww. No way. Gdax is king. Move it off the exchange quick as pie, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:05:47
Not yet. Once leveraged futures contract and margin trading through big financial desks gets up and running - then it becomes a threat to the economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:04
And it'll drag down the alts, too. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:08:07
It almost certainly is a lack of perspective, lol. Of empathy, too, I'd wager. 
Ah, well. Par for the course, I guess. Thanks for the comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:06
Ah. That makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:18
No. Not even close.
A 1000 fold increase month to month would suggest it's being pumped up in speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:00:19
You're correct in the fundamental understanding of the contract. You would need to supply a certain percentage of collateral to mitigate risk to counter-party risk. That presents a very specific flavor of risk to individual investors and smaller firms due to the inherent volatility of the commodity. This certainly doesn't threaten any economy except your own. 
But, let's assume the tipping point has arrived and acceptance is now following a standard s-curve of adoption. This would encourage businesses to open up channels for BTC spending, larger firms to begin aggressively investing, and just generally further integration into the global economy. This opens up another unique kind of risk as wealth would not only be stored but also an exchange of that wealth would be witnessed. This is where things would start to get scary as political regulations would have the power to essentially wipe out the market over-night. We saw this happen back in September when The republic of China halted trading. What happens when the power-trading countries catch wind of this? What happens when these countries start halting the exchanges located in their borders? Bad things happen. Very bad things. 
Furthermore, as BTC price spiking hasn't followed a deflationary trend, the cost to invest substantially goes up, almost exponentially. Whether those funds need to be physically deposited in a brokerage account or not escapes me but deriving that collateral from held assets further increases the risk in an incetous manner. 
To answer the volume and depth question - I don't know the answer to that question as operations are still small. It's scheduled to hit NASDAQ end of Q2/ start Q3 2018. There's another exchange opening up futures later this month, too, I believe. How that affects the economy is detailed above as I understand it. Trading on margin pump the price higher and futures contracts would become increasingly risky with a need for commensurate collateral. 
Anyways, this high buy-in cost further encourages investors to trade on margins and expose themselves to greater and greater levels of risk. 
Hopefully that makes sense. I'm on mobile so the flow of the thought might be clunky. The take home message is that countries have a lot of power over the growth of BTC such that margin trading would become ever increasingly risky.

The IRS always gets theirs. If this is actually tax evasion than he's even more idiotic than I previously figured. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:25
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:48:25
It's more along the lines that businesses just don't want to deal with the hassle. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:19
That's... actually terrifying. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:50
I don't think taxes would have anything to do with that. You pay capital gains on cash earned not taxes on stocks owned. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:25
On what basis? The BTC craze is from regular joes and janes. BTC is considered blue chip to these people so if the blue chip falls why on Earth would expect them to have confidence in BTC clones?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:51:25

When were you when bitcoin died?
I was on bitfinex trading BTC on margin 
"Bitcoin is kill"

Got it. Keep fighting the good fight, son.

Hindsight sure is 20/20 with this one, lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:41:06
I take it you're not buying it.
Any comment on these mysterious USDT commissions around BTC market retraction points? Or should we just accept the in-house accounting?
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:27:24
LN serves to further centralize BTCs efforts. And, the energetic cost is what's stopping me. There's no positive ROI unless my electricity is subsidized. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:33:36
Fees and trx times. Plus, the centralization of mining just kills off any sort of actual use case, lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:35:55
It's not an issue of anyone being able to run a hub. It's an issue of efficiency. The fastest and cheapest transactions will occur through centralized locations to avoid as many "hops" as possible. So you see a not-so-dissimilar problem witnessed in China as they were approaching the 51% threshold. 
All of this adds to the multitude of reasons why LN is not being implemented and utilized currently despite it's heralded upgrades.  
And, PoW is dying out. PoS is a much more scalable and elegant solution. 
And, please look up the actual energetic utilization potential of solar or wind before making a case for it's integration into cryptocurrency mining. Spoiler - it's terrible.
