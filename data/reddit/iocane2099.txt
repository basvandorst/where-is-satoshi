I have been back and forth with avast and they told me it was finally fixed a while ago  It hasn't been updated since then, so it's not a virus. It just hit's as a false positive. Are your definitions up to date?
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:04:37
Thanks so much for your help with this.

I never made it open source. Only I can submit to Apple, so I'm pretty sure the App Store version is clean. I have never used these other sites before though, pretty lame they can upload something and claim it as theirs. contacting them now.

I also got 0f9dfd4f238ffea1f1aeaa4b92dd28bd as the hash.

ok, is this for the actual executable .app-&gt;contents-&gt;mac os-&gt;bitcoin ticker ttm?

then they find the secret compartment and see a toothbrush. now they are really like "wtf?"
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:52:32

Hey sorry for the late reply. It's been a while since I have checked my messages. I've been going back and forth with avast for the last few weeks and this issue has finally been sorted out. It should no longer show as a false-positive.

The Appstore version now registers as a false-positve from all the major anti-viruses now. The best way to check if you are clean is follow the steps that nptacek laid out.

Tell me about it, this is very unsettling. I have been very public with who I am and what I do. I just wanted to put out a simple bitcoin ticker, because the other ones on the App Store to me weren't that great (the free ones). I hate to think someone got scammed because of this.

Hey guys, I'm the developer for Bitcoin Ticker TTM. Please only download this from the Appstore. A redditor just alerted me about this post. I have no connection with download.com or macupdate.com and have never uploaded an app to them (not sure if they can do this with your consent or not). I never uploaded my app to a third party, it's only been available in the Appstore as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:27:05
Wow, I never thought my app would be hijacked for malware. I'm the developer for Bitcoin Ticker TTM. I can assure you the Appstore version is clean.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:28:20
This the developer. App Store version is clean. Never download this from anywhere other than the App Store.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:54:27
Thanks! I'll into adding it in the next update. Not too sure when that will be though.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:43:45
For your mac it only pops up in your status bar in the top right.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:15:25
glad it helped.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:07:58
haha nice, I didn't see this before. Then again, I probably wouldn't of had the motivation to make my own.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:26:43
Yea, I sent a fix the day it went over $1000. Just have to wait on Apple now. It only breaks for Mt. Gox. The other exchanges work great. I guess there could be worse reasons for a bug to happen :)

Awesome, this is my app that I released less than a week ago! Though, I think they put all the new apps in the beginning. It hasn't gotten that many downloads, so I doubt its based off that. Anyways, I already pushed my latest update. Next version will make the footprint smaller (had excess space to the left of the bitcoin image), ability to remove the decimal value, ability to remove the currency symbol, and add GBP currency support. Tips and/or reviews really help out: 1aoTcvYFrW1sTSQtPGuYCNMmGW7P5G93k
Here is a screenshot with the new smaller optional footprint 
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:52:45
Someone emailed about that as well. £ will be added in the next version which I estimate to be in a couple weeks based on how fast Apple is reviewing apps.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:05:11
I understand. I've been reading a lot of horror stories lately about people getting hacked, and I am too concerned.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:18:31
No worries, I just learned about bitcoin a couple months ago. I started with only one just to see how it all works, and by the time I received my first coin the price already went crazy..., wish I got more back then (I think almost everyone has had this feeling).
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:41:16
Yep, I mentioned that in a post here. If you have any other feature requests just let me know, and I'll do my best to implement it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:04:38
Just wanted to let you know I took your advice and my latest update for the Bitcoin Ticker is now live and offers a much lower footprint in the preferences :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:26:39
I agree with you, but I'm just a developer using my real account. Plus to be in the Apple store your app has to be sandboxed. The only entitlement my app has is to send an internet request to retrieve the bitcoin rate.
