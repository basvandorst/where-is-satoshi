50% is only the confirmed number, they could be mining on other pools as well without us knowing.

Hashfast is allegedly BFL on crack with TOS changes, delays with shipping and recent direct chip sales even even though they are months late with a majority of their customers.

John Oliver should make a 'Fuck That Guy' segment just on him. How can we get this guy off our backs because he is wasting his time. People will work around whatever bullshit regulations he intends to impose on us.

ghash.io is getting DDoS'ed, CloudFlare all over the place. 
And my BTCGuild miners are acting erraticaly.
Something fishy is going on.

When your labor force can't switch to any other industry that has a monopoly of the workforce (esp in WV), they become very anti-any other industry because happily employed people will vote towards anyone who represents their interests, even if its environmentally shabby. Look at the donors of all the people in Congress. They are elected based on their donors and the 'right' people to know. House of cards really shows this to some degree.

You're telling me, I've been waiting since September. I wouldn't give BFL another dollar if you ask me, and I think 99.9% of everyone here would agree.

What about this supposed helium shortage I've heard of?

Supposedly there is a way to flash the firmware to make the chips run faster. Needs another piece of hardware and has a high potential to fuck up if you don't know what you're doing apprently. Thread on bitcointalk:

As someone who recently got charged back, don't do it. How is it even profitable for Paypal to give the money to the scammers and not the actual legitimate people using Paypal, even with undeniable evidence??
@_date: 2013-09-11 16:24:26
Even at current prices, you're never seeing ROI ever given the 30% climb every 2016 blocks, and on top of that it will be completely obsolete by January 2014. How is that even remotely a 'value'?

Is there a quantifiable probability of this happening in general? And how did it mine a block without sharing any of the work if it was part of a pool?

Looks like Dwolla's tagline "The best way to move money." became a lot less true.

Ordered on 9/6. They are nowhere near as loud as the 3x 7950s that were on the rig next to these. And you almost can fry an egg, they get quite warm to the touch, I'm considering taking the cases off, but letting them settle in because it took 2 hours to get Windows to install the correct drivers. One is hashing at 8Gh/s, two around 7.5Gh/s, and one at 7.3Gh/s. All running at around 40C.

This worries me: "debuting a dramatically improved trading engine which will be launching very soon."
This speaks to me as some implementation to keep more track of the USD going in and out of the system for the gov't considering MtGox is now in the crosshairs.
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:45:12
I will once I can justify having them not hash away for an hour. Today was a *long* day just getting Easyminer via BFGMiner to get the right USB drivers to communicate correctly. I'm running a debloated (xDark) version of Win 7 64-bit on my main rig for now.
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:28:09
They did not and if they did I would ask for a MiniRig or two. :-D Or some good 'hash'.
I am still glad they managed to do what they did considering there is only two chips per box running &gt;3.5Gh/s on the board. This makes my Avalon chip purchases seem like amateur hour.
The variance +/-10% per unit was expected. All 4 Jallys average out to 7.5Gh/s per unit which is well above what I was expecting. I hope (but not really) they catch up with their backlog because they certainly have the best chips so far even with &lt;1% HW errors.
Anyone have hints on how to optimize these guys? To my understanding there were chips with varying "grades" which would explain the ~10% variance per board.
Also I paid in fiat-based Paypal because Bitcoin lacks the "fraud-protection" capabilities that would have made getting a refund easier, had I chosen to not keep waiting.
Yes, the bricks and the units are hotter than I would like them to be but so were the 7950s I had spewing out of my desktop. 
I don't know what happened to my last comment but I was looking forward to getting a BFL mug, but it seems when you get 2 Jallys at a time, they don't give you a mug. I'm crushed, I was looking forward to drinking whiskey from them. 'Tis life.
@_date: 2013-06-22 19:26:18
I actually got one on Monday, then another on Tuesday. So seems they didn't get around to mine when they made the tracking info the same day.

From the other thread this guy seems like an idiot waiting to get caught.

So this is where 90% of our "investment" went into...

Next round or two will be slightly higher due to KNCMiner's November shipments arriving and going online.

I'd rather Vice investigated BFL...might be a juicier story there.

The most absurd part of it all, is that they take the fee just to hold your money for up to 21 days and **THEN IT COULD BE TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME TO THE IRS.**

Overpriced, as usual, and soon to be obsolete technology. There are already 2TH/s miners supposedly to be released in the next 6-9 months.

9/6/**2012** As in Sept 6, 2012.
Sorry for the confusion. Hence the "2 weeks". I opted for the upgrade a month ago and glad that I did. Would I buy one today knowing what I learned in the past 9 months? Probably not, but hey, they *finally* delivered. And it seems when you order 2 at a time, they short you on the mug. Yeah, 4 Jallys and no BFL mug, I'm crushed. I was looking forward to drinking whiskey from it.

So how come no mention of HSBCs much larger money laundering scandal?

You almost can, but so could have my GPU rigs to a much easier degree. Looking at 40C as standard operating temp for these little guys with ~25-30C ambient temp in NYC is still nothing to scoff at. My electricity bill will certainly be different this month.
