His brother runs BTC-CHINA so he is probably not worried about that.

I'm curious too. Maybe sell  Facebook style advertisement or sell analytics.. I actually thought this was a  github type project to avoid corporate control.

Can they both be bad? I am not from the US and I see them both bad for your country.

I was going to say does this even exist anymore.

There was an image on the laptop near the end. It had a page that showed how to pay and something that appeared to request money and a statement. It had the price in USD and a link for payment methods. I actually was trying to look for bitcoin since that's the most obvious method to pay them. It didn't have that. I presume the next part will touch on paying.

I didn't even notice it. The ransom letter didn't have Bitcoin on it either. It had USD..

Mega and Mega Upload like it or not was a huge success in how people use data. I have no idea why people hate him so much. I can understand some of his early stuff was morally wrong but anything he touched recently was brilliant. Mega Upload legal or not he brought services people wanted and paved the way for legit services to see the potential for streaming. Mega pre takeover was and is still the best file sharing service out there too.
