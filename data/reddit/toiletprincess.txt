I subscribe to the idea of anarcho-communism as theorized by Kropotkin. Also, social democrats like Bernie Sanders are not Communists, they are very different ideologies. If you honestly want to look at the world, economy, and state from a perspective other than your own try reading The Value of Radical Theory, or The Conquest of Bread, or The Failure of Non Violence.

How the fuck would I know if you’re white or not, and why would that make a difference?

No your evaluation of Anti-Fa just leans heavily in the direction of the right and liberal persuasion. Also, of course a government official is going to disavow a group made up predominantly of anarchists and communists.

I have a feeling your understanding of what Anti-Fa is, is rather lacking.

Oh they certainly did. Have you taken the time to research, even in the slightest, the diversity of tactics, and the ideas that go along with the term Anti-Fa? It definitely dates back farther Berkeley.

You know, like Anti-Fa fighting ISIS in Syria or Anti-Fa groups fighting against literal nazis throughout Europe.

Assuming that you’re misinformed on the actual premise of Anti-Fa by right wing propaganda doesn’t make someone racist. Good try though. I appreciate the effort.

Top notch work buddy. You really showed me. You learn that on storm front?

Oooooooh okay, you’re one of those guys. I never said I equated myself with the state capitalism that Stalin and Mao subscribed to. I suggest you do more research then something most likely gleaned form a meme on r/libertarians. I can suggest some literature if you’re interested on a perspective other than your own.
Edit: The term Nazi definitely meant something during WW2 when the first Anti-Fa groups popped up.
