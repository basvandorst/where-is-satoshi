Hello. I was caught with their "Hit the iron while its hot" strategy. After signing up... not more than 5 minutes someone called. They were able to convince me that I can start trading with 250 USD. I deposited the account the another guy called me to assist on how to start. They tested the withdrawal function and tried to WITHDRAW 50 USD back to the credit card. IN FAIRNESS.. 50 USD went back to my credit card. So I left with 200 USD. With my curiosity, I clicked the Auto trading button and I immediately stopped it as 2 x 25 USD was traded in a matter of seconds and was immediately deducted to my account. I immediately halted the auto function as I am worried that 200 will go that fast. 150 left on my wallet Surprisingly after 2 days I checked it again and it went back to 197 USD and looking further to the details I saw that 2 x 25 was traded to bitcoin and dash and Stop loss was activated and instead if losing 2 x 25 USD I just lost 2 x 1.5 USD. I am happy to see that development. It looks decent but I do not know if 200 USD can be able to recover before drains out. Ashford tried to reach me from my  home country to assist me on the trading... But the agent told me that I cannot start trading with 250 (contrary to what the lady told me the first time they called) and I need to join the Entry group of 2500 USD and they will use 10% of the money and that is 250. Unfortunately I am not ready to deposit additional 2250 USD to Ashford and I set an open ended discussion and told them that I need to see my 200 USD earn some $$ before I do another investment with them. When Im ready to lose the remaining money on my wallet I will update you.
