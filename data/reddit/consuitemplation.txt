I sell ass on Backpage and use the BTC for narcotics. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:23:22
Simple math shows that bitcoin can't scale.

I'm sure I can open a bank account from scratch and send a wire transfer before you're even done epoxying your ethernet port.

That's some pretty awesome and professional software where you have to post your financial information to reddit.
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:32:28
Yeah, it's like how if you want help troubleshooting Excel you need to upload your spreadsheet. Oh wait.

Don't assume that people want to share the details of their transactions with 170k of their closest friends just because they have a technical problem.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:34:26
Just like my bus.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:21:35
I'm sure once they actually use Bitcoin and its horrible user experience they won't stick around for long.

This sub isn't a tech support forum, it's a discussion forum. People shouldn't have to publish their transactions in order to participate.

Right Bitcoin only scales if you add some nonexistent layers of non-Bitcoin on top of it. That's the same thing as not scaling.

Your full-node trusts the blocks sent by the miners. Whatever "validations" your node does to those blocks don't matter to the wider network.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:34:45
Sorry that you have to learn about it like this. I feel like I just told a kid that Santa doesn't exist. :(
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:01:22
I think your username speaks for itself as well...
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:01:51
Yeah? And what happens when the block fails validation by your node?
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:12:16
Regardless of what running a full node used to be, as of 2016 it's a pointless endeavor, which is why so few people bother to do it. The only blockchain that matters is what the miners agree upon. Everything else is just noise.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:27:25
I'm not talking about a breakaway miner. I'm talking about all of the miners moving to a version. The exchanges will always follow the miners, and anyone who doesn't won't be getting their transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:56:29
Cool story, Hansel. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:16:51


And? Full nodes don't back anything. The network does not need even one non-mining node. In fact, the whitepaper doesn't even mention non-mining "full nodes" because even Satoshi thought that it was stupid.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:50:39
Is it not possible to enjoy the theory of crypto without being delusional about how it works in real life?
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:30:11
Not as stupid as the people spending actual money (i.e. dollars) to run their idiot full nodes.
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:42:50
"Released" is the same thing as "going live" you silly twit. Like when Rihanna releases an album, it doesn't mean she "released" it to the mixing guy so that people can hear it in 3 months.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:38:24
Sure. The nodes are the Peanut Gallery. They can whisper and gossip amongst themselves and disapprove of the entire process, but there's nothing they can do to impact the network.
So your node finds "funny-business". What are you going to do? Post on Reddit? Unplug the damn thing? There's no recourse.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:49:25


No they don't. The network does not need them. Like you said, the design by Satoshi did not include them. They "validate" blocks, but what happens when a block fails a node's validation? Nothing. Because those nodes are not solving blocks their only use is to provide a copy of the blockchain to a client that requests it. And if their copy doesn't match the miners' copy, who do you think the network is going to side with?
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:26:01
Then it's too bad you're stuck with that one. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:06:08
If all of the miners are on the same chain, then whatever the rest of the network decides does not matter. Did you not read the article? This isn't about a rogue miner.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:09:25
Exactly. It gets rejected by your node AND NOBODY ELSE CARES.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:24:03
Sorry bro. You're deluding yourself if you think that your validations do anything to "secure" the network. The only service that you're providing is just another backup copy of the blockchain. Which really is unneeded since the only copy of the blockchain that matters is what the miners agree on between themselves.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:20:57
Yeah. 21 Inc. What % of the hashpower do they have right now? Even 1%?
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:39:51


You have that completely backwards. If the nodes rejects the miners' blocks, then the nodes are out of luck. And the nodes will quickly move to the miners' chain, or become irrelevant. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:29:48
It's decentralized into the hands of 5 Chinese miners.
