Some people are out of touch with reality.  They have no idea how average, middle class people live their lives.

Poetic.  I like it.

Great response - I can actually respect it when people back their investments because they actually believe in the cause.  I've been in several IRL arguments in the past couple weeks with people at work who have hopped on the BTC train without really even knowing why other than seeing the chart and having dollar signs in their eyes.


That is a pretty huge factor.  If lightning network is successful it would be a very cool technology to see in real use.  It seems to have a "startup" problem where forming the network will be difficult, but perhaps exchanges will facilitate that process.  It is going to be interesting to see!  If it could work as well as Venmo for example, where my group of friends and I all have a floating balance that we "pass around" frequently, I can see it working great.  I haven't cashed out or put money into my Venmo in months, it just seems to get traded.  If LN does ever get to that point, it will be unstoppable.  Getting to that point seems to be the hard part.

Just because something has tech and is "fascinating" doesn't mean it provides actual value.  Perhaps the price has come down because the true worth of bitcoin is being re-established.

I'm quite confused by this mentality in general - I know it's optimistic to think the price will rise again, but do you actually believe in the future of bitcoin?  I know you think the price will rise, but is this because you think bitcoin is a utility that will gain value, or perhaps because of your personal investment.  Do you think lightning network and the technology behind it will be able to make bitcoin usable again?  I personally do not, and believe there will be a long drawn price correction as other cryptocurrencies make themselves more useful than bitcoin as time goes on.
