Thank for for sneaking a post that shows the problem of Bitcoin right now. We need upgrade 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:41:40
Idek tbh, it’s an update thing that everybody wants but has been 'suspended' because a small group didn't want it. To my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:22:32
The current situation is screaming for it.

@_date: 2017-11-14 21:40:20
There is many good and patient people affected by this.
So you're telling me there will be a fourth time, and a fifth time in the best case scenario, which is that this will be solved ¿soon?

@_date: 2018-03-28 08:31:08
It is actually, it means a lot of things.
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:19:55
Well... when they accept Bitcoin LN in your nearest supermarket, then that is a very strong signal of widespread adoption :D
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:22:24
Widespread adoption is driven by usage and ease of use.
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:35:05
Not really. Would you say that there is only 11k users of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:10:15
