Thanks.  How very sad they had to create another subreddit just because of all these virgins.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:30:57
That asshat just started randomly parroting everything I said like a goddamn toddler.  So hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:55:46
The unoriginal shit was PM'g me telling me what an idiot I am but apparently I'm clever enough for him to steal the "bitchlips" insult I threw at him first.  Haha.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:54:02
The fuck?  Your reading comprehension sucks.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:57:20
No.  That was lame.  You're throwing out more playground shit.  Try again.  Come on, you can do better than that.
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:23:33
Okay then.  Let's take a look at the unparallelled eloquence of &gt; You're 2 smart 4 me, teach me how 2 bitcoin invest for money how to libertarian?


You don't fool anybody, child.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:48:20
No, that won't do.  That was shit.  You'll need to step up your game, troll.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:32:57
It's sad as hell, the most pathetic shit I've ever seen in my life.  Pretty hilarious, though.  It's like in here.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:15:01
Even more retarded are the virgins like you who do nothing but post in Bitcoin threads thinking your pussy replies are actually making a dent.  That shit is sad.  Do you even know what sexual intercourse is?  LOL
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:17:42
Holy fuck, you are one pathetic sack of shit.  An *entire account* of nothing but whining about Bitcoin.  What the fuck is wrong with you?
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:11:06
Will you still be whining like a baby about Bitcoin? LOL
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:06:06
You don't notice much.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:03:59
I'm amazed and fascinated by it.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:57:39
It sure is!  What an appropriate username for you :)
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:59:10
You asshats know there's other shit on reddit besides Bitcoin, right? LOL
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:51:10
I hope nobody's paying you for this shit because they are just throwing money away.  I dare you to post somewhere other than a bitcoin-related thread.  Can you? LOL
Edit:  Holy shit, [the stupid goofy fuck did it!](  Although he did only half-ass it with a generic link, but I'm proud of the little guy.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:58:54
The fuck you talking about karma for, idiot?  I didn't say shit about karma.  Damn, you have a one-track mind.  Did you have a stroke or something?  Holy shit, it's sad but hilarious.  And where's that post?  Let's see it :)
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:46:11
Damn straight.  I think it's incredibly fucked-up to have seen the effects first-hand after only leaving *two* comments in which were the first two I *ever* posted here.  Shit is insane.  I do love how they instantly jumped to the ridiculous conclusion I'm a frequent visitor and assumed I had an account full of whiny bitcoin posts like they all do.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:38:57
Really?  Haha.  If you're just going to parrot me at least be correct so you don't look like a dumbass.  That comment and this one are the only two comments I've ever posted in moron :)
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:00:58
I love how all these little shit trolls just assume everyone who posts here is an avid Bitcoin user.  I couldn't fucking care less.  I have like 35 cents in an account.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:12:23
Yeah, that's you.  How many of you goofy anti-Bitcoin virgins are there?
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:14:03
Posting that once wasn't enough?  You fuckers are some rookie trolls.  Step up your game, bitch.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:21:33
Except all your downvotes, bitchlips LOL  Nice job firing off a comeback 18 hours after the fact.  What a swift response that was.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:46:31
I'm amazed at how many of these pathetic bastards there are.  They already started lodging shit in my general direction after posting one comment.  I've never even posted in before but these retards assume I'm a die-hard subscriber or something and it's fucking funny as shit.  Hell, the two replies I got back post NOWHERE else on reddit but or (whatever the fuck that is).  That is some sad shit.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:42:59
Now the kid is PM'g me talking like this:


Yep.  Too dumb to discuss Bitcoin with, or anything at all for that matter.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:00:15
Cool.  Didn't know this existed.  Hi!
