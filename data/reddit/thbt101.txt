It's a good warning about the dangers of margin trading, but hey OP, what's with all the "whales" blaming in the title of this post?   
"Whales" didn't make him place a bunch of risky margin bets on something as volatile as bitcoin.  He's not a victim of whales or anyone else.  Most of the volatility has to do with all the small inexperienced traders who panic sell every time there's bad news. 
I get tired of r/Bitcoin users always coming up with conspiracy theories that blame rich people, banks, etc. for everything that goes wrong in their lives.

SegWit2x would have helped, but that's probably a lost cause at this point unfortunately.  
So now the Lightning Network is what we need to fix the situation.  Apparently progress is being made, some hopefully we'll see it working at full scale sometime this year.
Even with the Lightning Network, a block size increase will still be needed eventually.  It would have been ideal if that had happened already, but hopefully it will happen eventually (the sooner the better).

Of the things I'm unsure of about LN, having low fees is not a concern.  Looking at Poloniex's BTC lending rates, people are willing to lock up their BTC for *days* at a time on a risky third party exchange with risk of defaults just to earn the equivalent of a 4% yearly return.  
So if I can put some BTC on a node and earn some BTC for locking it up in transactions that takes miliseconds each and are zero risk, hell yeah!  It only takes fractions of a penny per transaction for that to add up to a serious return on your money over a period of time.

This is pretty typical stuff for bitcoin.  It's happened many times in the past.  Most of the time the price will shoot back up in days.  Or it might take months.  You only lose money if you sell when it's down.
This isn't the end of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, all the fundamentals still look good.  The markets are easily spooked, but there isn't even any risk of problematic regulation in most countries in the world (including the US). 
So for now there's no reason to panic.  Take a break from coins.  Go outside.  Read a book.  Watch some TV.   You still have the same number of bitcoins you did yesterday, and the price will return if you're patient.

If you look at Poloniex's BTC lending service, you'll see how many people are interested in finding some way to make their BTC holding generate a bit of extra BTC (as low as 5% interest over a *year*, and that's with the risk of holding coins in a third party exchange!).  
With LN, there's no risk of trusting anything to a 3rd party, so a lot of us will happily put our BTC into the system even if the earnings are just pennies per transaction, because that can add up to real money. And I'm just guessing, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of the hardcore enthusiasts will run nodes with no fees just to prove to the doubters how great LN and bitcoin is.

If you got rich off bitcoin, you'll sleep better if you keep it legit and pay the taxes you owe when you sell or spend it.  Some of us are at least kind of happy to do it because we know that we benefit from the services provided by our government.

Does that mean in real life they could fall-back to doing an on-chain transaction in that case?

I guess that's a valid point perhaps?
I'm not actually sure what's involved in sending segwit transactions.  I've sent bitcoin between an Electrum wallet, Coinbase, Kraken, Gyft, and Blockchain.info.  I don't even know if any of those could have been segwit transactions, or if there is something I'm supposed to do to try to make more of my transactions be segwit.  I think the companies aren't motivated to use it because they aren't paying the transactions fees in most cases. And most users don't know they're supposed to be doing anything differently.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:46:32
I'm not an expert, but my understanding is you can at least try to see in advance whether it appears to be practical to make the transaction using LN: 
"The code searches for an inexpensive route and, if one is found, a payment is attempted. " - 
(I'm not sure if that was referring to how LN works, or just their simulation's code.)

About your first point, I don't know, I would guess that people would be even less likely to support it if it did anything else at the same time just because it would probably be even more controversial.  But I'm just guessing.


Ok, this argument really irks me (but I know it's probably a big reason some people here opposed 2x).  We shouldn't care who did what, all that matters is whether it's good for bitcoin or not.  It doesn't matter who came up with the idea, it's either a good idea or it's not.  2x does exactly one thing, it increases the block size by 2x.  Supporting that one technical change.  Period.  
Saying "it would really have been the end of bitcoin if they had succeeded" because someone you don't like also happens to support the idea is a horrible, petty reason to oppose it.  But I'm really afraid that that's exactly why some people opposed it.  And that's just sad, and that kind of mentality is what makes me worried about the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:24
Yes, but the block size increase shouldn't be temporary since even with Lightning Network, it's likely we'll still need somewhat larger blocks.  (And if it turns out we don't, no problem, the block size is a *maximum*, so blocks can always be smaller if there are fewer on-chain transactions!)
I'm hoping this time we will put the politics aside and support the new 2x blocksize proposal that's coming up in a month or so because it's the best thing for bitcoin at this point.  I think with what we've experienced lately, that might actually happen this time.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:04
Ok, I appreciate your reasoning on that. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:39:09

Did you not support it because you objectively and genuinely thought it was a bad technological solution?  Or in reality, was it because you have a grudge against the people who happened to also support it and that influenced your judgement?

That's a good attitude.  Everyone could have made more money if they had bought or sold at more or less at just the right time in retrospect, there's no use in dwelling on it.
If people freak out and the price drops back down to $5k, you'll look relatively smart for having sold some at $11k.  But even if it doesn't, it doesn't mean you made the wrong choice, it's a gamble either way.

What made it fail?  I thought increasing the block size was a pretty simple change (I mean, Bitcoin Cash was able to do it). 
I always feel like the arguments here against it aren't very convincing, just as I also feel like the big blockers arguments against SegWit aren't very convincing either.  It just seemed like SegWit with an immediate 2x increase in the block size would have been the best of both worlds, but it mostly failed because of political rather than technical reasons.

Bitcoin will most likely supplement the existing system, not replace it.  There are advantages to having some oversight of the economy.  The Fed has been massively important in finally [almost] solving solving the inflation/deflation cycles issue that has always plagued economies by using interest rates to increase or decrease the money supply to help stabilize the economy (limit overexuberence in good times to prevent inflation, and stimulate the economy in bad times). 
The existing system actually works fairly well, except for perhaps manipulation by Wall Street traders... but unfortunately bitcoin isn't even more susceptible to that problem than most other currencies.

Yeah, I would also prefer to see off-chain scaling, but I've heard an argument that we'll still need somewhat bigger blocks even with things like Lightning Network.  
And it just seems to me that it sure would be great if we went ahead and at least did 2x now so that it would ease some of the current backlog and transaction prices so I wouldn't have to hear so many people bitching about how bitcoin can't really be used as a currency because the transaction fees are currently too high.

I wouldn't assume that all of us like bitcoin because we want to "kill the banks".  Banks aren't entirely a bad thing to have (minus the corruption and greed of some), and bitcoin isn't going to kill them anyway.  There are a lot of other reasons people are interested in bitcoin.

Ok sure, but Tether is a way to hold funds in USD in trading accounts, so more gets created when there is more demand for it, such as when some of us sell some of our BTC when the price goes up and our limit sell orders get filled.   I don't know why no one talks about that possibly legitimate explanation when they talk about the Tether conspiracy theories.   Maybe it's all a big conspiracy to make the prices higher on Binance or whatever, but that never really seemed like a likely scenario to me, especially the idea that they would still be doing it now that there is so much scrutiny.  The legit use explanation just makes more sense.

Gifts aren't taxable as income.  However, if your gift later generates income (such as if the bitcoins go up in value), that generated income is taxable.
But the gift giver can owe tax if the amount of the gift is more than the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 as of 2014).  Why would the gift giver have to pay tax on large gifts?  So that people won't use "gifts" as a tricky way to get around paying the inheritance (estate) tax.

I'm not sure if I follow.  If you use this buyback feature, you end up with the same number of bitcoins you started with, except you've had the dollar amount withdrawn from your bank account.  So it's not really doing anything except basically letting you pay from your bank account (and charging you a 1% fee plus $0.15 that you wouldn't have had to pay if you just paid with a credit card online). 
The only way it really does anything with actual bitcoins is if the merchant has chosen to get paid in bitcoins rather than cash, which is only sometimes the case.

And for most of us, we're not worried about the "US government" getting our passwords anyway, we're worried about hackers and criminals.  
Yes, KeePass does have the advantage of not storing your passwords on a remote server.  That makes it potentially more secure, but also less convenient.

So what are they going to do with this growing stash of bitcoin?  Pay employees partly in bitcoin?  Eventually buy products or companies using bitcoins?
Edit: Why did someone downvote this??

This is my understand of it... If you want to deduct the cost of your mining hardware, you would need to file your mining operation as a business (which is pretty much what it is).  So you would file a Schedule C and that would let you subtract the cost of your mining hardware as a business expense from your business income (the value of the bitcoins).  
It does get a little tricky because mining hardware is something that should be depreciated over a number of years... basically what that means is you can't take the full deduction in one year because computer hardware is expected to last for a number of years.  It's complicated, but tax software like TurboTax will compute it for you.

Well, my understanding of that the documents implied that the DEA, FBI, or CIA may have used the IRS to pursue criminals on tax evasion if there wasn't enough evidence to actually charge them with drug dealing or racketeering or whatever.  So the CIA might tip off the IRS that they should investigate someone.  
But that's shady under the table stuff.  That's still very different than the IRS seeking a court order to monitor a financial service to find tax cheats, as the hackers claim.

All "mod" is is the remainder when you divide one number into the other one.  12 mod 3 is 0 (because 3 divides evenly into 12, so there is no remainder).  13 mod 3 is 1 (because 13 divided by three gives you 4, with a remainder of 1, so that remainder of 1 is the answer).

A blanket statement of "just not keep coins with a 3rd party" can't be applied to all situations.  A better statement might be "be aware of the risks of keeping coins with a 3rd party".
Bitcoins need to eventually reach a point where they're as convenient to use as buying things with a credit card without having to install special software, and for a lot of people that's going to mean storing them online with at least some amount of trust in a 3rd party.  But people with a lot of money in bitcoins should be at least aware of the risk.

They can't give you your password because they don't know what it is.  They don't store your password.

It's true that bitcoin attracts the crazies who think the Fed, banks, and fiat are big conspiracies.  But those people do seem to be in the minority here (even if they are vocal as always).
But I think it's important that we don't let bitcoin get labeled and cornered as something that's only used by nutcases.  That's just as bad as bitcoin being labeled as nothing but currency for drug dealers.  Those kinds of labels on something that people don't entirely understand can be extremely damaging and it can create a reputation that's difficult to escape.
I think there are enough respected high-profile people in the world who have endorsed bitcoin that it has a certain amount of legitimacy (Richard Branson, respected economists, senators, etc.).

You don't have to pay tax on it for owning it, you only pay tax when its value is "realized" (when you sell it or buy something with it).
If you sell a lot of coins and there is a large deposit in your bank account, or you buy a car with bitcoins, and you're audited, then you may have some explaining to do.  For small purchases and selling small quantities of coins, the IRS isn't likely to care, and in some cases if the values are small you may not be required to report it at all.

*That awful website has so many flashing, flickering, pop-up ads that it's impossible to read anything on there.  I usually would never do this, but here is the text so you can read it...*
Bitcoin has been deemed property, not currency, by the IRS. This will be important to the government in terms of taxes as it changes hands, but the real change will be how it changes hands. Several investors, including BitAngels and Andreessen Horowitz, are backing entrepreneurs who see many development opportunities for Bitcoin to reach beyond its function as money to find new uses for it. Instead of relying on banks, who make money just for holding the keys to others’ money, these new functions can be handled by Bitcoin. Several start-ups in particular are looking to use the verification capabilities of the company.
BitAngels is a collection of investors who fund start-ups related to Bitcoin. David Johnston, co-founder, has said that they are looking into over 30 different projects. These investment opportunities follow the theme that what was once considered a digital currency is, in Johnston’s words, not “a payment system, [instead] it’s the Internet of Money.”
This week, the central bank of China has closed the trading accounts of over 10 Bitcoin exchanges, which caused Bitcoin’s value to drop by approximately 10 percent. However, last year investors held a rally that bumped the value from $12 up to $1,200.  The value has leveled out now and in the past month has ranged from $500 to $620. With groups like BitAngels, the value of the currency should be more stable and new uses for it may be discovered. The block chain, which is the public record of all transactions using Bitcoin is key to these forward movements as far as how these commodities can be used, and it is what makes this system so unique. The public database not only keeps track of every transaction, it can be used for identification and verification. Marc Andreessen, multimillionaire investor and a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, thinks that the ledger and the functions of Bitcoin is what will help it move forward and access other industries. His company is looking to fund these start-ups as well.
As Bitcoin develops new uses beyond the limited capabilities of money, virtual currency entrepreneurs have begun gathering at conventions. One of these is CoinSummit, where Andreessen explained plans to draw other industries in with the “core innovation” of the block chain. “We want a whole sequence of companies: digital title, digital media assets, digital stocks and bonds, digital crowd funding, digital insurance. If you have online trust like the block chain provides, you can reinvent field after field after field.”
BitShares X, one of the first Internet of money services to pave new ground with Bitcoin, is a decentralized bank plus exchange. Users will be able to save, trade, borrow, and lend with no middle man. Computers handle all transactions and because verification is public, there will be no concern of theft and fraud. Dan Larimer, CEO of the developing company Invictus, said that unlike Mt. Gox, “no one can steal the balance from your account.” This is ensured through the exchange not defaulting on their transactions, making it a much safer investment. Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said that how Bitcoin assists the system is “very brilliantly designed.” It is moving towards eliminating fees such as the costs of accounting, banking services, and verification steps.
Banking systems are not all that Bitcoin can revolutionize. Actual property could be given verified digital tokens and those would be simultaneously exchanged along with the payment. The purchase of particularly costly items, such as cars or houses, can also be changed. Dealerships and real estate brokers are currently the middle men who, for a commission, run those transactions in order to minimize the risk between buyer and seller. Michael Terpin, co-founder at BitAngels, projects that the block chain can take over “at least 10 percent” of transactions done online.
The Bitcoin Tangible Trust is another project that is moving modern technology forward. It allows buying and trading gold using Bitcoin technology for verifying transactions. RippleSingapore is a similar service for not only gold, but also silver and platinum. Invictus is expanding this technology and using it for buying shares in soundtracks, but this could also be used for other digital media. In addition to defending against piracy, Larimer explained that, “It’s a way for fans to buy into a song when it’s new, and if it becomes popular, you can make money.”
Johnston from BitAngels said that the groups funding the technology will be mostly related to Internet of Money this year and have invested over 60 percent of their funds in Mastercoin.“Right now, Bitcoin is in the lead,” said Brock Pierce, an investor of Mastercoin, “And usually, the technology that gets the most adopters wins.” It is an accurate point, and likely this will determine how well all of the new developments that use these technologies do in the future to help expand Bitcoin beyond just being money.

It really does make a difference.  My local (non-chain) restaurant is now thinking about taking bitcoin, it's definitely worth asking when you buy something on craigslist, your landlord if your renting, really any place that isn't a big retail chain (even some of those can in some cases if the owner chooses to).  It's also definitely worth asking when you're going to buy something from a website (especially smaller retailers).  
For a lot of these places, if they get a few people asking, they're going to definitely start researching it and possibly start using it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:01:23
No.  
They would have to prove that you were aware that you are knowingly facilitating laundering money used for a crime.  These idiots were on Silk Road knowingly selling bitcoins to Silk Road users.  That's why one of them buying drugs on the site is relevant, it proves they knew what Silk Road was for.  
They aren't being charged because of the BitInstant's legitimate exchange activities, but for other activities involving Silk Road.

No... if you're running a legitimate exchange and following the basic reporting rules, you're fine.  
These guys were selling bitcoins on Silk Road to Silk Road users, and one of them even bought drugs on the site.  That's a completely different thing.  They aren't really being charged for BitInstant, but rather for their "side gig" of selling bitcoins to druggies on Silk Road at a marked-up price.

The first time bitcoin was still young and it was for many people the first time they heard of it, which brought it more people/money.
This time around most people have heard of bitcoin, and again associating it with another drug market isn't such a good thing.  It took forever to shake the public perception that bitcoin is just for criminals. 
This doesn't help convince people that it's a legitimate currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:12:40
There were no criminal charges because the government was unable to prove that the bank knew how the money had been used.  They were only able to prove that HSBC failed to file the proper paperwork.
The government prosecutors would have loved to have pressed criminal charges (that would have been a major case for them), but there just wasn't enough evidence since the bar for proving guilt in the US "beyond a reasonable doubt" is difficult to reach and they didn't have enough evidence to win that case.
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:32:40
Some of it does protect consumers and regulation of banks actually does a lot to keep them honest and at least reduces outright fraud.  But of course a lot of it also has to do with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism protection.  
If you really want to hide your bitcoin activities, you can avoid these regulated services if you prefer.  Bitcoin lets you do that.  
But having "licensed" and regulated bitcoin companies will do a lot to help to legitimize bitcoin as something that's ok for everyone to use and isn't just for drug dealers and anti-government activists.  
There are still people who say bitcoin is only good for hiding illegal activities, but this kind of legitimacy will do a lot to help change that perception.

But that's just his whole point.  Those people shouldn't be panicking because Bitcoin's future potential is huge compared to the current temporary downturn due to China.    
If you really understand what he's saying, people who bought at $1200 don't have "every reason to be panicking".  They have every reason to not panic and be patient.  The only people who are going to lose money are the ones who panic and sell at a loss (as did many people when it dropped from $200 to $100 a while back, or $20 to $5 a couple years before that).

&lt;sigh&gt;  This article sounds like something written by a Reddit user.  The government prosecutors would have *loved* to bring criminal charges against individuals at HSBC.  That's what they do, they live for that kind of opportunity.  
The problem is when you're talking about a criminal case in the US, we have a higher burden of proof ("innocent until *proven* guilty").  They would have to prove that some individual knew without a doubt that the money was being used for a criminal activity.  They simply didn't have the evidence to prove that against HSBC, so the best they could do is give them a massive fine for not filing the proper paperwork.  
The Charlie Shrem / Robert Faiella case was very different.  The guy left a trail of evidence that they not only knew they were working with drug dealers (the one guy even bought drugs using Silk Road), but they actively pursued them and charged them an extra fee to knowingly launder their money in a way that would make it harder to track than with a legitimate Bitcoin exchange. 
It wasn't BitInstant's legitimate exchange that got them in trouble, it was that they were doing deals on the side directly with Silk Road users, and basically telling them they would keep law enforcement from being able to find them by laundering their drug money for them.

It's not the mainstream people he's referring to, it's the fringe crazies that are also attracted to it.  They may not be a majority, but they're vocal, and it's damaging to bitcoins reputation when bitcoin is associated with them.
But I think it's important that we don't let bitcoin get labeled and cornered as something that's only used by nutcases. That's just as bad as bitcoin being labeled as nothing but currency for drug dealers. Those kinds of labels on something that people don't entirely understand can be extremely damaging and it can create a reputation that's difficult to escape.
I think there are enough respected high-profile people in the world who have endorsed bitcoin that it has a certain amount of legitimacy (Andreesen, Richard Branson, respected economists, senators, etc.). But we should be aware that associating it with conspiracy theories, anarchy, and craziness is very damaging.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:33:50
First, you only have to worry about calculating the dollar value of a bitcoin if you exchange bitcoins for something other than money (either goods, services, or other virtual currencies).  
If you do exchange bitcoins for something other than money, If you can provide a defense in an audit that method you used to calculate the value was reasonable and you weren't trying to game the system, you should be fine (so don't try using the current Mt Gox value).   If you're buying something from somewhere that also displays the value in USD, that would be a safe value to use.  Otherwise, they generally also prefer that you're consistent in the method you use for calculating value (so stick to the value on one exchange, unless you can provide an explanation for why you used values from different exchanges at different times).

Most of us are just regular people who want to use and encourage bitcoin because of the technological and practical advantages it has for storing and exchanging value.  
Most of us don't expect or want it to bring about a new world order or whatever it is you're talking about.

Yes, but the most important thing is that they pursued Silk Road uses specifically and it can be proven that they knew Silk Road was a drug market because one of them bought drugs there himself.  
If they were merely not verifying their customers or not filing the proper paperwork, they would just get fined (like HSBC).  But these guys were knowingly working with criminals to help them launder money.

Yeah, I figured someone would mention that.  Yes, but despite that, people will still use goods and services as a way to avoid reporting their gains even if they are supposed to report it.
But also, how bitcoin will be classified for tax purposes is still undetermined.  But if it is eventually classified like a foreign currency, from what I understood of dblcross121's tax info, in that case gains that are under $200 and not for business purposes wouldn't be taxed.  Which would mean it could be used for small purchases without reporting gains.

As others have said, there's no proof of any of that.  As soon as they said IRS, that's when it was clear it was just bullshit.  The FBI or FinCEN may request access to that kind of information from a financial service if there is evidence of a crime and an actual investigation with a court order.
But the IRS doesn't operate that way.  Not even close.  Their authority and investigative procedures are limited.  If they suspect an individual is delinquent on their taxes, they first request documentation from the individual and perform an audit.  They can seek a court order to force the individual to turn over documents, and failure to comply can lead to fines or jail time.  But they aren't involved in monitoring financial services.  If they did they would be able to do a much better job at catching tax cheats than they do now (which is very hit or miss).

This is a weird attempt to white-wash black markets as "free markets".  Then they make it sound like governments don't like free markets just because they're free (they hate us for our freedom!!).  That claim doesn't make sense when conservatives use it about terrorism, and it doesn't make sense for Silk Road either.
Silk Road wasn't a "free market" that just happened to also have some illegal things for sale, it was almost entirely a drug market (along with some categories for selling stolen goods and a few other things).  It existed because it sold illegal items, that was its purpose.  That's why it was shut down.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:31:27
Thanks for the thorough answer.  Looking at  because of Silk Road, there is still a persistent myth that bitcoin is mostly used for illicit activities and it's been a difficult job to shake that bad reputation among the public.  Bitcoin's connection to Silk Road is still often quoted whenever a politician or journalist wants to discredit bitcoin as something that is only used by criminals.
Heavily focusing on the portion of bitcoin users who have anti-establishment views and portraying that as the primary purpose of bitcoin is damaging to any chance it has at acceptance from a mainstream public that views anti-establishment activists mostly negatively.  
And even if you think bitcoin is going to somehow subvert governments... *hush*.  Right now much of the US federal government and several others view bitcoin is a great thing... and that's crucial at this stage since governments can still do a lot to make using bitcoin more difficult (e.j. China).  
It's also not factual.  The libertarians are just one of many subgroups of bitcoin users.  A large portion of bitcoin users are capitalistic investors.  Many are entrepreneurs wanting to build businesses using it.  Another large portion of us love it for it's technological genius and practical use to move money quickly.  The libertarians are just one subgroup of many.  The only thing we share is a love of the potential of bitcoin.

It's used by social revolutionaries, Wall Street bankers, and everyone in between.

There can still be closed source, paid software without software patents.  Software is still copyrightable.  
The problem with software patents is the daily process of writing software is inherently inventive and most programs do at least a few things that could seem novel enough that someone could describe it in fancy language and get a patent for it.  So some companies have started doing that, paying thousands and millions of dollars to have patent lawyers look at their software and writing hundreds of trivial patents for everything it does.  Bad companies (and patent trolls) can use those patents to attack any company they want either to squash competitors or to make money.  It doesn't matter if the patents are nonsense or not, it costs too much money for most companies to fight them in court.
Most software not only has patentable ideas, but most software also technically violates probably dozens of trivial patents owned by someone else.  It's a mess.  You just have to hope the companies that own the patents on the kind of software you want to write don't decide to sue you (and usually they don't).  Big companies have agreements not to sue each other, but small companies are always at risk.
Compare that to a world without software patents where ideas and new techniques can be opening shared and reused.   Companies who write software still make money thanks to copyright.  But companies can also write and use software without constant fear of being sued by some patent trolls who make billions but produce nothing, or competitors who can't compete on quality so instead sue their competitors as a way to make money.

Ok, you guys are both right, but "blockchain database" is still not great terminology to use.  Yes, it could technically be called a database in the broadest sense because it stores data.  But most programmers wouldn't choose to call it that because "database" usually implies traits like an index and some system of randomly accessing the data.  You could import the blockchain into a database.  But the blockchain itself would be bettered described as an ordered list.

Not likely.  Yes, things like Silk Road gave bitcoin a bad name because there was so much press about it that people started to think of bitcoin as mostly being used by criminals.  But I don't think Kipi would be big enough of a thing for people to think of bitcoin as something just used by pyramid schemes.  Not that either makes bitcoin look especially good.

I just don't see why the top post day after day needs to be something bad that some government did.  We get it already.  That's great if that's why you use bitcoin, but it has nothing to do with why I like it, or why other people may be using it.

That's not really a fair basis to judge him.  There was a long period of time when Mt Gox was beloved by nearly the entire bitcoin community before the cracks started to show.  And Purse.io itself isn't a scam, it's a neat idea that is unfortunately somewhat volnerable to some abuse by scammers (the same could be said for eBay).

If you read through the evidence against him, it's really hard to come up with a scenario where there is some other explanation for all of the evidence other than him being DRP.  He did a terrible job of concealing his identity in the first few months of Silk Road (including using his own email address in posts related to SR before it launched).  
I do believe in always waiting for the trial and to hear both sides... but it would be an extraordinary thing if his defence manages to come up with an explanation for all the evidence that seems to be against him.

This is a silly argument about semantics that misses the point.  The benefit of rebuilding the server in a new hardware environment isn't because new hardware is better because they recently bought it in a store.  The benefit is in installing the software onto a clean install in a clean environment to eliminate most of the risk of trojans installed by the hackers remaining on the server.  That's what they mean by installing it on new hardware.

A lot of us would buy it at $50, but not at $100+, but you can use that fact to your advantage.
You're sitting on a marketing gold mine and you aren't even taking advantage of it.  If you announce a special "Reddit-only" 2-day sale of Trezors at $50, you'll get up-voted to the front page and probably end up with many hundreds of orders (at least).  If you don't have the inventory to sell us that many, that's ok too, just tell use *in advance* that there may be a delay before you can ship these special price orders.
These are nearly all orders from people who didn't want it at $100+, so it's profit that you wouldn't have made at all otherwise.  And after two days, the sale is over and you can continue selling them at the higher price to people who are willing to pay that price for it.

Is there any actual reason to think the Fed would have a problem with bitcoin?  The Fed adjusts interest rates to keep inflation under control and to stimulate the economy in recessions.  But unless bitcoin completely replaces fiat (unlikely), I don't see why they would feel like bitcoin would be harmful to the economy or their ability to control inflation or stimulate growth.  
I know the conspiracy theorists who learned everything they know about the Fed from YouTube videos think the Fed is part of a big conspiracy, but I doubt the real life Fed is terribly concerned about bitcoin.

I've been away from the Bitcoin for a while and I'm still trying to figure out what this all means.  Apparently there are too many transactions for the current block size.  So why is there resistance to increasing it?  
I've seen people say that it would make it impossible for people with a regular PC to run a bitcoin node and only big corporations would be able to run a node.  Is that really true?

I think you should calculate it as 10% of your future bitcoin profit based the assumption that it will hit $100k.  So if bitcoin is at $10k now, but in a year it'll be at $100k, you're ok to invest 10% of that profit, which is... whatever amount you invest.  So that justifies investing your entire net worth into bitcoin.
Can't argue with math.

Whenever people talk about bitcoin's market cap, I always wonder what percent of that is actually permanently unavailable because of lost/destroyed private keys, amounts sent to invalid addresses, etc.

Ok, I see.  It's kind of a "Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon" thing where I may not be connected to the retailer, but I probably know someone who knows someone who knows someone who is.
Has anyone run some kind of simulation to done calculations to figure out how many bounces an average transaction would take, or what percent of transactions would realistically be able to happen off-chain?  I want to know how often transactions would realistically get reconciled and eventually added to the blockchain.  For example, if the Bitcoin is used the way it is today, are we expecting 10 off-chain transactions for every on-chain one? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:33:51
This isn't really an argument for "no2x", so I don't know why you needed to include that in your post.  The whole point of SegWit is that it would allow for larger blocks.  The argument over 2x is about whether that's enough, or if more transaction volume is still needed.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:59:25
It's disingenuous to call the SegWit2x fork a "fork attack".  Some people think it's a good idea and some people don't, but it's not an "attack". 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:28:04


Yeah, I think that's true.  I haven't done the math or research to know exactly what block sizes are reasonable or not, but I'm not personally against small increases to the blocksize anyway.  But I also think off-chain transactions are a really good idea, and pretty much necessary (see below).


It's a fairly simple change that manages to both fix malleability, and also increase the number of transactions that can fit in a block in a way that doesn't break compatibility with older versions of the software.  


I'm not familiar with the "spend by any" issue, but I think it's addressed [here](


Two reasons.  First, 2mb wouldn't even do enough to handle the transaction volume we have today, and 32mb still wouldn't be enough in the future if Bitcoin becomes something that is used by the masses for daily transactions.  I've heard we would need 550mb blocks just to match Visa's level of transactions.  Keeping every tiny transactions on the blockchain forever isn't an ideal solution.  (But personally, I think it's a shame we couldn't at least have successfully forked to 2x, since I think that's a good idea in any case.)
Second, the other big advantage of using off-chain transactions instead is verifications are nearly instant.  Bitcoin won't really work for retail stores if you have to stand there and wait for 10 minutes for at least one confirmation before you can leave the store with your item.
Better anonymity is also an advantage of level 2 networks by the way.

I've seen people talking about making the first Lightning Network transaction with Litecoins a while back, but I don't know the specifics of the current status of it.  I think it's still considered to be in the testing phase of development. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:47:38


There are resources online that explain it better than I could.  But malleability basically limits the ways bitcoin can be used because there is no reliable way to identify a particular transaction without an ID that can't be changed.


That's not the case.  It's still a chain of signatures.  Here's an explanation: 


Home networks and computers wouldn't be able to handle that, unless technologies significantly change in the future.


No, it's not.  There is information about this online that you can find that explains why not.


You can use it now on test networks and make actual transactions with it.  Developing standards and sophisticated secure software do both take a long time.  


I don't know what that means.  But no, it's not something that would be centralized or able to be controlled in centralized way.

@_date: 2017-11-14 06:25:04


From my understanding of it, it wouldn't lead to centralization.  It would be a network of nodes where anyone can run a node that can help to pass around transactions.  It wouldn't be any more centralized than Tor or other peer to peer networks.


A 1000x transaction increase in on-chain transactions would require blocks that are 1000x the current size, which would be difficult for most computers to even just store as a full node.  The current Bitcoin blockchain is about 140 GB.  Storing 140 TB (1000x), would take dozens of large hard drives just to store it, and many months to download.  I do think a 2x, 4x, or 8x increase in blocksize would be easy to handle, and I think it's a shame we couldn't compromise and support at least 2x.  But I think the hope is the Lightning Network (or level 2 transactions of some kind) will provide a better solution than trying to keep every little transaction stored on the blockchain forever.


Yeah, who knows what Satoshi would or wouldn't have supported, and I don't even think we should care. It's not a religion, and Satoshi isn't an all-knowing god.  All that matters is which is the best technical solution.  Bcash is the one that "forked away" only because there wasn't enough consensus to change Bitcoin itself.


I think SegWit is a clever idea, that also solves the malleability problem.  It's probably not the way we would design Bitcoin from scratch if we could start over, but there's nothing particularly bad about it.  It's just a way to fix a problem, and it works, and there's no need to remove it.  SegWit transactions are being used now, and it's a permanent part of Bitcoin, and that's ok.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:51:25
Yeah, it was around $300 for a long long time and it just seemed like Bitcoin had peaked and the general public just wasn't interested in it other than some druggies and some internet kooks with conspiracy theories about the Fed and the end of civilization or something, so it was on its way to just slowly fade away.  And then the investors started finding out about it, and eventually realized it might actually be a useful thing.

Ah ok.  So if the max block size gets raised to 8 MB or 8 GB or whatever, in reality the blocks will hopefully never actually be that big?  It's just a absolute maximum possible?  
That makes me feel more comfortable with siding with Gavin's proposal.  I think it makes sense that the *maximum* block size should be fairly high to accommodate a large number of potential transactions.

None of that has anything to do with how we should evaluate the different technical options to scale bitcoin.  Both sides spend way too much time dwelling on the politics, drama, and mudslinging and not enough time talking about the technical merits of technical solutions.

The crowd that distrusts governments latched onto bitcoin pretty early on, especially on Reddit, but that wasn't why bitcoin was created (Satoshi was all about the technical achievement of decentralized payments and what that can mean for e-commerce).  If that niche remained its primary supporters, it wouldn't have much of a future except among a relatively small group.

A 2x increase in the blocksize still wouldn't really be enough to handle the demand for bitcoin transactions today, let alone in the future when there may be 100x or 1000x as many.  So the idea is that "level 2" technology like the Lightning Network that lets transactions happen "off chain" is the only long term solution.  
Even with the Lightning Network, some increase in the blocksize will probably still be necessary.  Hopefully there will be better consensus and agreement that will allow that to happen in the future.

What's the deal with GreenAddress? I've seen it a few times lately.  Is it just one of the few online wallets that supports SegWit?  
I think the way their system works is you and GreenAddresss both have keys that are needed for transactions, so in theory they won't lose your coins if they get hacked (but if they disappear entirely you would lose access to your coins because they have half your key).  Is that right?

I wonder how long will it be before some programmer creates a simple Uber-like phone app that lets people get rides paid with bitcoin without any company in the middle taking a big chunk of the profit.
They can still make some money off it by add-ons like charging drivers to get background checked to get more riders, and selling insurance.

I've seen Gavin's proposal described as "raising the block size to 8 MB".  But that's just the first year right?  It will actually raise it to 8 *GB* eventually (8000 times the current size) since it would double every two years.
I don't know if that's a bad thing, but what happens if the block size far outpaces the number of transactions?  If the block size is huge but the transaction rate remains relatively low, does that mean transactions might take a massively long time to process because everyone is just waiting around for there to be enough transactions to fill up a whole block?

I'm curious about the reasoning behind choosing to sell sex toys for bitcoin.
I think there's an assumption that people will be more likely to buy sex toys with bitcoin because they don't want payments for these types of items to appear on their credit card right?  Is that really a concern that many people have?  
I can imagine the logic behind someone using bitcoins for something like online porn which they might want to hide it from a spouse, or because it's of a questionable nature.  I'm just not sure if the same type of motivation applies to sex toys (other than people who just like using bitcoins in general).

Running for election and being a public official are some of the most difficult jobs anyone can have.  I don't think anyone does it because they're lazy and want to do nothing.  And there are also far easier ways to make money.  Most politicians do what they do because they think their views are right and that they can make a difference and change things for what they think is the better.  Some also do it because they have big egos and get a thrill from it.
When it comes to things like bitcoin, most politicians barely understand what it is and don't have a strong opinion either way, so most likely just vote based on whatever they think the people who elected them want.  Writing to them really can make all the difference on these kinds of issues where they don't have a strong personal opinion either way.

Having the option to encrypt your wallet with a password would be hugely better than having it completely unencrypted as it is now and it would provide reasonable security against any computer that isn't infected with a keylogger.

It would be great to have the option to use multi-factor authorization and smartphone integration is great for people who have smartphones (which is still only a fraction of the population!), but that stuff won't be understood or needed by people who only have a small balance in bitcoins and just use it occasionally.

Even if NameCheap could deal with that, my local Thai restaurant that takes bitcoin for online orders can't.  For now they still need to use simple payment services like BitPay that let them accept bitcoin without the risk.  And we should support them for at least supporting bitcoin at all at this point.

I can't come up with an scenario where "AML/KYC" is a concern (BitPay doesn't know anything about who I am, and why would it matter if the QR code that its giving to my phone wallet was connected to me... none of it makes any sense).
The technical issues don't make any sense.  The author of the program is just too wrapped up in personal issues with the history behind it ("the same person who thought of that idea also thought of this other idea that I don't like so I'll show him!").  &lt;sigh&gt;

This is all kind of beside the point, which is that people and businesses who use bitcoin at this point are still pretty rare, and we all should be doing everything we can to make it as easy as possible for them to use and support bitcoin.

He then throws in some things like HeartBleed, which is completely not related, but he just throws it in to confuse people who don't understand how it works.
It's just a personal/politics thing.  The new QR standard is supported by every other wallet as far as I know, and it's actually really nice.  It can work like the old type of QR code, but it can optionally also show you who you're actually sending the payment to, not just the address and the amount, and it protects against things like malware altering the code because you can verify who you're sending the payment to.
It's just the Samourai dev who is telling people that he won't support it, and he's basically telling his users that sorry, you should use another wallet if you want to be able to buy stuff from stores that use the new QR codes.

Ok, but is your fear about the government taking your money really the primary reason to use bitcoin?  Most people (at least in Western countries) mostly don't have the concern.  It's never going to going anywhere if the only people who use it are people who are trying to hide money from their government.  
And if bitcoin sets itself up as something that is in opposition to government, government can squash it fast (at least at this stage).  See China.  Its only chance to really succeed at this stage is to work towards acceptance by governments, banks, and companies.  Not as a way to hide from them.

Well, yes, there isn't enough at the current gold price.  But what would actually happen, assuming there is some way we could afford to buy up all the gold in the world, the price of gold would skyrocket to unimaginable levels.  And that would cause a crisis in industries that require gold (electronics, medical devices, etc.).  
But that's not even the biggest problem.  Not even close.  We tried the gold standard and it was a disaster.  We already know the difference between an economy with it and without.  Not just in theory, but in actual practice.  There's a really interesting Planet Money podcast about it... 
The important thing to understand is that even though fiat money backed by nothing is a scary concept for some (and a source of conspiracy theories), having a money supply that can contract and expand with the economy is one of the key things that made the prosperity of the 20th century possible.

Yeah ok.  I stopped reading there.  If you really think the best thing about bitcoin is that you can use it to hide money from the government or because you think corporations are going to take it, you might as well use cash.
The amazing thing about bitcoin is that you can instantly transmit money to anyone anywhere in the world for [nearly] free, it can be used worldwide without exchange commissions and fees, and it's a way to store (and backup!) wealth.  
Perpetuating the idea that it's a way to hide money or illegal activities from the government isn't helping the image of bitcoin at all.

Ok first, FDIC insurance doesn't protect you from wiring money out of your own account. 
Second, so... your theory is that he was blackmailed, and rather than keep quiet about it, he decided to make it as public as possible by writing an article that details events that didn't really happen involving his accountant, multiple banks, and others... all of whom could blow his cover (especially if they aren't in on his plan to cover up the blackmailing truth).  
So that's one possibility.  The other is that someone accessed his Gmail and impersonated him to get his accountant to wire money to them.  That's a much more common occurrence and more likely scenario and it fits the verifiable facts of what happened.   So unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, that would be the more likely explanation.
I'm willing to guess you see lots of conspiracies going on in the world around you.  See, that's how you reach a conclusion based on reason and evidence.

These services are the easiest way for non-techies to get started using bitcoin.  Posting this kind of fear-mongering here isn't helpful, it just creates fear and confusion to newcomers.  It's mostly rooted in the anti-corporate and anti-government views that a portion of users have.
It would be more helpful to simply say that there is always some risk in trusting your money or bitcoins to any third party.  Coinbase and Circle and highly trusted sites run by legitimate and well funded companies.  But users should be aware that there is still some risk in trusting any third party, and for people who have a lot of bitcoins, or have the technological know-how and interest in holding their own bitcoins, that is also a great option.  But they have to learn how to protect and backup their own wallets and understand the risks of that option as well.

Is that true?

I'm not sure that's possible (assuming the exchange is run legitimately).  The exchange is just facilitating the exchange of bitcoins for other people's money.

Names and labels matter.  The average person has only vaguely heard of bitcoin, if at all, so the terminology is important because that may be pretty much all they know about it.

The adjustment after the recent extreme price spike is expected.  We've been through this several times before.
It goes like this:
- Media articles or events spur interest, price jumps a bit.
- New people start the process to invest in bitcoins, it takes a few days for their bank accounts to get verified, but once they do, the price really starts to climb (a reasonable increase in price is justified by the increased level of interest).
- The higher price generates it's own buzz and it climbs beyond what the market can really sustain (the bubble really begins).
- As soon as things calm down a bit, and usually during a weekend day when new investors aren't getting their bank accounts verified because it's a bank holiday, the price starts to dip just a little.
- Everyone panics and starts selling and over the course of a few days the price drops below what it's value should reasonably be (and smart investors buy in).
- Over time it returns to a more reasonable growth pattern and the price starts to climb again until the next bubble comes along.
So, it'll likely continue dropping over the next few days, and probably bottom out somewhere around $600 I would guess. It'll eventually creep back up again, but it will be a little while before it's back to $1000, probably not until there are some big news stories about retailers starting to accept Bitcoin (which is happening, but it will take time).
So the next few days should be your best bet to buy in, but be aware you'll need some patience for it to climb back up in value.

From what I understand, banks (and credit unions) are required to report large transfers of funds.  It may not make a difference what sort of bank it is, either way it will still be reported and investigated.

When you say "lock it up in a safe place", hopefully you mean using encryption and not a physical lock (which is easily compromised). 
Pretty much the way to do it is to have a folder encrypted with TrueCrypt and long password with a copy of your Bitcoin wallet (and a copy of other important passwords, etc... such as an export of your LastPass password vault).  
But be sure to have multiple backups of that encrypted archive (including at least one copy that isn't in the same physical location).

Not really, it's mostly "interest --&gt; price".  There is some "price --&gt; interest" that creates a feedback loop (and a price bubble), but that's a secondary effect.
The major price spikes came *after* a major news story (or multiple stories) about bitcoin.  First there it was some coverage about the technology, then a TV series mention, then stories about VC interest, then stories about financial fund interest.  Every time there's more media coverage, more people hear about bitcoin, start the investment process, and the price starts climbing a week or so later when their funds clear.

You can't move around that kind of cash without proving your identity because of money laundering laws.  In this case it's not PayPal's fault.
There are laws that kick in at around $10K, and sometimes less.  $200K is an enormous sum and if you know anything about money laundering laws and banking regulations, it's absurd to think he was going to anonymously dump it into a bank account without a social security number without jumping through some serious hoops.  If it was that easy, all the drug lords would be funneling everything through PayPal.  
I don't doubt that he'll get his money eventually, but there's going to have to be a procedure that he's going to have to go through and it make take some time.   I really wonder why he waited until now to try to withdraw any of it.
If it was Bitcoin, at least he would know it was his to keep, but it still might be tricky to get all that converted into currency and deposited into a bank account if that's what he wants to do with it.
Edit: Oh, and not to mention that the IRS requires them to report payments over $600 to the IRS so people don't use PayPal to hide from paying taxes.  Not everyone is thrilled about all the regulations, but in any case it isn't PayPal's fault that they have to follow the law.

As demand increases the price would gradually go up, which is fine if it happens at a reasonable rate.

Hopefully eventually there will be some ongoing stability in the exchange rate of bitcoins.  As long as there's all this potential to gain or lose money if you hold onto bitcoins... it isn't good for the health of bitcoins as a real currency.
Like many people, when I see the price going up I just want to hold onto them and not spend them at all.

It's nearly impossible to read the damn article because of the f***ing annoying flashing ads on the page.  I gave up and closed the tab.  What a shitty website.

Get the media involved.  Google your local newspaper and TV news stations and call them or send them an email.  They love stuff like this (kids + injustice = ratings).

Why is this posted in @_date: 2013-12-02 01:21:28
How so?

It's nice to see a comment on the internet about the Fed that is actually factual and not a conspiracy theory.  
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:34:14
I don't know why my earlier comment got buried, but while some of his info is good, he also throws in conspiracy theory bullshit about fiat money and big banks conspiring that he probably got from watching other YouTube videos.  There's a lot of misinformation, so take what he says with a grain of salt.

If you really want to know how to get this in the news, the answer is you contact reporters.  Every newspaper and news station has contact info listed for news tips.  It just takes a little more effort than upvoting a Reddit post, so people don't usually bother.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:37:23
Yeah... that's not good.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:58:07
I'm not sure whether you're being sarcastic or not, but either way, your statement is true.
"Marketing" and the public's perception of bitcoin is the most important determiner of its future success.  A lot of us techies tend to disregard marketing, but it really does matter.

There's no actual link to the actual Mega site, so I assumed it isn't up yet.  But  looks like it might actually be it.  Can anyone confirm that?  
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:16:07
Yeah, that's part of it.  If the terms are unreasonable, that's another indication that there wasn't a meeting of the minds and that there was intent to defraud.  
An unfair contract isn't automatically void, but an unfair contract can be a strong part of the evidence to show that one of the parties was deceived when they entered the agreement. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:43:32
When people complain about all the irrelevant junk in lately, this is what they mean.
Yes, it's funny, but it really has nothing to do with bitcoin.  Please don't post this kind of thing and please don't up vote it.
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:58:07
Yeah, as long as you make the changes clear enough that they could reasonably be expected to be aware of the changes before signing, I would imagine you would have a pretty good case.  
If you quietly make small unnoticeable changes, that could be considered "fraud in the inducement."  But if the changes were made in a way so that your intention was clearly to make them aware of the change, you would probably have a good case.
I'm definitely not a lawyer, but I've taken some business law classes and know a little bit about contract law.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:05:46
No.  I'm sorry, but no.

"Hero who sacrificed everything"?  Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but the only thing he "sacrificed" was his own country.  The world is a less safe place for all of us because of what that one traitor did.

In a year or two when bitcoin acceptance is widespread we're going to look back and laugh at how silly it was that it was big news on every time some local pizza or sandwich shops decided to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:39:01
In these early days the companies behind these services are pretty much unknown and can turn out to be scammers.  There's definitely a lot of risk if you're trusting your coins to one of these online services.  
We're just now beginning a new phase where there will be more established companies backed with Silicon Valley venture capital and founders with established reputations, so there will be more reason to trust Bitcoin services as it becomes more mainstream.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:14:03
Not necessarily.  There are signs that the US Treasury Department sees some potential benefit to the economy from the efficiency of cryptocurrencies and "innovative technologies."  It's entirely uncertain at this point whether cryptocurrencies will be discouraged or encouraged by governments, and we've seen some indications of both kinds of response.  It could go either way, but I suspect it will eventually gain acceptance worldwide. 
There's a lot of talk on the internet of governments using fiat currency to control people or whatever, but in reality most democratic governments just want to do whatever is good for their economy.  And if Bitcoin is seen as good for the economy (without helping criminals or terrorists too much), they'll embrace it.
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:58:29
Sure, that's just inflation.  But the problem is when people see that as a sign that something nefarious is going on... or as the nutcase in the video says the government is "printing money to bride constituents and donors" or something.  Mmm... okay.  Sure.

Not only that, but only 15% of them will still be un-mined in about 7 years.
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:40:28
Sure, but that's just one problem.  There's a reason why nearly all economists and historians agree that the gold standard isn't just a bad idea, it's a dangerous idea.  It's been tried before, and it was a major cause of nothing less than the Great Depression (seriously).  That [Planet Money]( story on it I linked to is fascinating.  Besides, there isn't enough gold in existence to make it possible in modern times anyway. 
I was pretty restrained in my original message, but really, it's shameful how many people are easily duped by misinformation from garbage they see on the internet, when it's so easily debunked for anyone who takes the time to even consider the counter arguments. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 05:02:03
Umm... who do you think is stealing it exactly?
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:10:09
It's great he's talking about Bitcoin and all, but he nonchalantly mixes in conspiracy theory bullshit about government plots and conspiracies with the big banks, etc.  As soon as he shows a graph claiming to show a dramatic drop in the value of a dollar because of "government control", you know he's full of shit.
So, he's a little gullible and some of what he says is typical Youtube conspiracy theorist nonsense, but there's also some actual good info about bitcoins and other alternative currencies.

Where do you see these mtgox lag time measurements?  
I logged into mtgox and tried to make a small trade but the buy / sell buttons just don't do anything when I click them.

I don't know why some people insist on perpetuating the idea that it's Bitcoin vs. all established banks/governments.


Not true.  The response has been mixed, but some of the biggest investment banks are embracing Bitcoin.


Not true.  Again, the early response has been mixed, with some significant favorable responses, especially in the US.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:41:42
Nothing.  But people love to upvote anything that agrees with their personal/political views.
