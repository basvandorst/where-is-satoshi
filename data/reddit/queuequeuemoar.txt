MtGox is a very profitable company and gained a lot of money out of Bitcoin's success and they stand to gain much more. What motive do they have to put an end to everything just like that? 
People were mentioning a possible motive being them trying to get rid of evidence that would have somehow incriminated MtGox in the whole SilkRoad v1 debacle, but I'm not buying that considering MtGox isn't even based in the USA and doesn't have to answer to any agency in the USA...
We know two things, first is that MtGox's community relations staff is nonexistent (or complete shit), and second is no one really knows what's going on except MtGox employees themselves and they are all keeping their mouths shut as of now.

I think you're referring to black hats turned white hats...all companies inherently hire only white hats.

Recently I read an article that said that the big difference between Intel Xeon and Core i7 processors were the fact that Xeon processors were engineered to run stable at high loads for long periods of time in server environments, whereas Core i7 processors were built to run at higher frequencies but only to handle lower load. 
Based on what you're saying, there's no risk that running an i7 processor at constant 100% load will result in it failing faster compared to the Xeon running at constant 100% load. 
If that's true, I guess the article is wrong then.

Credit card companies don't know what you purchased from a marijuana shop, let alone any store you use your credit card at. Drugs are not the only things you can purchase from there. I doubt they would "flag" you for it, it's none of their business.

The bash shellshock vulnerability has been there for 20 years and was only just recently publicized and patched.

I was also curious about the "yalla" at the end. It is an arabic word that means "let's move on" and it struck me as odd that he was using it. You're getting downvoted for calling him a fraud, but you have a good point about the word usage.

Good for you, but you kind of got ripped off paying ~$250USD for an HD7870. It's is a good card but the new generation is out, and that card is actually worth around $150 new nowadays. I would have gone for a HD7950 or an 8000 series card.

don't touch it for a year. forget about it and it will pay off. Absolutely no day trading with bitcoin, it will net you little to negative profit.

probably better off buying now, I'm doubting there will be a steep drop as we've seen before ever again. there are lots of whales investing now, individuals have less and less influence on the market. it may drop a hundred or so, but not much more than that in my opinion.

you can still recover deleted data with FDE as long as you know the password or have access to a live copy.

I think the point is there are no promises if you don't include a transaction fee since most of the miners avoid processing transactions if they are not benefiting from them.
Just like if a restaurant knows you don't tip, you're not likely to get any form of stellar service.

I could have sworn that MtGox was supported by Akamai, which has one of the most resilient networks in the world, pretty much immune to DDoS attacks. What gives?

These aren't always sure-fire indications for scams. Bitcoin is so new that people are starting new businesses that deal in bitcoins every day, this includes registering new domains (and possibly keeping whois info private for obvious reasons). They may not have social media presence because they are just starting off, same with all of your other notes, they are all possible with a newly started company. Does that mean they are scammers? No, it just means they're trying to get their foot through the door, and people that automatically assume the worst of them are hurting the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:45:36
you cancelled a bitcoin transaction? wat?
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:14:21


No, how did you manage to buy 0.5BTC for $316, when that is the cost of an entire BTC and it hasn't risen above $400, like, ever? Maybe I'm not understanding correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:46:41
it probably is if you've got years of blackhat experience, but yeah certifications are an assurance of your skills

You've got to wonder how they got your email address though, and how they knew you used coinbase?

and you'd need to know how to hide it, can't imagine any bank would let you cash out that amount very easily
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:43:13
That's true. Also if you were an early adopter you probably don't care much about spending a little extra.
