First paragraphs sound much like Bitcoin. I hope people stress the fact that a decentralized system is always superior to a centralized one.

I can not find any other source backing this claim. Looks fishy to me. The only other news about this also comes from the same site:

Andreas explains things like this best:

Get a wallet at 
Preferably, choose a segwit one, as this technology allows more transactions in a single block. The wallets currently supporting segwit can be found in this post: 
Then create your wallet, remember to save your seed (write it down on paper!) and send your Bitcoins from Coinbase to your new wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:35:25
Try this one.

Instead of block reward, they will solely rely on fees.

More BTC. Don't fall for shitcoins.

This thread is beautiful for gems like this.

Just like in Bitcoin, it's the community whose task it is to regulate itself. If the majority of people want shitposts to hit the frontpage, there is no reason for regulatory intervention.
I don't like these posts as well. They are flooding the frontpage, burying all the great news underneath them.
However if you want change, then we as a community have to drive that change, not ask for regulation.

It should be a no-go to store your Bitcoin on exchanges. If you want to know why, google Mt. Gox.
Yes, transfer it to your wallet. Get a wallet at 
Preferably, choose a segwit one, as this technology allows more transactions in a single block. The wallets currently supporting segwit can be found in this post: 
Then create your wallet, remember to save your seed (write it down on paper!) and send your Bitcoins from Coinbase to your new wallet.
As you can't choose the fees for the transaction (the exchange has to do that) it does not matter if you send now or later.

For every transaction you can select the "tip", the miner shall receive for including your transaction on the freshly mined block which he adds to the blockchain.
There are many sites that visualize the mempool and show you, what tips/fees are currently in the network and how you should select your transaction-fee according to that.
Have a look at:

Thank you for your very detailed reply!
You are right pointing out trusting one statement and not trusting another statement is inconsistent. And its also true that starting from 2017 it takes significantly longer to sync the blockchain (I just setup my node 2 months ago).
So verify it is :).
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:25:18
It depends on the type of wallet you use. Most wallets don't offer replace by fee.
Fee bumping is explained here:

Andreas Antonopoulos. Watch everything in his Youtube-Channel. Everything!
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:36:05
Its odd. For the first time in my life people actually listen to me. I don't know if I can handle all this.
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:49:54
What is the timeframe where this could have been exploited? I get that the issue was introduced with 0.15.0, which was released 2017-09-14. So the blockheight should have been around 485000.
So `invalidateblock 485000` and I am good?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:53:29
If you want to make it go through you should really use CPFR or bump the fee. Maybe you use a wallet that lets you replace the fee, then do that.
With just $ .13 the transaction will never go through.

I like how his surname is missing. Because we all know who you are, Andreas &lt;3.

I know you want to counterplay the FUD going on by posting shitty memes. But please... This isn't getting us anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:28
Usually I downvote posts like this because it gives people a false impression of what Bitcoin is and should become.
But at this point, I don't really care anymore.
Have all my upvotes!
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:06:06
The memes on this subreddit have been getting out of hand but this is actually really awesome.
Thank you!

Hello, I am replying to you because you seem to have good insight on the upcoming fork. No mean to highjack to comment for a dumb question or anything.
So what I have heard about this specific way of trying to split the coins is that it is only possible with freshly mined B1X/BTC/Core-Coins. At least that is what this article on bitcointechtalk suggests:
I don't know nothing about hard-forks and the way to go as a user. I have just gotten into Bitcoin three months ago. So I would really love to hear your insight on this, as I am very unsure about the way to go. My goal is to get rid of B2X asap. Not because I want to "win" as much as possible, but I don't want to support it in any way.

I did some stalking on your account and found out, you're most likely german :D. Me too! I got my father this book for christmas because he doesn't speak english that well: 
It's covers all aspects of Bitcoin and the Blockchain and is one of the very few profound and reliable books out there. Lightning Network of course is not a topic as well as all the new developments in the recent months.
For everything else, I suggest Andreas Antonopoulos Youtube-Channel: 
Although it's "just" a Youtube-Channel Andreas has a very deep knowledge and is a trustworthy source for all aspects of Bitcoin and Ethereum. You can check out his books on github:

Ok, I'll keep that in mind then. Thanks again!

Oh interesting. I was looking into running a full node on a rpi3. Haven't yet decided on all the parts (hdd/ssd due to electricity demand).
Would you not recommend using a rpi3 for a full node? Do you know about cheap alternatives? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:16:34
Thank you!
So there are no overheating issues on a rpi3?
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:13:37
Even if you cannot let it run 24/7 I would firmly recommend you to download the blockchain on a PC bit by bit for a few hours each day. It will be faster and easier on the Pis processor unit which overheats quickly without active cooling attached.
For the harddrive I would suggest getting a regular 1 TB 3,5'' harddrive together with a cheap case for external harddrives with power supply. Costs just as much as a fancy 2,5'' USB-Harddrive without dedicated power supply. You can still use your harddrive for personal use. For a node it sadly is just a waste of money and also time.
And while youre at it, i would suggest getting your Pi a case with active cooling (just a small fan is enough) and heatsinks. Costs just about $ 20.
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:45:37
No it actually says "869G/916G" *available*.
Check the last block and percent. He is currently downloading the blockchain to the Pi.
Which is a terrible idea  because this process is gonna take you 2-3 weeks on a Pi. What you want to do instead is downloading the blockchain on your PC and transfer it over to the Pi via ssh. I hope the attached harddrive is formatted in ext4? Did you txindex=1 the blockchain?
When it comes to stuff like this, people shouldn't experiment. Follow a good guide instead. This here is a very good one: 
//e: Also the unpowered harddrive is most likely gonna be a huge issue. The Pi's core will downclock when not supplied with enough power. An external harddrive can drain up to 10 W (0.6 A). Always use a dedicated power supply for your harddrives.
