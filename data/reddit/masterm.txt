Or to put it another way, the law made them choose between an extremely expensive option or an unsecure option, when the original method of operating was fine.

I thought I was looking at screenshots for eve!

Nice I'm going to get 0.56 so I can be part of the 2%
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:05:51
Now that just doesn't make any sense.  I don't own a home.

Paypal charge is fucking ridiculous, and i cant seem to find a list of cash deposit places
@_date: 2012-12-09 20:36:57
Doesn't mean there isn't a shitload of other things that are wasteful.

after all these years?

New idea: Have bitcoin wallet able to be set up like a truecrypt fake or masked volume. I.e. it looks like a normal file, any type you specify, in any location, and needs a password each time to access it
either that or something like a blizzard authenticator. it would be hard to implement solely client side but there's got to be a way

I would also like a few coins to mess around with and I don't want to go through the process of setting up multiple accounts on these weird sites just to get it. The barrier for entry sucks

I didnt use the same password for other services

Forever, as long as most miners only mine when it is cost effective. less miners = less difficulty, so when it gets to the point where it isn't profitable, people will stop mining and difficulty will go down.

I wouldnt think quitting mining would help, just selling

What kinda mobos are you using? what kinda power is needed to run those beasts?
@_date: 2011-02-10 16:30:45
the site seems to be down
@_date: 2011-05-09 22:52:13
If implemented correctly, this could be the thing that brings bitcoin into mainstream
@_date: 2011-04-23 13:33:41
yes. you loose it, and it is gone forever. the system was designed this way and since it has an ongoing deflationary trend, the lost of bitcoins doesn't hurt it much

That depends loosely. If something takes labor to create, and I would like to skirt that labor by buying the complete product, the product is worth more due to the labor

I would store it encrypted on a service some where else incase the house burned down
@_date: 2011-08-14 19:53:45
the lack of the other key
@_date: 2011-06-13 19:44:24
sold out already
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:32:07
I wish I had bought in earlier. I remember when bitcoin was worth less than ten cents. How much money I could have now...
@_date: 2013-03-13 05:52:45
why are miners using an old version?
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:39:16
I was so close to putting in $1000 when the price was just under $.5 a coin. SO talked me out of it and I'm kicking myself. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:36:51
looks like france vps is the best deal on there.
