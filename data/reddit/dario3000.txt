Yes, it does have an automatic BTC Wallet check. Every time you receive a payment to your wallet, the number of coins will be added into your MY-BTC account.
It also have a function that automatically substracts the mining costs. You can find it here: 
Mining costs can be set under [Enter the costs of your mining]

You can find an alert function under "settings". It will send you an email alert if your coin value will rise and/or fall over a defined percentage

Thanks :)
there is a hit rate of the predictions, displayed on the right site, so you can see how accutate the forecast is.
Bouth, the long term and the short term forecast, analyzes several factors (eg. past developments, prices, trading volume, foreign exchange rates, Google Trends, time, day, etc.), read the pattern and calculated a prediction. 
The difference is the time period of this data. Long term checks the last years and short term only the last days.
So the long term is more accurate and much smoother. The short term is more "risky".

I don't have trades at CampBX. If you send me a CSV, I will build an import function the next days. I will send you my email address.

For example you could create two accounts and join them together under "settings" (this lets you switch between accounts in just one click).
The first account is your exchange account (e.g. GOX) and the second one is for your savings (here you can create an automatically BTC Wallet check)
So you see every time how much you have in the exchange and how much in your safebox.
