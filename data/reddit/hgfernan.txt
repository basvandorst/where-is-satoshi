I believe that profitability of this device depends first and foremost from the cost of the kilowatt in the buyer's location.

An excellent article, that confirms that people with excellent background in economy can also write clearly and respecting the common sense.
I’ll have to share this on in all social networks i’m in.

With Bitcoin, nothing is exactly linear, or just as expected.

When Bill Gates say something is good, i fear for that thing. 8-)
But he actually didn't say that: he just said it was convenient. Bill is betting in a version of digital money that's more similar to Kenya's MPesa.

A study sponsored by banks. Can it be FUD -- designed to cause Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt about Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:55:33
It is really not what they told you: there's no prohibition of BTC in Ecuador at all. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 20:24:10
I hope so: some nice Bitcoin sites are in Russia. If they close, it will be a pity for all Bitcoin-sphere. :-(
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:21:18
Sad news. Maybe that can bring lessons to avoid it happening again.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:53:56
Excellent description of what is happening there.

Go, Argentina !
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:56:59
Maybe they can't track somebody's BTC spending to that extreme level of detail, so they make random accusations.
It's not impossible that it' just old FUD, aka "Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt".

A very insightful discussiom on the price of bitcoin.

That was how Brazilians used to identify themselves in the past.  no Twitter. 8-)

Makes sense: Bitcoin mining is just a specialized form of high performance computing.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:54:53
Can the black magic of traders give hints of the Bitcoin prices ? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:13:47
I'm not a lawyer, but i think that  says that what's going is a culture clash between two different ways of creating a legal system: the Roman Law (used in most Latin countries) and the Common Law, used in most Anglophone countries.
Brazil follows the Roman Law, and the lawyers here have a phrase that's exactly the same as  said for Ecuador: people and private institutions can do what is not explicitly prohibited by the law. 
So, Luiz Nunez seems right in his interpretation of the Ecuatorian law.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:27:23
Dear  while i agree that you have good ideas, i'm afraid that this discussion is becoming too technical and too dependent upon the culture and the legal practices of Ecuador. 
It would be nice to hear what an Ecuatorian lawyer has to say about this.

An interesting list of people to follow on Twitter.

It would be interesting to learn what other cloudmining services think about this. 
From the user point of view, Cex.io looked like a company that charged too much.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:58:58
Agreed.

The problem with Bitcoin news sites is that they are also doing Bitcoin speculation in a way or another. So, they use their propaganda power to improve their gains. 8-) 
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:13:30
Sorry,  my bad. Learned it, though.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:47:41
Why am i not surprised ?

The White House ecosystem is totally aware of Bitcoin.

Very rich information about the Bitcoin status and future trends.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:28:54
The investors of Bitpay/Coinbase pay everything just because they're charitable and want to spend money in a haarmless cause. 
And the media coverage is not a habit changer; that is: what the media says nobody listens to.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:07:15
Again, i believe that your words are too strong in this context. 
If you said that Bitcoin for these companies is just a means to convert fiat money and eventually bypass credit card or bank fees, i would agree to you in gender, number and degree.
But no doubt these companies are really accepting Bitcoins, even though they're not storing those Bitcoins. 
Would you agree that the acceptance of a new habit (economic or cutural) can be gradual ? 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:03:36
Futurology is always futurology, but it is interesting to see how far or how close they have been from reality. 
Indeed, no $10, but half of the price went away in a year.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:26:59
Indeed, they're convinced that Bitcoin is useless. And they accept it currently just to throw away money and time.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:34:00
Good ! You seem to agree that the extended media coverage will lead people to change their habits and adopt Bitcoin.
And since the companies that invested intend to profit, aka make money, why do they invest in Bitcoin ? Have they been fooled by the media coverage ? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:43:18
I'm not an ecomist, so please forgive my uneducated guesses. And English is not my native language. (That's easy to see 8-))
But i believe that "nothing" is probably an unnecessarily strong word in this context. 
 
What about an increasing number of companies accepting Bitcoin ? 8-)
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:24:23
So, Bitcoin is leaving the speculation to become part of the common economy.
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:02:25
Please tell me about who pays them to accept Bitcoin. And if you don't mind doing two things at the same time, please elaborate a little more about the gradual acceptance of a new habit being introduced by gaining media coverage. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:44:16
That's an interesting argument that you should tell the companies that are taking the time to adopt the harmless novelty. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:09:03
OK. Agreed. 
I should have said something less assertive, like "It seems that Bitcoin is gradually entering the real world economy."
