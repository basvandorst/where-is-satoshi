Why doesn`t the name match?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:48:19
Down 32% for the month
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:05:53
Someone's clearly trying to make the price dive.. why on earth would anyone sell at that price.. maybe they're bringing it down so they can bet long when the futures start again. . Or maybe they're just trying to kill it
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:03
Nope... I just know when people are being Dicks
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:57:53
You can see as soon as we move towards mid 11k some arse sells a giant red candle full. It's being totally manipulated
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:55:39
Yeah whatever. Been reading stuff like that for a month.. look at it now
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:22:39
Serious question now.. why on earth would anyone sell a heap of BTC at $11.7k when it's going upwards.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:59:37
It doesn't help people in this situation when they're worried or concerned because they're about to lose their money and experienced crypto guys laugh and abuse them and call them pussys.. they're just ordinary guys who wanna try make a few quid. I'm not aiming this at this sub.. but on Trading view and You Tube there's some real Assholes.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:07:26
What about the G20 summit where they will discuss banning/regulating crypto trading. (Not confirmed). What could this news do?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:19:14
The Gobshites on the trading forums are waiting for $8k to buy in.. they know something. Don`t panic guys.. come back in a month
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:02:32
Some on trading view were saying that last night.. it's dropped $1250 since then. Basically, no one has any idea what they're talking about or what's going to happen. May as well just toss a coin
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:10:55
Will they be doing this futures thing again.. if so when?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:15:06
I'll hold you to that..
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:17:02
Every time there's a big buy there's an even bigger sell.. it's under attack. Fight dammit
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:33:50
Doubt they report when it goes up.. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:33:28
Just wondering... if all the alts are following BTC... why don`t I just sell my alts for BTC. What`s the point diversifying? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:23:17
Seriously guys, please explain. All the green buys on this chart arent moving the price.. when theres a red one there`s a substantial drop.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:22:32
It baffles me, someone just sold a heap at $15k.. why would you sell something at $15k that was $17k only 48 hours ago?
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:40:40
BTC $11,220 right now... will be 10,900 again within 30 minutes.. just watch.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:21:12
Just looking at GDAX. Nearly every block on there is green but the price ain't moving up. One tiny red and it drops.. bit fishy
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:20:30
Is it a dip though.. it`s been dropping for 4 weeks
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:25:14
Deplorables.. you mean ordinary people who thought they'd try and invest their money... ?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:59:42
I thought that ended last week.. what happens Fridy
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:50:07
You mean in this thread
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:53:30
BTC gone down $3k in 3 days. But i can`t see why. Christmas/New year is over, No talk of forks/futures failed contracts.. what is it? Is it just dying?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:03:31
There's real people losing their money here.. don't be an Asshole
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:36:25
Some Whales just trying put a stop to that
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:59:07
From what I can see the only logical creature that would sell a heap of BTC at £11,100 is probably a manipulator
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:32:08
Problem is it held well yesterday at mid 14k.. today it's holding at mid 13k. What's it gonna be holding well at next Sunday.. mid 7k?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:46:52
Really.. even though it gets out of breath when it gets in the 15's
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:04:43
Something fishy here.. or is it me not knowing what I'm saying. Look at the 1 hour on GDAX. Several large green buys and the price didn't move.. 1 red sell and it dropped like a brick. Can someone explain it. Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:09:26
Not really..
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:27:21
Don't believe you
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:49
What do you guys have you stop sell set to. (Serious answers please)
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:05:19
The same people will make a big red candle in about an hour
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:40:58
The Whales have woken up
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:52:17
Bet you a BTC it makes zero difference
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:29:25
It was also $17k just 1 month ago.. so don't feel relaxed
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:45:58
Shame the top sentence makes no sense
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:46:28
There was a survey on this yesterday in this sub somewhere.. I think it`s $1000 to $5000
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:22:10
"2018 will be a great year for crypto" they said ��
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:24:56
OK.. but how do I write the word "isn`t" for example
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:29:38
How about you Fuck Off!!
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:05:45
If it goes down to 6k you'll be buying a dead duck.. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:24:07
Bang on..
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:48:00
Oh hang on.. found another... is this it... ' Hey thanks man
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:29:43
This sub is dead these days..
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:35:22
24 hours later and not that wrong ��
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:36:03
Taking a bit longer than I expected
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:35:37
I'd rather it just went up $1 a day than bouncing around like a freaked out beach ball.. it's doing my head in.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:07:01
This is totally fucked up.. why would anyone sell a block at $11,100k.. why, why?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:30:25
This is why I HODL and don't trade ��
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:29:37
Make sure you watch the price for a day or 2 and buy at what is the average lowest price. Don't make the same mistake I did in October.. I was so eager to get in that I just signed up and bought at a peak.. could have made a bit more profit than I did.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:06:34
Guys, anyone know how much are the total fees to withdraw   Euros from coinbase to a UK Bank Account (SEPA)
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:49:47
Not got it set to GBP by any chance have you
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:14:31
That's probably the most confusing explanation I've heard yet
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:13:40
Still here.. waiting to get the rest of the profits back that I just lost in 7 days (still 75% to go)
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:01:15
I was told in the beginning to diversify.. I then got 16 different alts as well as bitcoin. Now when BTC moves they all move exactly the same. May as well just got bitcoin. Having said that ETH broke a different pattern yesterday which is quite rare
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:24:06
may take off... for an hour or 2.. then
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:03:03
�� hilarious.. there are people out there that paid $19k for it.. I'm sure they're not worried at all.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:09:16
Yeah.. nice
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:58
We were also told it`d be $20k by now.. who do we believe?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:14:07
This is why I lost money :) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:08:05
Aww piss, thought it was happenin again then.. is it?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:57:53
What are everyone's thoughts on the news from France today?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:56:51
What will that mean to the price?
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:45:10
When there's a dip people say "zoom out... Look at the month gains". Well I just zoomed out and this thing is going to shit
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:47:03
That`s what I used
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:49:18
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:35:36
Oh dear.. I was hoping the whales didn't work weekends.. it appears they do.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:47:42
I just bought some choc chip flapjacks at discount.. price dropped because the shopkeeper found out coinbase aren't planning on selling flapjacks right now.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:59
Bitcoin will be $20k by Jan 2018... Oh err ��
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:54:26
Haha, look at those sells at $10,921.. those Whales are just making it obvious
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:32:22
Whales are awake again.. fucking turds
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:33:36
What chart is that?
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:55:09
Why the hell is this thread so quiet these days
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:02:05
Look at that huge dip then.. hardly any significant red sells under it on GDAX.. so how did it dip so hard?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:23:53
Hi guys, honest answers please. What do you all see BTC price being by next Christmas. I don't want to ask this in crypto subs because there's so many childish haters out there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:12
I`m contemplating the same thing..
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:32:38
I'm confused.. I thought that's what a limit order does too, what's the difference between a limit order and stop order
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:02:00
I would say a ratio of 60/20/20 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:23:09
Good question
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:28
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:32
OK, Why though?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:06:20
Just look at all those Whales trying to shake the little guys off.. fuck em. HODL
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:08:09
The train is very late...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:31:35
But not in £`s
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:50
BCH dropped to 3250 now
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:33:56
I didn't have to give it
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:08
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:12:32
Therefore, now is probably not the right time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:12:16
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:29
Coinbase price is £12,515 and it wants me to buy at £13,065. Kiss my arse
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:43:24
An actual Troll
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:28:02
Kraken is total shite
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:47
Now's the time of you want to buy cheap.. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:45
I could be wrong... but it appears they only do the top 3 cryptos and Ripple
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:36
No lol, I just want to know how (When the time comes) to cash in BTC and put the funds into my Bank account... in £`s
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:45:32
But then there`s charges
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:49:54
If I buy some you can guarantee it`ll drop.. i`m not gonna bother unless it gets to £70 what I sold it for... too much hurt
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:08
Annoys me when you just see a big drop and all the exchanges go down.. this is when we need them. Coinbase down too
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:18
Everything just.......... Stopped
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:27:29
Sorry, my mistake
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:43
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:03
Or coinbase won't let me cos it's broke ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:46:10
You`ll still be checking prices even if you`ve sold... curiosity will getcha
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:57
So, unbiased opinions.. is it worth buying a little BCC today?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:41
Why are people selling at this low price
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:16
I didn`t mean put BTC in my bank... lol. I know you can`t do that. I meant sell it for £`s and then put it in the account. Especially as GDAX don`t do £`s
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:51
Dollars, Euros and Pounds aren`t real either.. If everyone in my country went to the banks to draw out their savings, it would take the country 10 years to print it all
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:47
Coinbase "BTC purchases temporarily disabled"
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:16
It just dropped almost £2000 in 6 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:24:05
Hi guys, I`m thinking of doing a bit of trading on Bittrex. I have enhanced verification in place... would you stay away from them or are they ok
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:31:52
Err, 'all- time high".. look again.. it's been dropping for a week
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:37
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:03:51
Me exactly the same... was watching my ETH and LTC bleed all week.. took it all out on the 7th at £318(ETH) and £70(LTC).. put it all in BTC  and within 24 hours they shot up like a space rocket and BTC is now sat twiddlin it`s thumbs. I feel like smacking myself in the face
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:36:10
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:45
Price dropping fast and coinbase is still working... funny that
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:49
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:11
I've been in the crypto game about 2 month. The biggest mistake I made was to sell coin due to panic. Will never do it again. Sold a Litecoin at £70.. next day it flew like a rocket.. cost me £260 to buy 1 back... . HODL boys
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:08
It did the same 2 weeks ago. Dropped 3.5k.. have a look at the 30 day graph
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:27:55
Not just you.. I check every 5 minutes. Need to stop it
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:25:53
Don't panic, it's only 1.75% down from this time yesterday.. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:23:35
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:13
You can`t win unless you HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:21
We're moving
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:58
There was a substantial drop just before GDAX went down.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:28
Are you sure?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:04:01
Still don't get it, what's the difference between a limit order and stop order?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:25:33
Holy shit, opened a Bittrex account... tried sending a bit of bitcoin over.. the fees were double what I wanted to send. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:48:46
How do you get it to your bank account though?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:24:56
I'd prefer 100 per day instead of rocketing 1k and then falling back. It's like walking home drunk
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:30:00
What is this Cryptokittens?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:19:40
BTC won`t go up until about an hour after I sell all mine.. (That`s what just happened with LTC and ETH) Then it`ll rocket. Everyone send me some money and gifts and i`ll sell and you`ll all get rich. If you send chocolate make sure it`s dark chocolate.. cash in £`s and TV`s minimum 32 inch. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:00
Coinbase purchases back on
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:48:38
I sold at £70.. 12 hours before it went to the moon ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:06:43
WTF.. it's nearly £13k and coinbase still showing £12.6
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:04:04
Hence.. diversifying
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:31:01
Read the first article on the front page.. it lists Bitcoin cash as the most unlikely to be listed on coinbase.. therefore mate I'll pass
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:32
But you`d have to be Psychic to know the ATH
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:01
I learnt my lesson losing this week.. i`m HODL`ing to the death
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:55:37
If you want it to drop I can buy some if you wish... always happens 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:39
I could get some BCH for $3500... should I
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:19:54
It doesn`t.. don`t give anyone that ever...
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:50:38
A lot of people ask this, I did a while ago. I don't know why we don't just grow up and call it "Hold".. then people won't need to keep asking
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:25
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:29
Yeah, is there a way to get BTC to my Bank Account with no fees.. or do I have to pay Coinbase for the honour of doing it
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:27:21
At the exact same time Litecoin dropped about 20% for over 7 minutes... funny that
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:51
What do we think BCH will be at this time tomorrow ($)
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:44:11
Whales trying to shake the pussies out of the tree
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:29
People were anticipating a correction at $10k
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:15:29
Hodl.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:51:16
Won`t your bank hit you with a charge for that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:57:26
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:24:20
I think I might av been right this time ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:04:19
Thanks, how long do deposits normally take?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:45:23
Yep.. hodl
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:44
No No No.. not yet
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:27
Or do I keep it all in and set an alert for the point where I start to lose then get it all out
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:05
They only give you BCH if you had coin before 1st August.. so you aint that much of a beginner
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:18:56
BTC is a over £500 less on Coinbase than GDAX.. why`s that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:38:07
I was verified in about 5/6 hours
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:07
So someone clearly knew coinbase were gonna do this.. explains the dip earlier
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:39
Same on bittrex
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:15:52
The dollar hasn't weakened since he came to power.. hardly at all against the pound and euro anyway
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:21:08
What is fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:01
I've doubled my initial investment.. I'm wondering if I should take out my initial investment so I'm never out of pocket and leave the rest in our just let it all roll
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:02
All the major coins did exactly the same thing.. really weird that
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:27:21
He`s talking about Bitcoin Cash folks... he confirmed it down here somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:57:46
Good point
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:32
Well we know it could get up to $19.5k and above.. it did an hour ago
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:23:55
But look at the size of those blocks on GDAX.. they ain't little guys
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:47:16
Why is the coinbase price for BTC a fair bit lower than the price on GDAX for instance
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:06:56
Hi, do you know if there`s a fee to move from BTC to pounds/dollars within your coinbase wallet
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:14:17
Where do you suggest 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:38:48
Makes me feel a little less lonely
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:49:38
Don`t know what hodl is... I`m gonna take a guess at "Hold on for dear life"
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:14:43
Wow, you actually have fucked bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:31
Look at the identical dip at 19:44 British time yesterday
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:34:23
What on earth are you all talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:27:20
That`ll be down to me :)

It`s interesting how BTC, Ethereum and Litecoin all bottomed out briefly at exactly the same time.. 7:44PM BST.. strange that.. and they all have identical graphs. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:55:40
Thanks, but not a clue what you just said.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:17:14
Coinbase said the fee for £500 buy is £19.80.. so why did only £475 appear in my account?
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:26:14
Thanks bro

How do you get the funds in and out of GDAX to use
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:10:47
But the maximum you can invest is 500 per week
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:45
Exactly the same.. tis strange

1: If the referendum wasn't legitimate why have the people of Crimea not protested or set up a resistance. It's been a few years now and not a peep.

Who said it was Russian agents. Getting proof would be nice

I think people are getting fed up of crypto. I was in for 4 months had 16 different cryptos. 60% bitcoin. Got totally sick of looking at the price all the time. Feel happier with it just in the bank making a guaranteed £30 a month. I know bitcoin could be £30k by Christmas but I really don't care. Too much playing with my emotions. My mate who got me into crypto also pulled out.

How about war... would you like that?
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:55:36
Go away
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:08:14
I wish mate.. couldn't do it
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:21
I did say ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:23
Remember the greed in December by people jumping in because of FOMO so they could make money.. we're now seeing the mirror image of the greed.. people buying as low as they can, lower and lower.. but all they're doing is destroying their own investment. If they keep going bitcoin won't be worth shit ever again.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:18:39
We were told it would be that by the end of January
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:57:10
That's 4 .. there's 193 countries in the UN

Not many said they did it... Most wanted full investigation and evidence
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:41:37
and a liar

Sell order at 9000 that sent it down again.. explain that one
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:57:54
What do you think we should do to Russia?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:43:31
The small guy will be waiting for 5k to buy some big coin. . But the whales know this, so they'll slow down the drop and start the rise at 5.5k to keep him out.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:32:28
I thought that`s when they started

What's the FUD this time.. is there a faulty cash point in Taiwan
@_date: 2018-03-29 00:21:28
it is if you`ve got £3.5k tied in

1: Russia didn't forcibly take Crimea. There was an election and not one bullet was fired
2: The USA have missiles virtually on the Russian Border.. How would USA like that?
3: If you don`t want war it's best you just keep quiet
4: Did you protest about the 300 people that have been murdered by Islamic terrorism in Europe the past few years or are you more concerned about the health of Russian double agents
5: Russia are not going to invade anyone or exterminate people in concentration camps. Get real
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:21:20
You guys were saying relax at $15k
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:48:40
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:33:43
Did you see that massive sell when it reached $9k.. that's manipulation on a massive scale. It's the only explanation for someone to sell at that point
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:45:57
Then 4k, then 3k then pop
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:14:22
It's interesting that a Bitcoin sub hardly mentions today's news on its main page.. it's as though they don't want to discuss it ($8.9k)
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:11
Good for you then
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:29:28
You'll believe anything.. you'll make a rubbish detective. Why didn't they just shoot him and leave a note

Key time between 16th Feb and 18th Mar

Is today the end of crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:47:13
A dip of $8,000.. that's some dip
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:52
There was lots of them.. on the bounces
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:16:14
Lol. Oh dear
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:45:30
I was thinking long term when investing in crypto.. but seeing as our British prime minister seems to want a world war I need my money now to pay for sand bags, tinned food and a Jeep with enough fuel to drive to New Zealand. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:34:41
But wasting 3 hours of your day looking at the prices and getting grumpy with the family when it goes down
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:43:19
No, you can see this is being manipulated. There's massive sells on an up slope.. panic sellers don't sell on an up slope
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:22
Why would they get out just as it rocketed from 8400 to 9000
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:19:15
I disagree, because these sells happened on the up slope just after it had already reached below 9000. If it was a stop order it would have already taken place.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:56:00
We'd better start buying these cheap coins.. or the 1% will buy them all and burn them
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:39:05
Is this relevant.. from Coinbase.. just wondering..
SegWit compatible Bitcoin sends/receives will be available for customers in the next few weeks
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:10:30
Whoopee, Only to go back to $9,650 12 hours later

Move either way.. it's been going 1 way for a week... Down
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:56:29
There.. did you see. It just tried breaking out from 7500.. as soon as it got to 8200 there was a massive sell to hold it back. That wasn't stop orders
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:34:44
The trade forums are full of total immature fools. They were begging for 8k when it was at 12k because they wanted to "gonna get me some cheap coin woohoo".. now look. They've enticed it to 8k so bad that there's no confidence in the investment so soon it won't be worth dog shit. Well done guys
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:30:08
OK, so why don't they ban them buying cars, furniture, holidays, betting on gambling sites
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:19:50
Where did the daily discussion go?
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:15:50

@_date: 2018-02-06 07:40:58
Everyone don't worry.. someone said very strong support at $50
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:28:54
It's gone well below the 200 day moving average. It's dying guys. Say goodbye to your investment.. for at least 6 - 9 months. May as well go get yourselves a hobby

I've got about 100 Facebook friends.. I'm pretty sure only me and 1 other are in it.

How long is this up-down shit gonna go on for?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:35:29
People were saying that at 14k if I remember, then 12, 11, 10, 9, 8
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:25:20
Will be back to 6.5k in ? mins.. fake bounce
