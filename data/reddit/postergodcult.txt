You don't have you buy bitcoin anonymously it is just one of its features.  Bitcoin emphasizes this feature because it is one of its founding principals.  You can mix your coins and have those anonymously. (ex. joinmarket)

Hey dude it can be tough to get free btc because we all value it so much, but there are some alternatives.  Most poker sites have freerolls nitrogensports.eu has one every hour to win 1mbtc.  Another option to learn more is to use alt coins.  Alt coins usually have bigger faucets so you can deal with whole units.  Also because these other posters are being dicks I'll help ya out if you comment with your address

Yeah I think bovada would be the best one to start accepting.  They are an Indian casino that's run by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission.  They don't fall under Canadian laws and regulations which allows them to operate as they do today.

In response to the volatility coinapult is a good option to lock your btc to usd or any currency.  Also the site could have your balance in usd and transfer to btc upon cashing out.  Gambling on sports is the best, for any amount you choose to bet you can be entertained for hours.

That's why trump is doing so well.  He was amazing on WWE monday night raw for a few weeks.  He body slammed mcmahon and bought raw from him only to sell it back for double and drop money from the roof!  Then in trumps final match it was a loser has to cut their hair and trumps team won so they all cut mcmahons hair it was awesome.
