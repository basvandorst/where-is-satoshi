This is a patent application publication, not a patent. This is what publishes 18 months after the application was filed and has not been approved by the patent office. 
There is nothing wrong with copying disclosure for the specification. A patent must describe the invention but also give context for the invention in the prior art. If someone copies the prior art description for the specification that is OK. What would be improper is to actually claim the prior art.

Good point.  The "inefficient" transactions in this graph include colored coins or other things that represent non-bitcoin value.  Users of these "inefficient" transactions may be willing to pay the highest transaction fees.  
It would be fair for colored coin users to pay higher fees because they are deriving value from the blockchain by putting pressure on the tx limit.  What if transactions below a certain threshold carried a higher fee?  I realize this would push microtransactions and small purchases to Litecoin, but maybe that is not a bad thing if/when bitcoin no longer has the spare capacity?

That's not what you said in the above post. You said they won't risk $6k to get the $15 of fees represented by the last 250 kb of the block. If that is really their reason, then raising the max allowable block size will have no effect on what size they decide to mine. If they don't want to mine 1 MB blocks now because of the orphan problem, why would they want to mine 8 MB blocks?

This is true.  However bad it is when 1MB blocks get full, it will be much worse if we put it off until 20MB blocks are filling up.  Maybe now is the better time to test out the fee market.  So many people are going to want to use a well-defended blockchain in the future.  *See, e.g.*, NYSE's colored coins.  It is inevitable that the blocks will fill up eventually no matter how big we make them.

I am in favor of 21MB blocks, but maybe it would not be the worst idea to let the 1MB blocks fill up first and test out the fee market a little before increasing the block size to 21.  The bitcoin community will learn from it, and there will be time for wallet makers and other to incorporate fee features before the 21 MB blocks start filling up too (probably years until that happens).  If full blocks really do cause complete mayhem, as some are predicting, it would be better to know sooner.

Putting a crypto currency chip in a device certainly can be patented. What prior art is out there? Devices have much higher patentability rates than algorithms implemented on a general purpose computer. 21 is likely filing non-publication requests on their patent applications so the community does not find out about them unless they issue. (Upshot of non-publication requests is that they cannot file outside the U.S. and rely on the filing date of their U.S. Applications)

Maybe their chip is fast and will be able to keep a small trickle going. They probably do not need many satoshis. And they might end up deriving a lot of income from their cut of the mining if the price goes to the moon. So much so that they could generously subsidize devices containing the chip.

Patent applications do not publish until 18 months after they were filed. It is quite likely they filed a patent application because it is a violation of the patent statue to mark the product as patent pending if there is no application on file. 
It all depends on what the patent claims. It could be something extremely narrow or they could be trying to patent multisig like the outfit where Ryan Charles works.

People probably will not use BTC for normal everyday spending if they have to go through what you did.
But my experience would definitely be acceptable to almost anyone with a smartphone.  The idea popped into my head one day "hey let's try bitcoin" after I read about the ATM and the restaurant.  It took virtually no planning ahead.  The ATM sent a verification SMS message to my phone, and 5 seconds later I was scanning a QR code and had 20k bits in my wallet ready to spend.  I think more people will do this as the number of ATMs and merchants grows.

If there was a pool of patents that the owners bought to prevent infringement suits, then anyone who doesn't buy in is a freeloader because he gets the benefit of not being sued while other people pay the cost, i.e., buying the patents.
As an example, see the patent aggregator RPX.

This patent expired on Dec. 31, 2013.  It was filed before June 5, 1996, so it expires 17 years from the issue date rather than 20 years from the filing date as is the case with patents filed after June 5, 1996.  [See MPEP 2701.](  Normally, the 17-years-from-issue rule means the patent expires later than the would under the new scheme, but this one issued the year after it was filed, so it expired earlier.  
The patent was asserted once against a defendant called SSL Networks in the case captioned *Juniper Networks, Inc. v. SSL Services, LLC*, Case No. 4-08-cv-05758 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.  It appears Juniper Networks is the assignee of the patent.

This is correct.  But look how broad claim 1 is.  A method of only three steps.  The first step is generate a bitcoin address with private key.  Second step is get two public addresses, i.e., get two bitcoin addresses.  Nothing revolutionary yet.  Third and final step is make it multi-sig.  This is attempting to claim multi-sig.  How could one use multi-sig and not infringe this claim?

I usually get downvoted for saying this, but there are other crypto currencies out there. 21 could make sha2 and scrypt asics and mine a variety of coins in the devices. Just because Bitcoin has the only secure blockchain today doesn't mean it will remain that way forever. Because you are right, bitcoin will not scale enough even with max sized blocks to do what they are proposing.

That's what happens with a normal fork.  But if some nodes start accepting &gt; 1MB blocks while others do not, then both chains will keep going with each set of nodes rejecting the other chain.

Yep. After one week of using a trezor was when I realized crypto can be brought to the masses. Even if it does look like an MP3 player from 1996, it works flawlessly and is a no-brainer at $100 for anyone holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin.

I think this is right. There are many smart people who think 1MB is better and they will continue mining it after the hard fork. And 1MB blocks do have some advantages over 8MB-maybe Bitcoin original will continue on indefinitely in its own niche. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:07:52
It is not inconceivable that a SHA256 altcoin could come out and draw some hashing power away from bitcoin.  Especially if the altcoin is configured for a specific purpose (smart contract or whatever), and people who want to execute smart contracts start buying whatever token trades on that blockchain to attract hashing power.

This is why I find the hard fork so confusing.  In a two chain scenario, spending pre-fork coins could be recorded in both chains (if the tx ends up in a &lt; 1MB block) or just one chain (if it goes into a &gt; 1MB block).  There is no way to know in advance how big the block will be.

@_date: 2015-07-14 17:49:11
I think this is right. No one is forcing miners to mine huge blocks full of free transactions. Why not let each miner weigh the size of a transaction fee against the added risk that his block gets orphaned if he includes it. Some miners, eg, China will prefer smaller blocks due to their bandwidth bottleneck but Icelanders may not care as much. Each miner chooses for himself what is in his best interest. This is free market decentralization, seems like bitcoins would love it.

HD hardware wallets are what convinced me to buy a substantial amount of BTC. I have Trezor and ledger and love both.  I hope one day this hardware will end up in smart phones and bring crypto to the masses.

My understanding is that quantum computing will break SHA2 cryptography, and probably all other kinds of cryptography too, thus breaking bitcoin.  It will also be the end of privacy in general.

I am starting to question whether increasing the block size now is a good solution.  Maybe it is better to iron out how fees will work on full blocks first, then we can scale up block size.  What if wallets incorporate dynamic fees?  Could be good for miners and users in the long run.
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:27:38
Perhaps.  But they must care how much fiat those coins are worth.

Both trezor and ledger are great options here. OP's mom just has to remember where her pieces of paper with the backup seed are stored. Copies may be stored in multiple locations to reduce risk of loss. And when mom is ready to convert to fiat, it will be easy to send any amount she likes to an exchange.

Go to bitcoinpaperwallet.com and made a few test wallets.  When you buy your first BTC, send small amounts from the online wallet to your paper wallets, and practice sweeping the wallets.  (You can only remove all the coins from a paper wallet, not fractions).  Once you are comfortable with the process, then move your stash to paper.  Just remember to make backup copies!

Suppose SHA2 breaks in the same way. If all miners start guessing nonces that are more likely than random guessing to solve a block, wouldn't the playing field be level and difficulty just adjust up accordingly?  In the alternative, could Bitcoin core simply switch to a new non-broken hashing algorithm?

You make a good point in your post.  But one problem with the example of the bread is that in 1914 the loaf was probably baked according to traditional methods, and in 2012 it was some industrial piece of shit pumped out by a factory in under four minutes.  It doesn't change your main point, but the two loaves are not the same.  (This is why I bake all my bread at home).

Yeah I thought I read somewhere that they sent Ross faked photos of Curtis' death to lead him to believe they carried out the hit.  Just like when Hank took the fake death photos of Jesse to send to Walt.

But doesn't it have a candlestick chart on the price graph?  Scrolling on the order book would be a nice change.
Limit orders are supported--you can place a buy or sell order at any price.

Bitcoin is a nonfunctional currency wtf?  They why can you buy sell and trade it?
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:14:21
No reason to sell them all at once; they could sell a few hundred per day until they run out.  Just seems like little effort to ensure they are getting fair market value.  It's not like they took possession of real estate or personal property that is not fungible and widely traded on an open market.  
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:53:25
Ouch you fucked up there.

Sure but there are still many people living in unstable countries with at least some savings. OP is saying it would be advisable for them to have some BTC.

Why not do it in small batches and wait to send the next set of coins until the USD from selling the prior batch is withdrawn?

does this work for the exchange or just their broker service?
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:54:58
Cool. Does anyone here have one?
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:27:38
Would someone explain what this number means?  My understanding is that the miners are looking for a nonce such that the SHA2 hash of the header starts with a predetermined number of zeros.  If they find a nonce close enough, then that block is considered solved.  How does 44 billion factor into this?
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:31:53
I really like his 30 days series, especially the one where the hunter from North Carolina goes to live with the animal rights activists in LA.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:38:36
It makes sense that the transactions do not effect the required hash of the header.  
Maybe was it the case here that the winning node found the right nonce to hash the header really fast after receiving the previous block, and no transactions had yet been broadcast since the last block?

I used bitcoinpaperwallet.com and really liked it. You can buy the cool stickers to make them tamper proof but it is free to just print a wallet. I print two copies of each wallet and store them in separate locations. Not a bad idea to print one out and practice sending a small amount to it and then taking it off.
Good luck with your hodlings!

Stupid question: why are they auctioning them in big blocks like this?  Why not just sell them on the open market on exchanges?

Great podcast. Very interesting to hear andreas' thoughts on Greece. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:09:17
Everything said in this thread is true under current conditions. 
But what happens if 51% of miners agree to fork the bitcoin client and increase the coinbase transaction, i.e., the reward for solving a block?  They would reject any blocks that contain block rewards on the current schedule, and their blockchain would become the largest.
What if, in 50 years, the world economy has come to depend heavily on bitcoin, and the miners realize they have the world by the balls.  Who could stop an international bitmining union from continuing to pump out coins in excess of 21M?

My idea was for them to do it slowly over time instead of all at once.

Is that really what would happen?  What if the Bitcoin Foundation or Lighthouse or whoever has control of the code most people use change it?

Well yeah if you've got a coinbase account then use that and pay 0 fees.

People use buy/sell for other currency exchanges, e.g."I sold Euros and bought dollars on my way back to the US."

Despite looking like a hick, the hunter actually turned out to be a pretty open-minded guy, and ended up agreeing to participate in protests against inhumane factory farming practices.  Some of the vegan animal rights people were total jerks to him because he ate meat, but he always kept his cool and ended up looking like the good guy.  
I always keep that guy in mind when I try to remember to act respectfully and say my opinion without being a jerk when I talk to people who  seem crazy to me.
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:01:12
I guess I was thinking with a present-day mindset where BTC is not exchangeable for most goods or services I buy.  BTC will probably be accepted for a lot more than it is now by the time I am 80, so I guess I could modify my plan to "spend 1 BTC" every year on my b-day.

Just wondering, what is good about the hash rate going up?
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:15:31
I think it is great.  Simple but good looking interface.  You can buy bitcoin and have it available in your coinbase wallet in seconds.  
Currently no fees but will change to 0.75% for removing liquidity and no cost for bringing liquidity.
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:39:49
What is the difference?

I like the coin base vault. There is a 48 hour waiting period during which any pending withdrawals can be cancelled and they email and txt you repeatedly to give you a chance to stop it. Also withdrawals must be approved by two separate email addresses. 
It feels safe from scammers but you are still trusting coinbase not to lose your coins or get robbed. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:48:43
Why can't the private keys be in cold storage?  User can check his vault's pub key balance on the blockchain.
