And this is 100% accurate because you are... an expert/insider?

You're saying that *this* incident won't happen *again*?

I think there was some miscommunication.
It's one thing to say: "diversify your investments, *perhaps* consider bitcoin"
&amp; it's another thing to say: "buy bitcoin, bitcoin is a good investment"
It's a shill statement, which is like being in the year 1997 and saying things like, "Limited Edition Beanie Babies are a good investment" 
Personal finance deals with a general scope of management. ~~Bitcoin~~ Cryptocurrencies, real estate, works of art, precious metals, etc. all carries a degree of risk when it comes to investment.
If you want to help your argument, consider boiling it down to how it's a financial tool that'll benefit someone 20-maybe-30 years down the line.
I know it's exciting that bitcoin reached $5k in value; but give some basic idea to what drives those figures and why it'll remain at such a high value over time.
Also, considering how cryptocurrency exchange-participation can drive the value of bitcoin even higher; it's misleading to what you're saying. It boils down to intent. 
If you want more people buying bitcoin as an investment, for the sole reason to keep the $5k valuation or to increase the value further, then it's malicious - it's a pump &amp; dump for you and you profit while others lose out. 
Just reconsider your wording and intent of your message.
