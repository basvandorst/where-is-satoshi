Why would Ethereum suddenly not be a blockchain anymore. Blockchains aren't completely immutable and a blockchain doesn't have to be.
Any blockchain is forkable, which means they're not completely immutable, Bitcoin has been forked years ago, Erhereum has been forked, both are still block chains.
Now I'm not saying that the Ethereum bailout hardfork was just, but I'm just saying that it is still a Blockchain, a blockchain that's in control of a small group of people, unlike Bitcoin. Now there's also Ethereum Classic, the non hardforked ethereum, which is also a blockchain that's not in control of a small group of people, although it's not as popular as Bitcoin.

Both are quite trustworthy I’d say. I trust the USD to lose value over time, and BTC to gain value over time until a certain level, which is far above the current.

@_date: 2017-02-28 08:57:59
Don't say it could go to "0". It's practically unrealistic. Such a thing wouldn't even happen if all countries in the world banned it and it was hardforked every week.
It's probably just as likely as USD to reach 0, I guess I couldn't call it impossible, just extremely extremely unlikely.
10000$ however is completely realistic (even in a relatively short period) and so shouldn't be "equated" to the chance of going to 0.

Why would it be be unusable in India?
They call sell it for usd and Rupees, locally and online. They can put it on a bitcoin debit card that immediately converts it to USD or rupees. There are a few companies that do accept bitcoin. It can be used to store money, better than storing bank notes below your bed. It can be used to send it over seas for very cheap. There's lots of uses for Bitcoin in India.

The majority isn't drugs buyers lol. Sure many people use bitcoin to buy drugs, but the majority of bitcoin users are either tech fans or money fans.
And even if it was mostly drugs buyers, the number of drugs users is growing, the human population is growing, the number of people with internet access is growing and the number of people who grow up with internet is growing. To me these are signs that it's very likely that bitcoin will have a much bigger user base. But not only that, it's also likely that there will be billionaires who will simply realize that Bitcoin, unlike any physical currency is deflationary, the opposite of inflationary, what reduces the value of the biggest currencies slowly. ( 1$ USD in 1960 is worth 8$ today)
It's likely that there will be some competition to get as many bitcoins as possible before the price raises to extreme levels. And that billionaires and others can work together to simply pump up the price and not let it fall, therefor creating value for everyone who holds, and if many of them work together and simply stop selling too cheap, value is created.
This thing kinda happened with Gold, but there's one big difference with Gold. Not only is gold somewhat inflationary, more gets found/mined everyday. There's also octillion tonnes of gold in our galaxy. What if In  20 years a company like SpaceX starts mining asteroids and find lots of gold, and they find a way to cheaply send it to earth. Then suddenly there's so much gold that people with value less. So like for pretty much everything that's spendable, the supply is inflationary, but not for bitcoin. No matter how big the universe is, how far you go to search for bitcoins. There will always be slightly less than 21 million, and every who dies and takes their private key with them or simply lost it will reduce the supply even more. And the more people realize this, the more people will expect a price rise and it will become a self fulfilling prophecy.

There are several exchanges that have margin funding, in which you can lend out your bitcoins for around 0.02-0.08% per day. Because of cumulative interest, this could give you over 10% (slightly less if interest is lower, which happens if bitcoin is pumping) more bitcoins a year. If Bitcoin price rises not only do you have 10% more bitcoins in one year, your bitcoins are also worth more.
An exchange that offers this is Bitfinex. Of course it's always a risk to trust an exchange with your coins. But even after a hack Bitfinex has been pretty reasonable and they're a legal company. 
You can also  just hold on to it in a hardware or paper wallet, which is safer but of course no extra interest, just the price increase of bitcoin.
A third option is leverage trading. You might think bitcoin goes up. And you could use your bitcoin as a margin and trade x5 as much. Or maybe it is now high and you think it's going down, you can short it x5 and if it goes down 5% you ear 25% bitcoins, but be careful, leverage trading is extra risky and being liquidated isn't fun.
The safest is simply holding on to it. The easiest more profitable way is just lend it out with margin funding (on Bitfinex FFR and auto renew function are very useful), the hardest but possibly the most profitable is leverage trading.

Look let's say that 40% of a purchases are drugs ( I think it's lower), Then it's still not the majority of bitcoin users. There's nothing wrong with it either, it's good. And there's more on the black market than drugs too, but yeah out of all products I guess drugs is the most, but if we look at bitcoin users, most people use it for something else, for example trading, holding, sending it to other people etc 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:43:39
I didn't say hahahahaaha that's not important, I think it's a big thing for bitcoin, but it's not like the majority of bitcoins are used for drugs. And the majority of bitcoin USERS don't buy drugs.
Bitcoin is often used as a store of value, to send money overseas, to trade, and also simply for shopping online. When I order food, 80% of the time I use bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:44:44
They actually put a limit on it later? But I think it won’t be used as digital gold, maybe more like digital oil.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:36:33
I think 0$  or 1 million $ are much more likely. Such a thing would only happen if bitcoin was cracked or the supply inflated by billions.
There will always be believers and holders so that it will stay above 1000$ on this point, but if that doesn’t hold for some interesting reason it will crash to 0 and not to 0.01$

I think Bitcoin can best be compared to gold, a great store of value. Although I think bitcoin will be a superior store of value. Looking at the marketcap of gold, bitcoin would be around 500000$ with that cap, but with a growing: world population, world economy global internet access, knowledge about bitcoin and how to buy it, services around bitcoin, financial investment and leverage services and the loss of individual bitcoins of dead people and forgotten wallets it might far exceed the marketcap of gold in the future.
I don’t know how to accurately value it, I can only estimate the order of magnitude, which will be around 200000$-5 million $
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:35:58
Why would they need billions of dollars for 30 million (extra) tether. They’re a huge bitcoin exchange, surely they have enough bitcoins to pay for the USD if necessary. Unless BTC suddenly crashes a shitlaod they won’t have a problem at all, they’re probably making more than 30 million in just trading fees.
But I doubt BTC will lose more than 60% of its value, so they’re safe.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:04
I mean the price of gold, if it wasn’t a store of value, so if there was infinite gold and it was used for jewelry and machines and computers, would be magnitudes of orders less than the value now, so maybe it’s significant in statistics, maybe it’s 5% if it’s total value, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessary to be a store of value, it really doesn’t matter much for its store of value price whether it’s 0%, 1% or 10%, the majority is from speculation, hoarding and its financial history
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:42:17
You should look into Iconomi then, they also allow people to make their own funds/DAA choosing their own included coins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:40:00
And yet I think far more people will consider buying bitcoins than gold. Especially in developing nations.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:32:42
What do you mean Not smart? You mean risky?
It was smart to buy bitcoin before this, maybe it’s still smart to buy bitcoin right now. The demand is still growing, even if it is speculative demand.
I made more money in a year than I would working for 8, and I’m a 21 year old student, I know it’s mostly luck, but it wasn’t not smart to realize bitcoin was extremely undervalued considering the onviously growing global demand and repeating booms and busts.
And people will not consider us not smart when buying now and bitcoin goes to 500000$, as many experts claim it will for a good reason.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:09:55
Why do you even think 9000$ is a lot?
I think bitcoin will one day be at least 100000$, as many experts agree, so I consider it still cheap.
I do believe a huge short term correction can come but that doesn’t mean it’s not gonna go higher next time.
I keep hearing people saying 9000$ is too much but what do they base this on? There’s only 21 million bitcoins, it’s fucking cheap, just 9000 to get one out of 21 million.
I actual might sell some soon, not because I think it’s overvalued but because I want to buy more when weak hands panic.
So I wonder, why do you think 9000$ is a lot, do you compare it to something, like stocks? Berkshire Hathaway stock is much more expensive and like bitcoin they don’t issue more shares anymore, as bitcoin won’t issue more bitcoin after 21 million.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:14:34
Don’t forget that the world population, the world economy and USD supply are growing relatively fast.
The poorest and richest are getting richer, the USD is loding value over time and technically a store of value needs less money pumped into it than Its value Will Be, as long as people consider it a fair price.

But wouldn’t in a situation with 10 hours or more blocktime create a huge incentive for the community to agree on a hardfork to change the difficulty (and or mining algorithm), even allowing some upgrades in the mean time 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:05:30
Crypto might be infinite, that’s why he global community will choose one or a few coins to be a store of value, not all of them. It’s likely that bitcoin will be one, but if not bitcoin it’s likely it’s another cryptocurrency, but even then bitcoin might still be an extra store of value and still reach 20% of gold markets cap right now 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:21:11
It’s not just the first, it’s also one that is distributed pretty much the best, the one that already has extremely rich and powerful people holding it, it also works fine, maybe slower than others but that can probably be upgraded and isn’t that important for a store of value.
It also already has lots of “brand” recognition, growing financial markets.
It moght take decades for a superior coin in speed, safety and cheap transaction fees to catch up, by then bitcoin as a store of value will not panicsell to another currency.

Doesn’t mean he used it. It’s a common whale tactic to fake support. That way prople think he will suddenly buy 50000 BCH or more in one go and they will  buy BCH before it arrives, meanwhile he already put his BCH sell orders and will sell some more. Then he just slowly withdraws from the exchange again. Probably had a special insurance deal with the exchange that he’ll get most of 25000 even if the exchange is hacked.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:04:35
That’s the great part. Bitcoin is much more accessible than gold, so it will probably overtake gold in marketcap at some point because even poorer people and regular people can invest some in it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:40:45
But in a huge crash bitcoin wouldn’t lose 80% of its value, and if a competitor loses less it will likely recover slower than bitcoin.
But I do think it’s possible but I think there will be a good chance that bitcoiners will be able to buy any upcoming competitor much faster than others, so betting on bitcoin is still wise. I have some other cryptocurrencies and don’t think one exists that will overtake it, but who knows one day, I think it’s not very likely though because of how it will be distributed, if it spikes above bitcoin in one day it’s likely that most of the supply is hold by a elite 0.01%, which doesn’t mean it will crash but it might motivate others to keep to bitcoin.
But even if there is one, I think bitcoin would coexist and that maybe it would be 2nd or 3th most valuable and it can still become worth more than gold. 
But right now I think it’s far more likely bitcoin stays ahead for decades. And I doubt it will be as easy for another cryptocurrency to be talked about everyday in the media even if it would surpass the price at one point.
What cryptocurrency do you think is most likely though?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:00
Diamonds are artificially inflated in price thanks to patents and an almost monopoly.
Not sure about opec though. But that still doesn’t mean that something completely different than those two, gold isn’t mostly priced because of its store of value use.
Diamonds are rapidly decreasing in price now that they can relatively easily be made by compressing and they weren’t even a real store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:49:15
I think a lot of speculators, including me, are betting on that on one point, bitcoin will be used as Safehaven, will be less volatile than be right now, and like gold will keep gaining value over time, safe from inflation. But since it’s still in it’s early stage, and even more scarce than gold, it will grow much faster than gold at least for a while.
We don’t even need stores to accept bitcoin to achieve this, but I often order food in BTC, maybe I should have just hodled though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:49:13
Golds intrinsic value is insignificant and irrelevant to its price, most of the price is because it’s used as store or value and speculative investment.
It doesn’t matter if the intrinsic value is 100$ or 0$ of the price is 1200$.
A store of value doesn’t need other properties, but bitcoin has many things on gold, easily transactable and divisible, more scarce and easier bought and sold.

I’ve heard about it. It also often called the NO ARBITRAGE theory or something like that.
I believe it’s true for most stocks and companies, for the housing market and pretty much most markets, but there are exceptions, for example highly volatile scarce cryptocurrencies to which most investors are warned for and there’s no consensus on how it could be valued. 
But even with stocks it’s only partly true.

What if I believe 12 months ago it was extremely undervalued? Most people never heard of it before or if they did would just blindly believe it’s a scam or worthless. The market is extremely inefficient for bitcoin because most people don’t know how to value it, most rich people are too busy or old to learn how to work, most people in the world haven’t even heard of it and people are still scared of new technology that is volatile in price.
Now it’s getting closer to its real value, but it will take a decade or two to get truly close to it.

You honestly believe that if gold wasn’t used as store of value the price of jewelry stayed the same? Jewelry’s would buy more and more and sell more and more for cheaper, and with a lower prices the demand of jewelry increases. 
There would be tons of gold aviable that would normally sit safe in safe, now destroying the market price.
But what do you think gold would be worth if no one ever bought it ever to sell it for more, to escape inflation and if gold derivatives wouldn’t exist? Do you honestly believe 1 oz would still be worth more than 1000$?

@_date: 2017-09-05 05:24:05
That's just bullsjit. No one can predict it perfectly, but it's safe to assume bitcoin won't just go to 0, unless some quantum computing or better makes the whole system useless, which can't just happen tomorrow.

That’s still not a bubble. Bubble has to go up in value a lot and then suddenly pop. Fiat doesn’t go up in value much, and sometimes there’s a lot of inflation which can cause a chain reaction of panic and more inflation, which imo isn’t the same as a bubble popping.
But bitcoin is a nice escape from monetary inflation.
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:53:12
People seem confused. Normally when a split happens the value of bitcoin should go down. Last time there was a split + segwit. It could be possible that segwit caused the price to go up, because segwit can be considered an upgrade.
With bitcoin gold there is no upgrade for BTC. It is still going up though because people expect the same, but after it forks it will likely go down unless there’s another reason for it to go up.
The 2X fork however is more dangerous.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:52:13
But the chance is less than 1 %, even if 85% of the miners are mining the new chain. The old chain will still be called BTC, has most users and institutions, has the most money backing it and quickly regain the miners that mine for profit.

200$ isn’t that much so if you want to buy more bitcoins next month it wouldn’t be stupid to leave the 200$ for a month, this might save some fees.

I agree that Trump would be a terrible president, but Atleast he isn't rigging elections and being bought and he even has a plan to make the government less corrrupt. He doesn't sound like a racist to me (Mexicans, Muslims and immigrants aren't races), maybe a slightly sexist, but then again, all heterosexual and homosexuals discriminate on sex, but he is very ignorant about the world, which is a big problem, but I rather have a complete idiot than an election rigging powerhungry corrupt warmonger as president. And when he says he wants to make America great, I believe he truly wants to do that, even if he has no clue how to do it, he seems to really want to.

It's actually very profitable because of the bullmarkets. As they're so cheap they'll rise more in % than bitcoin. Most of them are shit but some are promising and therefor can go up a lot, for example Ethereum has some real world value and went up much more % than bitcoin this year. It's nice how there's a whole mini currency  economy around bitcoin now, I think it even adds to bitcoins value.

But I just don't see the big difference between a government (a group of people and a system)
And a bitcoin user base and system willing to always exchange it. I think it's more likely that the US government fails then that all bitcoin users suddenly stop wanting to buy bitcoin (not saying the price can't fall to below 100$)
I disagree that something is only worth something if you can use it, I think it's worth something if you can sell it too, this is why Shares of companies without dividends are worth money.
And bitcoin isn't even like that, it's actual money, you can buy goods with it, you can actually buy lots of things with it (not just drugs) and I do it quite often.
If you have thousands of bitcoins when the bubble hasn't crashed yet you're rich, regardless of whether it will crash tomorrow or next week or never. Same as with stocks. The richest people in the world own more value in stocks than in fiat, they're still considered the richest and when their stocks gain value they're considered even richer.
I'm not saying to never sell, but it doesn't matter if a bubble can burst or not, if you could sell it any time you have that money. I would agree if there was no liquidity though, if you were actually unable to sell at the price you think you can, then I guess technically you can't. But right now, if you have 1000 bitcoins, you can sell whenever you want, you are a millionaire whether you sell it or hold onto it, maybe you won't be a millionaire next month, but right now you're still a millionaire.

And Satoshi's wallet might be lost too, that leaves only 20 million BTC for potentially hundred of billions of humans or even more in the future

So the only difference is taxes? 
So if you don't pay taxes you're not making money???

Just use a high fee and avoid wallets that won't let you decide the fee yourself, it shouldn't take more than an hour with a reasonable fee in green on bitcoinfees.21.co 
But yeah the fees are becoming too high so we really could use some segwith with bigger blocks

If they're gonna short it, surely the community will try hard to short squeeze them.

Sure, some of they will. But the majority of miners will switch to the 2MB fork, which causes both chains to slow down, but the slower chain to slow down much more, causing others to switch to the faster chain, causing the difference to get bigger. I like Ethereum the difficulty adjustment is a very slow process that can take weeks if bitcoin is slowed down.

There will be a hardfork, it's just not certain how many people will support it and so the bigger chain will be unknown. But unless exchanges refuse to list it, it's likely the segwit2X fork will survive because it will have more miners and not be extremely slowed down.

There's no other resource of which no new units can be created or gained, blockchain cryptocurrencies are the only ones I can think of and that gives them a special edge, especially towards other currencies.
But why would it lose its meaning if there's no inflation?
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:44:58
Why are so many people against Segwit2x? It seems like a reasonable compromise that will deliver the best fees and transaction speed (no more transactions  lag for at least  a few years)
There's no dangerous miner advantage like bitcoin unlimited, so what's the big problem with this one? Both sides get something they want and the fees will go down..

Let's just build some jobs somewhere else then and create a new big financial city full of jobs for young people.

The price won't plummet much, it we'll never be high in the first place. It probably starts around 0.15 and goes to 0.1 BTC

Put people offer it always so it's already worth something and so if the price of the island goes up I'm making money even if I wait to sell. 
And this isn't an island, this is bitcoin, I buy stuff with bitcoins every month and it's not illegal drugs.

The fed should just create more money and invest it into younger people, maybe by making education better and cheaper. Maybe by helping new businesses. Maybe with a small basic income.
Yes the value of $USD will go down, but that's a good thing now that there is easy ways to safe havens and so much income inequality.

Why? And why would this be scientific? This has almost nothing to do with science.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:14:46
You can overdo it. But Twitter has become a useful place to communicate with communities, about science, technology and everything. He isn't trying to debate on twitter but just shows his opinion. Ntwrk is a fine short and isn't cringed like scnce

Governments are groups of people. Some governments are better than others, but most governments print more money every year and deflate the value of their currencies.
Bitcoin users/holders/miners/traders are also groups of people, all together, all over the world they're willing to buy your bitcoin if the bitcoin price goes down. Many of them believe the price will go up, and it will go up, partly because they believe it and partly because demand is simply still growing.
Why should I trust a government over an growing international community?

What do you mean hastingly? It's been over a year that this debate has been going on. Lots of tests and analysis have been made and it's clear that 2MB or even better 4MB would reduce fees and increase transaction speed generally. Do we need it? Only if we want to scale, which in most people their eyes is very important.
Segwit is a nice addition but blocksize is more important
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:34:40
Less so but still some. The blocktime is so much faster that it's far less noticeable, but if ETH goes to 2000€ you'll notice higher fees too. The blockchain will also be much larger in size which shouldn't be a problem.
Won't be a problem for a while unless smart contracts spam the network
