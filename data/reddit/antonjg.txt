can you sell by emt transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:25:44
Whats with all the begging posts lately? Go out there, get a job and earn it. Some got lucky, some didn't. Think about it, if you had bitcoin would you be sending beggars money? Don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:37
could very well be someone that bought thousands of bitcoin when they were like a penny, thats also a possibility
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:02:34
how could he hypothetically cash it out?

Buy a hardware wallet, either a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor.
Check out their websites for more info, and pick the one you think is best for you!
I personally have the Nano S and love it!
Ledger: 
Trezor:

IRS? Is that an exchange? /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:54:09
Interested, don't forget Canada in it!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:33:48
I believe GDAX to ledger should have no fees, but don't quote me on it. Fees are really high ATM so I would recommend just keeping it on Coinbase if it's not the biggest amount and if GDAX does not have free transaction

Because people are new to crypto and think that 1k crashes are the end of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:42:00
I like the 2 cent discount, appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:25:36
Who's man is this 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:11:45
Are you wanting a mobile, desktop, or paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:17
Just curious, what position of wealth would someone be in to send 37btc?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:33:52

Yea its called growing a pair
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:50
Good, simple wallet to hold small amounts in.
Look into a hardware wallet once you have a decent amount of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:47:07
Do you have a 12 word seed you wrote down somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:01
You ever get back that 20k bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:23:03
What a great person, beyond generous.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:17:52
Breadwallet is very simple to use, don't use coinbase as a wallet, you don't technically own your bitcoin on there
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:43:52
Thank you very much! 
Merry Christmas everybody!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:08:28
this isnt r/incels
lol its banned
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:23
Last time I checked, paper was not a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:06:57
If you have the seed words you can input them into a new wallet and you should be able to get your bitcoin back. 
Find a wallet that supports it and once you input them it should recover them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:01:07
and what exactly do we do with the b2x? I don't like having two balances
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:40:07
I mean it would be cool to get people to tell their story and how much they have, but most people rather keep it under wraps and not risk it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:50:24
You're one of the few that don't have to say you regret not getting in earlier, big ups to you man. I hope Bitcoin has done wonders for you 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:26:44
I'm from Canada, can't use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:09:32
How is he "mining" on his phone, what app?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:42
to be honest its a little scary, bought my first bit of bitcoin 2 days ago and now this whole mess unfolds, must of came in during the wrong time haha
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:13:04
congrats man
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:40:55
It's already starting to dip again, I'll say 10k in a couple days.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:08:14
Upvoted, gl man
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:26:57
" IT HIT 10K ON bitc0iNPR1ce.ru.ca.com!!!!""
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:10:58
And the recovery seed is the 20 ish words you write down right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:46:24
Thanks for a good answer, this is what I meant by saying stats, an educated guess.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:55:21
Stolen by "hackers"
Do your own research though and make a conclusion yourself. 
If you have Netflix, Banking on Bitcoin is a good doc that you can watch that explains it a bit more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:25:06
thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:47:01
best bet is to buy a whole bitcoin now and give or take a few years when it reaches 1 mill hopefully, ta da, you're a millionaire 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:50:29
Can you explain dollar cost average for me? Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:45:12
I bought a ledger nano s, is that ok to keep a couple hundred dollars worth in?
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:29:06
I can't use Gdax!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:32
Exactly what I based my question on haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:24:20
Does it have anything to do with just creating an account? Would it help if I purchased through the mobile app
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:27:27
Then I would say sell when you think the time is right, I'd say give it another day then sell
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:08:27
Thanks for the help!
Can you explain what a wallet is though and how it works? Is it just a storage space basically? How would I transfer money from my coin base account to my wallet? 
And why isn't coinbase a wallet? It says that my BTC are  in my "BTC Wallet"
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:06:48
I use Coinbase without any problems.
Watch Banking on bitcoin, its on netflix and youtube, it can help you get started if you don't wanna read a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:18
ledger, love mine
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:02:48
Do you have the chrome app? That's where it shows your balance. Search it up on YouTube there's some great guides 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:20:15
doesn't matter, take em to quadriga when you're ready
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:10:42
Can you explain a paper wallet? I know a key is given when making one but how do you access the wallet online? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:38:11
Where can a Canadian sell bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:43:08
Satoshis love child
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:54:48
Yea it can seem like that, but I don't think your balance shows if you don't have the ledger plugged in, so your coins are on the ledger. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:59:10
That's awesome, how long does something like this take? And is it fully scannable?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:23:51
Yep called them and let it go through, thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:13:29
The thing is though that it gets cancelled immeidiately. Do i need to create an new address within the site for the money to go into?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:58:58
you get the jist, its stuck in this price range
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:36:46
put as much as you can afford to lose, number 1 rule
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:48:16
doesn't help thinking about it, think to the future, we're still in it early.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:14:41
As long as the box doesn't look tampered with or off in anyway, I highly doubt the ups guy or whatever it comes in tampered with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:50:30
Hypothetically, could you cash out all your bitcoins in local deals like bitcoin for actual cash and not pay taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:46:00
The amount of bitcoin you bought lets say: 0.01 will stay the same but the value will go up, because the price went up as well. Once you buy it the amount of bitcoin is locked in, the price goes up though
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:13
Yo one sec lemme go ask the future 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:41:01
His loss, he'll be crying when it reaches a crazy price.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:08
9k to 10k in a couple days would be crazy, but I think its gonna dip for a bit then go back up, sit tight and get some sleep!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:52:31
850,000 bitcoins
You know there's something called google right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:30
What do you mean by genuine? I ordered mine from the official website 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:40:51
When you keep coins on a exchange, they are NOT YOURS. 
You are basically telling the exchange what to do with them but unless you have your own private wallet, they are not yours.
If the exchange ever shuts down, you also lose all your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:34:03
Not sure you're gonna get people telling you their net worth
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:17
What do you mean by rally? new to btc in general
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:23:58
You broke the rules already lmao, only put in as much as you can afford to lose 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:37:39
This is awesome man! Have a great holiday and all the best for the new years!
