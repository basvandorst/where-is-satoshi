**Come on BULLS**
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:23:32
Let's hope the $7,300 support doesn't break. I still keep HODLing despite this dump and waiting to buy some more when the time feels right. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:14:46
there might be another rally upward, we just have to wait and see what ASIA decides to do.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:00:23
next resistance level is at $9,800 for those asking and wondering.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:34:24
Who else is hodling despite the dump on the weekend? Raise your hand -_-/
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:01:22
Just hit 9,500 in tradingview
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:55:37
Here we go guys. Don't be surprise to see big pumps during consensus 2018.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:23:56
He bought it!
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:25:06
Well just bought .0385 of BTC. If it keeps dipping, I'm buying more :) but definitely not selling my btc. My goal is to have 1 full btc by this year so every dip I buy to increase my portfolio.  
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:45:53
Does anyone else have a wife that gets mad every time you buy bitcoin or is it just mine? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:10:50
Same here bro.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:02:18
Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:08:30
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:25:52
First time seeing this happen. Is this usual?
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:16:01
Well I have been buying all the dips and HODLing and now I finally have 0.5 BTC. My goal is to have a full BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:25:35
I keep buying large amounts of BTC every time it gets around the $6,000-$6,200 range. I keep accumulating because I know where the blockchain technology is going :).
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:55:38
Only like $1,700 at the current price.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:07:15
That is the plan
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:58:51
Have $2k to spend in crypto. Would you guys get in right now or wait a couple more hrs?
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:27:40
Cool, my goal is to have at least a full BTC by the end of the year. Keep us posted when you achieve the 2 BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:03:09
we closed the 4 hour candle below the 0.236 Fib retracement ($6,890 was the target). Not enough volume at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:16:57
Good time to buy or wait for Asia to wake up?
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:20:16
Be on the lookout for these key resistance points:
$9,200 if we break it look for the $9,800 resistance and if we break that as well next point of resistance will be $11,200.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:45:07
this is based on prior resistance points from nov 2017 to now.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:31:36
Just bought .0404 of BTC to bring it more down. You're welcome guys! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:26:53
In my chart I use the Ichimoku cloud, RSI, volume, supporting lines, and a couple trend lines.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:15:57
Waiting for the $8,000 dip to buy some more. Anyone else on the same page?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:09:48
"Crow your coins"
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:43:11
Based on my TA and MA analysis.

You and the person receiving the gift play rock, paper, scissors and the loser pays the tax. You're welcome.

Me this morning (literally):
- Woke up at 5:30am for work
- drove to work sleepy AF and was wondering why I even came to work in the first place
- Got to work, turned on the computer, open the necessary programs, and opened an internet window
- Went into coinmarketcap hoping to see BTC in the $6,900-$7,100 range still
- saw $7,700 range, reloaded the page to make sure it was showing the correct price, pinched myself to make sure I wasn't in a dream, and researched why the sudden pump
- well in conclusion the sleepiness went away in a quickness and I'm more energetic to work now :)
-The End
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:39:52
As long as we don't fall below the $7,800 range (resistance), we should be good. IMHO this drop was due to people taking profits and a correction in BTC price.  
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:13:16
Si señor ahorita se la mando
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:39:51
One minute of silence for him and all the rest of the guys that missed this rise (sigh)
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:18:59
Yes more precise in the Ventura County
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:35:38
Asia better not let us down. We already did our part.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:55:38
Guys make sure you wear your seatbelt in case we head to the moon :). Nice to see some green in the market. Hang tight.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:33:32
What do you guys think about this? Future of Crypto payments in retail markets.
 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:53:28
I apologize for not including any research Mike. I will try and add as much research as possible in my next story to satisfy your needs. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:03:07
Tiny dump to $9,200 which was expected since we can't always keep going up. (correction taking place)
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:06:11
Good morning everyone, just got to work and saw we have passed the $9,300 mark. Very nice to see, next resistance/test level at $9,800. Keep hodling especially with the upcoming meeting which we'll see big money come into the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:17:22
That escalated quickly from $8,059 to $8,285 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:36:23
Just bought .03270172 of BTC since I don't think we're falling out of the 9,000 mark. If we do, well I'll just buy some more :). My goal is to have one full bitcoin before 2018 ends. Wish me luck.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:46:37
Coincidence? Cover-up? Who knows lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:30:50
I was looking at the coinmarketcap website. When I hit refresh it showed $8,285.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:09:54
Here's my prediction for the month of May:
We are going to see institutional money come into the crypto space as well as millionaires. We can expect this around the 2nd-3rd week of May especially due to the consensus taking place in New York.
 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:34:21
See link for further details on the meeting:
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:53:54
Time to place an order for a Lambo or not yet?
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:24:53
Time to strap-on and see where it takes us.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:07:30
Good morning everyone, just arrived to work and it is nice to see that we are above $9,300. Hopefully, we see some more ppl buy more btc especially since today is payday. I receive a bonus today so might put some of the money on crypto. Also, I hope we get to 10k by the weekend and hold it there in order for us to go above the $10k mark next week. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:21:21
One minute of silence to this guy and all the other weak hands who have sold.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:21:23
We'll be above that in no time. People on the west coast still in the process of waking up. Expect an uptrend by 9am or 10am pst.
