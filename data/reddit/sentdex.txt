Honest and valuable business...created with the specific task for slowly separating people from their currency? Even they knew that they needed to keep this guy playing so he could finally lose the funds back to the system, and that was part of what did them in. A system created to game the people got gamed.

"Any information that leads to the return of the coins from this incident will be greatly rewarded."
Gambling website, specifically coded and created for the sole purpose of slowly scheming bettors out of a sliver of their wealth at a time to slowly separate people from their currency, feels they deserve coins back when their system fails them. Part of the reason you lost so much was because of your admitted desire to keep that guy betting so he would lose it back to the system ASAP, you just didn't know you had a leaky bucket at the time.
Absolutely ironic. 
I am all for having the existence of gambling websites like this... but you cannot really think you "deserve" the coins back. They played the system under the rules you set. Had they hacked the wallet or something, sure, those are your coins, but no, your scheming system got schemed. Those coins simply don't belong to you anymore.
You and your developers just learned a very valuable lesson, and it will make your company better in time.

Making GUIs look pretty is the easy part. There's a reason why UI/UX people are paid much less than the actual back-end engineers. 
Aesthetics are important... but the actual functionality is more important. Open source from the beginning is important. Actually solving problems before taking $20 million worth of bitcoin is important. Having hard proof of the solved problems matters much.

Bitcoin itself is still in beta. We're talking about the trading platform here. Why aren't all exchanges saying they are all in "beta" phases? There's a major difference between the good being in a "Beta" stage and the actual platform it's being traded on in "Beta."

I do not support my tax money going towards jailing this guy. What the heck. He's so clearly not needing to be removed from society. 
I understand punishments for laundering money, but the punishment should fit the crime. The guy laundered money out of greed to make money. You fine him significantly more money than he made and you move on.

Well, if the current "plummet" of price is going to be based on the reasoning that two pools could work together, then this should have happened long ago. It's happening right now because one single pool hit over 50% for a brief period. Sure, it is worrying, but, if it is based on two pools working together, then the timing sure is pretty odd. I don't think that's everyone's thinking who is selling off right at this very moment.

Nice narrative. Too bad it doesn't play out realistically. You gave away too many identifying characteristics about yourself that, given your lack of proof and supposed secrecy, you would not have. The problem is you're attempting to defend the wrong secret, you're attempting to defend the story, instead of yourself, which actually gives up the story.

Mt. Gox is not for sale, first off. They've not announced failure, they allude that they will continue on. You cannot just decide to acquire something, it must be a mutual decision. 
In the event that they did announce such a thing, it wouldn't be Coinbase. Coinbase has a vastly different business model than the various exchanges. Maybe Bitstamp or someone like that would consider it just to get the "customer base" ...but probably not.

Research the legalities of actually doing this BEFORE you do it. The Tor website has some great documentation for running a relay, and the plausible ramifications depending on how you are supporting the network. 
I believe that no one has ever been prosecuted legally for running any relay, but people have been put out, requiring a temporary forfeiture of any computer/server running on that network, and ISPs have asked people to stop doing it. 
If you want to support the network, and get BTC tips for it, there are quite a few hosts that you can get plans on that will rid you of any trouble. 
You will not profit by running a node, so if that's your goal, just leave. If you don't care about the profit, then just buy a small server and run a Tor relay off of it, just make sure it's a company that supports running Tor relays and who wont just turn you off after a few DMCAs.

A lot of people make a lot of predictions. Few like to bring up their failures, but the people who happened to be right like to remind everyone. 
So many are doing this, that there are bound to be some people who are right once. What's more important is a long track record, as well as reasoning behind the "predictions."
I am not saying Schiff was incorrect, but it is a bad idea to just take someone who made predictions and was right at full value, since people are doing this everyday, and it is just pure certainty that people will be right just by chance alone.

Slight jab, plus also a misnomer. MIT gives out full scholarships, and already does that. If all MIT did was raise money for more scholarships, they wouldn't be the institution that they are.

"mention" and "mumble" differ, and what happened a year ago, compared to how much bitcoin has changed is important. You say "keep perspective" and I totally agree. Back when we were desperate for someone to just notice bitcoin it was one thing. Back before you could actually spend bitcoin in any major place or before any major news source reported on bitcoin even remotely frequently... it was a big deal. 
Times have changed significantly. In the last year, given all that has changed, an off the cuff remark that was barely auditory is of little importance. Certainly not front page reddit material.

BTC-e is not the  threat, centralized exchanges are. Rumors and baseless accusations are close to the top too.
Everyone wants to think their exchange is  trustworthy, and that they themselves are somehow epic at knowing who to trust. 
This is becoming like a religion argument with no way to prove anything. Can't we at least recognize the facts of what exchanges have actually gone under and under what circumstances? We've seen quite the array here.
Tolerance for red flags is also an issue. We saw plenty of flags from Gox when there was still plenty of time to get out.

I know it feels good to blame someone for price dropping, but this is not solely the fault of Ghash.io miners.

Understand that a large portion of Bitcoin ownership is Asian.

This post is the only one that matters. Too many people are treating bitcoin like it's a stock or something, and the rise in "value" of the bitcoin network, and the use of protocol will mean a rise in price. 
There's a steady releasing of more and more bitcoin every single day right now. Yeah, eventually it will be limited, but, for a while, this is going to keep pushing down on the price.
The more stores that accept and legitimize bitcoin, the more are just instantly selling for the instant fiat conversion. 
Most people here are focusing on whether or not his investment is good or bad, and basing it on the strength of bitcoin. 
The reason for that is many people in bitcoin have made this exact same mistake as OP. 
What if OP suddenly gets cancer or has some other ailment that requires liquidation of assets before this "sure thing" rise in bitcoin price? There are all sorts of outside causes besides the ones considered thus far for bitcoin itself.

It's very easy for people to get emotional when their money is being held with no answer, or no proof.
It's also very easy for people to use their 20/20 hindsight and call people who had money in Gox idiots for doing it.

It's a new place with a bunch of techno kids who have mostly no idea what they're doing, but they are trying to learn and be legit.

If you are running a business in pure bitcoin, you wont need "them" to work with you. The only time you need bank support is when you're taking a loan from a bank, or you're converting and storing your business account in fiat. 
I don't see how you can stop a pure bitcoin business. Heck we already saw how hard it was for them to catch just one guy running a massive market that was "illicit."

A few things in response:
1) I am not suggesting an eye for an eye. Shrem's case, if you ask me, is an arm for a scratch. 
Shrem's crime was greed and financially based. He did not harm anyone, and his crime just simply does not require him to be removed from society. 
2) Actually, right now, people who have no money actually commit crimes to get "two hots and a cot" as it is referred to Purposefully committing crimes so they get free housing and food. Yes, people with "nothing to lose" will always have some incentives to commit crimes. Not sure how you'll get away from that one. 
3) No, because again, in your example, you have someone whose sole objective is profit. The only way you could attempt to twist my logic would be if he was laundering money to buy drugs, then you could play silly word games and ask me if he should be fined drugs. Of course not. The punishment just needs to fit the crime. Charlie's crime was greed, without a victim. There's no reason to pull him out of society and put him in a jail cell. Revoking his human freedom is simply not a comparable punishment to his crime.

Exactly. This post sums up my thoughts all around. People are looking at this baby-staged thing expecting it to be some sort of behemoth of perfection in every way. 
To me, bitcoin will serve as the internet currency in microtransactions especially. Also, an escrow layer can and will be built on top of bitcoin for the "risky" situations. People have been babied too much, and don't bother spending the time to research who they are sending money to very often, because they know they can just chargeback if something bad happens. This ability does not come free. It costs you in higher prices and increased fees. 
This is a new paradigm that you absolutely cannot judge based on looking at it through the glass of today.

I am sure this is the case, it's no different than having spies in organizations physically. It's just a part of the game. You can sit on the sidelines and bash the players for their legal tactics, but doing so will almost certainly lose the game for you. 
It's not just the government that has an agenda to go against bitcoin, it's other businesses like VISA, the banks... etc. 
I really don't see how this is any different than bitcoin owners who just love any post that has anything to do with people investing more money into bitcoin... no matter what. You have people pumping up bitcoin, and you have people bashing bitcoin. 
It's the same in the corporate world with competing services. You've got people attacking exchanges, from the other exchanges, purposely trying to tarnish reputation. 
It's not just governments doing it. It's everyone. The government is just doing it in a more collaborative and structured way. 
If you're camping new posts as well, you can quickly stomp out most of the threads that you don't want to surface, and you can also purposely raise up others. Despite Reddit being open media... it's still relatively easy to control the flow of info.

While you can require proof of work in the loading time to a website, that's the backwards way of doing it. 
Instead, it would be far better to first load the page, then conduct some mini-mining in the background, sort of like your qz.com link showed. 
This would allow for anyone, fans or not of bitcoin, to access "paywall" type content for free. 
The only major drawback here is, as people begin to move more and more to pocket devices, on-hand processing power is not necessarily plentiful.

Bitcoin is valued based mostly on the "now." Coinbase is valued for its propensity to be as close to a bank of the future if bitcoin succeeds as possible. Coinbase's value is not really linked to the value of bitcoin either. Coinbase's value is determined by their revenue, which is valued by the earnings from 1% of the transactions that occur. 
If a lot of transactions take place, that makes Coinbase's model more valuable, but not necessarily bitcoin more valuable.

Exactly. The other stat he kept throwing around was 15% unemployment and 9% addiction to a substance. He was attempting to allude that the entire 9% fit into that 15%, when we know that to not be the case. Substance addiction, to some degree is indeed debilitating, but we know large amounts of substance addicts to be functioning alcoholics, functioning cocaine addicts (some of the highest ranking workers have this addiction), pot smokers, and I am going to go ahead and assume cigarettes wasn't included in that 9%... but if it was, well shoot there goes the entire 9% out the window.

Just for the record, the "newly rich" bitcoin folks, de-facto, MUST be willing to invest in highly risky and weakly-based investments.

Actually, there are three gambles that I see, and I too manage a bitcoin fund. 1. Bitcoin itself. 2. Having your money almost inevitably with exchanges. 3. Trusting the manager to succeed. 
Funds also have fees, usually something like 10-20%. Many have what is called "load" after that. You must add all of this up, and the fund must outperform the market at least by that much, and then some more to justify, if possible, the added risk. 
Back testing to 2012 is a joke. I show clients back tests too, but explain that they are near-worthless, given the time-frame. Out performing, even for decades, doesn't mean you're doing it right... and that's a forward test. We've been live trading now since December 2013, and that live test is still pretty darn worthless. You need to be able to understand fully the strategy, and believe in it logically.... just like you would any stock you'd invest in. You're investing in the management.

I think  really sums it up. The punishment just needs to fit the crime, that's all there is to it. 
No one, not even me, is saying that a murderer for profit (assassin) should only be fined. Part of his crime was murder, so he is obviously a danger to society. No one is going to logically argue against the notion that we ought to remove assassins from society, as they pose a serious threat and should be removed. 
The issue at hand is the crime Shrem committed. Why do you feel he should be removed from society?
I think this boils down to what people think the purpose of "jail" is. I suppose some people think it's a good idea to treat it like a "time out." Revocation of human freedom as a punishment. That is indeed a form of punishment, and some people may deserve it. 
I think the primary purpose of a jail through history has always been to remove dangers to society, whether those dangers were real or fictional, the "theory" was to remove them from society. Only recently have we seen jails and prisons being used more for purely punitive reasons. 
I think that's where the real divide is. Some people think jails and prisons are fine to be used as punitive. I disagree there, and I further disagree that, even if they are punitive, that Shrem's crime fit the bill for taking away his freedom for 2 years (with the plea deal). If he had taken this to trial, and lost, he faced 15-20+ years in prison.
Seriously? Do you think he deserved to face 15-20 years in prison? Do you think it was fair to offer him 2 years plea or 15-20 years in prison if he lost his case (which he would have, the evidence of his crimes was strong.) How does his crime warrant 15-20 years in prison?
Edit: Oops, I was using figures less than he was facing. It was actually 30 years. THIRTY years. C'mon. How is that even close to fair?

Exactly my thoughts. I am all for equality, but the problem is where people think equality is. I have no problem with women objectifying some men. Some men purposefully dress to be objectified by women, and some men find it empowering. I see this as no different than women doing the same thing. The problem is some people find it to be demeaning instead, and that's an opinion, nothing about equality. 
Feminists claim that to be a "feminist" is to just feel that men and women have equal rights. Too often, however, I find feminists really mean women today deserve reparations and men need to be pulled down so women can assert dominance. 
I think these events are a perfect illustration of that. This man was literally brought to tears. His life's greatest achievement overshadowed by complaints about a shirt.

First off, show some respect and watch your language. That's not how mature people speak to each other, and no discussion can take place when people use foul language to insult each other. I know your leaders have taught you well how to just mud-sling and undermine actual discussion, but let's go ahead and not follow that example.
I don't buy goods from Walmart, and I don't have DTV, so what now? I am surprised you use that example rather than talking about radiation from things like bluetooth. That's regulated too, and would make a better example for you to tell people how they are ingrateful for their big brother's help.
Consumers have been allowed to become completely complacent, entrusting far too much into the government. Some degree of this is inevitable. Everyone cannot possible research every little thing to understand it, so we have government for that. Do we need it for everything, and is it good for everything? No, it's not. That's not the solution. We're teaching a group of people to just be totally complacent about the most important thing, our economy. You may disagree with me, but I believe it is very evident that we've given the government too much power overall, at least here in the States.
We as bitcoiners know this the most, yet still just only seem to care about *anything* that will just make bitcoin go the heck up in price, even if it means rolling over to NYC and regulators to "legitimize" this currency.
This wasn't what bitcoin was for. What do we need regulation for? Tell me one law or form of regulation that you'd like to see that isn't already covered by pre-existing laws? We only need clarification.

Not only that, claim it has women in bondage gear? What? Where is the bondage gear? They are in some shiny suits. So any picture that depicts a rope is now a picture of bondage gear? IMO, it's the people making these claims who are the sex crazed lunatics.

I would first contact them, and see what they said. If you had such a good relationship with them, it only makes sense that you'd try to first contact them and report your issue, which will most likely improve the relationship.
The point of reporting issues like this is you are clearly a false positive that needs to be worked out in their systems. The amount of processing that they do a day is massive and risky purchase detection must be automated. Help the company that has been helping you for two years, being one of the first in the field to do it big. It's not like Coinbase *wants* these mistakes to happen, and they probably care very little about "risky" looking purchases, they are forced to do this by the US Government or go to jail. It might not even be their systems, many times they have to use third-parties to evaluate risk and identity. At least make the report. You took the time to write out this thread, why not contact?

Money laundering on the scale that Shrem did it was not hard at all to catch, especially for a single actor. I am surprised how easy you think laundering $1 million is. It's really not, unless you are the bank. There's a very good chance you'll get caught laundering that much money if you're ever putting it into USD.

As of right now, you don't pay taxes on Bitcoin gains, or the monetary value of your bitcoin increasing. That would be as if you had a house, it increased in value, and you had to pay a tax on the value of the increase every year. So long as you do not exchange your bitcoin for dollars, you are not taxed on the gains.

Just as bad. It's very easy to "miss the point of the post" when the title itself misses the point of the post. 
In this day, people tend to just read titles of articles, or posts. I find many people don't really even read what they share. Not long ago there was a perfect example with Mozilla's report of bitcoin donations. People thought it was so great. The comments on the article and the reddit post showed most people had not actually read the article, since the article was Mozilla claiming that having bitcoin donations was losing them money. The title didn't give that away, however, so people voted based purely on that.
I wager a lot of up-votes on this came from people who didn't even read it at all. Just the title and popped a vote. 
Those that did read it might agree, and the issue is real, but the title is highly misleading.

If "politics" had no place in court, it would already be the case that you could not use politics in court, and this motion would not be needed to be made at all. 
Instead, this isn't the case, and they are trying to get it barred from this trial. 
So, your viewpoint of what a trial is for, is simply trumped by cold hard fact of what is typically allowed in cases. 
Trials are often the breeding ground for legal and legislative change. They set precedent for future cases as well. Currently, politics are allowed in trials, which you apparently don't understand. 
Barring politics sets future precedent.
Unfortunately, you think trials serve one singular purpose, and you have no attention to the fact that they serve many purposes, and, historically, politics are indeed allowed in trials (again, you're missing the fact that they are trying to stop it from occurring here, meaning this is *not normal*). Trials have meaning, and they shift political and legal thought, as well as setting precedent. 
Stop trying to argue against facts, thanks. I welcome your -1 vote.

The punishment should always fit the crime. When it comes to money laundering, the primary "focus" and "objective" is profit. 
To deter this, you set up harsh financial penalties that negate such an objective, making the financial risk outweigh the reward. His motivation was profit, that's it, and the crime was a non-harmful crime without a victim. If he was trafficking slaves, taking away their freedom as a part of his crime, then the rightful punishment could indeed be revocation of his freedom.
Revoking someone's basic human right over a crime of this caliber is sadistic. Absolutely insane.

Promote market forces and consumer intelligence regarding risk of entities. 
I run a bitcoin business where I manage user funds. The existing regulation is already enough to make me not want to ever have control of the funds, and I don't. Everything is done via APIs under SaaS, and I never actually transact money. We don't need more regulation. We just need informed consumers. Consumers have been allowed to be absolute idiots, playing fast and loose with their funds. 
I know when I buy something on PayPal, I just don't care how risky the entity is. If I don't get my goods, I know with 100% certainty that I'll get my money. I've been on both sides of this as a buyer and seller. I don't worry about my stolen credit card, I just say the charges weren't mine and we move on with life. This doesn't come free, we all pay the 3% fee that accounts for fraud, which gets passed on by the CC companies to the merchants, then passed finally on to the consumer.
Forget the safeguards. Encourage education. We only need clarification from regulation, we don't need dumb licenses, we don't need more forms to fill out, we don't need more fees to pay.
Regulation has never saved the people. The tricksters only get more advanced, to the point where the trick isn't even understood by the masses.

His argument is that bitcoin will continue to rise until it levels out. Okay cool. 
He defends that by saying that it must rise until more stores accept it and people can actually spend it, otherwise they have to hold. Okay cool.
O wait, except for the fact that it has been slipping for the last year, so that premise is out. 
Sounds like he forgot about the $1 million dollars worth of bitcoin that enters into the market every single day, most of which is sold to cover the cost of mining since holding is losing money, and most miners are in it for the business.

Yeah, I am aware of Schiff's history. He brings it up every time someone questions his current bet that the market will soon do it again. I've seen him talking pre-crisis. 
I think he's smart, but he's got an agenda, and was right in one major event. It's really not enough to be statistically significant, especially since he's already warning for it to happen again. If you keep on predicting the market will crash for 10 years, then finally on that year 10 it crashes, congratulations, but you were wrong the other 9 years. 
Find Schiff talking for years and years before the mortgage crisis. See what he's saying. If you listen to Schiff constantly, you're losing money in the long term. 
If you listen to him right at the right moments, you do very well.

It's 80K for spreading misinformation, and yes. Not only would I turn down a job that I morally do not support, I already have, and it was for more than 80k. 
I know many people see 80K and think that's some fantastic number, but 80K is lower-middle at best income. The kind of people who are willing to take 80K to assume that role, deserve to wind up where the job leads. 
Everyone is different, and there are plenty of people who are willing to do these sorts of things. If I don't get anything out of the job except for money, I find it unfulfilling.

At $25,000, we'll put the bitcoin logo and text on the quarter panel of the car. If we break $50,000 but not $100,000, then we'll put bitcoin on the hood of the car. 
Up to 49,999 just for the quarter panel. That's really quite expensive. Up to 99,999 just to get a bitcoin logo on the side and hood of the car. For that, you get ~90K impressions there + 5M TV viewers, but these impressions are not targeted to your choosing. The reason this isn't getting much support is the price is outrageous compared to the audience. The audience watching nascar just isn't cost effective to purchase this from.

Well not quite. The reason why depositing less than $10,000 at a time is a crime is because you're avoiding the extra checks that come in at the $10,000 mark. Thus, if you continually deposit 10K+ USD, you are also probably going to get a knock because they still suspect you of money laundering.

As a developer, with knowledge of how much it would take to make a site-wide backup of all wallets with usernames and passwords to access them, I wonder deeply about why these wallets would be destroyed. 
Also, 3 weeks notice to destroy funds? In the United States, that's 3 weeks notice to destroy property, and currency at the same time depending on the agency. So you are giving US citizens 3 weeks notice before you destroy their stuff? 
Yikes, I don't think you're even near compliance here. You might think adding a simple "client assumes liability" to your ToS allows you to just do whatever the hell you please, but that actually does not absolve you from liability.

Yes, yes I do. They ask me every year to pay, and I actually do have the choice whether or not to pay. Usually they do not even ask me about my taxes, they just expect me to know that I owe money (I run my own businesses).
No one has yet to come to my house with a gun, or anything, forcing me to pay my taxes. 
Last I checked, I had the freedom to refuse to pay taxes. Sure, if you do not pay your taxes, you may eventually get a visit, a fine, or maybe jail, but that doesn't mean you do not have the ability to simply not pay. 
There have been many major historical events that marked massive changes in social thinking, where people simply refused to do something that they were expected to do.

There is a wage ceiling, there's really no high paying job unless you have a connection. 
Most people earn literally the 30-40k a year salary with junk benefits at best. 
After that, you have land costs, which are very low on purpose since prisons are generally out in the middle of nowhere.  You have cheap employee costs bc ur out in the middle of podunk no where. 
You have some thick walls, and big doors, but... it all just doesn't QUITE add up to the amount that prisons bring in. It's definitely one of the most corrupt industries.

Great post OP. I hope we don't just let this die. The blockchain is a ledger of everything.... show us the evidence. I really want to believe it was at least stolen and wasn't some inside job that MK was in on, but there is total lack of any evidence by MK so far that a theft even occurred.

Yeah, no worries. Similar boat as me. I saw a few of their live presentations. All sounded great, and I even read their whitepaper, that was many months ago, around Jan 2014 I think, back when it was set to beta release like Feb I think. Too many unknowns. They were really great about bashing why the other coins would fail, but not about why they might. 
I cannot believe they got so many bitcoin before anything solid. That's incredible. I hope there's some sort of retribution if they do not follow through here.

Well, first, unless you are one of the people who is going to help with the conversion, I do not care what your feelings are on the matter. 
Second, no, my comment is for people who continually bring up that Africa has no internet, therefor their adoption is unlikely, or pick another country. Not only will bitcoin adoption take time, internet's spread will as well. In the end, it does not matter, however, as it is the goal of multi national organizations to do so. 
And let's be clear, they aren't doing it out of their own good will. It's Facebook and Google we're talking about here. Of course they'd LOVE to be ISPs. Talk about some seriously valuable information. It will happen.

Can we just sit back for one minor second and realize that Microsoft, on the whole, is not accepting bitcoin. This is just a tiny part of the Microsoft empire that is accepting bitcoin. 
This is great news, but it's not at all like a company like Overstock accepting bitcoin, or eBay accepting bitcoin, which encompasses the entire business. 
Since you put a dollar figure on it, you'd really need to put a dollar figure on the App store revenue, and then decide if it's really the biggest acceptance. 
It's a great step, but the company on the whole has not accepted bitcoin. Companies of this size have tons of off-shoots and one faction accepting it isn't equal to the whole of it accepting.

I remember an adblock campaign where people were literally donating to adblock so that adblock could buy advertisements to advertise adblock. 
Maybe that's what they're doing again and I am just missing it this time, but damn, what a joke. 
People love the free stuff from the internet, but they don't want to pay the fractions of a penny themselves, so the ads are served. That's one of the great things I see bitcoin solving. You could have websites that just plain charge a small amount of BTC per view, or per hour, or whatever... and solve the problem entirely. 
I produce a lot of content too, but hardly anyone donates. The ads pay for the content. If you want to silence the ads, and not donate, then you will silence the content.

Interesting. If we are acting under the premise that Ross really was willing to use violence (not just violence, murder), then yeah, I would have to agree he deserves life in prison. 
I did not know that actually was included in the trial and that it was going to play into his sentencing. 
The whole murder for hire thing is the tipping point for most community support, I believe. No matter how just you might think running a drug bazaar is/was, we cannot have ordinary citizens playing God and murdering people, for the same reason the death penalty ought not exist. 
I would wager most of the people who support Ross in this case, also support the abolishing of the death penalty. With the cards currently on the table, and with the murder for fire being one of them, especially where Ross was indeed under the impression that someone would really be murdered, and that someone "was" murdered... I'd agree that he deserves life in prison, regardless of whether or not someone actually was murdered. He went through with it in his mind. He should have known better than that. 
Really a bummer to hear this aspect is included and that it wasn't challenged / shot down / inadmissible. 
Still curious to know if he was still the active DPR, but it sounds like he was, since he was busted on the laptop, logged into the DPR account.
I could see how a massive drug bazaar could happen to a 25 year old kid, winding up way over his head. Murder for hire, however, I will not "understand" or pass off. 
Sorry Ross, but you will have your entire life to fight the evidence. Luckily the state didn't decide to kill you.

Yeah, it can be brutal. I've never won a case through PayPal, even when there is a large amount of evidence to back up my case. I am fairly certain the entire process is automated, no one even bothers to "look into" anything. If there's a dispute, buyer wins, period. If there's a tracking number, then maybe a human looks into it. 
I've run several businesses through PayPal, and I was sufficiently warned of the risks like this. I imagine you were as well. Chargebacks, whether they are credit card, paypal (or both... usually this long is a credit card) affect all businesses. Fraud like this is rampant and must be worked into the actual profit model, because it will occur. 
Bitcoin can maybe help with that, but your business is likely far more profitable by continuing to accept cash. You just simply need to price risk in. 
This is no different than people selling bitcoin and accepting PayPal. They charge a massive amount over market, to account for the chargebacks and then make a small margin after it. 
Just price in the risk. 
The only killer aspect is that, if the chargeback is credit card, you can get charged a $20 chargeback fee from the credit card companies. Really kicking you when you're down. That cost should be passed on to the person who had their info stolen, which is partly their fault... not the merchant's.

We really need to have people who not only get paid in BTC, but also spend in BTC. Most people are completely one-sided in their affiliation with Bitcoin. Businesses that accept bitcoin don't actually want the bitcoin, they're just taking advantage of it. 
What's more, there's a 1% fee imposed on the merchant, and then there's a hidden fee imposed on the purchaser. This hidden fee is in the conversion rate that services like Coinbase give you. They have a rate for buying, and a rate for selling. This brings you to 2-3% fee for transactions. 
Gosh, that sure sounds familiar.

While bitcoin is the future of the internet currency, it may, or may not, mean that price will go up any time soon, or that it is a good investment now. 
Price may double, triple, whatever... but it may be a decade, or 5 before that happens. 
Doing business and using bitcoin technology is a certainty, but the price of bitcoin itself could easily continue to go either way. 
Thus, take your 19K, and figure out a way to get in on bitcoin business. Take note that these big name "investors" that we keep seeing are not buying batches of bitcoin. They are buying batches of bitcoin businesses. Very different investments here.

You can mine bitcoin, not selling it, and not have to pay your taxes on it. I think you're confused too. You can make bitcoin profits and not have to pay taxes their either. What exchange rate would you even go off of? What would constitute as a valid exchange rate?

Bitcoin is not a currency in the eyes of the law.

Ross "for sure" operated the Silk Road in my eyes prior to the conviction at trial. It's been proven that no one was murdered by these "hitmen."
It's also been proven that Carl Force was one of the "hitmen," and there is proof that he extorted both of these guys. We know for sure he was corrupt and in the business of extorting for Bitcoin. As such, I convict him in my mind, so I say he for sure did it. He's not yet been convicted or sentenced, but one could argue that even a conviction or sentencing does not equal "for sure." We have court judges to make the final judgement, or a jury of peers. I am his peer, I am making my judgement as we are all entitled to make.
Carl Force cryptographically stole bitcoin. A jury can go ahead and deliberate away, but I'll go ahead and go with the math.

"American?" No. That's how a free market works with high competition. This happens all over the world, and this is the way it should be.

Most of them are based on the bitcoin technology, rather than the price at all. Price could be $5 a bitcoin, and most of these services and businesses would do the exact same thing they already do, and the need for them would still be there.
Regardless, the safer, and more likely to earn you a profit is the business itself, rather than the bitcoin. 
This guy is a believer in the tech. He's read up on it, and knows that's what he wants to invest in, but is about to buy something that isn't actually what he has faith in. Maybe he also believes in the price,  but the things he's read, and what he proclaimed to believe in was not the financial instrument of bitcoin, it is the bitcoin technology... two very different things.

Isn't that the truth... I get monthly VC offers on my businesses now, and I have so far avoided all of them. You can get some solid angel investors that share your core beliefs, and I have met a few with one as a partner now, but I've yet to meet a VC just yet that seems very genuine.
A VC firm is built to earn a profit, they are just an investment company, nothing more. I've met one now that was interested in "bettering" the world, but, when it comes down to it, they want to squeeze as much profit as they can. 
VC firms are also a bit more attuned to staying on the legal side of things. Legality usually doesn't come down to black and white, there is some grey area. That grey area is discerned as black or white via a court case. VC firms don't want it to get there at all, so they always stray as far over as possible. 
With something like bitcoin, that's very far. 
You cannot blame the VC firms, because they are just protecting their ass-ets, but all of this institutional money isn't necessarily a good thing. 
You can see this each time a VC-backed company testifies. They want more regulation. Why? Because that'll surely bring them more money. 
It's all about the Benjamins for some people. If you're a bitcoin business, or a humanitarian business, you need to find backers and employees are are about something else.

Schiff is as much of a gold Shill as there can be. Bitcoin satisfies many, if not all, of the arguments to buy gold, and then some. 
Bitcoin, to Schiff, is a threat to his investment. 
Really no different than Schiff being a threat to our investment, and a lot of ignorance to his arguments and the utter shutdown of his thoughts without considering them. 
In the end, Schiff can hate on bitcoin, and bitcoiners can hate on Schiff. Things might slow or disrupt the change, but you cannot stop inevitability completely. 
Given the events of 2014, I'd say bitcoin is far past its possible tipping point. Adoption has been pretty massive and you can actually do things with your bitcoin. 
Really, bitcoin is far more valuable than the gold you buy, especially seeing how much "gold" you buy isn't even physical, it's just a certificate saying you have that gold in someone's vault. 
Bitcoin dropped because you can actually spend it, there are tons of exit points for bitcoin now, demand has to catch up. 
If people devised a way for you to quickly and seemlessly transact with gold certificate values, letting people who accepted it convert instantly to fiat, what do you think would happen to gold?

No link required. Just look at the business model for places like Coinbase, which accounts for most of the investors mentioned. 
Just look at the business that is provided, you don't need a link to some article, read up on the business itself. Coinbase is not dependent on the price of bitcoin, they are dependent on the normalized 1% rate they charge, for example. 
Bitcoin awareness is definitely up this year. Far more adoption than ever. Price is relatively stable, and notably down. Adoption of bitcoin, and using it, does not necessitate a rise in price of bitcoin. 
Rise in the use of bitcoin, however, does necessitate a rise in profits for companies like, say, coinbase.

Coinbase is regulated and licensed, where necessary. Just because they operate in some states that simply have no regulation in place, it does not mean the company of Coinbase is now "not regulated."

CPI is a measure of the cost to the consumer given a "basket of goods," which consists of ~88,000 items. 
The CPI measures the average person's cost to have a basic standard of living. 
The fact that it decreases is literally shows that people are better off, and it is cheaper to have a basic standard of living nowadays, as compared to worse times, like the great depression. 
This is why during times of large recessions and depressions the chart goes up... What is scary is people here are really believing that times were... better?? ... during say the great depression and other recessions? What the hell is going on in this subreddit.

No, just no. Research the CPI.
Look up how to calculate the CPI. Do the math for yourself with a simple example if necessary.
The CPI is a measure of Consumer Prices, and how much you pay for the basket of goods today compared to that same basket of goods in the past. 
Stop spreading your fud, and again, answer the question:
Do you really think you're purchasing power for your dollar is worse off today than during the Great Depression? Do you honestly think things are worse right now?!

As someone who makes a significant part of their income from YouTube adsense earnings:
These prices for videos are too high. I would be a millionaire right now if my videos got that much CPI. I've not signed up or anything, I assume the poster can decide how much to charge, so maybe that's just their fault. 
Advertising all together is massive money, but almost no one gets 5-10 cents a view, that's big money. 
I'd much rather see bitcoin literally replace advertisements, so either you can pay say 0.004 USD worth per view, or see an ad. Either will do. 
I think many people would rather pay fractions of a penny than see an ad, but allowing the user to choose results is large asking prices like this... 10x over market at least. 
I think the site would have more success allowing the choice to view an ad or pay a fraction of a penny. Starting out is obviously hard, however. You need content... but you also need the viewers. Most websites like this start by wooing content creators, and keeping the price for the viewers low. Looks fairly bootstrapped, so I doubt the investment money for that exists. 
Neat idea regardless. I wish this would take off. I'll consider putting some videos up here. 
Another idea: embedded videos through your payment structure. Then people could embed videos on their websites as well. Maybe this exists as well already.

You can break down points if you want. CPI isn't just in the title, it is the main descriptor in the title of the chart.

I doubt it. The bank heists were just that, elaborate heists. Hacking bitcoin exchanges, or hacking anything for that matter, is not an exciting thing really, at least not for someone viewing it.
Hacking in general is very tedious. The term hacking has been glorified, but it is usually:
Step one of plan: (attempt, fail x 50)... then finally succeed, move on to step two. Very non-eventful in most cases.
Most hacks go unpunished, the risk is low, distance great, there's very little suspense to it. 
The only one that may make for a decent drama so far is Mt. Gox's hacking, since that was more likely an inside / political job... but it wont be Oceans 19.

Average RPM anywhere is ~ $5-$20, depending on your viewers, which tends to depend on your content sector. 
I agree most people would at least consider paying 0.01 per video no problem. $10 CPM is respectable, that's about what I see with programming/finance videos on YT.
You're right that the network isn't designed to handle 0.004 USD worth, and I think that's a huge shame, since that's still far too high for something like pageviews on a news-site for example. Videos with vid ads tend to garner higher payments, understandably. 
Currently, or at least last I looked, there's no place that supports even 0.01 payments to any fair degree. 
The way you handle that is viewers deposit something like $1 worth in bitcoin at a time, or $5... etc... and each view subtracts from that. The video maker is then paid in $1 or $5 increments.

As far as I know, there's only one way that a deposit address could have been modified, and that's with a decently high-leveled access to their main server. 
The absolute last attack vector would be targeting the deposit address, since people would know something was up after ~10 minutes, and then after an hour would probably begin complaining. I think the 12 hours response time was rather unexpected.
Before that point, there's a lot of other things you could do with that kind of access. I am not privy to their practices about what happens when the hot wallet empties and how it gets re-filled, it would't surprise me if that system was at least somewhat automated. 
With the kind of access the attacker probably had, then that lines up with moving (changing) servers, and also lines up with the requirement for a full rebuild. It's too easy to set up some obfuscated back doors, and a clean start is what is probably necessary to be absolutely certain things are clean. 
The problem is a real and proper job of full rebuild should take months... not days. A proper system for issues withdrawal requests, however, should be do-able within relatively short order and match their DB records which they have promised to honor anyway. Check for DB integrity, build the withdrawal system, and let people leave.

So then not 24hrs, not 24-48... I wouldn't even trust an exchange built from ground up in a week or 4... or 8. Give people their BTC back and then re-make your business, taking your time. You can either remake your business fast, holding people's bitcoin against their will but doing a shoddy job at the remaking the system, which was shoddy to begin with, or you can hold people's bitcoin against their will for a long time, but maybe do it right. 
Either of those options are bad. Give people back what is theirs by simply rebuilding a solid withdrawal ability, let people leave, THEN fix your broken business. Don't hold people hostage.

Which only further drives my point home that this entire thread is worthless. In my original complaint I brought up the actual worthiness of the CPI being in question. 
The problem is this is approaching the top thread in Bitcoin, under a premise that it is an image that shows the utter shambles and that the economy is akin to the sinking Titanic ship, *based* on this statistic. 
You can literally only take two stances based on this picture:
1. CPI is worthless and so is this thread. 
2. CPI is a good measurement, and this picture actually shows that the economy is only getting better.... thus this thread is utter BS.
Really the only conclusions that should be reached. Somehow, a 3rd has been reached though, which is both 1 and 2, put together, then turned opposite. 
3. CPI is a valid measurement, and consumers reaching a basic standard of living far easier is a bad thing.

I cannot believe he's begging to not receive life in prison for his crimes. The punishment is nowhere near fitting to the crime, even if it was Ross himself moving all of the drugs on the site. 
Keep in mind, this sentencing has nothing to do with him hiring hitmen, and one of the "hitmen" was Carl Force, who we know to have tried to extort Ulbricht and Mark Karpelas, as well as allegedly (US Gov't is the accuser, not just bitcoiners) stealing bitcoin. 
This sentencing is purely for running SR. That's it. Crazy.
Every single person claiming he's just paying the price for breaking the law has broken laws and not paid the price. I know they didn't go admit to the local police station what they did. Not one person in here has never committed a crime.

It's not a cop out. I didn't down-vote you either if that's why you're offended. 
It's not an opinion how the CPI is calculated, it's just a fact, like how we calculate the length of an edge of a triangle. I was getting offended that I was being required to cite my sources on multiple occasions here, when it's not like a research study or an opinion.. .CPI is literally a formula. It is this thread and the supporters of this thread who are positing that the CPI is a worthy measurement, and what it means, so I think requesting people know how it is calculated is not really that much of a stretch...but:
CPI is a measure of the cost to the consumer given a "basket of goods," which consists of ~88,000 items.
The CPI measures the average person's cost to have a basic standard of living, compared to the "starting point," wherever that happens to be. 
The fact that it decreases is literally showing that people are better off, having an easier time achieving the basic standard of living, especially as compared to worse times, like the great depression, this is why this figure actually goes up during the great depression, and almost all recessions which you can clearly see in the OP picture.

I appreciate prudence before flipping the switch back on, as obviously there was a compromise that involved the changing of a depositing address or something in that system, but offline for the coming days? Every hour this website is down and users cannot access their coins is more worrisome. 
Words claiming something are meaningless. We've seen the "your coins are safe, we will 'honor' this and that" before. It seems to have a less than 50% accuracy track record. 
It's of course only logical for a profitable business of this magnitude to get back up and running ASAP, but the main concern is of course solvency as it always is. FRB works until it doesn't. An event like this will likely trigger a decent run, easily going past 20% withdrawals including the amount lost. 
Locking up completely for "days" that could turn into weeks is never a good sign. 
Also, this sort of attack signals a pretty significant breach. I'd like to hear how the deposit address was changed, or where coins went while deposited was changed, without significant server-sided code access.
Again, I realize the utmost attention to detail and security needs to be taken, but no access even to see or withdrawal funds is worrying, and so is a breach of this kind.

Yes, I mean the example of a website on Tor that was taken out due to its growth and hub nature.
If you think the only thing that brought down the Silk Road was a gmail address, you're being naive. 
If you think that you cannot be tracked over the Tor network, you need to look again, and investigate how Tor keeps you private.
Check out how many nodes even exist. If you use Tor enough, or if your Tor website is used enough, tracking you down is not a massive hurdle. There's much more involved. 
There really hasn't been any other major threatening Tor site to date. There are some hitman websites and such, but none of them have really been successful. SR was successful, because it was a centralized place. If you stay dispersed, yeah, they probably never will bring the Tor site down, but, again, we're talking about making another main marketplace. 
It just wont happen this way, even with your precious Tor that you apparently think adds special anonymize pixie dust to web traffic.

This sentencing has nothing to do with the alleged hitman stuff. Not to mention Carl Force was one of the "hitmen" and we already know the guy is dirty and is being processed through the legal system now himself.

@_date: 2015-05-28 13:19:40
The hope was that he had some sort of defense against those claims. I am sure he was going to serve a long time either way according to US law, but, in my personal head, the hinge for getting more than maybe a year on parole was whether or not he really solicited a hitman, and really thought he went through with it, and really thought he murdered some people. 
If it's true, then yes, he deserves life. More aptly put, society deserves him getting life, because he is a danger. 
If all he really did was run a drug bazaar website and never committed a violent/physical crime, then his punishment ought not be physical, certainly not 20+ years in prison, my gosh. 
Sadly... that's not what we're finding out, and it's a bummer to me. I wanted Ross to be a good guy.

To make sense of this people just simply need to think logically about comparing our times now to the Great Depression, where wheelbarrows of dollar bills were paid for bread, and immediately they should realize how stupid they are to think this chart signals a bad thing. 
There's a massive misunderstanding in this thread, and it is very depressing to see.

"Good news" and "bad news" does not move markets, contrary to popular belief. 
Buyers and sellers move markets based on supply and demand. Price is dropping because, despite the positive news surrounding bitcoin, there isn't an influx of buyers coming in. How many of you are actually buying more coins? Probably very few, as most people who are bullish bitcoin have already made the bulk of their investment. 
Sure, many businesses accept bitcoin too, but these businesses, for the most part, aren't actually holding it, they are converting instantly to dollars.

The price chart is not an exact record of human behavior at all, only trades that actually occurred. For one it completely neglects market depth. For another, it neglects to report leverage.

It's not that I am not a fan of TA, I support forms of TA, just not the basic forms that can be easily drawn on a graph to suit the majority. I am a programmer, and I have had the ability to test almost all of the more popular TA indicators, to find they are absolutely worthless.
TA is actually fascinating to me, because I too see the patterns that some of these indicators seem to predict and think wow. Then I test these "patterns" and realize how flawed we humans are. 
Most people involved with using TA just overlay the indicator, and that's that. They don't possess the ability to actually back-test that TA against, say, thousands of companies over decades, to see how they actually fair, or even in the last few years. If they get that far, even fewer know how to run the risk metrics on top of the results.
In the end, I think TA is one of the biggest traps for traders. Some TA can, and does, work for some people. Whether that's just statistical certainty, or people are on to something, I am too stupid to know for sure.

A 1/10 chance to replace USD is an exaggeration. A chance that it does is just statistics. Denying it makes you the real lunatic. Talking in here as optimistic as people are is a bit absurd. 
Bitcoin also isn't an "either or" situation that people make it out to be. Bitcoin can easily just do basically what PayPal does, and just take some of the market share from PayPal and do microtransactions, and that be it. 
Talking about all of bitcoin being worth a quarter of Snapchat is also totally pointless. We can bring up a ton of company values. At one point Snapchat was worth a quarter of what it is now. At one point Google was worth 15,000 of seed money that was barely scraped together, so that argument is pretty pointless, and look how far Google is after a similar time frame.
Something could become a world reserve currency in 15 years. 15 years is a hell of a long time nowadays. Things change extremely rapidly. Some of our smartest people are calling for the replacement of cars with self-driven cars, where you wont even be allowed to drive in cities, happening in 5 years. 
Look at the paradigm shifts that have occurred in the last 10-15 years, and consider their "absurdities" at the time. 
I would not assign a high probability to bitcoin becoming a world currency, but I do see it being the replacement to internet transactions, unless banks can adopt it quickly. They are doing it, and people trust banks. 
I think the most likely scenario is bank adoption of blockchain tech to enable instant and fee-less transactions. 
edit: Also, you made a comment about bitcoin not being able to support a single-country's transactions. You're basing this, I assume, on thinking of replacing a country like USA or GB. There are a LOT of countries, and bitcoin can already supply the entirety of quite a few actually.
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:42:10
Agreed with your replies, good points. 
Why bitcoin, out of all things, could replace the USD is it is the first successful non-fiat that solves division problems and gives people the option to stay non-centralized. That said, bitcoin is becoming successful, and people are centralizing to bitcoin banks like Coinbase, and businesses are already building back-channel side-chains to do off-chain transactions... this is just going right back to centralization in my book, but that's another topic entirely. 
The reason why bitcoin is simply that it solves transaction, cannot be easily controlled by any entity, something like a war or a government's collapse wouldnt bankrupt the people, etc. Right now, Bitcoin is the only currency in place to reasonably satisfy this. Maybe someone else will come along and make something better, but Bitcoin is building first to market advantage and testing every day, building a larger and larger moat as time goes on. 
My biggest fear is something like Quantum computing, or an otherwise massive shift in computing understanding and power. Again, something people think is outlandish and totally scifi, but it's just plain not. Even with Moores law only, assuming it continues, we're going to see our current encryption brute forced within a century, probably less, and that's the biggest problem. Quantum computing stands to break all encryption and not really provide a solution again that I know of.

You're saying this panic dump is the result of Greece "resolution," pointing out that the pump was from China not Greece.
What makes you think the dump is from Greece info and not China? 
Have you paid attention to the China Market? It is currently in the most "leveled out" spot that it has been in a while. There were a few pops on the way down, but this pop is appearing to hold.

Coinbase is brand new at this game. They have industry leaders to help them out, but they are still new. They make one mistake and you're ready to just move out entirely? 
Bitcoiners are *all* about supporting the fledgling bitcoin industry, unless of course one mistake occurs to you and you're ready to say "F--- it, I am taking my business elsewhere, good riddance!!"
If Coinbase messed up with my account, the first place I might think about going is here, people might listen and I have seen Coinbase always seems to respond here fast.
If Bank of America declines my card at Target, I just use another one and move on. 
That one time Bank of America would not cash my Cashiers check not only not immediately, but not for weeks... I didn't think to even try to find a or something. Who would even care. People know they can come here to raise a ruckus about bitcoin businesses though and maybe get somewhere.
People say you don't hear about this stuff so much from regular banks, but that's not because it's not happening.
I can understand someone who had their entire account frozen or something. That's scary, and I too would want my money ASAP to leave. If Coinbase declines a transaction I made... I am not going to just pack my bags and leave. Jeez.

Bitcoin has about the same chance of getting $1M per coin as it does for $500M per coin, as it does for $500K per coin. 
If it gets to the point where one single coin is worth that much, the value of fiat has collapsed. Once fiat collapses, it will serve literally no purpose. Bitcoin always has a purpose as a nice, cheap, way to transact, but it can also be superseded by something that does this better.. Fiat really doesn't have any value beyond what we ascribe to it. Once it gets to the point where we ascribe such a small value to it, it's all over.
For an analyst to give a high rating to such an occurrence, however, is dangerous. These people are always very careful with their words so they can go back on them later. "Analysts" usually try to stay as safe as possible when they make claims. 
The impending "financial collapse" prophets are no different. They predict the collapse for 10 years, then it happens, and they take all the credit possible and write some books. Then, a couple years later, they start predicting again. Eventually, the broken clock is right.

Anonymous tipping can help to solve the problem. Eventually, however, journalists and news sites have found that they get more viewership by seeing what "sells" best. What sells best is short term sensationalist crap. I am not certain that changes with a tipping bitcoin site. Maybe in the drastic short term, where most bitcoiners are slightly more technically minded, but not in the hopeful long term.

The old adage: a broken clock is right twice a day explains these forecasters well. They forecast, and forecast. When wrong, they don't say anything and their thoughts are lost in the whirlwind of day to day. Then, finally, when something comes true, boy will they love to tell you about it!

O right Peter Schiff. He's also talking about a coming crash. Been talking about it for years. Luckily for him, recessions come once a decade or so, so he just keeps jibber jabbering til then, and then finally he can say "Told you so!"
If Bitcoiners are to follow trend forecasters, then we sure had better not ignore Peter Schiff! What's he saying about bitcoin again? Worthless? Will bust? We don't like what he says though, he must be wrong. But this guy... he's right.

Moving into speculation about future events, however, changes the game entirely.

The constitution is, and has been, amended, reinterpreted, and, in parts, ignored.  
The encryption we use today was once illegal, right here in the USA, and that too was after the constitutional first amendment was in place. Despite your amendment rights currently, there is a law in place right now called "key disclosure law," where you are "forced" to give up your keys. You can decline, but declining is breaking the law and that's enough to put you away as well. 
There still exist forms of cryptography that actually are illegal to create and disperse in the USA and most other Western countries.
I don't think we're really too far away from going back to the days where cryptography is illegal again.  Britain is probably closer than the USA is to outlawing it entirely, and I could see USA using that as a springboard to do the same. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:47:53
Governments want backdoors into the programs that use encryption. 
You could build a crypto algo that had a backdoor (otherwise known as a flaw), but then someone else can build one that doesn't, and bitcoiners would just use that one. 
The only real threat to bitcoiners is with large bitcoin companies, who have something to lose by government threats, so they grant backdoor access to the app itself.

Every time something like this happens, people like to boil everything down to one major mistake. In this case, it was TeamViewer. These things happen due to a chain of mistakes, usually any link broken would have meant an avoidance of the entire thing, this story is no different.
It's not like TV is the only remote control software out there, there are plenty of other hidden ones. Simply operating under the idea that we shouldn't use TV is silly, and you're not safe by not having TeamViewer. 
Here's a quick and simple list of mistakes, all of which caused this:
1. Simple Password, or possibly some other sort of malware that stole the password to Teamviewer. Even with this, a hacker doesn't have your Coinbase account. 
2. User chose the whole "do not ask again for 30 days." Bad idea, now all someone needs is control of your machine and a single password to basically have access to your bank account. 
3. User left his computer on, while away, likely for a very extended period of time. 
Number 3 is a hard one, I know it is common nowadays to do this, but I highly suggest against it. People will bring up instances of bathroom breaks... etc. A hacker usually waits until they believe you will be gone for a while before starting, since you catching them in the act means the whole thing is shot. They know you have to sleep, and they usually wait for that. If you work in an office and have a scheduled lunch-break, same story.
Number 2 is just a mistake out of laziness, don't fall victim. 
Number 1 is the same as number 2. 
Without the combination of these, this particular hack likely wouldn't have occurred. One cannot simply blame the installation and use of TeamViewer here.

Exactly. I'd add a few more things to the list, like Ethereum. That whole operation has needed far more consumer protection and oversight. 
Bitcoiners keep thinking they can handle this economy without regulation. 
... but then companies like Butterfly labs keep shafting the hell out of people for over a year. It was totally public knowledge about their shenanigans, but nothing happened until the US Government stepped in to shape them up a bit.
It'd be great if we didn't need the regulation, but we sure as heck do, since we keep rolling over to scammers. We, as a community, have been given the chance to work things out ourselves. There's plenty of time before the US Government steps in... they spend a long time building evidence before they move on anyone. We just simply need the regulation. I used to agree that we didn't... but after watching all these scams and shams, and nothing being done other than with the government stepping in after the fact, it is clear to me that we need something.

His argument: We don't need the government to step in to protect net neutrality, because the notion that one provider can set limits or give people more speed is the actual problem, since providers get monopolies in sectors.

Let me know when you find one single person who is specifically in prison because bitcoin was a factor, rather than regular fiat? I cannot think of a single example where it appears bitcoin played a major role in the sentencing. 
Ulbricht committed a crime, and all of his crimes were regardless of bitcoin. 
Shrem? Money laundering... regardless of bitcoin, he laundered a million dollars. 
... The list can keep going on. Is bitcoin a threat, sure... but hardly. 
The real crux of bitcoin is the blockchain, which can and will be implemented by the major banks, who will also offer their coveted protection and security that people clamor for. I know people keep claiming the big banks are scared of bitcoin. 
No they aren't. They are going to adopt the blockchain idea for accounting, and bitcoin the currency will be the loser most likely.

I can understand you, and agree there. Like I said to the other guy, sort of a new concept for me to consider on it. It's more of a realization that the actual problem is the monopoly-like hold these companies have that allows them to even have the option to consider various rates for various customers. 
I believe telecom is likely very similar to the construction industry. Sure, the barriers to entry are high in cost, but there's a lot more to it than just having money. You gotta know the right people and jerk the right dicks. 
Something like the auto industry was an example where people thought hardly anyone new would ever come in. Surely not electric cars. Musk came in and did it, no problem. Good business model, lotsa monies, no problem. 
I don't think Musk could have as easily done construction, or telecom, since there's more to it than just having a good idea and a lot of money and a lot of luck.

I think the more important take on the matter was the fact that it was monopolies in the first place that are the problem, not really the whole rate-fixing for different customers. 
I agree it's a complex matter, I just had not considered that the real problem was monopolistic companies even having the ability to consider such a thing. 
Still a new concept to me for consideration, but it's a point that I haven't seen anyone really point out, I might just have missed it. They are all up in arms about net neutrality, but the real issue is that they are monopolistic.

Yeah, the USA luckily still has laws in place, and a nice checks and balances system that stops government regimes in current power to just do as they please entirely.
It's actually not a "huge" fraction of the budget. Fiscal year 2015 proposals for the budget:
Yes it is a large amount of money, but it is 16% of the total budget. We could chop out military spending entirely and have tons of problems still.  A lot of our military spending could be argued as fruitless, or aimed at expensive government contracts to biased parties, but you will be hard pressed to defend spending absolutely nothing on military. 
I also know that it is a massive misconception regarding "how much of the budget does America spend on its military." Media mongering makes people think it is the majority, which it is not. 
Saying what else you could have done with the money does not help to illustrate how much percentage of the budget something is. I am a big fan of getting us out into space, but one could easily argue that other problems are more important than getting cities on the moon. AFAIK, there's very little NASA interest in cities on the moon. That's the first I have even heard of it. Thought the interest was in getting us to Mars, which is happening. 
Easy to moan and groan about this and that and where the money ought to go. Try fixing it. Just imagine the task at hand to even begin to budget for the USA, or to fix just any one of the many problems. 
In the end, lets consider getting people to the moon. Is it really the fault of the US government? I think if the people truly wanted us to be on Mars, we would be there already. It's just not in the interest of the people, and the politicians are still slaves to the people here in the end. It is a 2-way street.

The idea, notably popular in the Roman Empire era, was that if there was just one government, no one would war. It would be so peaceful, there'd be no fights to be had if there was just one major power. 
Too bad the Roman Empire taught us that even when the Pope sides with one group to push out the other group, what ends up happening is factions within that winning group start to bicker and want power, then that group divides.
Thirst for power will always be there, same with corruption. There were always people who wanted to bring down the Roman Empire, and now look at Rome. It's a fun place to visit, but also depressing to consider what it was then, and what it is now. Rome is ruins, it is the past. 
There is no perfect government, and you cannot call what the Western world lives in today a "democracy." We vote in politicians at best, but we are really a republic. We elect a lot of our "actual voters" on policies and legislation (though keep in mind we vote for who we're given the choice to vote for...). Did you choose the republican or democratic nominees? You were served them on a platter for a choice. 
We actually have very little say overall. Since lots of people like to yell about Obama and Obamacare, I like to bring up Romneycare. Same thing, written by the exact same author. No matter who was coming in to office next, the same shit would have happened.
This system has worked for a while, but all these systems come crashing down. Political history is one of cycles, usually in the exact same order of government systems. It's pretty fascinating. 
Humans don't like equilibrium. If your cells reach it, they die. If your brain stem reaches it, you die. Struggling is what we're all about.

Interesting, would love to hear if it's just the emails that they didn't get, or if it's the bonuses as well. They should be trying to woo not only users who left, but also the ones who are sticking around. 
I am one of the people who left Bitstamp long ago. It's probably been over a year now since I did any trading with them.

I have a limited experience, and I suppose you wouldn't really know if someone was undercover government, but I have not found people who work for the anti-criminal (lol) government agencies are afraid to drop where they are from.
In the case of Force, he probably wanted bitcoiners to know he was DEA, since he probably thought that THEY would be worried that he was going to give them trouble with accusations of drug money.
Sometimes, these agencies also want you to know they are watching, and they want you to know, that they know, that you know they are watching.
The games are real.

There's a difference between accusing bitcoin as being a "huge NSA cracking grid" compared to something that simply increases hardware technology to the point of reaching something that "could" break SHA given enough R&amp;D. 
We always knew that something could eventually be developed to break SHA. It's almost inevitable, especially given the exponential increase regarding computing power year over year.

While I was a minor, I had the opportunity to purchase many drugs, and it wasn't via some website. Once a kid gets into middle school, if he wants the drugs, he can get them. There's always some kid, with some older brother, who will supply. 
You don't help keep kids away from drugs by adding barriers. That only makes the allure stronger. 
Same reason why teenage sex is higher in private Catholic schools.

In over his head. 
Wasn't prepared with what the business would grow to be, what he'd grow to be because of it, and what security precautions should have become. 
Just little things alone... sitting with his back to the outside world, allowing agents to get close enough so he wouldn't be able to just shut the laptop, that's close. 
Just seems insanely stupid if you're the kingpin running this massive underground black market not to at least sit in the corner so you don't have blind spots behind you, would have at least allowed him to shut the laptop, and things might have been far different. It's not just FBI agents that you should fear. Anyone who might want your BTC stash.
From the court docs, it sounds like he didn't originally start out very tech savvy, and it sounds like he put a bit too much faith in Tor.

The jealousy appears to me by the way you talk about him and the family. It's not "his father bank rolls him," it's his "daddy."
Why is it your business if his father is bank rolling him? Do you know best? Who might know best? The family or you? The Draper family is basically a lineage of venture capitalists. I am sure people said the same thing about Tim Draper initially too, or maybe still. Who knows, and, more importantly, who cares? Looks to me like the Draper family is looking to continue the line of investors, and getting Adam first-hand business experience is important. 
The Draper family is doing just fine, and Adam will likely continue down his path, if this is what he wants, and he will be as successful as his dad and grandfather. The only business you have worrying about Adam is whether or not you should trust in his businesses, or, if you're an investor, whether or not Adam is competent yet in choosing companies. Now, sure, he's a risk. Because of that, to continue pushing him forward, someone with some other sort of interest in him needs to bank him, so family kicks in. Yes, it's on a larger scale, but families support their kids and dump money into them all of the time with things like college or sports. 
Let the successful investors continue to figure out where to put their money. Is it likely Adam has a lot to learn? Sure... but same goes to you, me, and everyone else.

The scene with Sen. Joe Manchin made me laugh so hard, where they meet up. Typical political posturing for dominance, really great showing of it, one of the most blatant that I've seen.
35:17: Hand shake, initiated by Spurlock with a perfectly sideways hand moves to arm grab by Manchin. Normally, it ends here if only 1 guy does the arm grab + tap, like a pat on the head, quick show of who is the dominant one.
35:19: No, Spurlock ARM GRABS and pats back! We've got a show down! Manchin locks his stance, and gaze.
35:20-21: Spurlock slips up, trying to start walking away from the now awkward handshake first, as he is in showbiz and awkward is no good... while Manchin holds steady, witholding Spurlock for just a moment. At this point, Manchin knows he has won, despite being shorter that Spurlock, but he needs to literally display it.
35:22: He proves it with a nice lower back-pat as they walk, since he is now guiding and in control, which is not returned, and dominance is set.
Game over Spurlock. It wasn't a fair fight though, posturing is all they do.
Wish he had patted him back, would have loved to see the next move.

My comment did not contain an air of "it's okay because others do it." My comment was in response to an ignorant claim, naming only the United States, and further only referencing military spending, which is a small fraction of the budget. 
It's not an America problem, it is a world problem. It's not a military problem, it's a free handouts problem, and free handouts across the board. It's not just welfare programs, it's jobs that shouldn't be had, rates that shouldn't be given, and palm greasing that shouldn't be done. 
It's politics. It's the human element. 
What are the countries not engaged in any form of deficit spending? Who do you think isn't taking part in corrupt politics which always boils down to money?

In none of these cases have I heard that someone was forever-restricted from their funds if they answered the questions, and the questions were not really privacy-invasion types of questions. They aren't asking you how many times you masturbate a week or what time of day you poop. They are just asking how you got the money, and what you do with it, so they can keep compliance with regulatory agencies just to provide you the services you seek. 
Your answer should just be the truth about it. If you are using bitcoin for illicit purposes, what in the heck are you doing using Coinbase? Bitcoin doesn't care what your uses are, but any legit MSB does and must. 
You can't have it both ways, you cannot have a large, established, trustworthy, funded company where you can entrust your funds...yet not have to deal with any regulatory compliance issues that come with the things you desire.
You don't *need* Coinbase to use, or pay with, bitcoin.

They were able to move in, with one of the requirements being that he couldn't shut the laptop, so they needed to be able to get him blind like they did. Since, if he was able to shut the laptop, it's likely he was running on a temporary instance that wouldn't leave any storage information behind when shut. Instead, they confiscated the laptop open with him logged into the SR Admin account. The defense tried to claim he had passed off the site, but he was clearly administrating the website at the time of the arrest. If he had been able to shut the laptop, it's likely things would have been much different, defense-wise.

No doubt, according to law, guilty as can be, but he must have had a mentor who, arguably, was the real head of the operation. Ross just didn't have the expertise to do any of this, especially to scale. I will be interested to hear the sentence. He's due some years, but 30 to life is overkill for what he "deserves" according to the laws and what the situation really was. My opinion doesn't matter, and you're absolutely right about anti-drugs in USA. That's changing, however.

I hardly think such a rude statement was useful here. Do you think an ordinary person in his situation would have been as nonchalant? It's not really a hindsight is 20/20 thing, it was more of a testimonial regarding how he must have been way in over his head, more than he knew. 
Anyway, not like that'll stick with you, captain prick. I wont capitalize your name either.
