Travala which recently changed its name from Conciergeio is a platform from which you can book everything travel related.
AVA is their token and their website is currently under renovation because of rebrand. Going to hit couple of exchanges on 18th May
This is where you can book everything travel related with fiat, major cryptos and their own AVA tokens 
Hope this helps in few days

My job involves only traveling and when you visit japan you realize that most of the places accept Bitcoin. Asia is revolutionary in its adoption

Japan is the most crypto friendly nation in the world. You can find plenty of small to big stores to make payments with bitcoin. There are plenty of places which have those sings of “We accept Bitcoin”

Bic camera is one of the biggest stores I can talk about besides the small coffee shops and car showrooms
