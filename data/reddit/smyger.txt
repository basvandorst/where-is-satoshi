Some countries accept only dollars, while some others accept only EUR. Both Litecoin and Bitcoin is global. In the perfect world I would like to see Bitcoin adopted by US government and LTC adopted by chinese government. This is to prevent corruption. Litecoin developers watch Bitcoin developers and Bitcoin developers keep an eye on Litecoin developers. Two strong open source alternatives is very important for crypto currencies in general.

You need to open your mind. The world is not black and white. Nothing will be set in stone. The whole world will not adopt only one crypto currency, but several. It's like saying when cars came, it was a new invention, that only one car manufacturer will exist. Bitcoin and Litecoin will coexist peacefully.

Sorry I don't understand this:
"The 9,600,000 public shares will receive the first dividends up to the value of 0.0035BTC/share, providing public investors a priority in receiving a minimum of 100% return on their investment."
What do you mean with public investors? Who are public investors? If I buy from BTCT.co tonight am I a public investor?
After you have paid out 0.0035BTC/share, will you stop paying out divends?
Also how much is total valuation of the company today with IPO?

If you mean the "View transaction button" in multibit where you can see Raw transaction it is gone because the transaction in multibit program is gone, yet there is still some other transactions (just the low ones) in the program but the big transactions is nowhere found. 
Is there a way I can find it somehow?
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:35:49
I have tried resetting the blockchain and transcations several times both from this day and from the day I installed multibit.
I admit I may have fucked this up, because I resetted the blockchain before all transactions were confirmed. Is this why I lost all coins?
If there is anyway I can fix this and you help me you will be rewarded with BTC.

@_date: 2013-10-30 17:50:56
By strengthening each other, what I mean by that is that Litecoin is used as a testing ground for new Bitcoin functions while Bitcoin is the big brother deciding what should be the standard. That is not possible with old commodities like Gold and Silver. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:41:05
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:33:31

@_date: 2013-10-30 17:45:00
You don't understand how markets work. There will always be alternatives, Litecoin is a safe heaven when BTC goes down and vice versa. Free market in work. Two strong open source currencies where one is Silver and one is Gold , not competing with each other but strengthening each other.

Take your fucking rake profit and fund it yourself. No reason to beg for money if you are already making A LOT of profit. 
Or maybe if you want funds. Make a stock. IPO.

The best altcoin exchange out there, no doubt. 
This feature with sharing profits with the all the users, giving away interest on all deposit is something we should demand from every exchange. Hell even Mtgox should do this.

In my mind right now: 
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:50:11
I'm installing it right now.
But what I'm afraid of is that the bitcoins didn't go off the Multibit client. I tried sending it to Blockchain wallet. 
But didn't get any confirmation of it, I then waited for 2 hours and tried resetting blockchain and transactions. My question is, if Multibit fails to send the bitcoins to an adress does it get returned to the old adress?
Thank you very much for helping.

What you are all missing in this thread is that there are still around 50% of all coins to be mined. That means it doesn't matter if one person owns 25% of it, because he will eventually die before all bitcoins is mined.
