Noob bere. What happens to a bit tip if the receiver never collects? 
My first tip was posted a couple of days ago to a casual stranger in a r/politics sub and it's still hovering in anticipated brilliance.

New to this tipping thang... so forgive me if these are already available: 
Option to make an adjustable time limit that would notify you of any uncollected tips.  (Still not certain if and when my poor alone and ignored tips will remain in limbo)
More options for notifications of tip status aside from site-specific messages (text of email, etc). Thanks for your time!

Error when registering.  Attempted again and it looks as if their site is displaying a "scheduled maintenance" page.

Lov-ed this part: "Bitcoin is an insurrection. Holding Bitcoins is a way for individuals to reject the legitimacy of the welfare-warfare state. Bitcoin is a vote of no-confidence aimed directly at the very concept of governance."

Please explain then. How did you take back your tip? By what magic doest thou possess?  Limited funds? Cancelation phrase?

What does placing the word "private" do here? Should it change this post's appearance?

Never had the berries! Only the fish... where have you been all these years!?
