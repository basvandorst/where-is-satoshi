Says no transactions detected. I searched the address of my Trezor wallet which is the same address I put into gdax to withdraw to.

Also can someone confirm that this private message I received below by "Jaber21" is a scam. It looks like he's trying to get me to send bitcoins to him.
"go to your gdax account, and click on “accounts” scroll down to bitcoin and click “send” you’ll then want to enter
into the address bar. Then enter the amount of bitcoin you want to send. This is the blockchain verification block. (This affirms the bitcoin is yours and is actually in your possession), After this, you receive an email from gdax verifying everything is legit, and they ask you to connect your wallet to their website. They will send you a referral link that will instantly down and sync your trezor"

In this highly upvoted comment Bitcoin is said to be a pyramid scheme. There is a lot of discussion about this below the comment. 
Is this true? What makes bitcoin not a pyramid scheme, and how will Bitcoin stabilise in the future?

In coinbase is says "Transferred bitcoin from Gdax", and then just above it, it says Sent "bitcoin - pending".
And yes it's for the tiny test amount I wanted. So that confirms it hasn't been lost or anything?

Ah it's appeared in Trezor now, I checked just after viewing that transaction.
Thanks mate!
