just withdrawals? Like xapo with bch?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:38:32
They can steal and sell your funds?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:20:52
I did not receive the first email and the second came a week before. In attempting to close my account, do they not have to return what is rightfully mine? Theft is theft
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:00:48
Are they really?
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:27:10
FDIC insured
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:20:11
Only 200,000 tons?

Gathering names of customers for a class action. (not coinbase who already gave a timeline, just circle). If you know of any, let me know.

Never received first email, and a week's warning is not sufficient. hloders do not "log in" frequently. Their website was crashing when I did attempt to. If you have nothing to offer but "sucks bruh", fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:34:21
Ahh i see ok, thanks for your help anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:05:11
Well worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:32:55
LOL trust me I have more than you and its worthwhile for me to sue. So I'll hlod tyvm, and you fuck off little man.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:25
It's not laziness or negligence. They are FDIC insured up to 250,000. By the time i received the email, their website was glitching enough that there was no way to move anything.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:33:42
not coinbase, im fine with a timeline for the release of my funds. But circle has offered nothing.
and I agree, unleashing the lawyers always works, but the headache omg. Unless you're pissed off then it's worth every penny and second.

The sausage fest of sausage fests
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:26:38
returning my property is not their problem?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:15:49
Yes, for all the smug fucks like you out there, we know. They are FDIC insured, I didnt not know that they were also incompetent. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:13:59
well what are we waiting for, you bring the shovels.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:25:41
A developer, perfect, ok so question. Just implementing wallet withdrawals, like xapo did for Bcash and Gold. How difficult is that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:06:25
Easier with more people. Don't mind the handful of us, but we could use more pressure.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:10:57
and gold? It's a general question, and if there are any lawyers here with experience, please DM me. Not sure our family lawyer is well versed with the whole scene.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:36:54
sigh, I know it was a bad move in hindsight, I just didnt want all my eggs in one basket. I've already moved them out. The others and I just want our fork coins back.
