What do you mean?  Even with something like bitcoin, if someone refuses to pay you the bitcoin that rightfully belongs to you, you could seek legal recourse if you wanted to, right?  Otherwise how can you protect the private property that's rightfully yours?  It's the same with this system.  The gold or silver belong to you, but if for some reason Quintric (the company that issues the Quint tokens that I mentioned) refuses to give it to you, then you could seek legal recourse just the same.  But that's not actually built into the system itself, you know?

On this chart you can see that while there are ups and downs, the price of gold (as priced in USD) is predominantly *going up.*  This is because the value of the US dollar (which the prices in this chart are measured in) is mostly *going down.*  So really, it is mostly the US dollar which has been changing (losing lots of value through inflation), wheras gold has been staying relatively stable.

You know that's only worth about 8¢, right?  But sure, I could just send you a portion of one of my Quint tokens, which is a crypto-certificate backed by legal tender (read: not subject to capital gains taxes when used for everyday transactions) gold.

If BTC is like gold then why is its price so extremely volatile?  Volatility does not make for an ideal currency (as you can't make loans with it, have stable prices, etc.).  The purchasing power of gold, on the other hand, has stayed relatively stable for 1000s of years.  I do value the technological benefits of BTC though (easily carried and exchanged worldwide, extremely divisible, etc.).  What would you think of digitally tokenizing gold so that it has these technological benefits while also providing stability?

Well, if they did refuse to give you the gold and silver that belongs to you, you would be able to seek legal recourse as  they are a legal escrow service.  As for the government taking it, sure, that could happen, but couldn't that happen with any asset you have if the government becomes too powerful?  True, the government did seize gold before, but at least they did pay people for it, and this action has been basically universally condemned so I think it's unlikely to happen again.

Backed by US minted gold (and silver) stored in a vault in Utah that has several high-def cameras in it, which will be constantly live-streamed onto the company's website so I can check it, compare it against the blockchain ledger, and see for myself that all the gold they're supposed to have really is there :)

According to this quote, why use bitcoin specifically though?  Why not use actual gold?

Yeah that does sound like something Facebook would do unfortunately...

I think I'll be using this. Thanks for putting in the work for us to have a simple and easy way to stay up to date.
