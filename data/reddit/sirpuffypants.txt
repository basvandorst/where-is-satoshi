Umm the entire business world? You can literally just google this shit and find it out. Its not exactly a secret. There are numerous studies/articles talking about all the different liabilities cash creates for a business.
If you actually care about it at all, I encourage you to research it. But I'm not going to spend anymore time trying to convince a random internet stranger to google shit on their own.

Erm, no there isn't. I remember many years ago there were a few places that had that. I haven't seen one in well over a decade.

Because thats really is the singular, real benefit to **encouraging** cash payment to a business. Businesses operating legally still **accept** cash either because they must and/or to be accommodating, not because they want to. Someone pushing customers towards cash is incredibly suspect. If you wanted an similar analogy: personal checks. Thats what cash is going to be in a decade.
I mean if you want to really get into it, people talk about the 'costs' associated with electronic payment processing as if cash is somehow 'free'. Its not. Dealing in cash directly exposes your business to multitude of liabilities which, in non-cash payments, either do not exist or are assumed and handled by the payment processors and/or providers. 
However, with cash, now **you** are responsible for figuration out how to mitigate these in some way. This is why businesses dealing in substantial amounts of cash, more often than not, **pay** someone else to assist them in managing these liabilities.  But even paying for professional services, dealing in cash still carries significantly more liability and risk compared to digital payments.  
So naturally you should be asking yourself: why, given the reality of cash, would some one be actively encouraging a payment method with a higher cost to benefit ratio when done legally? Because they're likely doing something illegal.

Several small and medium business in 2 different states.


The only way I can think this could be 'huge burden' is if you're business model is atypical and you're paying your employees min wage without benefits. If you're paying your employees a living wage and grossing enough that payment processing costs are higher than an employee cost, payment processing costs are going to be minuscule compared to either your overall payroll or tax liabilities.
I'm not about to tell you how to run your business. People have different goals for what they want to accomplish. But I can say for a fact that if payment processing was ever 'a huge burden' I would carefully re-examine cash flow and/or the payment provider I was using.

I've run my multiple businesses: this is 100% what is going on. Any remotely sane owner knows payment processing is minor cost of doing business in the 21st century. You're going to lose way more business antagonizing customers over payment options, than you'll save. 
On the other hand, know what *is* a huge cost of doing business: taxes. Know what cash lets you avoid easily: taxes. Typical combined tax rates are 30%+, but a good chunk of that is on net profit. Any cash you take in under the table not only isn't taxed, but *also* reduces the tax liability on over the table because your net profit is decreasing (still incurring the costs of doing business for the cash transaction, but legally 0 gross profit for it).

No, its not a thing in the US.
