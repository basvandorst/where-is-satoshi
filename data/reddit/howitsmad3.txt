Tax credit in my country just about covers it, don’t worry

Seems wise, thinking of moving a sizeable amount of my savings if I get back in though, maybe 5 or 10x what I invested First time out 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:30:09
Hmm you make a great point. I just “know” that overtime the technology won’t seem as ground breaking. Imagine a value over time graph 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:47:51
Hahaha great point, just looking for alternative opinions and hoping someone in here will have more sense or know how on the situation than I have. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:50:26
Yeah back into the stronghold currency that is the Euro lol

The aggression, manipulation and borderline psychotic refers to the way posts used to be replied to within this subreddit with people wanting to be as positive as possible on bitcoin as reddit was often a first point of entry to speculative investors. 
Aggression as well refers to the price, when anyone with some common sense should have paused to genuinely think if this “asset” or “currency” was overvalued or hyped like past trends...

Ok, thank you.
Seems like this currency is being destroyed by the investment scene, shame.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:56:52
Why’s that? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:25:27
hahaha well I'd imagine the fees are a lot lower these days \*shrugs shoulders\*  
but nah i initially bought some to use as a currency (VPN's etc) but last year that kind of became impossible...
maybe i'll get back in one day

No control over the price mate 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:46:05
I work in the gambling industry. 
3x in like 6 weeks is a great ROI, plus I’m not too pleased with the high fees and huge insecurity. 
I mean no one who’s invested has any control over their money, that should be more worrying to others than it seems to be. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:56:23
Hahaha I like it 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:52:07
How so? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:25:50
Haha Bitcoin is a crypto currency that’s very use is being hampered as it becomes an asset.
Plus, futures have just become an option it become more and more like a business every week.

I’m not that convinced in the technology, it’s easily duplicated (other cryptos) and during the dotcom boom/crash the technology seemed as ground breaking 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:40:20
He is right. Does no one in remember the last big boom and crash? I’m only 21 and can remember it clearly haha a lot of people lost huge amounts of money. This is like a Groundhog Day. The tech before the dot com boom was as fascinating back then as bitcoin is today. When the banks and conglomerates figure out how to regulate and monetise the technology themselves bitcoin won’t seem as attractive. 
Having said that I’m still in on BTC at 4000 and hold some alts too. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:21:08
Would appreciate some advise guys. Basically I’ve €2000 to invest. At this current point in time. BTC and ETH seem like the best things to get into. Should I split it 50/50 or is there any reason to choose one over the other?
Also in a worst case scenario situation. Do any of you see both these currencies every dropping by 80-90%? I mean who knows what can happen out there. 
Any way thought I’d ask here as a few of you seem really knowledgable. And at the end of the day we’d all like to make some money off of what could be this wave or bubble.
