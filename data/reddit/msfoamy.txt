Hey thank you!  Now I get to learn about how ChangeTip works - fun.
So, you know they say that sitting for prolonged periods increases risk of heart disease?  I'm going to go ahead and agree with you that standing and being more mobile will, ahem, increase blood flow and have positive benefits.  To the moon!

Absolutely - we're using Shopify for the online store and they make it very easy to add Coinbase or BitPay as a payment processor for accepting Bitcoins.  With our setup, the customer can opt to pay with Bitcoin instead of a credit card just like they may opt to pay with PayPal instead of credit card.
We setup a Coinbase account and linked it to our business checking account (at a credit union). We don't actually keep any of the business's funds in Bitcoin avoid the volatility.  We just see Bitcoin as the payment mechanism - for now.
Customer pays us with Bitcoin, Coinbase exchanges the Bitcoin to USD for us and then transfers to our business checking the same day.  The Bitcoin to USD exchange fee is 1% (this is in place of the typical 2.9% to process credit cards). You can see what the checkout process looks like on our store if you're curious.   Just don't send Bitcoins / enter credit card information if you don't want a standing desk!
If there were more merchants out there offering services that my business could use, I'd spend the Bitcoin with them instead of exchanging it to USD.

"Thank you to Spendabit"
-Erector Desk
I was very happy to find your website.  The more places we can actually spend Bitcoin and not get into complicated MSB laws, the better.

Thank you!  The desk is meant to be kept at a standing height that’s comfortable for your body - set it and forget it kind of idea.  Everybody's ideal desk height is going to be different depending on body height, arm length, preferred elbow angle... the desk though can only really go between 38 and 45 inches.  I know a kid who's around 5' tall that uses the desk (but I think he uses a little stool) and a 6'4" guy who uses it.  I'm 6'1" and mine is at about 41".
Our thought when designing the desk was that it’s easier / has less mental friction to switch positions if you just pull up a stool instead of raising and lowering your whole work surface.  This is the stool that I use and I switch between sitting and standing a lot:

Now for how you go about adjusting the height, it’s pretty straightforward.  The height is adjusted by a set screw on each of the four corners. You simply raise each corner to the height you want, then hand-tighten the set screw (with the included wrench) to keep it there.

Thank you! It's too early to say on the proportion of sales we'll get with Bitcoin payment vs credit card but I'm very interested to see as well.  I think that there would be a crossover between people willing to consider an alternative way of setting up their workspace and people interested in alternative currencies.

Heads up?!  PMs??  You nasty.

Thank you!  And of course you deserve a discount code for being awesome.  Use "Bitcoin" at checkout.

Oh the stools, and the monitor arms, and the matching Erector Desk headbands... it was very tempting but we decided to keep variables low and just focus on doing a really good job with the standing desks.  Cheers though!
And I'm all ears on how we can communicate better and provide more info.  Most of our customers are buying via the website and they're going to want to feel like you know what they're getting before irreversibly sending over Bitcoins right?

I would not recommend trying to eat Bitcoins.

How people actually use Bitcoins IRL was fairly mysterious a week ago.  Then I listened to a Joe Rogan Experience Podcast with Andreas Antonopoulos about Bitcoins ([ and have become somewhat addicted to learning more... I think others can relate :)
If anyone else wants to chat about how to accept Bitcoins from a beginner's perspective / small business owner's perspective, I would be very happy to share what I've learned.  Please reach out!

Please do not try to do that with coffee on your desk.
It's meant to be something you dial in over the first day or so and then leave alone. We think it's a more elegant solution to pull up a stool rather than change the height of your desk every time you want to switch standing and sitting - and making switching as easy as possible really is a good idea.

Gotcha, that horizontal bar can be moved back very easily with the hex wrenches we include for assembling the desk.  We just put it in the middle by default so that the desk can be approached from both sides.
Also, I should point out that this is a standing-height desk and that we're recommending you do take sitting breaks - but with a stool.

Well there's always the [hamster thing](bit.ly/1o8NBna).  I don't use a treadmill with the desk but have a few people who've fit one under and like walking (slowly) while they work.  Seems like patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time to me.

We're in favor of standing desks for the increased mobility and non-exercise activity thermogenesis. Switch positions, keep moving, take breaks like you say. Standing in a static position and never taking a break really isn't a goal we'd get behind either.

I like the club!  Are you exchanging into USD immediately? or have you found useful ways for your business to spend Bitcoin that avoid the exchange transaction cost?
I'd love to be able to just keep the business's funds in the Bitcoin economy, but it's too volatile.  So the only viable choices I see are to spend or exchange.
