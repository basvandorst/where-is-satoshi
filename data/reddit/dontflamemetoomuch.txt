That's exactly what I intend to do. The point of a 529 is that he'll have the freedom to choose whatever route he wants. If I don't save for his education, I could be denying him that opportunity. If I do save, it's still not forcing him to go that route.

So long as bitcoin is a relatively small part of a diverse set of investments, this is smart. If you're treating bitcoin like a lotto ticket, please reconsider. A sub I frequent on my 'less anonymous' reddit handle is Lots of __amazing__ advice there. Lots of people willing to give practical advice and instructions on topics ranging from working through school, saving for a down payment, paying off credit card debt, saving for retirement, and becoming financially independent. The advice there is far far more practical and repeatable than you'll find here.

Is this a case of Poe's law in action? I don't know where to start here..
1) Are you majoring in Corporate finance or do you have a degree in finance. I didn't know a degree could major in anything... is... is your degree studying corporate finance? Is that possible?
2) Your degree in corporate finance... is it a masters? I feel like it should be a masters since most undergraduate degrees are more general. For example, there's no such thing as a "Bachelor's in Inorganic Chemistry" because that would be stupid. Similarly, the only "corporate finance" Bachelor's degrees I could find were from those shitty scam schools like University of Phoenix and Kaplan. Anyways, for someone whose so concerned about credentials, I'm surprised you didn't tell me _exactly_ what your degree is.
3) You have a degree in corporate finance but you don't know the difference between banking and investing?
4) You have a degree in corporate finance but you apparently think it's worthless... circling back to  did you go to a shitty scam school rather than a real college? That might explain why nobody is hiring you to do their books.
5) You have a degree in corporate finance but you don't know how portfolio diversification works, or why one might want a diverse portfolio (before you say something else stupid... owning Bitcoin __and__ Ethereum isn't diversification).
Pardon me if I'm skeptical.

Oh totally agreed. I'm not convinced that college, in its current form, will last forever. I do think that valuable paid education options will probably exist for a long time.
My cousin is a great example. He didn't do great in highschool. Dropped out of college after 1 year. He was always mechanically inclined though and enjoyed working on his car for practical reasons and as a hobby. Several years after quitting college he enrolled in a 18 month trade school for auto mechanics.  Ended up graduating at the top of his class, did extremely well on some standardized tests. These days he earns great money at a dealership. 
My point is that he taught himself the important parts. Just being passionate and engaged about something gets you very far. A trade school supercharged his skills and gave him access to indicators he could use to get a better job.

You're giving me self-conflicting assessments of fiat currency. The stock-market can't be over inflated at the same time as currency is losing value. If fiat currency was losing value, then we'd expect to see soaring valuations in the stock market, wouldn't we?
That's the nature of owning assets rather than currency. Asset value is determined by market pricing, not by government edict. Index funds, especially those backed by companies with physical and intellectual assets (as opposed to bonds) will hold value as long as the world economy is even mildly functional.
So which is it; is the stock market over-priced, or is fiat currency dying?

Nothing is "secure" from the prospect of "what if our monetary system collapses and we enter a second, and larger, international great depression". Bitcoin is a decent but also imperfect and incomplete hedge against that.
That said, 529's are extremely secure tax advantaged savings accounts for education. The investments are limited to broad and diversified index funds and they usually offer a grab-bag of domestic and international stocks and bonds. So... not perfect, but good. Said another way, if college education still has value in 18 years, my son's 529 is also likely to have value.

It's technically still waiting on ACH transactions to clear. Of course I'm setting aside 20% for cap-gains. The 529 contribution limit is related to gift tax limits. I'll be talking to a professional before I pull the trigger.

I'm extremely fortunate... lucky really... that I won the birth lottery and was born into a family that could afford my college education. I did have to take debt, but only in the last 2 years. I'm well balanced, married, gainfully employed, and happy. I give to charity and, although I don't __love__ taxes, I pay them ungrudgingly because I know that my taxes help those less fortunate than myself. My point is. My parents helped me through college and I turned out alright.
Under the right supervision, a college education can be an extremely helpful and productive gift. If "sink or swim parenting" works for your family, then go for it. But I know from experience that carefully administered assistance can be an amazing and productive thing.

1) wow - putting my money where my mouth is would be diversifying my assets. Going from one bubble looking for another doesn't get me out of chasing bubbles. And I've absolutely diversified my investments since I'm not an idiot.
2) Just what? So you're saying that what bitcoin really needs to take off is another currency, a "settlement layer"?  Then what the fuck is the point of bitcoin? A "store of value"? Why store value there? I could store my value in property and at least make money on rent. I could store value in a farm and make money on the crop. I could store my value in stock of a company that is growing or pays dividends. The entire point of bitcoin having __any value__ is that it's a transactional medium, and the whole point of the response was that bitcoin is a SHITTY transactional medium.
I think there's great value to solving the byzantine general's problem, but the big banks don't need bitcoin to implement its solution. It's arguable that a similar solution could be implemented without the trappings of currency and with some elements of trust (ie; limiting compute resources to a quorum of pre-authorized institutions). That last proposal probably sounds like sacrilege to the true believers, but financial markets don't run on true belief they run on money. Fiat money.

My major was quite useful and I am where I am today because of it. Yes you __can__ waste your time in college, but if you're driven; if you treat it like you'd have to treat a young business, it can be worth the money.
529s are not limited to college tuition either; they are flexible enough to cover whatever sort of education is valuable. The one thing that won't change in the next 20 years is that people with specialized skills will continue to be more in-demand than people with a GED equivalent.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:44:17
What you literally said


This is exactly what I haven't done nor is it what most tax advantaged long-term savings accounts offer. Maybe you do have an education in finance, but your bullishness or your inattentiveness made you stick your foot deep in your mouth. Don't double down on it and try to pretend you meant otherwise.
Edit: u/lazmanc : has an education in finance from a top school, but advocates dumping all your money into a single highly volatile and speculative asset. I hope your job doesn't put you in a position where you advise people on investing.

This 100% - I'm not out of BTC by any means - but locking down a substantial win is not regrettable even if bitcoin makes another 10x gain.
if bitcoin performs a 10x three more times, and I sell one each time. I'm still a multimillionaire. If bitcoin crashes tomorrow, my son still has college savings.

Few things -
1) I didn't mine full time, out of respect for my wife and our small apartment, I had the computer off at night since the fan was noisy.
2) Although I was aware of and followed bitcoin news throughout 2011, I didn't get a card until mid/late summer; some time after the first big price spike at also corresponded with a big difficulty spike. In the first month of mining I think I made somewhere between 8-10, over the next year I made the remaining ~1.5-3.5 bitcoins. By mid 2012 I just stopped mining since the rate of return was so low. I kind of checked out of the market for a long time after that - just making sure to keep my keys well hidden and well backed up.

Tomorrow when you're on your way to work at footlocker or whatever retail shit job you do. Just remember this conversation and how you deftly proved your financial prowess to a stranger on the internet. Then visualize the secure and diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies you are spending your beer money on. Feel reassured about how secure and sure that investment is, and imagine how good it will feel when cryptocurrency replaces the entire world economy and you're an instant millionaire. Remember, just for a moment, that cryptos always appreciate faster than credit card interest, so it's really ok that your Visa is maxed.
That moment, feeling superior and excited about the future. You earned it buddy.
Poor me on the other hand. Tomorrow, I'll be using my _worthless_ college degree at my 9-5 office slave job. Getting paid by _the man_ to do his bidding. My slow and conservative investing strategy could take another decade to grant me financial independence. The fact that only a relatively small percentage of my entire portfolio is in cryptocurrency is a tribute to the failure in vision that I have. Adding insult to injury, my poor children will have to live only getting a debt-free college education while your children, I'm sure, will be multimillionaires with one yacht each and no need for the rat-race starter line that is a college education.
If only my worthless degree was "majoring in corporate finance" I might have your insights.

Or inherent utility. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:31:57
If you aren't bullshitting me; then don't bullshit other people. It's fine to invest in crypto, but in your own words, you have to understand risk/return. Since the fundamentals of cryptocurrency pricing is still unknown, it's inherently an extremely risky investment.
I don't know if you saw the pour soul elsewhere in this thread that implied she was saving for her own college payments (this year) in bitcoin. There's people out there that are going to lose their skin if/when bitcoin takes another multi-year downturn like it did after 2014. Don't be the guy that encourages that sort of risky, stupid, behavior. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:45
As explained elsewhere, I'm not keeping the savings as fiat; 529s allow investment in index funds which are a pretty decent way to store and grow _value_ no matter what happens to the US dollar over the next 18 years.

I think what people mean is, "I don't trust any exchange that will shield me from paying tax." That's a valid concern, which is why I'm going to be paying capgains. I went through coinbase. As always, I send the minimum necessary for my transaction. Everything I have left is stored securely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:06:21
You're missing some important points. It's shitty for transactions because -
1) It's volatile (or in your words, it's still in the price discovery phase).
2) It's deflationary.
3) Transactions are expensive on absolute terms (5-15$ per transaction is insane).
4) Transactions are slow on absolute terms (most of the world's banks clear transactions on the order of seconds, without sacrificing security).
5) Using bitcoin is notoriously difficult to do securely... Verified transactions themselves may be immutable, but your private key is either extremely inconvenient to use, or vulnerable. Those are the two possible states.
As you've said... this is the __current__ state. So where can we go?
 * Make transactions cheaper? Well, that was tried and lead to one bitcoin fork (almost lead to 2 forks). On bitcoin mainline it's still insanely expensive even after SegWit.
 * Make wallets more secure? Not without adding trust back to the system (the lack of which is one of the strongest arguments _for_ bitcoin).
 * Make it less volatile, or inflationary? Not without governance and "central banking".
The problem of course is that anything that would make it easier to use as currency attacks value of the currency held by bitcoin miners and bitcoin mainters. So real reform, reform that would help it become a market dominator, is effectively impossible.
I really believe that cryptocurrency will one day be king, it will be so common that we will just call it currency. The chances of this being caused by anything other than government intervetion is low.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:22:52
Yes, but I'm also considering that the cost of college has appreciated faster than the stock market over the last 10 years. I'm hedging here and I'd rather be over prepared than underprepared.
529s may look a lot different in the future, but as they are now, the account holder can change the beneficiary at any time. If that rule stays intact, it means that if I've over-prepared for my children's education, then I'm just going to roll over those savings to my grandchildren. I'm not actually worried that I'll be over prepared, but, as you've pointed out, you never really know.

Go to Bitcoin was (and thanks to my recent sale, __is__) a relatively small part of my entire portfolio. The investing and saving advice there is far more scalable than you'll find here. The specific issue you mentioned can be addressed with some or all of the following tips.
1) Have a larger rainy day cushion before you start investing.
2) Invest a significant portion into stable index funds that are at least partially backed by bonds (this will make your invested money more liquid and less susceptible to market swings, at the penalty of lower rate of returns).
3) Invest another portion into tax advantaged deferred retirement accounts that you can't access without penalty. This is a good place for medium risk investments (stock market backed index funds). That way market swings in the 3-5 year timescale won't affect your family funds.

When I started in 2011, invested $200 to upgrade my graphics card (I should have used that money to buy ~200 bitcoin but thats neither here nor there).
My point is, I have a substantial rainy day fund already just from my day job and being frugal. I also have retirement investments. I'm not rushing out to dump those into bitcoin. My portfolio over the last week had become uncomfortably heavy in value from bitcoin. I'm simply rectifying that situation. I'm still quite heavy and considering selling 1 or 2 more, but perhaps the [endowment effect]( is too powerful

Obviously there's lots of uncertainty and if my son wants to go to an elite private college without scholarships, then he'll have to get some loans. That said, what I'm setting aside is enough for several years of tuition in the University of California system using today's dollars. Hopefully a diversified investment portfolio in his 529 should help that keep pace. So, he may have to pay for college, but he's going to have a good runway whatever route he chooses and in some routes he could enter and exit college without ever taking debt.
I also have a daughter "on the way". Having so much set aside for my son means I can focus most of my savings on her college. My long-term goal is for both my children to have an inflation adjusted $50K set aside for college in today's money. This sale has just gotten me close to the finish line for one child much faster than expected.

Several people have already given the same kneejerk reaction. I've already addressed them multiple times. Please spend more time on There are financial tools that can mediate the risk of inflation. 529's, IRAs, 401k's are all designed to be excellent investment vehicles even in the face of inflation.

I make good money - not AMAZING money - but good. My daughter will be born soon and this will change her life as well as my sons. Because now I can focus my savings effort just on her. Absolutely I'm planning on paying both of their college tuitions. This early boost for my son will let me and my wife focus our savings on our daughter. At our current rate they'll be a parity by the time she's 8 years old. At that point interest/appreciation can do the heavy lifting for both of them.
Edit: also, depending on some variables, I may just split the money now and continue saving for both. I'm not a tax expert so I'm going to get somebody who is to advise me on how best to save this money without throwing any away on avoidable taxes.

To echo to you what I've told my wife. There's no magic bullet in life or investing. Do I regret not buying 500 btc back in 2011, of course, but I also regret not buying a bunch of AAPL when it was 5% of what it is now. Just make a bunch of small bets and some of them will pay off.  I don't have as many hobbies as I used to, but I'm still always looking for what's next. TBH I do think bitcoin has the potential to be a good investment (I would have sold all of mine if I didn't think that), but invest in moderation and save some money for other hairbrained ideas. Some of them might pay off, at minimum you'll learn a ton.

There's literally centuries of economic data that disprove your idiotic response regarding the use of a deflationary currency as a medium of exchange.
