Great. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:31:57
Yeah, somehow I keep holding onto faith that they'll improve... Because, how can they not with so much money at stake and the potential to be one of the best?  The thing is, I made so much money on margin positions with them. Before I used them, I tried Whaleclub and couldn't believe the margin rate was 8% per day! How could anyone make a profit on that? I didn't realize what I was doing and lost like 0.04 Bitcoin in 2 clicks in less that 20 seconds which was worth about $200 at the time I think. I wanted to buy on margin and Kraken seemed the only affordable place for a US resident to do it. I probably won't do much margin any more since I don't believe Bitcoin is going to go up like it was going any time soon, but maybe in some cases I will. Do you have any suggestions of where else to use?

Well, I don't have it, but I read on their site that "IF" you have created a master key, you can get in, but if not, you need to go through the process I'm trying to go through. Bottom line, it's my fault I'm locked out, I get that. I just started using 2FA a couple months ago and didn't understand that Google Authenticator wouldn't back up on my full phone backup, etc. I thought somehow it was linked to my phone number as well. I don't have the key. I need their help. It's my own stupid fault, I get it. That doesn't mean they shouldn't help me or at least respond.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:34:22
So, basically, I put up with having to try to place orders 20 times, from having errors more often than not, for the long wait times on support request... Because, I was able to make good money at a good rate. Because they're known for good security, etc... I have to say, I appreciate them in other respects... I've just lost my patience over this incident
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:37
Thank you. I'm gonna do that.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:13:44
Thanks. Interesting perspective
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:57:29
Yeah, I was thinking about giving that a shot. Any suggestions? I do think many people made some good points here: Definitely some educated, well-thought-out answers, but still, overall, heavily biased pro Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:12:49
Right on. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:20:06
I mean, I hear you, but we're not talking about some minor amount of energy consumption. Like, it's expected to take some energy to send transactions of anything, to do anything... But things can be reasonably energy efficient or completely energy wasteful, and, at this point, I don't see how more and more hashing power improves anything.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:11:37
Right on. Thanks for this. Minor detail though: that 110k is total energy, not total electricity, which is much lower, right?
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:09:24
Yeah, when Bakkt launched or was about to launch, they had this dumb statement that they were accepting or storing physical Bitcoins or something. I can't find it online for some reason (can anyone help?) but, unfortunately for Bakkt, they're going to be remembered for that. At least I'm going to remember them for that.
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:49:45
Makes sense.  Didn't think of it that way. Thanks man
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:15:55
True... But most of the replies (not yours) have helped to relieve me of my FUD which is good and which is one of the reasons for this sub, no?
@_date: 2019-11-01 05:06:14
Yup, I think you're right. I'll have to read up more on poisson distributions. Still, even if it isn't a standard bell curve, it seems like there should be a greater concentration of occurrences near the mean than crazy outliers but maybe there are and I just happened to be looking at blocks that were outliers.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:54:39
I think I get you and overall, I'm understanding more. Thanks for taking the time to explain, etc
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:31:39
I don't think this energy issue is going to cause value to go down any time soon and I'm still bullish on Bitcoin for the next few years at least. I think, at some point in the future, it could cause the value to go down but if I get out now it will be because I don't want to be a part of it which I'm not sure about yet which is why I posted this: so you guys could help me remember/realize why I should stay in.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:16:45
Well, there likely is some private keys to that address but nobody has it and nobody ever did and nobody ever will. You would spend 10,000 years on a fast computer trying to generate a vanity address like that.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:21:53
Thanks for this
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:03:34
Only if it's a physical Bitcoin though
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:08:19
I don't know. I can say that people are probably becoming more and more diligent about keeping and safeguarding their private keys including plans to pass them on if they die because the value of Bitcoin is more understood now. So, although Bitcoins will continue to get lost forever it will be at a much slower rate. Not like when guys had a few hundred Bitcoins on a computer and forgot about it or their hard drive failed and they never bothered to write down or backup their keys.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:51:11
Didn't know that. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:08:26
Lower supply. In other words, more rare.
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:53:05
So, I have a question about that in relation to the Lightning Network: if lots of addresses in a single transaction means the transaction size is large, does the Lightning Network really increase scalability by orders of magnitude if the transactions need to be committed to the chain later? By the way, what would happen if a single transaction was bigger than the block size?
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:26:52
Makes sense. Thanks. I bet though, for 400 blocks when you should average only 1 over 60 minutes, there were more like 10 in the blocks I was looking at. And, 40% of blocks should happen (on average) in less than 5 minutes so what are the chances of a 10 blocks in a row each less than 5 minutes? .4^10 =  .000105 and most were actually less than 3. But I get it and I think I just happened to be looking at some outlier data which is going to happen and I don't think I'm going to invest time in looking at more (I was actually looking at them for another reason). In any case, my daughter, who does not have dwarfism and whom no doctor has diagnosed with any disease despite trying, is around the .01 percentile for height (like, out of a 10,000 girls, she's shorter than 9,999) so, yeah, I can accept that rare things happen.
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:32:26
Funny, I just asked that same question in a different way in the comments. I don't know
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:06:48
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:25:19
Okay, so, maybe theoretically more hashing power improves security of the network, etc but, in practice it doesn't make a difference at this point. Like, if the hashing power decreased 20% today, it wouldn't mean any less transactions would go through (at least after difficulty readjustment) or be falsified, etc,  and no one is going to be able to 51% attack at that level either. It would be the same as if it increased 20%
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:30:59
Yeah, and actually, I don't know enough about the cryptography to say whether or not there is likely some possible private key that would generate a public key like that. In other works, would any randomly generated string that follows the pattern (like, regular expression validated) of a Bitcoin address (the original version addresses that start with a 1) have a corresponding private key and, if not, how likely would it be to have one?
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:33:46
Ban on mining only in certain countries maybe. What would be cool is if some countries enacted laws that said you had to use green energy to mine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:58:54
Right. Good points. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:49:10
I think because they were fresh coins... Coins that you can see on the block chain were block reward coins that had never been moved
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:06:30
Okay, enlighten me on what it's about then? I've researched a little, read a few different things on the topic. What do you want me to do? Spend a year and read everything I can and write a book about it before I ask a question or lay out my thoughts and concerns? If you're time is so precious, don't bother responding. I mean, I knew my post wouldn't get upvoted to the top of this sub so it's really just people who are digging deep in and want to answer people who may not be Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:14:45
Sweet. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:00:31
Right. Thanks for reminding me
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:28:06
Right on. I hear you
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:15:27
Right. Thanks
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:15:42
Thank you for responding. I don't have a deep understanding of the Lightning Network and I have looked into it but still don't get it completely. Let me rephrase my question just to make sure it's the same answer: if a channel involves transactions between thousands of different BTC addresses, then aren't the opening transaction and closing transaction going to be very large size transactions such that, even if the transaction size is much smaller than if it was a bunch of individual transactions, it's still a serious limiting factor such that the increase in total transactions BTC can handle (including all transactions on the channel as individual transactions) still doesn't increase more than 5x or 10x or something?
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:10:32
Thanks. I checked it out. Good stuff
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:22:08
Maybe, rather than Satoshi being multiple people, multiple people were Satoshi? Like Half Finney and Satoshi were the same person: Hal Finney. That's what I sincerely believe. I know he denied it, but I still think so.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:59:48
Sorry for what you're going through. Could you clue me in a bit about what you're talking about? Why is who losing? Who was hodling well in Russia?
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:48:39
Really, it wouldn't take a certain amount of money at all. I mean, let's say everyone cancelled all their sell orders up to 16k and then one guy bought at 16k. Of course, that's not going to happen, but, it I mean, perhaps, if people get excited that it's going to keep going up, enough people could cancel enough sell orders so that it wouldn't take as much buys to get up to 16k.
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:58:24
Right, like if the average life expectancy of a certain country was 50 but 45% were dying as infants and another 45% were living to 100... "What's up with what? The average is 50. End of story." Nothing to see there, right?
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:05:15
Makes sense. Didn't think of that. Price hasn't been too crazy the past 48 hours but it makes sense why they are adjusting so frequently and is going to cause a lot of anomolies. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:54:56
Yeah, seems doubtful at this point... But I think it's going to do some serious rising these last couple days of October... Maybe hit 11k or 12k... But, you never know with Bitcoin. If it hit 16k in the next few days, it wouldn't be the craziest thing to happen in Bitcoin. And if I'm totally wrong and it drops to 6k or 5k, that wouldn't be too surprising either.
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:52:25
Yes, I understand the gambler's fallacy clearly but it just didn't seem randomly distributed. Like, if I bet on 1 number in roulette, in a few thousand spins, there will be times I hit it 2 or 3 times in a row and times where I go over a hundred consecutive spins without hitting it... But, if I measured how many spins it takes to hit the number after each hit, it will be fairly normally distributed around 38. The blocks I mentioned seem to me to be the equivalent of going well over 300 spins without hitting the number and, then, hitting it 11 times in 80 spins... Which is going to happen in thousands and thousands of spins but it seems to be happening pretty regularly today and yesterday. But, if they adjust the difficulty that frequently, then I guess it sort of makes sense. I gotta think about it. Thanks for the info.

You may have forgotten one of the most important: Yuji Ijiri's "Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping": 
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:33:32
Remember a seed phrase? I've been using Bitcoin a long time and I don't remember mine. You mean "store" a seed phrase? You don't have to remember it
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:55:40
@_date: 2019-12-22 18:29:06
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:19:03
Thanks. Makes more sense now.
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:42:33
The problem is that it is a problem of being able to figure out private keys with quantum computing. Even if you forked, you would have to get everyone to move their funds to whatever the more quantum resistant wallets are because everyone would still need access to their funds with their OLD private keys. That's why you need to do it BEFORE it's a problem and there's still a problem because many people buy Bitcoin and just forget about it. "Hey, I'll see where things are at in 10 years and not even pay attention to the news on Bitcoin." It happened to me with an alt called HCash. I held HCash, forgot about, and missed some token swap and lost my funds. I dunno, I just think we need to plan ahead.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:20:33
Makes sense. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:17:04
Awesome. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:50:17
Sounds like you really understand it. What you say about the Wallet attack is true and it is why I think we need to implement quantum resistance 10 years before it becomes a problem. Even then, you're right... If the coins don't move for those 10 years and quantum computers become cheaper and really can break ECDSA, then they will eventually be stolen devaluing Bitcoin and creating FUD and I doubt the Bitcoin community, devs, etc would accept a "move coins to new addresses within the next 5 years or they will be frozen" type rule but maybe. I worry a bit about all this but I think, overall, we got good brains in the community. We just need people to see that, even if this problem seems really far off or maybe not even possible, we still should take it seriously and sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:24:02
Thanks. I think my fears have been put at ease by you and others now.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:37:45
Thanks all. Appreciate all the responses. My FUD about this is gone.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:43:59
Really? So it's just a made up threat? Also, given this comment:  [  which states that SHA256 is strong enough but we could soft or hard fork if it ever isn't, my question is really how would such a fork work? How would everyone still have their keys with no keys compromised?
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:36:01
Thanks. Sorry if I was causing any FUD. Def understand better now and not worried anymore.
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:33:00
Amen to that man. What's shit about Monero for example? Or Ethereum? Or even Litecoin? If they were shit, they'd be nothing by now but they're all up thousands of times what they started like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:53:16
Ha! Good one.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:20:07
Sweet. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:48:11
"The dominance of BTC will only be 40-46%". Doesn't give a date for that. Maybe he means, when it's a 1.5 trillion market cap? In any case, what does GRRM say about prophesies?
