You're obviously some random idiot trying to make easy money so Im gunna try to help you. Stop buying something you don’t understand. When you buy bitcoin as an investment this late in the game your basicly just begging early adopters to take your money. Seriously the easy money is gone GO HOME. You should sell and please stop buying things you dont understand.

Put all your money into Bitcoin and never sell. Also tell all your friends to put their money in too.

Other coins may have more potential for returns. Bitcoin is probably going to stay flat for a while so you wont make much. Other coins may be more risky but they might have more upside. A 10 dollar investment in an altcoin could triple, something unlikely to happen to bitcoin. If you like risk then grab some altcoins otherwise I would just stick with BTC.
