According to basic math the current system wont be able to go on forever. At some point you are going to have "huge issues", Bitcoin can work as a hedge against such an event.
If you arent disgusted by the current system then maybe greed can sway you. Bitcoin can also be used for speculation, it might go up, it might go down. I think most of us here foresee a huge upside to any investment we make in Bitcoin and that it will continue to go up in the future, albeit not in a straight line.
Bitcoin is the greatest invention since the internet, some say since fire. The power of Bitcoin becomes apparent the deeper you delve into the rabbit hole. Even if it might not be Bitcoin in the future, cryptocurrency in any form will change the world.
I recommend listening to any talks by Andreas Antonopoulus he explores all sorts of topics on cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. His talks are really eye opening.

Bitcoin is a way of opting out of a corrupt and immoral system run by the central bankers of the world. We haven't had the ability to create private currencies since 1863. In fact its actually illegal to create currency in the form of paper or metal coin, because it takes power away from the governments who want to control the money and the people.
I think this video pretty much sums it up

Sidechains, which do not yet exist, are blockchains which you could in theory strap on to the main bitcoin blockchain and that could function as their own ecosystem and that you could peg to Bitcoin so that when you transfer X Bitcoin to the sidechain u get Y amount of sidechain coins and your bitcoins are locked up until you move out of the sidechain again.
The article simply theorizes about what would happen if such a chain would die, as in stop functioning, and how you would get your pegged bitcoins out of that chain if that were to happen.

While your points may be true the REAL power of bitcoin is that the power to create money is removed from politicians.
Which means they can no longer wage debt fuelled warfare, both traditional and through currency manipulation.
They can no longer subsidise big corporations. Enslave future generations. Waste resources. Distort markets. Destroy savings... 
This will result in an even playing field and a return to true capitalism which means a higher standard of living for all.

"a form of investment (illegal in the UK and elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones."
There are no returns in bitcoin by itself and nothing is given. There is only appreciation and depreciation of price and people who take advantage of such price actions by trading in hopes of profit.

It seems though that this is already happening in an unpegged form because bitcoin is the main currency used to buy other cryptocurrencies and all these currencies are traded with bitcoin as the standard measurement of value. The only problem is that there are not that many places where you can then spend these currencies on things if you wished to do so and as such the only use is speculation or gambling if you wish to call it that.

High fees is a result of high demand and free market price discovery.
 If you go to the store and the apples are more expensive than you expected, do you tell the grocer that his apples are bugged? Same with TX times, the queue at the store is not a bug. A queue forms when a lot of people go shopping at the same time. So we can either reorganise the stores layout so that we have a smoother flow of customers at the register or we could invest in a bigger store.

I would argue that the problem isn't fees, but that we have a need for Bitcoin in the first place. The problem is that currencies issued by central banks can't be trusted. The real problem is that human beings are corruptible. The fee is what you pay to protect your wealth from these people.

"The OTC market has continued to grow, and there are an estimated 10–15 formal OTC brokers out there for Bitcoin with any real volume, and maybe 3–4 who are more well known and trusted, such as Harry Yeh of Binary Financial and a few more referenced by Wong Joon Ian in his Coindesk post, (which is well worth reading) on OTC Bitcoin trading. In the case of LocalBitcoins, they deal with smaller transactions but many exchanges also facilitate larger trades, off-book."

As he detailed in his latest post, they could possibly short the market to get a better price over the counter. The market cap is so small that such manipulation is entirely possible.
Edit: Here is the part from the blog;
"This also infers that, technically, exchanges today are thinly traded. If I wanted to buy $50m in Bitcoin, what would prevent me from shorting the market by with $2–5m, forcing the price down and then buying $50m in volume from OTC traders who have clients panicking? Market manipulation, although seemingly unlikely, is entirely plausible in a thinly traded market where large trades happen outside the exchange. This will change if and when the Bitcoin price and market cap is sufficiently large and liquid enough that 10k BTC trades (enough for an OTC tranche) would not move the price significantly."

No im with the republicans on that one, the "what almost every mainstream climate scientist says" is untrue, they skewed the statistics. The real number if you are referring to the Cook et al. study is "32% of climate studies agree we cause some warming".
So you are just gonna stop buying coffee because it will be 5 satoshis cheaper tomorrow?

Googled currency definition.
Top result
"1. a system of money in general use in a particular country."
Investopedia says
"Currency is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy."
Merriam Webster: 2
a :  something (as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange
So maybe one has to make a distinction between crypto-currency and fiat-currency because fiat implies the government forced part.

Keep it simple. Internet money. Install some wallets if possible. Tell them how to secure their wallet. What a seed is. Have them send a few satoshis to eachother. 
If you want to get technical, explain how bitcoin solved the double spend problem.
How the supply of bitcoin is distributed in a fixed and easily calculated manner.
Getting political is hard. Talking abou the fed and money creation you risk coming off as a kook. But perhaps you can mention bailins in cyprus. Inflation in venezuela. How it can help people in poor countries with fascist regimes.

We shouldnt cheer for government intervention in free markets. Its a slippery slope. Longer term i dont think its good for bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:09:16
"The manipulation consists of the Fed using bullion banks as its agents to sell naked gold shorts in the New York Comex futures market. Short selling drives down the gold price, triggers stop-loss orders and margin calls, and scares participants out of the gold trusts. The bullion banks purchase the deserted shares and present them to the trusts for redemption in bullion. The bullion can then be sold in the London physical gold market, where the sales both ratify the lower price that short-selling achieved on the Comex floor and provide a supply of bullion to meet Asian demands for physical gold as opposed to paper claims on gold."
Wouldnt this be alot harder to pull off due to the transparency of bitcoin?

Yet he has said he would like to see a return to the gold-standard:
"DONALD TRUMP: Bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but, boy, would it be wonderful. We'd have a standard on which to base our money."
src : 
Edit: Some more from mises on his econ policies "...the Trump team includes only one academic economist, and a heterodox one at that. Aside from its flawed trade policy, the Trump plan is broadly consistent with sound classical Austrian economics and focuses on cutting taxes, spending, and regulations and balancing the budget. While the plan is unfortunately silent on how a Trump administration would deal with the Fed and what monetary regime it would pursue, it is refreshingly free of any endorsement of the current Fed’s unconventional techniques for endless money creation, which redistributes real wealth and resources from productive Americans to parasitic financial firms and other capitalist cronies."

You can buy them from an individual via bank transfer or meet in the street:

People need to eat. Deflationary money does have the side effect though of lowering consumption which is very good for the environment. Savings themselves lead to an increase in productivity because people like to put their money to work, investing in businesses and ventures. And because money is worth more people are less likely to invest in silly things which means bubbles are less likely to occur.

If there is less candy in the store than there are kids who want to buy said candy, the price of candy goes up. In the Bitcoin store there are only 21 million candys and 4 million are estimated to be lost. The price will continue to go up until the market finds an equilibrium or balance between buyers and sellers or there are more sellers than buyers at which point the price starts to go down.

* Androids can still be hacked from within the device. Like if you download some sketchy app or you are on some public wifi or something. You know that shit you see on Mr. Robot. Only way a hardware wallet can be hacked is if someone threatens your life or if its tampered with.
* Bank accounts i dont know really, depends on where you are in the world. Maybe search through this subreddit and see if your bank shows up? Its never safe to upload your personal info and especially not through equifax but sometimes its the only way. If you are only going to buy a few hundred maybe try coinbase instead. I think you might be able to do it there without verification. Are you sure you need to verify to buy a few hundred on Quadriga?

If you prefer to use a Bitcoin-ATM you can check if there are any in you are here

As long as there are more buyers than sellers the price will increase. Price always searches for value, its called price discovery, we go where no man has gone before, looking for what the price of Bitcoin might be.
Sometimes the market finds out that it was wrong, then a big price increase or decrease can happen, this is called a correction.
Just looking at the fundamentals, There are only 16,708,000 Bitcoins in existence. 4 million are estimated to be lost. There are 5 billion people with access to banking, these are people who can buy Bitcoins. Doing the math you quickly find out that Bitcoins are in fact very scarce and that this price increase may not only be sustainable but that we might be in for further price increase as long as adoption continues at this rate.

When you trade on margin you borrow from the platform part of the money you want to trade for. For example on Bitmex you can margin trade with 100x which is crazy. So if you trade on 100 x margin with 1 bitcoin they lend you 100 bitcoin and take your bitcoin as collateral. So if price moves 1% you profit or loss will be 100 x that.
 this site display margin longs vs shorts data on bitfinex, as in how many people or how much money to be exact, is buying on margin and how many people are selling or shorting on margin.

Its a bit like being a psychologist and the market is your patient, trying to explain and predict your patients behaviour. 
Things like resistance levels are pretty easy to find, it can be just a number like $600. Because 600 sounds nice and round. Like when you go to the store, they sell things for $999 instead of $1000. Its just a dollars difference but has a huge impact on wether people will buy it or not. 
Resistance levels in a chart could be found by for example looking at the lowest and highest price within 1day, a week, a month. Its the point where the price usually bounces off.  
Triangles try to measure where the price will eventually break out after a move. There are ascending and descending triangles and even sideways triangles like after a pump or dump the price usually retraces 50% and then goes sideways until enough pressure has built up for the next move.
Most of it's guessing and trying to understand how a bunch of people react in certain situations. I would say tho that a good analysis is right 60% of the time. And if you are persistently good well then you are in profit.

He puts it into perspective in the post
"For output 46 (which was spent to the same address as outputs 40 through 45), that's a search space of about 35 trillion keys in about 1.3 million seconds. That works out to about 27 million guesses per second. With output 50, it's around 563 trillion keys and 20 million seconds which is just over 28 million guesses per second. For comparison, on my computer, brainflayer can currently do about 1.5 million guesses per second in incremental search mode."
"Fortunately, even at a trillion times those cracking speeds, it'd take longer than the age of the universe to have even a 1% chance of cracking the key for a single randomly generated address, so there is no cause for concern."

I wasn't too surprised at that until I looked at the transaction details - there was regular activity there right up until the week before he passed away and then nothing after that… until 2 years ago when the total balance at the time of 147 bitcoins was transferred out of it. This made no sense to me, unless someone else had a copy of his account or had hacked them from him somehow. But then I checked the history log on the computer and lo and behold it had been started up several times on the date the transfer happened.
Going back to my parents I asked them if anyone else had used the computer since they got it back from storage. They remembered that yes, two years ago my brother's old roommate looked them up and asked if they still had his computer and could he use it to get a copy of some files to do with their old rental. They had let him use it for a couple of hours and he left afterwards and hadn't heard from him since. I looked him up on social media and from his post history it seems like he suddenly came into some serious money judging from the purchases and activities he was involved with at around the same time.

Is Bitcoin a productive use of capital, is any wealth storing asset productive?
If it isn't productive we can expect the tightening of monetary policy to have a negative impact on Bitcoins price... on the other hand if it is productive... as accumulation of capital genetally leads to increased productivity... well then we are in for one hell of a ride.

I agree in a way but monetary policy usually ends up benefiting those at the top. When the fed/ecb/boj buys "X" it benefits those who hold "X" by driving up the price.
Those who dont hold "X" just get the inflation (I know its supposed to get the corps/governments to start spending, hiring etc, but that doesnt seem to work). 
Unless we hardfork in som QE thats not gonna happen with Bitcoin.

I think he is referring to this: 
"In a covenant…among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one’s own tenant-property. One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and removed from society."
Not fascistic but many interpret it that way because they do not understand that he is talking about a free society.

Not sure what you mean by more than ever...
The Bitcoin supply is fixed and every 4 year the block reward is halved. Today there are 1800 Bitcoins minted each day. The next halvening is in 974 days. When that happens only 900 Bitcoins will be minted each day and so on until it reaches 0.
Bitcoins value is skyrocketing because there is more demand for Bitcoins than there are supply of Bitcoins.

Coinbase is an exchange where you can buy and have them hold your Bitcoins, the Bitcoins are not actually really yours until you withdraw them from Coinbase tho. 
How coinbase handles the fork is up to them, they will probably release a statement when its time to fork.

You still would need a clean computer to generate it. Its safer than electrum but also more of a hassle if you want to spend. Also whenever you empty a paper wallet you need to swipe all the Bitcoin off of it otherwise you will lose whats left.

This is all i could find, it seems to only have been translated into swedish,
The Finish Tax Authority, Vero Skatt, has issued instructions for the taxation of virtual currencies, including the bitcoin.  When transferred to another currency, the rules on taxation of capital gains apply.  When the currency is used as a form of payment for goods and services, it is treated as a trade, and the increase in value that the currency might have gained after it was obtained is taxable.[47]  The sale of bitcoins at a loss in value compared to the original purchase price is not deductible under the Finish Income Taxation Act, because such a loss in value is not specifically described as deductible in the Act.[48]"

Not for long, he can only control the price for so long, at some point he runs out of coins if he keeps wasting them on manipulating the market. Also, no one is immortal, they die and either their spoiled heir lose all the coins on hookers and blow and the coins flow back into the system or they just get taken out of the system and we all get a bit richer.

There is a bunch of laws that are put into place to empower only certain groups of society. 
Minimum wage for example, it empowers Walmart because they are the only ones who can afford to pay minimum wage, thus driving small businesses (who cant afford to pay minimum wage) out of business.
Donald Trump said "im the king of debt". He gains tremendously (hehe) from low interest rates because low interest rates benefits the real estate business (again empowers certain groups of society). While punishing savers.

If by alleviate you mean remove entirely, then yes, it would make the central banks obsolete and everyone would be better off in the long run.
For example "quantitative easing" is not possible with Bitcoin, you cant print more.
Interest rates? Everyone is their own bank so they can set their own interest rates.

Competition prevents that, if their products are good and people are willing to pay them for their products well I guess they deserve that money. The ONLY way you can prevent competition is by force, thats where government comes in. For example walmart is for minimum wage because they can afford to pay minimum wage, but they know that small businesses cant. 
Im guessing the mining industry is pretty heavily regulated, especially when it comes to diamonds. Which means only the big boys with deep pockets and political connections get to play.
You cant compete with De Beers and thats why they can play monopoly all day.

Whats your timeframe? If you are looking to become a fellow hodler then it doesnt really matter when you buy, because in 10 years, you will still be hodling. Because fuck the federal reserve and the warmongering governments.
If you are simply looking to increase your wealth through speculating on the price of bitcoin well then you should learn trading, technical analysis and the traders mindset. Then you dont have to ask this sub when is the right time to buy, which will always give you either a cautious or biased answer, you can simply ask the charts.
If you are here to speculate, i would start by heading over to read the comments on the daily thread, scratch your head as to what all the jargon means, then look up all the terms on investopedia.com and you are on your way to becoming a proficient speculator.

according to this post;

"Bitcoin is not doing well.
After its recent reward halving, miners get only 50% of what they were previously rewarded per block, yet the price per bitcoin has not skyrocketed in response - so now miners are subsidizing losses, in many cases. Those economics cannot last forever. "

It would be really hard to do this with bitcoin, in ethereum you can move coins from account to account but in bitcoin you would have to reverse all transactions that happen when one coin moves from one place to another. Its sort of a net of immutability.

I don't know of a single time, regulation has done anything good for anyone, unless that person stands to gain from said regulations to the detriment of someone else.
When the government legalises something that has never been and never should be illegal, it's like they first take away the ball you have been playing with, to protect you, only to let you play with it... if you follow their rules.
I just find celebrating the governments slow creep into crypto utterly disgusting. We are doing just fine without them. We are here because we don't want their regulated currencies. Never forget that.

A bull or bullish market is one that goes up, the word comes from how the market price goes up in the same fashion as how a bull strikes upwards with its horns.
Bear market is a market where the price goes down, like how a bear swipes down with its claws.
A bull trap is where the market looks like its going up, only to trap the bulls or people who have a positive prediction for the price by then suddenly doing the opposite and bear trap vice versa.
If you are trying to interpret this picture, maybe look into symbolism or art interpretation.

Regulations dont make the things you are trying to regulate, go away, it just pushes them into the darkest corners of society.
Heres an interesting paper on child labor.
"In 1993 Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which would have banned imports from countries employing children. In response, that fall Bangladeshi garment companies let go approximately 50,000 children."
“The direct result was that Bangladeshi textile factories stopped employing children. But did the children go back to school? Did they return to happy homes? Not according to Oxfam, which found that the displaced child workers ended up in even worse jobs, or on the streets—and that a significant number were forced into prostitution.”
