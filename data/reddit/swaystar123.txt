i have a theory that this guy is on drugs, the evidence is astounding
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:26:42
I like how in the title he says it \*is\* true but in the textbox he states its just a theory

Pretty sure thats why casino chips are used, so it wouldnt make much of a difference.

Literally every single question of yours can be answered with a simple google search
also only one bank account is closing your accounts as of now
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:27:22
I doubts believing anything you say, you are 12 years old, this account is 2 years old, which made you 10 when you made this account (already something illegal)
and your 3rd post ever was in Polish, while you are from Ukraine... Nice

Alot more people will move to the country, means alot more inflation, means bitcoin price increases!
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:38:03
It was a money laundering scheme
He probably scammed the 310\~ btc from someone, madeup the website and shit and put up the image, after a few days just sent the money to his own address, easy way to launder money. Whenever the irs comes knocking on your door just tell them u solved some stupid riddle and got 2 million dollars
@_date: 2019-03-27 14:09:00
Your kidding me right? Why in the world would you use your brothers account?

its gonna take a while for electric to replace gas, but i hope it can be done!

fuck off, you literally arent even gonna use it, then whats the use of showing off? If everyone showed off the cryptocurrency acceptance but no one used it for payments, then the websites would remove it as an option eventually
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:55:21
Its still the case? Inventing bitcoin did not stop the government instantly lol

some proof and lots of motive
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:50:02

lol you are changing your story so much, go to a docter, your imagining things
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:06:46
I educated my self and found no credible evidence of him being satoshi. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:38:35
Making threats is proof? If that was true everyone would be satoshi
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:14:23
I mean sure whatever you think man, you can go ahead and sue Craig wright right now, if he still claims he is satoshi, good for you, if he doesn't you can short BSV. Both is good for you and will give you gains.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:36:07
Well about 0.02 BTC
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:40:26
got 5$ on what?
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:33:00
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:44:48
By getting credibility gullible people are more likely to buy the coins he shills ie bitcoin sv, thinking they are buying the real bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:25:56
Yeah but no coiners can be fooled into buying bsv as the "real bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:14:56
when that happens, im sure bitcoin will skyrocket, but right now, no one nearby accepts bitcoin for payments, especially my landlord, so if the bank account got sacrificed, we would be out on the streets
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:02:04
Yeah but paypal needs to be connected to a debit card/bank so she still says its not  worth the risk
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:04:20
Is this only for americans?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:38:58
The only friends i have which even know of btc is because i told them what it is, so nah probably not
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:50:53
Alright, please give me one time where he gave proof that he created bitcoin and wasn't absolutely ripped upon
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:43:01
more likely because its a good store of value and doesnt rely on governments
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:21:36
cash by mail is an easy way to get scammed, but the gift card thing sounds like a good idea, thanks
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:22:34
Also, he took your permission, and did what he said he would do, so how did he steal the idea? He didn't even make himself famous with it as he was anonymous
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:37:20
the banks are the problem, not the wallet, as stating the the OP i literally dont even have a bank account and the closest cash seller is 2 cities away
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:37:51
Stupid ass kids, atleast ask the price of bitcoin before deciding
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:41:41
Well, when the government itself they trust  so much calls bitcoin a scam, ofcourse it will be portrayed as a scam, so many people dont fight against it, and since most dont even have internet, they have no idea this is even happening
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:32:33
that is 661106 bitcoins ahead of us ( circulating supply) assuming none of the newly mined coins got lost that is 52888.48 ahead of us (somehow in the decimal but lets just ignore that and assume maybe an old wallet was found again to increase the supply) thats 528880 minutes
528880 / 60 / 24 = 367.2777777777778
op says bitcoin new ath is almost a year away
i trust op sounds reasonable

Then why is he sueing people for not believing he is satoshi? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:28:17
well its better than using paypal and stuff, and as i mentioned she saw the potential at buying at 3-4k
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:34:00
the next closest person is 2 cities away, at that point it will cost her more for travel and stay than how much she wants to buy
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:24:54
Ahh yes i show my credit card to everyone too!
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:45:00
