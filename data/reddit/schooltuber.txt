I mean, these guys need to eat AND I think they do have the right to get rich for all the good work they've done for the last few years.

That sounds a little fair, if you hold more bitcoin / "%" of the ecosystem you have a bigger say on what happens. Also, filter can be made, such as one transaction per address.

I dunno, I mean, this is crazy ! 100$ in less than 12 hours, I can say we can expect 1200 in the next 7 days

You need to work on your grammar.

It is possible, however some problem may rise from multiple votes. I mean, trolls are everywhere

When paying using cash, you need to show your face. When paying using a credit card, all your info is available to the merchant, and any other government or agency that requests them. However, when yo pay using bitcoins, you don;t have to give any of that info.

Ever heard about "market trends" ?
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:32:28
Maybe we can substitute that. For example, we can use algo as a substitute "SHA Bits" or so.

Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:46:02
No, You're stands for "you are". "You need to work for you are grammar "? Nope, it doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:17:13
Well... Maybe being damn smart :)
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:33:27
it does give a shit, they protect you wholeheartedly, because they want you to keep your money with them and charge you there numerous fees. That's the point I think we're missing.
@_date: 2014-09-27 21:08:33
Wishing you luck from Jeddah :)

No one can match a bitcoin address to you. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:03:35
Hi there
May I have some ?
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:58:56
Make buying bitcoin accessible. Have widespread kiosks. Partner up with local business to accept bitcoin. Also, try to maintain exchange price. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:33:20
Nope, Saudi's (and arabs in general) don't see bitcoins as a threat- on the contrary :)

Except when they resemble each other very closely.

Isn't that way to late considering they were sent for print? Could you consider doing an early test batch :D ?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:49:30
Don't you think you are a little too salty?

As the crypto market continues to recover, I was collecting data for a research paper to analyze the current investor's expectation about project performance with its valuation in mind.
Please take a couple of minutes and fill this survey: 
I'll try to share the papers' results on this subreddit!

Xapo's support is the worst, hands down!

What is the passphrase? 
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:15:33
If you lose your phone, you should be able to use any other phone by entering the authenticator's unique recovery code
