Yes, I got lucky and bitched out my short at sub 9400 because I had a "bad feeling". Didn't long but thank god I jumped ship ffs, this looks bad

I was laughing too, but then I had a bad feeling and bitched out of my short at 9390. Didn't long, but thank god I got out, Shorts got rekd hard...

Yes, it's probably the case

search for "Bogdanoff Twins", no idea why they ended up like that though

Not really

I'm bullish but not that much. Maybe in a far future 1 satoshi=1 cent could be possible though

Really got lucky there, bitched out of my short position still in positive under 9400, that thing came out of nowhere, the "oversold BTC" is not enough to explain this kind of jump, probably still going to go down before reaching 11.200k, but I am a short time bear, long time bull right now, might still just go to the moon

Exactly, I really got lucky there, it was impossible to forsee a correction this big really...
Truth be told, I didn't even mean to sell at that price, I somehow missclicked at the last second and sold on market instead of limit. That was pure luck, nothing else

I mean, I did the right thing but a smarter man would have sold at 9280ish, particularly with the leverage I used, that's why I'm not really happy.  
Also 11% in a few minutes and still growing now doesn't seem right, that's what I meant with "this looks bad", no idea why I got downvoted. 
I am bullish long run, yet I thought we would have jumped down to 8600ish, smart money didn't allow for it to happen...

I'd like that, some more cheap BTC would feel good in my wallet (not to mention to my short position lmao)

What you circled is 4.9, not  49 milions
