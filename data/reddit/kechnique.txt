I'll concede I may have been wrong in some respects.
But is not Alien Blue native?
The reddit mobile site is unusable for me..
I am a fan of HTML 5 replacing native on mobile though, don't get me wrong. Do you know of any good HTML 5 mobile apps i can check out though? I haven't really seen any...

We as a group think, and like to act together as one mind on matters of up voting and down voting.
Never break rank, or think outside of our unwritten accepted group norms of thought.

Steve Jobs' closed mindedness was both his greatest shortcoming and biggest asset. 
The closed mindedness produced the manicured design of ios, and also made it the walled garden which will be it's downfall.
He didn't even want apps allowed on the iphone but the whole company overruled him. 
Tim cook runs the show now, and all he speaks is $$$.
Johnny Ive may be of use, but i doubt he understands these matters as much as he understands design.

Debate me I'm a bitcoiner.
But in all seriousness, most people are initially opposed to genuine creative thinking, despite claiming to value creativity.

eBay will probably die with them.
Amazon is so cheap and craigslist so convenient for used that the only place for eBay really is sports memorabilia.
Liable to fall.

The real question is what should we do to get him off the foundation board.
Could start with a change.org petition..
Ideas anyone? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:53:37
Exactly.

There's a story in think and grow rich about a man who quit digging for gold just five feet short of gold and went back east.
After learning of his error, he eventually got into a different business and struck it rich.
I'd recommend the book to you.

Drugs and booze don't pay for themselves.
I'm allowed to say this because I spent many years as a homeless drug addict.

Doing unselfish things for selfish reasons can be a recipie for a wonderful life actually.

Arguably html5 will never be there for real applications.
So much hype in 2011 and nothing has really materialized.

I saw this coming a decade ago. Dumb mother fuckers and their cards..

Literally this.
Edit: wow thanks for the gold!

A whopping 400,000. 
Silicon Valley investors just this year threw 25 million at Path, the social network that never was. 
Not here to rain on the parade, but a mere 400k investment shows these people are not taking bitcoin nearly as serious as they should be.

Id dare to say anyone using bitcoin right now knows full well how to jailbreak ;)
Not sure how the security of the wallet would be then though. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:02:56
Doge is litecoin which is basically bitcoin. 1/10 I expected better.

Not saying people don't use it, I'm just saying it's far from some online staple and liable to fall just like any other tech company when they fail to innovate.

There can only be one magic the gathering online exchange.

The sole purpose of a Ponzi scheme is to scam people. 
Bitcoin doesn't fit the definition of Ponzi scheme at all.

Hey thanks for this good response. I'm gonna look into it thoroughly. Mind if I contact ya in the future with more questions perhaps?

I have read in magazines even about how 2 step verification can pretty easily be bypassed anyways....

This interview really came off as him pushing the paypal agenda; both against bitcoin and nfc.
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:55:20
I suspect they have a horse coming up in the coming mobile payments war. Bitcoin would be a threat to anyone like this: NFC, paypal, unreleased tech (by apple). 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:44:35
There's bitcoins out there on the net, just waiting for someone to scoop them up.
A group with some funding and a great deal of cyber security knowledge could solve this problem...
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:11:08
Looks like NFC Google wallet was held back by the AT&amp;T and Verizon's Isis mobile payments app (yet to be released?)
I swear to god, these fucking carriers man.

Just to play devils advocate here, but how viable is this as a currency if it takes this amount of knowledge to safely posses it?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:21:36
In his comment history he spoke of eating out of garbage cans. 
That sounds worse than debt to me but then again what the hell do I know?
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:23:11
How about drinking?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:24:22
Freedom to drink and use drugs?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:26:24
Back in 2007 I was homeless and a drug addict so don't come around here preaching your bullshit man cuz I can see right through it.

There were protests in China during  the Arab spring.
 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:37:07
Good for you man. But my comment was meant towards u/pureapeshit. The one who thinks being free means being homeless and getting drunk and high (see the above comments before you post another rant).
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:34:12
I'm glad you found a positive way to cope with what addiction has done to your life.
Good for you!

Why you gotta be so agro man?
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:37:04
I could totally see that.
I can't help but feel as though NFC is being overlooked or held back for some reason.. Even the local transit busses where I live all have NFC "paypads". 
Any thoughts on why it hasn't been NFC?

Enjoy your downvote I just gave you.

Not really man, I used to do the same shit.

Also a good example of how they didn't err on the side of caution.

Is that what they said in Tiananmen Square? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:59:16
True, I could see that happening. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:29:01
My point was that the demonstrations showed that TS was not completely forgotten, as you had first claimed.
Not to prove any pro democracy movement in china.

Do you think some sort of Bitbank would be feasible? Where the bank simply stores their user's bitcoins in exchange for guaranteed security?
