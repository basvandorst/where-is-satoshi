You could interpolate the numbers like the debt clock is doing. I doubt the people that have the debt clock have an actual live feed of every dollar spent by the government. They're just using an estimated growth rate and occasionally updating it to the actual number.

Yeah, then also intercept communication with the USB Controller, find an exploit in the Chrome app, and use that to somehow exfiltrate your data. Not going to happen.

The reporter in the second video seemed to gloss over the [very detailed requirements for being deemed notable on Wikipedia]( which were likely linked to during the discussion about the deletion of her page.

I see what you mean, but the fee would be the same. Coinbase would just pay it instead of him. You're right, but it's important to make the difference clear.

Also, don't save it on your computer or print it. The seed allows you to generate all the 2fa codes forever.

@_date: 2017-12-29 22:39:01
Yep, just be aware that if someone else gets access to the seed they can generate all your codes.

You only use the servers to broadcast transactions that are cryptographically signed by your Hardware wallet. Your private Keys Never Leave the wallet.

Each of them support a different set of cryptocurrencies.

The problem is that the wallet is decrypted client-side on Blockchain. Therefore, the user's browser would have to report incorrect login attempts back to Blockchain. Any person looking to bruteforce a wallet would simply disable this.

Agree. I thought that this created some sort of Bitcoin filesystem.

The point is that miners are not able to broadcast on the uplink. Therefore, they can not use it to publish blocks.

So if your bank account got hacked you'd prefer they just let the attacker drain it?

Right now you're sending headers on your homepage that say to never cache the page. `Cache-Control:max-age=0, no-cache`. You can configure WordPress to send cache headers on the homepage and set up CloudFlare. Then CloudFlare will cache the page and views to your homepage won't go to the origin (your) server.
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*` is a bad idea. You should probably remove that as well if you can. I'm not familiar with what WordPress plugin would be doing that.

I assumed that because he doesn't know how to run a shell script he doesn't know the syntax either. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:45:45
Don't run random shell scripts on your Bitcoin node unless you know how to audit them.

Hello? Craig? Is that you?

It may be illegal because he's not selling it, his family is. It's just smarter to pay your taxes.

My primary issue is that they claim it's safe to buy from resellers and don't even shrink wrap their boxes. Ledger has stated on multiple occasions (even in their packaging iirc) that you don't need to worry about physical or supply chain attacks due to their firmware attestation which has been proven to be broken multiple times. While an attack may not compromise key material, it may still be possible to steal the coins.
I personally use a ledger because it's the best option for me. However, I don't appreciate their specific cop outs and claiming that every vuln they are presented with is a non issue because key material is not exposed. I consider a vulnerability to be anything that can cause loss of coins to an attacker.

Usually when Google Voice calls and asks for 2 digits it's during the process of activating the GV account before they give you a GV number. It's likely that the Craigslist guy just wanted to activate a new GV account and already had one associated with his phone number or was using a bunch of them to scam more people. IIRC Google doesn't call the number when you try to port one in.

Only if you're making a transaction on localbitcoins. You can't report fraud for someone just using their web wallet.

Yeah. You can't do cross site Ajax though.

The server should send a CSRF token (random value or hash of some user info) to the client in a hidden field then verify it later once the form is posted. A potential attacker would have no way of knowing what the secret value is (unless they have xss on the website or something) so they would not be able to falsify the form submission.

Do you have any plans to open-source this script? I'm interested in how it works.

Please excuse the crazy screenshot job, this is my most recent order compared with Amazon prices. I saved a few dollars and had the added convenience of paying with Bitcoin.
