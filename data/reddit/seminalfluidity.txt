This seems extremely premature, given that there seems to have been no explanation of how the 'hack' was achieved.

It is probable that Bitfinex is providing a lesser haircut to whales. If we assume, for each individual user, that the likely amount of proceeds resulting from litigation is X, then Bitfinex will be making alternative arrangements with people whose haircut amount is greater than X. X is hard to quantify, but it's likely that Bitfinex is striking individual deals with whales to ensure that they won't be sued, while pushing the haircut onto the rest of the poor saps who don't have the incentive to go to court.

I'm skeptical as well. These systems are complex and involve solving some difficult computer science problems. It's also unlikely to be cheaper to existing datacenters once you have factored in costs of redundancy. I hope it succeeds, but I think the developers are a bit too optimistic. They tend to speak as if this problem is so tractable that it makes them seem unrealistic.

The Foundation is being unduly influenced by these corporate figures who are less interested in preserving the values underlying Bitcoin and more interested in making money for themselves and preserving influence.

Why would anyone use their wallet after this, even if they reimburse everyone?

Every time Bobby says something, China goes and does the opposite. His PR strategy is horrible, and he has lost a ton of credibility by continually making statements without justification. He seems to have an inability to recognize when situations are fluid and uncertain and describe them as such.

Their futures products have trading fees, which is what we're discussing here.

That bobby says this is pretty hypocritical.  What do you expect when there are no transactions fees?  You get bots trading back and forth with themselves.  There is no difference if the exchange itself is running the bots or the exchange is enabling third parties to run the bots.  He started the move to no transactions fees, and now he is ripping once he lost market share.
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:41:32
Yeah totally.  His reason for reinstating fees was to promote stability.  I guess he doesn't care about that anymore.

Thanks for the translation.  Their statement should have been as concise as yours.

Good call.  Gox has slid by for too long.  For that matter, a story needs to be done on the Bitcoin Foundation.  We can't have the leading Foundation run by, at worst, crooks, or, at best, lousy businessmen.

The loss isn't just due to slippage. 796 actually takes the position of the liquidated party, so if the price continues to move in favor of the counterparty, 796 continues to incur losses.
See 
This happens with the other margin trading platforms too (huobi, which lost +45% this week, and okcoin too).
Bitcoin is too volatile for leveraged trading, and on immature platforms such as these.

My point is that price does matter, and the bigger the dataset (i.e. the larger the timespan) the more you can rely on the data.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:46:45
Eternal bitcoin optimists, please stop using this inane line of reasoning. This argument cuts both ways, so at best it is neutral. Of course you can take any arbitrary time frame and get the data you want. You can also do the same thing with Blackberry stock, crime rates, the spread of ebola, ANYTHING. But the fact of the matter is, price = data, and the current price data stinks. If anyone said the same thing about a stock that declined 80% in one year, they'd be laughed out of the room. I wish people would stop using this horrible argument and use some real data, like rates of adoption, companies developing real applications, github repos, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:25:21
I would like to see him invest in a company with the same adoption curve as Bitcoin's. Highly unlikely.
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:16:40
It would be really unwise just to take any two points, draw a line, and make conclusions based on that. On this I agree with AA.
On the other hand, he is also saying to ignore the price altogether, which is dumb. Price is data. I'm saying that the price drop of the last year necessarily needs to be considered, and not ignored. Would you say that Blackberry's stock doesn't "stink" because it is a $6.6b company and came out of nothing? Or would you consider that it used to be worth ten times as much, and the price action of the stock in the past?

The title is misleading - OKCoin did not acquire the domain, only the rights to manage it for a certain length of time.

It doesn't follow that these people will they go and set up bitcoin mines.

Chinese people decided that today was a good time to start using bitcoin for capital flight. Makes sense.
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:28:59
It's simply because the operators aren't using their own money, they're using gullible investors. So whatever they end up mining, the operator "reports" just a portion and takes the rest as their own.

Seems to me that sidechains are an unnecessary and potentially destabilizing addition to bitcoin, intended mainly to allow existing bitcoin holders to have the ability to benefit from other block chain innovations and mitigate the risk of them losing their bitcoin wealth.

The regulation says no such thing.  It merely says 1) Bitcoin is not a currency, and 2) Financial institutions are restricted from engaging with Bitcoin (directly or indirectly).  That is all.  Any more than that is pure speculation, and Bobby is speaking with way too much conviction.
