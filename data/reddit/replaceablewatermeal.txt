I can't shoot the messenger :3 you speak the truth 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:25:49
lmao what 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:32:35
i bought in at 12900 cuz i thoguht that was the bottom, now im just buying more..literally the only way this is permanently bad for all of us is if BTC is actually a bubble and its popping rn. otherwise even if it goes to like 8000 itll still go back up probably in a really volatile fashion
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:11:22
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:36:28
I agree but most people don't trade with this mindset.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:52:33
I've already committed to HODL'ing my .375 BTC I bought at around 13k till next year, so I don't know why I come to these threads to feel like an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:37:14
Nah weak fud
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:12:36
Exactly. Its like my uncle, he sold amazon at 36$ and doubled his money. he was happy..
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:25:44
Yes 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:25:34

@_date: 2018-03-19 14:41:58
This shit cracks me up. Wanna give me my horoscope while you're at it ? I'm January baby
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:32:37
Brain dead tweet. Who is he even talking to?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:50:38
yah i see btc going to 4.5kthen slowly climbing back to like 10-11k by next dec
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:38:45
It's literally going to 5670 by Saturday 8 am eastern 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:59:30
You still gunna buy, not tryna be a jerk i'm legitimately wondering if this looks like a buying opp to you now that its real
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:50:52
youre trash bro. seeya at 50k
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:53:50
So tldr spread will slowly tighten
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:57:59
Bitcoin is going to vacuum cleaner the entire global economy into it, as if it had a gravitational pull. 
See you on the MOOOOON.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:30:37
I agree. Like for example, it was "SELL" rating on all sites like tradingview etc for BTCUSD pairing all while BTC was like 6-7-8k now suddenly pushing 12k its a "STRONG BUY" lol..what a joke
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:58:02
Lol now they are 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:33:24
I think it depends on the exchange honestly. Certain ones would have less vulnerabilities because they're more simple, like Gemini. But hey what do I know i'm just part of the Reddit clown mafia.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:07:01
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:10:03
dude no offense and youre probably not wrong about this bud damn this is why the IRS wants to derail crypto
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:00:28
what? i bought .375 of btc when it was 13,000
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:44:54
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:15:59
No futures are cash settled and the volume is like 1/18th of today's trading volume 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:45:10
lol theres like no floor wtf
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:47:53
Idk about that example. I think kids get newer stuff more so than adults in many instanceS, which is the reason in ten years bitcoin can be adopted 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:57:13
Ok i bought more lol no regrets 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:55:48
i see so many skeptics like "lol, were still in a downtrend" "lol we're still at 8k" 
Damn yall dont understand the idea of patience being rewarded. It is at the peak point of "bitcoin is useless" "dont invest in bitcoin its a scam" that bitcoin will once again rise to new highs, and id say itll take some months. 
This is why investing what you can afford to let sit there is an important concept. Impatient people that can't wait for bitcoin to climb back up in price WILL be punished. Those same people WILL be salty. 
Nothing is going to yield more than 50% in a year and not be volatile/have a chance of fucking people over. Not everyone's strategy works. For me, holding has worked though. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:23:04
why are the people who don't care/believe in btc even fucking here? if you all think btc is worthless go away like wtf is this bullshit 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:21:10
well fuck it i dont need sleep
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:36:42
Pin the loan to a USD-T token or something similar. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:59:01
well i averaged down to 8.9k during the dip, and im feeling pretty damn good with my .75 BTC lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:30:39
!remind m-ahhh fuck it i'm just gunna sell.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:03:11
Salt is real. Stay nocoin.
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:56:48
I legitimately heard and knew about Bitcoin years ago, but no one explained it. It took a massive public-invested bubble for me to really see into the tech and learn. So I think this is a good thing, even though it would've been marvelous to be an early adopter....It couldn't of been all of us. It happens in waves, the acceptance of it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:03:22
You're an interesting fellow. I get the feeling you're short-term skeptic, long term believer? See you on this sub a lot and you seem to be pretty negative on BTC but also reasonable with certain time horizons..
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:11:13
ill sell u 10 dollars worth via paypal if thats even allowed, but im charging 5% fee ontop of market price and ur going first
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:14:58
do you mean like black friday as in the thing after thanksgiving where everything is on sale
or like the stock market crash
CUZ ITS BOTH
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:03:50
lol "technicals" there was just as much TA at 20k justifying moves to 30-40k by April with a mere 30% pullback to like 12.5-13k... There was VERY little TA at that time screaming "bubble is going to pop" in fact, the only people saying that were not providing technical support for their arguments regardless, they merely saw Bitcoin as bubblish and *tested their luck* by saying it will pop. Might I remind you people did this at 2k, 5k, 7k, 10k. 
This is what you did too, and you got lucky. No need to rub it in to people by saying passive aggressive shit like "Change your own trading deficiencies"
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:09:11
I just don't understand why an entire crowd of people who are
1. not invested 
2. don't believe in the tech
3. think its useless
would even give it any attention?
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:55:02
Now we enjoy the ride cheers man
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:41:15
It's low growth if you compare it to the past of crypto not other asset classes 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:12
i think its the fault of speculators, no one ever learned why bitcoin was awesome so they don't make judgments on their own basis...its a crowd-mob-judgment wild west get rich or get ass fucked tryin' world..
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:41:57
Weak fud
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:30:12
bro just wait its gunna happen any minute now
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:06:33
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:31:25
the people I'm talking about aren't discussing anything they're just telling, 
Telling how much more it's going to crash
Telling how stupid we are
Telling how bitcoin is useless
No discussion. Do you see anything besides memes, suicide watch and angry "told you so" people ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:18:19
From USA. HODLBROTHER!!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:15:34
Give it fifty more days
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:17:57
8-12 billion of that is satoshis alone. remember he has like 10% 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:21:33
why do u need it to do what it did last year that would be boring...let btc do its thing homie
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:48:20
what if i told u last year was retarded
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:08:04
