You're talking like it's a foregone conclusion. He's posted that the winner will be announced in a few days. When that doesn't turn up, then yeah, but until then it's speculation either way.

Wow, you really are a low life piece of shit aren't you? The girl, who entered a comp that no-one thought was real, won, saw she was getting attention so deleted stuff she hoped would never see the light of day. But you, you fucking cretin, had to go against this young girls wishes, a girl who had obviously had a hard time already, for what, some fucking internet points?!?!
 You do realise the press will be all over this shit? She'll be fucking hounded, her family will see it, her friends, not that she's got enough to deal with, with police interest as well.
You make me sick. I hope something really really shitty happens to you with all that ill-gotten 'karma'. Go crawl back under whatever rock it was you came from you pathetic excuse for a human.

I don't understand why people think he was related to the hack, just because of a username. People on Reddit make me laugh, like the people below hounding her for proof, but they all quite happily believe that he hacked 120000btc because he called himself bfxhacker backwards? I tell you what's backwards, all you gullible idiots.

How come everyone is forgetting that as soon as the edited post went up regarding the .0001btc to be sent, he countered it saying that no one should pay any attention to it as his account had been compromised. Our is everyone just choosing to ignore this very large piece of information?

Informed on what? Some bullshit theory? I've already read all of that anyway. It's ALL supposition. The new hacker could easily have just slipped his own btc address in there on the off chance, and she didn't realise when she re-edited it, that makes more sense than anything. Anyway, you're still a cunt for doing it. You read too many comics. Go out and get a fucking job instead of embroiling yourself in conspiracy theories. That's if you're old enough you work.

That was actually on the bitcointalk thread, and he did post on Reddit that his account had been compromised and to ignore anything it said on there.
