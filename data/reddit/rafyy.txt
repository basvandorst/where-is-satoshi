a 100% move in a week is volatility *decreasing*?!?!?! no, thats called a blowoff top.
its going to 10K-12K shortly. possibly overshooting to 8K.

The 21mio limit wont be reached for another 120 years.

He's nothing but a scam artist. 5-7 years ago he was talking nonsense about gold and how it will go to $10,000 and silver would go to $500. Howd that work out for you? Only stupid people listen to what he has to say.

a 1031 exchange is tricky, people think you dont pay taxes when in actuality all youre doing is deferring taxes...you eventually will have to pay it. With something like real estate, where holding periods are years or decades, 1031 is an amazing benefit. With crypto, even now, not so much.

The amount of naivety (or is it stupidity?) on this sub sometimes is astonishing. grandma (and hoodlers) doesnt have any say in whats going on. the algos have been driving this market all year and theyve just started.

It has room to go to 8K, though if retests and bounces off of 11K that would be a good sign.

Fear Of Missing Out

Ive heard if you have Google Authenticator and you lose/break your phone, its nearly impossible to recover it...is that true? Also heard if you get a new phone its a bitch to move everything over to your new phone...also true?
Im nervous about using Google Auth for those reasons and currently use the default SMS authenticator on coinbase...even though ive read it can be beaten if someone clones your phone number.

Im concerned about the best way to store your keys. If you just want to buy some btc, eth, xrp...etc, and lock away the private keys in a safe and come back to them in say 5 years, whats to say Ledger/Trezor/and all the countless apps and programs will still be in business and youll be able to recover your money?  In that situation, wouldnt a paper wallet be the best thing or am i too paranoid?
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:51:23
Ignore all the people telling you to buy a ledger/trezor...why would you spend $75-100 to secure $50 worth of btc?!??!?
you can look into a paper wallet/electrum/breadwallet, just look into what the fees are to transfer.
for that amount id just leave it on coinbase.

Max Keiser is a complete and utter con artist that appeals to the stupidest of stupid. I doubt many people on here were around back then, but 5-6 years ago he was pumping gold and silver using the same old arguments about the dollar collapsing, the world economy will go to shit, and banksters are evil. Same old bullshit from him, he's just found a new group of dummies to scam.

Because i see the utility in it but i also recently see the fraudsters and the idiots who follow them trying to hijack it for their own agenda.

ahh, didnt know that. thanks!

The similarity between goldbugs 5+ years ago and some bitcoin enthusiasts today are eerily similar.
1. you have the same outrageous price targets now (100K, 1mio, 2mio for btc) as you did back then with gold/silver (10K gold, 500 silver). howd that work out?
2. you have the same scam artists (max keiser, alex jones) peddling their extreme ideas to dumb people; the dollar will collapse, the banksters are evil, the zombie apocalypse is near and youll be using btc (or gold back then) to buy a loaf of bread when anarchy is among us.
3. you have the same dumb celebrities (paris hilton, floyd mayweather) advertising schemes.  wutang crypto coins yo!!!! cash4gold anyone? we need william shatner on this stat!
4. bitcoin atms? HA! we had gold atms back then.
5. 'hodl' is the new 'keep stackin'
im not sayin btc is a bubble or a fraud but the irrational exuberance for it should give any rational person some pause.

i think i read somewhere that one address with 160K BTC is bitfinex?

moot point. you just validated my comparison.
heres someone on a gold forum 10 years ago trying to make the same argument as you:
