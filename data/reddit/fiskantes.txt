9 months ago I got my friend - real estate agency owner - into crypto. 3 months ago he sold first apartment for Bitcoin - in Prague.

There are smart ppl in r/btc and there are really dumb ones. Same as here :-) I read both to try and remain unbiased.

Cash would be flagged (because of serial numbers on bank notes) if there was not a law that specifically prohibits such flagging of cash, thus making it fungible.  
For Bitcoin there is no such law.

# I am referring to the fact that BTC is not fungible, and thus if for example BTC I bought where stolen (via hack from somewhere), police can seize them as stolen property (as would happen if I bought let's say stolen car)

From the answers so far I guess I have two options:  
1. Use BTC only in cases where no intitutional 3rd party is involved - e.g. forget about exchanges, forget about vendors and service providers
2. Use Monero

I know Bitcoin tx itself cannot be blocked, but if I want to send that BTC to any third party - exchange, vendor, etc. he can either refuse Bitcoin if they track it from illegal source or simply accept it and then freeze the funds, if criminal investigator tracks it and orders them to.   
Not using 3rd party for anything implies I just want to buy and hold, but what if I want to trade and spend?

Sounds funny, but LTC might just be the way to go.

You mean all 15 of them?

I get your point of view, but I think it's too idealistic. We are talking about currency here, and currency is meant to be used. I can buy coffee with Litecoin and don't have to pay 2-4 bucks for fees like with BTC. That's what matters to mass adopters, not philosophical debates about who came first or technical nuances of implemented code. :-)
In the world of tech it is not the one who comes first but the one who comes at the right time with the right user friendly tech to get mass adoption (Yahoo vs Google, MySpace vs Facebook).

Umm, why don't use Litecoin?
