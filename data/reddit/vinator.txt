This sub rather posts stupid memes instead of knowing what crypto currencies are about.

That's not a thing done by a subreddit that's a reddit thing. (A subreddit ist not able to do this!)
If you're in a sub that you haven't been before (don't have any upvotes) you can only write a comment every 10 minutes. (That's also what I can only do in this sub)

Oh, what a snowflake.

It's not called bcash, it's called Bitcoin Cash and the scaling debate is over for Bitcoin Cash but not for the SegWitCoin (which this sub supports)
No one knows yet if SegWitCoin or Bitcoin Cash will be the new altcoin (most likly SegWitCoin since it will run into scaling issues)

That you even have to ask shows that you're part of the problem.

There is still time to dump the old Bitcoin for the new and strong Bitcoin Cash.

Then it sounds like a good idea giving bitcoin in the hands of corporates with LN. Surely will help the issue.
