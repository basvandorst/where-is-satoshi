Well, truth is that if you got into bitcoin you should have researched it's tax repercussions. I'm not in the list of Coinbase addresses but I'm still reporting and paying the due taxes to the IRS this january. I paid a downpayment in a house earlier this year with bitcoin profits and went through hell to make my lender take the money, but I was happy to help set a precedent and educate at least a few people about it. If you haven't sold ANY of it you don't need to report yet, but if you have, and made good money of it, please get a tax advisor that at least knows what BTC is, and double please, pay what you owe. 
TL;DR: Please don't go to jail in the US trying to save your profit, it is not worth it.

Yes, that's a capital loss. You get a tax break from that, make sure you get help with your taxes about it, or make sure you are 100% sure about how to report it.

Lol, I'm here for the tech. And also for the money. But I have the common sense to know that the money won't come overnight.

I just wrote them an email requesting for them to deactivate 2FA on my account, they requested some identity proof and that was the end of it. Don't try to get them to add your new phone or restore your 2FA, just plain ask for it deactivated. It took me a couple of days while I provided the requested info and all, but I've got all my coins again. 
P.S. Always save your 2FA seed, especially when it comes to finances!
