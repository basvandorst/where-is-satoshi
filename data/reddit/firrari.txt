Thanks so much. I'm guessing by size some of them can hold more data than others?

I'm thinking of opening up a small business myself and honestly I don't even have a Bitcoin Wallet yet.  I've been reading up on everything all weekend and I have a few great ideas.
I think it would be fun/cool to put a nice looking BitCoin sign up with an NFC tag on it.
Something along the lines of This Business Accepts BitCoins.   And you can have a QR code on it and an NFC tag that they just tap with their phone.  The NFC tag will  have your receiving coin address so all they do is just tap, enter coin amount, send.  Done.

Hmm. I'm just starting out and don't want to make that mistake. Which size do we need for a wallet?

Good idea. Thank you.

Thanks for the reply.  Could you tell me how to set this up?

Thanks a ton will try that as soon as I get an nfc tag to play with. 
Thanks.

It just seems confusing and seems the fees keep adding up tho.   I'm not doing a lot of transactions or anything. I'm new and tested a transaction last night and this morning and each fee got bigger the more $ I sent =/

I'm still new.. but.. I've been curious if it's possible to set up one wallet where anytime money is deposited into it..  it automatically sends a % to other wallets.  Is this possible?
Example:  Let's say I have a website that is donation based and I have a couple of volunteers that help me and work for free.   If someone donated money to the wallet I have set up for the site... could I set it so it automatically sends x% to each volunteer helping me run the site and then the other x% would get sent to my wallet.  
Is that possible?

Ok that's good.   I'm using mycelium on mobile and have miner fee set to normal but still seems the fees are high.

Thanks. I feel like I've almost figured it out..  however I have no clue what URI is and what the "Request coins" dialogue is.
I love learning tho so by all means throw links at me if you can =P

Thanks. You are everywhere. :p
Yea that seems to do what I want. However I am looking to program my own nfc tag.  Will definitely give those a read. Thanks!

Holy fucking shit dickwad you are a mother fucking  genius.  
If you can't see what I'm complaining about or lack thereof you are the fucking moron. 
I was clearly concerned being new to Bit Coin.   They paid a couple of cents on a $600+ transaction where as I paid 2 cents on a smaller transaction and then 3 cents on a transaction that was only 8 cents.    I also watched a video where a guy sent $1 from one of his wallets to another of his wallets and that was 9 cents.    
Clearly that's not the fucking same as the $600+ transaction you moron. That's more.  That's almost a 10% fee.  
At that rate a $600+ transaction would cost $60+ in fees.    So I was clearly concerned how these fees work exactly. 
But of course you knew all that already you lil genius you =)
