yep check out Bitwage:  great for paying contractors. If you have your own payroll system you can encourage workers sign up themselves. It's already used by many people without their employer even knowing about crypto.

You could be an earner on purse.io maybe do some arbitrage by buying the giftcards on credit cards offering cash bonuses.

Hi guys. androod is correct. Everything in Bitwage is on a post-tax basis. you would have to pay capital gains taxes once you sold any BTC bought through Bitwage. here's an article on how the DD product works:

Small correction here, he would have to set up a Bitwage account on team.bitwage.com and pay $250k via Bitcoin with you as a contractor. This would ensure OP would not have to handle any BTC himself and get exactly what he needs in USD terms. Bitwage allows you to get paid in BTC as a contractor but you bill in USD or EUR or another national currency. 
For payment to happen with BTC, the payor has to be on Bitwage on as an employer. Since u/SlappinYoMouf 's client is in Crypto perhaps they are already on Bitwage. If they need help onboarding they can email me at support too.

That's great! If you'd wanted to have less negotiation you could have used Bitwage, which allows you to give your boss a USD bank account through which we convert your salary to BTC and send it to your wallet. You don't even have to teach your boss about Bitcoin and you could split at the employer level and send some amount to Bitwage and enough for your rent and expenses to your regular bank account. Dollar cost averaging takes care of the swings!

My advice would be dollar cost averaging. Buy a little on a consistent basis, you'll buy less when the price is higher and more when it's cheaper. This is how 401k funding works through salaries. 
In terms of Bitcoin, please look into Bitwage. You get a bank account you can provide to your payroll provider and you can tell them to send, say $40 per check to Bitwage to immediately converted to BTC and sent to your wallet. Check us out

Well if you use Bitwage you wouldn't need to have you bank connected to your crypto. You could have funds come directly from your wage to BTC and then trade it as you please.

Hi u/mgueramorena the idea that we'd ask for the passport is new to me. We usually don't ask for personal documents from the employer but business documents. Please email us to follow up support For receiving wages we don't ask for the employer's personal info.

Hi Luccio, that sucks!! We're adding unique USD accounts soon, so the account woud have your name on it. hopefully that would let your accounting dept pay you there.
