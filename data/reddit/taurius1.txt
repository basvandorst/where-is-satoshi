Lol. You expect Apple to get with the program? They've always been about "My way, or the Highway".

Is this legit ?

It's never too late. If you're going to play safe, don't put more than you can afford to lose. :)

Hm. Anyone got any reviews on this? 
Edit: Nvm. found Will look there.

Oh you'd be surprised how dumb some people are. :/

The way I see it, prices are always going up. They will always keep going up. The sooner you jump in, the better, no ? )

I bought my first BTC in February through localbitcoins in New Jersey without a hitch. ^_^

NVM. just searched and found a lot of negative reviews about this.

Well, in the long run.

If only there were a way he could upvote himself for giving himself the solution in a timely manner!

It never hit me till I read this: 
"Suddenly an idea that sounded terrible—a totally decentralized currency without a central authority, where semi-anonymous parties exchange meaningless tokens—becomes almost comforting, a source of power and authority."

From what I've seen, and read, I don't think you'll be making any losses in the long run. BTC has been reliably recovering from it's drops within a day.
