I found this thread from a google search and I had an entire newline as a leading character. Thanks for the quick fix!

That is in conflict with what was posted on [Coinbase's help page]( on 2017-12-11. (That makes this a pretty recent development, possibly in response to the NiceHash loss.) I can't independently verify the details of their insurance coverage. It looks like the "2%" came from the amount they store online as opposed to offline wallets. If that's so, then the funds are actually *more* secure because an online attack could only steal 2% of the total funds. Quoting from their site:   


Now, since only 2% is kept online, the presumption may be that only 2% can be stolen and that has been (misleadingly) restated to be that only 2% is insured. However, since they state the policy covers physical security and employee theft, then I would presume it covers someone stealing the offline devices. 
Disclosure: I can't verify their claims. I am a Coinbase user but not an employee. I just got a hardware wallet so I can secure my own coins so I clearly don't *completely* trust any one else's security measures.

I'm with you in that the Apple analogy is not a good one. Here's my attempt at another analogy:


That gives you recovery options of:   
• Get it from the bank. (Not an option if it's all stolen.)   
• Get it from the bank's insurance (Probably your best shot. Coinbase, for example, says they're insured against employee theft.)   
• Get it from the employee who stole it. (Might require a wrench attack.)
