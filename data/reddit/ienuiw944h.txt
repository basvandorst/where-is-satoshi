***Technically*** when you deposit money in the bank, the bank is borrowing from you. You are the lender, and they are the borrower of your money. So when you take back the money that you were lending them, they want to know the reason for why you are doing this.
The reason it is a concern to the banks is because they need to have your deposits in order for them to make loans to other people. It's called fractional reserve banking, where the bank can take your $10 dollars that you deposited and then lend out $100 dollars back to you + interest! They just create the other $90 dollars out of thin air...its a total scam.
So basically, when you take money out of your bank account, you are making the bank lose money. That's why they want to know what's going on with you taking money out.
***Also***, if a bank fails...they can go after your deposits. It's like if you borrowed from the bank, and you went bankrupt, then the bank loses out on the money...so it is if the bank goes bankrupt, then you will lose out on your money. This is called "bail-in" which is what happened recently in Cyprus. 
...People lost, and are still losing millions! Yet largely unreported in the MSM (mainstream media).
The bondholders are on the hook. 
***Legally***, a depositor in the bank is a "bondholder". So when they say, they that when a bank fails they will go after the bondholders...they mean customer deposits. This is why they invented FDIC insurance way back when...because people were losing their money they had put into the banks and people were running on the banks to try to get out their money from the banks. But the problem is that today, the FDIC insurance doesn't have enough money to cover all the deposits that would be lost if many banks failed. There are Trillions of dollars in FDIC insured deposits, and the last I checked, only about $50-Billion dollars worth of coverage with the FDIC...so maybe you would get your money back...after like 99 years after the banks fail.
***If you pay attention*** to the news, more Bail-Ins are coming, (i.e. "legally" stealing from your bank accounts)
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers said in March, "The heavy losses inflicted on depositors in Cyprus would be the template for future baking crises across Europe."
