Yep. Handling VISA scale efficiently would probably involve using wireless broadcast networks. But it's very much doable if there were VISA scale revenues to pay for the infrastructure.

I understand your point. But I don't think it's literally too late yet. Bitcoin still is the king of the crypto currencies by far. When one of the competitors to Bitcoin amasses a billion dollars in distributed value (what many people refer to as "market cap"), or when Bitcoin drops to $25/BTC or less, then maybe it'll truly be too late.

SPV with 2 confirms is not very safe, whether this patch is part of core or not.
Of course, what do you mean by "shouldn't accept payments"?

Yes, I'd like to get another 1-5m users in the next 12-24 months.
I'd also like to see the current users double their usage in the next 6 months, which I think is probably even more likely if only they are given the room in the blocks to do so.

I'm not familiar enough with bitaddress.org to answer that.
They'd be tied together more than creating separate random addresses, though. This might make a difference in terms of some rubber-hose cryptanalysis attacks. If the addresses were independent, then you'd have more plausible deniabillity that a particular address wasn't yours.

So would you be okay with this if it's wrapped inside a "if block_number &lt; 630000"?

Hi E. Vorhees. Long time listener, first time commenter here.
I don't know about them becoming my ally, but if Core commits to increasing the block size to 2MB within a reasonable amount of time, it'll at least solve the immediate issue.
Now, the main reason I finally created an account on reddit is in the hopes of obtaining a beer.

No it doesn't.

The ability to claim btc is non-inflationary while it's actually inflationary until around 2140 (if that part of the code isn't changed), is a huge part of its draw.
It's kind of like when Congress balances the budget by passing a law which phases everything out after 10 years. 
When 2140 actually comes around (or maybe well before then, if the combination of the block reward plus transaction fees becomes too low to secure the network), maybe things will be different.

I think 2 meg blocks would quickly be filled, and we'd be pretty much right back where we started.
If BIP 109 were an actual compromise, that is, if pretty much everyone could agree on BIP 109, then it might be an adequate short-term fix. Is it one?

Thank you. I had already read the latter, but the former gives an argument for why SegWit should come before any hard fork which I hadn't heard previously.
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:56:27
Specifying my preference a little more, what I'd like to see is: Hard fork to increase block size to 2MB and implement SegWit. Include the size of both the signatures and the rest of the transaction as part of the block size calculation (full nodes need everything anyway).
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:31:52
Thank you for your answer.


That might be something I'm missing. Why do nodes have to support non-SegWit transactions if you hard fork?


As I understand it, a SegWit hard fork would also have the advantage of not requiring fake anyone-can-spend transactions.

In terms of this patch, the fact that a block has txes in it other than the coinbase tx would be equivalent to the flag being set.

I'm on the same page as Hal Finney there.
As I understand it, the reserve currencies on top of which Visa and everyone built their payment networks handle even more transactions per day than the payment networks themselves, though.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:42:34






The problem is when a block is produced that part of the network can handle and part of the network cannot. If a miner is within the part of the network that *can* handle the block, and that part of the network controls &gt;50% of the hashing power, then it's perfectly within the rational self-interest of the miner to create that block.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:23:56


Is that true, though? If you don't update your client, you'll reject all new blocks. But that doesn't stop you from spending what you already had before the fork.
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:57:53




And the cost of *storing* value in Bitcoin is much more than the cost of *transferring* value using Bitcoin.
Devam13 said something about tx fees, not about eliminating all fees entirely.


On the contrary. People making transactions are heavily subsidizing people who hold Bitcoin and just sit on it.
Ideally there would be a periodic fee charged to every tx output. Dust outputs would quickly fall in value to zero, and could be purged from the blockchain. The collected fees could go to increasing the block reward. So you could maintain some block reward without messing with the 21 million limit.
That 10 cent tic-tac purchase would work using a CoinJoin technique. Inputs: $9.50 from the purchaser and $175.20 from the merchant. Outputs: $9.399 to the purchaser and $175.30 to the merchant ($0.001 fee). So there wouldn't have to be any small outputs. Then, say once a month, there would be a $0.001 fee on every output. This would much better reflect current costs, where there is a $0.05 fee which is charged whether the transaction sits in the unspent tx output array for 1 day or 5 years.
I'm not sure how this could be shoehorned into Bitcoin though. I guess a hard fork would do it.

What problems would be caused by  which don't fall into category 1, 2, or 3 above?


SegWit seems fine to me. I'd like it better as a hard fork, but even as a soft fork it seems acceptable.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:56:46
What if the peers don't send new blocks to a peer which indicates during the handshake that it has a version which would reject new blocks?
As far as acceptable UX, I'm not all that concerned about UX when someone is using woefully out-of-date software and refuses to upgrade.

It's Gregory's hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty in posts like that which turn me off from everything he says. He makes hard forks out to be this horrible dangerous thing which "rewrit[es] the rules" right after touting Bitcoin's capacity roadmap which also rewrites the rules, and also is dangerous. Gregory's explanation is not honest. He has chosen what he wants to do, and he is pulling out every excuse he can think of to try to justify it. That's one reason why people are accusing him of doing things solely to benefit his company. Because it's obvious to those who know how Bitcoin works that the reasons he gives are lies.
Maybe what Bitcoin Core is doing is the right thing. But if so, they need to come up with a better spokesman than Gregory Maxwell. Someone who can acknowledge that there are two sides to these arguments, and who can explain the real reasons why Core has come down on one side rather than the other.

And how do you obtain that altcoin? And how does your counter-party spend that altcoin?
Altcoins are maybe part of a solution to some problems, but you can't *always* use an altcoin. If you could, then why would anyone bother with Bitcoin in the first place?
(Somehow my comment above got deleted. It was saying that people in the US who aren't in poverty are likely to be in the top 1% of worldwide income. Specifically, $34,000/year puts you in the top 1% of worldwide income.)

Well, lets see. Let's say we have 10,000 bitcoin nodes. Let's say that transaction is 200 bytes. So 10,000 * 200 bytes = 2 megabytes.
Let's say transfer costs $0.10/gig and storage costs $1/gig. So the cost of transfer and storage of that transaction is...0.002 gigabytes * $1.10/gigabyte = $0.0022.
So, I'd say no, it's not terribly inefficient.
With that said, the real flaw in Bitcoin is that the fee is charged for a transaction, while the bulk of the cost is in the storage. If one were redesigning Bitcoin from scratch, a better fee structure would be to charge monthly or yearly for taking up space in the UTXO (unspent transaction output) table. (Spent transaction outputs can be pruned, as is described in the original Bitcoin paper.)
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:57:13
Which is why I said "or maybe well before then, if the combination of the block reward plus transaction fees becomes too low to secure the network." Right now the inflation rate is over 8% a year. Even after halving it'll still be over 4% a year. People are claiming to have their cake and eat it too right now.
By the time things get to 2% a year, something's going to have to change. (Lots more transactions, or much more expensive transactions, are two possibilities that various people are fighting over right now.) By the time things get to 0.5% a year, a *lot* is going to have to change.
Or maybe there will be a movement in 8 years to hold inflation steady at 2% a year instead of going down to 1% a year. I'm not recommending it. I'm not saying it's necessarily going to happen. In fact, I think the most likely scenario is that some time before inflation hits 0.5% a year that the vast majority of people won't care about Bitcoin any more, because something new will have come to replace it.
In any case, 2% per year is not "non-inflationary." But if it is, then the fact that people like bitcoin because it's "non-inflationary" does not exclude eliminating the 21 million cap and replacing it with a 2% inflation per year cap. (Which is something I'd support if, but only if, holders of 95% of all BTC also supported it. Which is to say, I almost definitely wouldn't support it.)

If I get paid 3 BTC every week and spend it over the course of the next two weeks (gradually and steadily), then I have, on average, 1.5 BTC at any given moment. My net effect on demand is equivalent to buying and holding 1.5 BTC for eternity.
Of course, some people will get paid 3 BTC and spend it all immediately. But most people hold on to at least some spending cash on a pretty much continuous basis. If they hold that spending cash in BTC, in the same way that people hold cash in the bank so they can pay for things with their debit card, then there's a net demand increase for BTC.
@_date: 2016-02-04 03:19:17
My comment was about what the effect would be *if* people use it like a debit card. Whether or not "most" people are ever going to do that, I'm not going to speculate on.
I would. If I could get a bitcoin debit card, it'd be the one in the top spot in my wallet. I'd probably even close my online bank account whose debit card currently holds that top spot. (I'd keep my credit union account, since I have my mortgage with them. But I pretty much never use that debit card. In fact, I don't even carry that debit card in my wallet.)
Add bill pay and I'd use it for paying my bills too.
