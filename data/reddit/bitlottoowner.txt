Interesting. I guess that would work too. I think the part I like for now though is that often the winning ticket will look the same at the beginning. They don't have to run or calc anything. 
Eg. Last draw picks were: ece9d517dc
The winner's ticket was:  ec75edecb0...
People can just look at it and see that indeed the beginning is close and know how theirs compares.

too funny!

LOL. Thanks. Do you know of any way I can have an escrow that doesn't rely on a person to authorize? Maybe some type of thing were multiple parties carry part authorization or something.

For every person who enters it becomes harder and harder to actually do that. Almost impossible once you have enough players. I know just from people talking to me that there is at least 6 players. I'm sure there is more but I don't know how many are buying multiple tickets. It's pretty much anonymous.

Oh how cool it would be for bitcoin to be main competitor to the dollar.

I wish I had that much. If I did, I wouldn't be trying to operate a legitimate lottery to make a small cut. :) But ya, I'm aware that I COULD be doing that but was hoping if anyone had ideas if it was possible to actually rig who won. Not win by buying a crapload of tickets. 
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:49:21
oh and at the time (only used this method once) a 49 was ignored...so 16 times 3 = 48

No. If a miner had lot's at stake they could generate a block near the time and not submit it if it doesn't work. It doesn't give him a win but it does very slightly increase their odds. They COULD get one re-roll if you will. It also makes sure there are a few blocks set in stone because of the confirmations.

I got ya. I'm looking for rigging or cheating the results. I'm not trying to ask if I'm the most trusted lottery but the hardest to rig. That's all. I understand I can play till I lose. I understand! 
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:57:11
I guess the only way to prove that I'm not buying 99% of the tickets would be to get the richest Bitcoiner to buy tickets with all his money then beat me! 
Honestly I can't think of a way to prove I'm not buying all the tickets. (it's anonymous after all) I guess it would be one of those things that would be noticed when I lose I guess...
@_date: 2011-07-12 15:48:00
I'm looking for NOT being noticed. That would be noticed once I leave and everyone would be after me. That's more stealing than cheating since anyone can buy a bunch of tickets and do the same thing. That's how raffle lotteries work. 
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:06:31
I want to eliminate even a miner with a super computer increases his chances even a tiny tiny bit. Some miners would at least get one re-roll if they don't submit a block. Sure they can't win but they do increase the odds.

Are you the same guy I debated a while ago on the forum?
Anyways, I understand your point thank you. 
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:32:50
But you don't have to use trust at all that I'm not rigging who wins. 
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:06:54
A bitcoin forum member I see! :)
I wish I had that much BTC!
Eventually though it would be noticed. Perhaps someone else is doing just that? It's a raffle. The more you buy the better your odds against the total. 
To use an escrow I'd need one that can be trusted a lot. I haven't found one yet that doesn't depend on one person (they could be playing), or have the risk of being in a country where the gov can seize things easily. If I find one that doesn't ADD risk I'll do it. For now I can't do it without adding even more parties that have to be trusted. Hopefully with time people see that I can be trusted.
@_date: 2011-07-12 15:59:34
Of course. I know. 
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:08:40
Yup. I think you may have better odds with mine though and not as expensive to enter! ;)

It does make the winning hash look very similar to the hash to find the winner though. Appearances make it look like a similar hash.
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:47:51
Ya the older ones used methods that weren't as good.
Transaction hashes can't be changed after they are in a block. It doesn't matter anyways since they don't know the target they are aiming for.
From the details page:
The first 10 digits (letters a-f are also digits) of the final hash will become the 10 picks used to determine the winner. The ten picks will then be published along with the winner so others can double check the winner without dealing with all the technicalities if they don't want to.
The first pick is used to see who has the correct first digit. (The first digit of ticket transaction hash) If only one person has the first digit matching the first pick they are the winner. If multiple people have matching first digits they continue on while the rest are eliminated. The second digit is now compared with the second pick. If only one person in that group has a matching second digit they are the winner. If multiple people have matching second digits they continue on and it continues on until the picks are used up. If during comparison at any time no one in the group has a matching digit to the pick being used the digit being compared is removed and the pick stays the same until a correct digit appears. Digits are compared and removed until someone's hash gets a match. In the event that all picks are used up and you still have more than one potential winner the first pick is used again and the process continues until a winner is found or their hashes run out. If during comparison the entire hashes of the group of potential winners runs out they then use the first pick as a tie breaker. Whoever has the most occurrences of the first pick in their entire hash is the winner. When using the first pick as a tie breaker it's possible for each potential winner to have the same count. If that is the case the next pick is looked at to see if a tie can be broken. It continues until all picks are used. In the extremely rare case you still have a tie after this process, the remaining potential winners equally share the funds.
It would be pretty impressive if there was still a tie after that.
