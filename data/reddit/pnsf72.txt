All these moves are only a way to prevent fiat currencies to disappear... that's what the PBoC is doing with dollar by selling their reserves they are artificially keeping the yuan afloat!!! (Last year alone the PBoC sold more that 200 Billion dollars of their reserves).
Because they cannot do the same with Bitcoin they spread the "news"!!!

Try Xapo and order their Xapo VISA card (withdrawal limit £2000/day)
TenX has also a visa card that allows withdrawals.
Not sure if it helps you!
