No, and I am fine with that. If you want to have a ultra-decentralized store-of-value coin then go create that alt coin. Don't try to make bitcoin into that by attempting to preserve a temporary anti-spam measure like its supposed to be a critical feature.

More money from transfer fees would make it more valuable if it was a company valued based on earnings, but lower fees makes it more valuable to the users. I dont know how to put a number on the value a p2p network, but if western union is valued at 9 billion I think the valuation of bitcoin is probably fine.

Nope. If you are a bad actor you want bitcoin not fiat. So you buy up all the bitcoin with gox-dollars they cant get out of the exchange. Then people deposit more bitcoin then you buy them up. Price goes up and people flood the exchange with more bitcoin to steal.

My understanding is that the assignat was a kind of bearer bond that was being used as money. So the "face value" was the value when the bond matured, but the government issued way more than they could ever pay so they started trading for less than the "face value."

It might be added in addition to mining as an emergency measure in the case of a 51% attack, but proof of stake needs to be improved to replace mining.

Anyway, if you want to test it send some bitcoin to a new address and then send it again so it has really low priority and when blockchain says you need a fee just click no, or cancel or whatever it is and instead of canceling the transactions it will send your bitcoins out with zero fee to languish till some miner decides to take pity on them.

"Let’s create a game to understand this better. In my game there are 100 QuantCoins and I am the angel investor who holds them all. There are ten players. I loan out 10 QuantCoins to each player and charge 10% interest, and I take a 50% equity position in each player. All players must either pay off their loans, with interest, after 20 rounds of the game or go bankrupt and I collect whatever money they have left. Only if they pay off their loan do they get to keep half of what they made."

Bitcoin does not use floating point operations so disregard all of that. We are currently sitting at about 15 terahashes/sec. That's about 9 mil in graphics cards or butterfly labs mini-rigs. 
Going forward an attacker would have to produce more ASICs than butterfly labs. Should be trivial for any government or major corporation.

I don't buy this explanation of the origin of money any more. People used all sorts of things as money before gold became the standard and those things were not always valuable in themselves like seashells or those giant stone disks. The important part is that they were scarce, not that they were inherently valuable.
Using scarce objects as a medium of exchange is a kind of distributed ledger. If you doubt this remember that cryptocurrencies are sometimes called digital tokens and a scarce object being used as a medium of exchange is a physical token. Cryptocurrency is a better ledger and so it will win in the end and we can take the gold out of the vaults and make electronics and shit with it.

To the best of my limited understanding the chain would fork and miners inside the country would continue processing transactions.

Bitcoin isnt anonymous, you can take steps to conceal your identity, but the NSA could still probably identify you if no one else. 
Exchanges(what you are talking about) are the opposite of anonymous due to AML KYC bullshit. If you want to get anonymous bitcoins you will have to do a cash transaction in person.

Bitcoin does not do floating point operations. The flops number is extrapolated from an estimation of the number of flops that a gpu could do if it was floping rather than hashing, but with the rise of asics it is a pretty meaningless number.

If you want to use a memorable phrase in a brain wallet then salt it. Create a random string of letters and numbers and copy it a bunch of times and store it a bunch of places and then add it to the end of your brain wallet phrase. 
Ya its not entirely in your head at that point, but its much less likely that someone will come across your salt, realize what it is, and then start brute forcing just to get your specific brain wallet than to have a memorable phrase cracked. 
Also, if you forget your phrase you have a chance of bruteforcing it yourself and recovering it.

I don't know the details about electrum but its probably stopping you because there is not enough in that address for a reasonable transaction fee, and being a tiny transaction it will have really low priority and might never get added to a block.

How would they regulate it though? They can regulate US companies and citizens who use bitcoin, but if they try to force changes in the protocol the miners in US would just sell off their mining equipment rather than try to exist as a fork. No one would respect the FED chain fork.
The government could have all the control they want over an impotent fork, and the rest of the world and the US black/grey market will be business as usual.

I dont know. This was basically the concern that kept me out of bitcoin when I first heard about it. I think the [network effect]( will prevent any altcoins from being more than an interesting side show to bitcoin unless they find some real innovation to do, but I am not at all certain about that.  
It does appear that the network effect can be... dampened by geographic and language barriers, but geographic and language barriers shouldn't be a... thing with bitcoin.
I diversified to gold when litecoin started doing.... whatever it is doing.

I ruminate about such things myself. It helps me to think about my choices now. What will bitcoin be tomorrow? 100? 200? What will it be in a year? 1000? 0? What should you do **right now**? Buy? Sell? Remember that the choice was just as hard for you a year ago as it is right now. You only kick yourself about the decision because of the information you have now, but the information you have now could just have easily been that bitcoin is $.15 rather than $150 and you could have been congratulating yourself rather than kicking yourself.
Your past self didn't have the information that you have now. It was a hard choice. Be kind to yourself.

If an onion routing system was integrated with bitcoin then they could be configured to use as many/few hops as one feels one needs and by paying for the bandwidth the bandwidth is sure to be there. 
For example you could configure a browser to access youtube over your regular internet connection. Access your email over 3 onion hops, and access silk road or whatever over 20 hops if you want.

The value of a cryptocoin is based on the network effect not the existence of a cryptocoin, so if you duplicate bitcoin you dont inflate it x2 you inflate it to the extent that it is adopted in leiu of bitcoin. The same effect that gives bitcoin its value makes it unlikely that altcoins will be adopted.

Remember that the choice was just as hard for you a year ago as it is right now. You only kick yourself about the decision because of the information you have now, but the information you have now could just have easily been that bitcoin is $5 rather than $50 and you could have been congratulating yourself rather than kicking yourself.

This number is extrapolated from who knows what. They probably took a popular GPU and did flops/hashes for that gpu and multiplied that by the hash rate of the whole network. When everyone was mining on GPUs that gave you a very rough estimate of the amount of floating point operations the network could do if it wasn't doing hashes instead, but it is a meaningless number in the age of ASICs.
