If you don't think the "exchange" part of the equation is important, then I have 100 trillion dollars worth of diamonds I'd like to sell you, I'll even give you a great deal, $100k. The only problem is that its on an asteroid in deep space. That shouldn't be a problem though, right? Since it holds value and all. 
The exchange element is just as important, and your ignoring this isn't going to change that reality.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:11:30
I'm going to point you back to my previous comment, I'm not sure you read it, and if you did, I'm not sure you understood it. 
To your point and to clarify mine, fluctuations in price are fine for "stores" of value (e.g. 1-3% per annum). 20% daily swings are not. BTC is not a "store of value", key word being store. It does however "have" value. The difference between these 2 is incredibly important. I'm not going to try to convince you of this, because it is in your own interest to understand why this is. If you don't, I can make a prediction that I'm 95% certain on. If you don't get clear on why this is important, and where Bitcoin is failing here, you in all likelihood will lose money. This is obviously your prerogative, but I expect not your intention. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:11:56
You know what's better than a store of value, an exchange of value.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:57:03
I'm not complaining, I'm not sure what language you're inferring that from. I am saying, however, without the exchange, Bitcoin isn't even a good "store" of value. Anything that regularly drops or rises 20% in a day isn't a "store", you could say it "has" value, and that'd be accurate, but qualifying it as a good "store" of value is not accurate. For something to act economically as a good "store" of value, it needs to have a high degree of predictability. That's why the USD is currently, and for now at least, such an important standard for "storing value", as its value is very predictable. Bitcoin doesn't have that. 
So no, it's not a good "store of value", it doesn't facilitate a good "exchange of value" either, what you can gsay about bitcoin is that it currently "has" value. The relationship of these 3 elements is critical to the long-term potential of BTC. These aren't opinions, these are facts.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:17:23
Are you telling me something that can swing 20% a day is a safe store of value? It's safe only in that it can't be hacked. This needs to function or it's going to die.

This is the kind of mindset that kills organizations, and it will do the same to any crypto. The moment you take your position as market leader for granted, is the moment you lose. Others want your spot. Others are hungry for it, and they'll do whatever they can to take it. There is no higher prize in crypto than dethroning bitcoin. I would not be so cavalier about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:45:47
You guys and your drama. You're going to kill this coin, you know that? WORK ON THE PRODUCT. That's all the focus should be. This spat between BTC and BCH is some of the most juvenile drama I've seen since 7th grade. Grow up. Work on the product, make it the best possible, and the rest will take care of itself. This is embarrassing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:57:36
This is the kind of crap that brings regulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:55
I'm not contending BCH is a better alternative, I'm contending that BTC is not keeping up with the market, and while it has the brand, it will only take people wanting to use their money for anything for them to realize it's too slow and expensive to be any sort of functional currency. Satoshi didn't design a "store of value", he designed a p2p cash system, and it's become a store of value because it's not moving quick enough. You know what else used to be called "store of value", beanie babies, seriously. The fees and time to process a transaction are ridiculous, unacceptable. This is only getting worse. Lightning needs to be fast tracked as much as possible, but I suspect part of the problem is that there is a vested interest in it taking a while, people are making too much money from transaction fees and that vested interest is strangling the long term potential of BTC. At the end of the day, people don't care about bitcoin, they care about being able to transfer value, and doing so cheaply, quickly and securely. BTC has 1 of those 3 right now. Look at the long run play here. No one needs a "digital" store of value. What good is that? What benefit does a "store of value", especially a highly volatile one have over a stable cryptocurrency? Maybe you have an answer to that, I don't. I don't care about BCH, I care about functional crypto as Satoshi envisioned it. BTC today isn't it. It needs to catch up because it's falling behind. I want it to succeed, but this pace isn't working, and eventually, if things don't change, this train will derail and money will move into other cryptos. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't think so though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:05
Why isn't there room for both? 
Also, saying BCH is not worth the trouble, I think misses the point entirely. They are ABSOLUTELY worth the trouble. That's part of what Satoshi envisioned, that Bitcoin could never be controlled because it could always be forked. The fact that they disagree over protocol is exactly what was intended. It may suck as a BTC holder, but this is entirely what was intended and exactly what should happen.

Oh my gosh, lol. Who in the world is talking about mining gold? That has never ever ever been a part of this argument. Are you only bringing it up because it’s the only thing that slightly gives the bitcoin argument water, because no one is talking about mining gold, only the storage of already mined gold. How many times does this need to be said? I feel like you’re trolling me.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:26:06
Who said anything about mining gold? People realize that less than 1/10th of 1% of gold that will he bought this year was mined this year, correct? I’m taking about holding gold as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:03:07
Except that it’s terrible and a plague on the environment. Owning gold, selling gold costs nothing for me or the environment. Selling $40 in bitcoin will cost me $70 and use enough energy to power a Tesla 1,000 miles. BTC sucks. I’m glad it’s getting people into the market, I’m terrified that we’ll miss climate caps because 5 guys want to make a fee pool. The world will be better when BTC is gone and better DAG or PoS cryptos are the standard.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:58:39
I'm with you, both BTC and BCH have serious technical challenges that they have to resolve. I think there's really a place for both, and I don't get this team a v team b politics, I don't really care. We should be working together here to figure out a workable model so that we can reclaim currency, that's the entire point isn't it?

Have you considered kiva? Kiva is a micro lending group that helps poor families secure funding for all sorts of worthwhile projects. The beauty of kiva is that the participants pay zero interest, they just pay back the loan as they’re able. That money can then be relent. It’s a great service that’s helping millions and has been shown to be more effective than just donating to poor communities.

You realize less than a 10th of one percent of the gold that will be bought this year will be mined? Most gold bought and held has already been mined. And who in the world is talking about mining? You want to see this clearly, look at what it would take to trade 1 oz of gold for 3000 years, then compare that to the amount of energy it would take to run 1 bitcoin over 3000 years. This is pretty straight forward and doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see.

You guys and your “attacks”. Hey, wake up, this is business. You stay competitive or you lose, that’s how this works. Bitcoins fees are insane. It’s slow, and costs 100x too much. It’s not an attack, it’s competition, they’re coming for your market share. Your job is not to be complacent and stay competitive. Right now, the only thing BTC has going for it is brand. I’m cheering for BTC, but you guys have got to get your act together. So many here act entitled to be  Guess what, they all want to be  and they’re trying to earn it. BTC’s job is to prove it deserves it. Get lighting here now. Until then, stop complaining about others coming after your market share. What did you expect?

Gold has been money for 5,000 years, long before we harnessed electricity or had the internet.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:24:53


I do, because you are looking at it in a very confused way. The price of fiat has collapsed, the value of gold has not skyrocketed. In 1913, 1 oz of gold would have bought a very nice man's suit. Today, it buys the same. Throughout most of written history, a days wage came out to about .1 ounces of silver for non-skilled lower tier workers globally. That's about $2 today, which is close to the $2.13 lower tier workers earn daily on average. PMs haven't exploded in value, fiat has collapsed and at times seen deflation. Very different.


I disagree for technical reasons. BTC has a LOT to prove still, such as working on a global scale as gold does. For the record, I do not think gold is ideal money, not by a long stretch, and frankly, I think it is fairly archaic. I also think BTC is the best alternative to gold we have, aside from silver, but BTC from a sober perspective still has a lot to prove. Its price is driving interest and adoption, which is a byproduct of scarcity. Technically though, it has some serious hurdles to overcome, and to say otherwise is to either express disingenuous, or a lack of understanding of what technologically needs to be achieved in order to serve as a global reserve.
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:21:26
This is patently incorrect for more reasons than I would probably care to illuminate here.
I'm an economist who specializes in monetary history. What you are saying is simply not true. Gold and silver were literally the monetary base. To say they were not worth as much is along the lines of saying, "money didn't use to be worth anything." 
I hold BTC, but it still has a ways to go to prove itself, and to pretend that it has solidified itself as digital gold is a very, very big stretch.

I think you can still transfer out at any time, you just can't make exchanges. Am I misinformed?

You really kicked that straw man, nice job. 
However, I do know a lot about this, I am an economist who has been researching, studying and analyzing this space since 2017. What you are saying is factually false. The majority of hash power can be traced to coal, and sub traced to certain smaller regions of China receiving massive energy subsidies in regions primarily powered by dirty energy, or what would be considered C02 dense energy. That's what I was saying. You were saying things too, it's just that what you were saying was mostly incorrect.

@_date: 2019-08-21 17:36:49
"Is P2P" - Assuming tx costs aren't cost prohibitive.
"Is Decentralized" - 4 mining pools controlling 80+% of hash power.
"Anonymous" - Not at all
"Best Investment" - Highly volatile value - As long as you don't need that money at any specific point in time. 
"As good as gold" - Doesn't work without electricity and ideally internet. 
I own BTC, but there are way better arguments than this and most of these are objectively false.
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:24:17
Cool typo catch bro. You got me. Pretty much invalidates everything else I've said.
I did not make the original claim, you did. I responded with what I personally know to be true. I'm not trying to convince you of anything though, I was simply calling out the falsehood you were spreading. I don't care what you believe, and frankly, you do not exactly strike me as someone with an open mind worth taking this to a different level with. BTC uses primarily clean/renewable energy, as you say? Great. Let's see the research. You support *your* claim. 
Otherwise, that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

I find it hard to fathom how anyone working in innovation in the banking industry would not care about revolutionizing and automating liquidity management and cutting the necessity for nostro/vostro relationship management, which are huge costs. If your bank doesn't care, you may want to find another bank who does, because by the time they do care, it will probably be too late.

Millennials are broke and the long game looks like a trajectory into the ground. Who can blame them for looking for a way out of the trashed ecosystem those before us have left us? 
What I love is, the power system has accumulated all of these "dollars", and millenials are saying "fine, we'll redefine what a representation of value means." This may sound dramatic, but it's effectively what's occurring from a high level. We can't win the game, it's rigged, so we changed the rules and created a new game. If you haven't read Malcom Gladwell's *David and Goliath*, this is how underdogs win all the time, and right now, millennials are the underdogs.

Finance, power, consumption, and credit aren't standard protocols. Protocols exist when they have a mandatory utility, there's no mandatory utility of bitcoin for a finance network. I don't have a problem with global currency of the internet, I have a problem with single global currency of the internet, that's just dumb. We know for a fact that China is inventing its own crypto currency, so there will be at least 1 more, and this is in all likelihood will be the norm not the exception.

There have been over 600 fiat systems throughout history, prior to 1971. Every single one of them has failed. Historically speaking, this person is absolutely correct. 
The better argument is that while this may be true about bitcoin, it can be said about literally any other hard asset. You could make the same argument about a brick and you would be just as correct.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:55:27
Honestly? Yes. To put it another way, every non-gold based financial system has failed, and failed consistently after abandoning gold. There is a history spanning over 4,000 years and hundreds of financial systems that tell the exact same story. 
Do I think gold is the best money possible? Absolutely not, it is a rock. However, it is a rock that keeps governments honest, and for the time being, it is the best we have.
