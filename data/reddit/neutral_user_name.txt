Make that 3 months bro... I cannot wait for the 2x split when BScore coin will lose 85% of hash power. Oh yeah, that's right, hash rate does not mean anything. Bye.

Only since May or thereabouts, everynow and then. No biggie.

pssst: here is the ticker for the REAL Bitcoin: BCC (or BCH on some exchanges). You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:39:25
yes, it is called a "soft fork" (vs a "hard fork"), but sometimes the changes are too important and the new version cannot be made compatible with the old version.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:57:45
Yes. As per the NYC Segwit2x agreement (Jeff Garzik and friends), there will be a 2MB Bitcoin with Segwit (with about 85% hashpower), and a the Bitstream Core 1 MB shitcoin, which will die off.  
Future = Bitcoin Cash

A side-chain?
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:44:27
It's not because I would not use it that I would not be affexcted by it ie.: fractional reserve principles introduced by it. It is a complete departure from the original Bitcoin intent and usage. What a mess.

I am under the impression your post won't get far

So much for consensus
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:28:08
btc only, bcc is already flying alone, there was a clean break, whatever happens on the btc chain has no influence on the bcc one.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:45:50
If I wanted more of the same thing, I would not invest in Bitcoin. Plenty of it in the fiat world. I am done with fractional reserve banking. Segwit creates it.

Bitcoin Core is financed by insurance companies and banks. Wake up.

Oh, you are able to predict that the NYA agreement will fail? You good.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:34:48
yes, This is not a decision that is taken lightly. This shows you how much Blockstream is stupid (forcing Segwit down people's troath, vastly diverging from the Bitcoin essence (originial Satoshi white paper)).
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:47:11
I am going to guess you are of the opinion that the most important metrics is number of nodes? How did I know that, hmmm?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:41:30
The longer chain with the most hashrate is bitcoin. Soon, that will be BCC.

If Bitcoin had not already been taken over, then there would not be any takeover attemps.

It sure is, 100%. But not from the users. From BlockStream, AXA and the Bilderberg Conference. Keep downvoting me, it stings so hard, ouch.

Governments HATE Bitcon, as it represents a h-u-g-e potential breach in their inflated monetary scam. Any government intervention in relation with Bitcoin is bad, bad news.

I have no idea what you are trying to explain. Please take a deep breath, and come up with a nicely worded, clear answer. I am fully open to hear your ideas.

@_date: 2017-06-19 10:21:44
Ah, much better, thank you! I guess I am learning about side chains and drive chains now.
My point was about an article I read earlier today, where it was explained that:  


maybe it is wrong or I missed some context. I will read it again later today, while now having your clear explanation in mind.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:46:18
I just read your site. Here are the main 2 contradactory statements I picked from it:  


Let's call the above M0, or some kind of M1 variation, or Narrow money... and  


The later could me assimilated to M3 and M4, or Broad money
Do you know how we call what I just described? You got that right: fractional currency, or fractional reserve banking. Yes, the very same thing that creates inflation.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:13:40
Dude, those ibankers are not benevolent. They will want to maximise their return, and they will succeed by taking advantage of TVM (time value of money), which ineluctably lead to fractional banking. That's exactly what -I- would do. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:34:43
Coinbase is a reputable outfit, licensed by NY authorities and with Venture Capital backing/funding. They are not a fly-by-night operation that could pull some crass shit. Too many high profile people and institutions involved. - but we never know!
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:13:59
Spent about 35-40 minutes reading this in diagonal. What I took out of it:


That completely defeats the purpose of cryptocurrencies. It is well established that "trusted" third-parties are amongst the worst kind of security holes. I cannot believe this party keeps going.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:59:04
Without looking too hard for it, I heard 2-3 things that turned me off about poloniex: withdrawal problems, insider trading investigations, lags on their trading platform, server availability hickups, DDoS attacks against them, no listed street address... Mainly run by a couple dudes, Mike and Tristan... It is starting to be a bit much for me. I hear good things about their trading platform, quite complete for trading several crypto currencies, much more extensive than Coinbase (they are 2 different beasts, really.) Good luck.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:56:15
Thanks, thats' what I figured. I have since then also realised that:  
a) I got some answers from the "corporate side" of bitcoin, which confused me.  
b) Side chains are a complex topic, regardless of the trusted party issue. It appears there were BIP suggestions and discussions that predate that whole monetary inflation kerkuffle.
