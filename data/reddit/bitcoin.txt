That was r/bitcoin, but you're welcome.

Reddit rules don't allow selling accounts, so unfortunately the only thing I can do with this account is trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:38:17
Yes. Doubled it and paid the rent.

Hold it. The only true bitcoin will go back to 90% dominance on coinmarketcap. Trust me, I'm an expert.

Just when I thought that my old wallet is empty. Surprising benefits of shitposting.

Actually now I have an idea, but I think selling stuff will annoy people here equally as much.
I can sell a reddit account. 4BTC anyone?

Let's examine it. It is obvious that the address was also a part of a regular wallet, was used to for regular transactions, and accumulating btc from mining.
Some large transactions with 1750 btc received directly from mining:
Addresses that look like belonging to the same wallet, moving large sums forth and back:

Begging is very common in the bitcoin world. At the moment I don't have any well defined product to sell (few people have).
@_date: 2011-07-03 13:06:43
It is easy to check that the 25k guy got his bitcoins mostly from mining.
I think moving money multiple times through the same address was rare. Transaction fees discourage it.

File names are visible but files can not be copied from the volume.  It happened to me at least two times.
@_date: 2011-07-03 17:15:47








Those forum users had really strange ideas. Why would anyone sell 350K btc in one day? Clearly it's impossible to happen.

It makes me think, because transactions are free, can anyone just create two accounts and do a lot of transactions between them, to attack the bitcoin system?
In the current version of the client everyone has to store all blocks containing info about all transactions, and that data takes already over 200MB on hard drive.

Okay, the application works.

Truecrypt is not 100% reliable. Sometimes it breaks the encrypted volume and all data inside it is lost.
My advice is to use another encryption app besides truecrypt, or backup into two different truecrypt volumes and test after each write if the volume is not broken.

All right, but the point is, someone, or a group of people, can trash the Bitcoin p2p system with a lot of nonsense transactions forth and back. And all transactions need to be stored. Currently a copy of all transactions is stored by everyone, right?

Is it true that together with Ross Ulbricht you rewrote Bitcoin in PHP? And why did you do that?

It's opensource.

400K bitcoins is $4M dollars. Given all risks and uncertainties around bitcoins, no wonder some of the early founders exit their investments. Tomorrow mtgox or dwolla may disappear. It is the matter of one government intervention.
@_date: 2011-06-02 17:48:47
This will probably happen, and closing mtgox will cause a massive decrease of BTC value.
@_date: 2011-07-03 13:13:43
I disagree. It is beneficial, because it is better to observe and take example from wealthy than from unemployed. And bitcoin offers levels of transparency unprecedented in the world of finance. It is alright to take advantage of it.
And whether bitcoin will benefit the world, this is not obvious. It surely benefited early adopters.
