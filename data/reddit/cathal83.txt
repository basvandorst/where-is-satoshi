Yes, I did. I have a revolut card and I have used it quite a bit. Its excellent. 
When I read articles in the newspaper or online, it has typos. My own bank Bank of Ireland has had typos online. The crypto section is new and something they are working on but they have made a submission to the european banking agency to be recognised as a financial institution. Obviously this is just my opinion but I like it and like that I can buy and use crypto on the revolut card they sent me and it transfers the transaction from crypto to fiat (any fiat) instantly, anywhere in the world and for little or no tx fee. Brilliant. No hidden extra fees.

I find it encouraging that they did not tell you anything. Every exchange can potentially lose or have information hacked. Happens to banks, hospitals, schools, casinos etc. all the time. Kraken is one of the most secure. Coinbase and Bitstamp too. 
Not sure what you are getting at with this post. Other exchanges ask for a hell of a lot more. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:12:23
Well, you would have to be holding to understand... you slate something you don't understand. It's ok, you just haven't evolved. Some people when they trip and fall don't put their hands out in front of them to soften the impact and they faceplant. Best of luck to you and mind yourself out there.

I am unsure what you think I said but it seems you have taken great offence. There are rules to each reddit and you broke one of them. Hence, your post will probably be removed by the mods. You don't promote in reddits. Re research, I have done more than enough research in fact and I have better coins with better tech, actual dev teams and clearer futures in my portfolio. You don't know me so refrain from the insults. If you are part of the community then I suggest you stay away from trying to promote them. You'll give it a worse rep. Best of luck.

It's not just my opinion. It received an 'A' rating for security and customer service back in 2014/2015 and I, nor any of my colleagues, family or friends have ever had issues with it and we have all used it a long time. Just look up the independent investigations of exchanges by  TheBlogChain etc. You'll find the answers you seek there. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:04:37
Great. Just set up a revolut account and transfer your money there and use your revolut card on the exchanges. I don't use the bank for anything other than my mortgage. That can be paid off and then I won't need them for anything else.

Keep BTC and Eth. Once Eth hits 1000, sell it for LTC and with some profits from LTC convert to BTC. Buy more Doge (everyone needs a little bit of Doge in their lives), some maidsafe and stellar xlm and when it comes out, mobilecoin. Keep most, imo, in btc. There...now Hodl and sleep better at night. Bless you

The European Banks and American banks are lapping up this FUD and spinning it to say how 'concerned they are at the rise bitcoin'. Good! They should be. But South Korea wishes to regulate the exchanges that have anonymous accounts to weed out the criminals (so they say). They want exchanges that have ID Verification and to reduce the hacks on exchanges etc. Good luck to them with that. Andreas warned us only recently about all of this paranoia and FUD but it is history repeating itself too.  South Korea doesn't have that much pull on the crypto market but the FUD, the shills, the paranoia and the cracks showing in communities like this one does. We need to fight the FUD brothers and sisters.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:07:17
Yes, they are not banning. Regulating makes sense as it states herex it weeds out the scammer exchanges/bad players.

It is not a ban. It is a regulation on the exchanges which is a good thing, depending on what your position is, as it is looking to weed out the exchanges that are scamming and acting the bollocks!

Well, according to a number of posts on the xrp reddit...Ripple is decentralised and BTC is centralised... some BTC bashing going on over there.

Revolut has applied for a European Banking License and is expected to receive it. If so, it will mean that if it is shut down, for whatever reason, all card holders funds will be protected and refunded under the European Deposit Protection Scheme up to €100,000. That is not bad. You can find source for this on their site and many others.

I am not sure if you would consider a centre in  Ireland. I have always wanted to give something to this charity.  
The work that this charity does is phenomenal and I have always wished to do something to raise money for them after I saw the owner and one of the families of a very ill child being interviewed on TV. If not, either way what you are doing is amazing. Hats off to you.
Unfortunately, and fortunately, I am new to crypto but hope that someday I can make enough to give something to my own kids but also kids in this charity. This might sound odd but I am fortunate (touch wood) that my children are healthy and hopefully have a long life ahead of them but this charity will definitely get a chunk of any profits from crypto. Do consider them and congrats to you for Hodling!

I had a similar conversation with three lads. One a school principle, one an accountant and another works for some Chinese stock brokerage and was a lawyer. On top of what you are saying, two of them (accountant and lawyer/broker guy) but it is used by criminals... fml. The guy who is a lawyer and works for the broker, was quite on edge and a little passive aggressive about it. The accountant just kept running into brick walls with his arguments and was ao frustrated. I don't blame them as I asked them all finally, so what research have you read into block chain?...of course, none and they admitted that and promised to inform themselves. I doubt these two will be the school principle was intrigued as his background was economics and philosophy. He bought some ltc, stellar and btc recently. Good man!

I am a mental health professional and am pleased to see this post. I have a team of professionals that could provide Skype/Whatsapp sessions to anyone who wants to talk...or simply needs to be heard. I have thought about this on many occasions and I even posted on a thread a month or so ago that was discussing real world use of crypto. I wondered whether conducting therapeutic sessions for crypto would be the future and doing it over video chat too. It is a question that I still have. 
Aside from the above, the OP is spot on and spreading awareness is key here. Especially when there are less experienced traders and people buying in due to FOMO and thinking that the price rise is a certainty... only to see that they bought LTC at 350 with all they have or money they planned to use for their childrens education or health bills (I've seen these posts) and watch it dip to 250 or less. These consolidations are not that big of a deal to Hodlers and those who have done their research into a coin, who know that this is common and we've been here before, and have most likely only traded/invested what they can lose (which is the most important and least adopted advice). So...thank you to the OP for reminding us...and minding us. We could all do the same and pay it forward. 
Good health to you all. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:37:01
You can call it mass hysteria, mass adoption, mass common sense or mass revolution. They all carry a different sense though. There are many variables, one being FOMO but mostly the idea that you can become rich quickly and easily (which seems to be the message) and it is a also put forward as a 'standing up to the banks' and using crypto over fiat. I believe in crypto and its future but we have to remember that our comments here and support of others is crucial to its growth, its useability...community means everything.
