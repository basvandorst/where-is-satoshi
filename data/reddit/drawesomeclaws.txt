Say you wanted to change a transaction that took place about 2 weeks ago.  
With a block being generated every 10 minutes, the block that the transaction is in is about 2000 blocks behind the current block.  
So you change your transaction in that block, 2000 blocks before now.  But now the hash for that block is wrong because the transactions have changed.  So you need to find a new solution, a new nonce, to make the hash of that block valid (a hash lower than the difficulty at that particular block).  Ok, so you've gotten lucky and found a valid hash for the block containing your modified transaction... 
But that hash gets fed into the next block.  
So now you have to find a new nonce to solve the block 1999 blocks behind the current one.  Then that hash gets fed into the next block, so you have to re-solve the block 1998 blocks behind the current one.  And so on until you catch back up to the current time.  Meanwhile the real network has been continuing to add blocks, so you have to overtake that and create a longer chain.  
Once you have a longer chain, you can declare yourself successful, barring all the uproar, attempted chain blacklisting, politics, etc that happen when this new chain you've created manifests.

I think the best way to do this would be to set up a multisig transaction wherein 2 of 3 parties have to sign in order for it to be valid.  Then you don't need to share your private key.  
Say you want to have your child inherit your coins.  You could set up the transaction between you, your kid, and a bank/mediator/lawyer.  In order for the transaction to be valid, 2 of the 3 parties have to sign it.  So you and your lawyer could sign it to send it to the child, or you and the child could sign it, or once you die the child and the lawyer could sign it.  .  But the third party lawer can't just send the money, nor can the child just take it.  
You could also set it up so the transaction won't be valid until after a certain date (well, block number).

They're talking specifically about the immutability of the blockchain, the transaction record.  Not some nebulous general idea of immutability of the software.  To change a transaction at some point in the past you'd have to do the same amount of work as the whole network has done from that point until now within a very short amount of time, making it essentially immutable.

Each link is a bit, a 1 or a 0.  There is some risk when encoding it, but when reading it you're only looking at whether that link has been crimped or not.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:54:40
Risk plays a big part.  If i have 10,000 miners in my closet, I know if I plug them in I have *x*% chance of generating *n* coins, where x and n are a function of network difficulty over time.  
Or I can sell all the miners, probably making slightly less than I could theoretically make mining, but with little risk.

Many of the services actually pre-date the web (but not internet).  Originally you could buy a monthly subscription to one of the online service providers.  Most of the larger services had local numbers to dial into for most areas (at least in the US).  You'd dial in with proprietary applications which kind of functioned as web browsers but were custom built for whichever particular service.

The thing is, that with bitcoin there is moral hazard.  Mt Gox won't be bailed out if they're being dishonest with customer funds and go bankrupt.  
If another company wants to start a "bitcoin bank" that does fractional reserve banking, that's fine.  They'll just have to be honest with their customers about what they're doing or risk a major bank run if the customers find out.

Bitcoin isn't meant to be anonymous, though it does give you quite a bit of privacy if you choose to utilize it in a way that does so.  
If you buy 10BTC from an exchange, and then send that 10BTC to 100 addresses you own, there's no simple way for anyone to know weather you paid out 10BTC to random people or if you still have control of them.  Converting to and from fiat currencies will always carry risk if you're concerned about people finding out about your financial dealings.  
If I buy something on overstock.com with bitcoins or with a credit card, I can be easily found out regardless.  Since they're storing my personal information to ship the product to me.  
The nice thing about bitcoin is that I don't need to give overstock access to my bank account or credit card credentials.

The solution is just requiring a transaction fee in the transaction.  The merchant can enforce this, and upcoming payment protocols will create a simple, transparent, and one-step process for the customer to push a transaction to the merchant that includes a proper fee.

They do it all the time.  The vast majority of petty drug dealers are armed, and almost none of them have a pistol permit.  They're carrying illegal firearms to do something that carries very little criminal penalty in comparison to the penalty of getting caught with those weapons.  
But you didn't answer my question.  What country are you from?  What is your rate of violent crime and how do the demographics compare to the US?  You're implying we can make a direct comparison, so let us do that.

I am being honest here.  I never even implied anything of the sort, I'm sorry if you read into it wrong.  
If you'd like to continue the discussion, I'm game.  But my offer still stands, regardless of your insults.  My skin is thick, I don't take it personally for the most part.
But, the crux of your argument is that because I said homogenous populations generally have less conflict that makes me a racist.  Is that correct?  If so, can you point to any evidence counter to my assertion?  I mean, even if I'm wrong, that doesn't make me a racist, it just makes me wrong. But it seems to me that throughout history, much conflict has arisen because when people of different backgrounds mingle.  From Egyptians/Nubians to Bitcoin/Dogecoin, the communities conflict in various ways when they collide.  Generally this is a good process, as cultures die unless they evolve, but it can be messy.   
So, instead of just calling me a racist, please tell me why my argument is racist and why posting derogatory memes labeling large groups of people isn't?

Yes, what you are doing is bigotry, not technically racism.  It's the same idea though, labeling large groups of people based on bad information.  
I've lived in many places throughout the US, from Connecticut to Texas.  I've run into far more racism in the Northeast than I ever have down in Texas.  Boston is the most racist city I've ever encountered.  Texas is far from perfect of course, but the magnitude is smaller, communities generally more integrated, and the racists are vocal and easy to avoid.  
Regarding my games, I'm proud to make my opinions known to the people that buy my games.  I'm a humanist who makes no judgements of anyone based on their race or ethnic background.

Racist? That's ridiculous.   Homogenous populations statistically have less problems. When groups with different values and backgrounds populate the same area there is more opportunity for conflict.  I'm making no value judgement about the people, and it happens anytime different cultures cohabitate, regardless of what those cultures are.  Further, I've not said people shouldn't integrate, as I think that's a very good thing.  I'm just pointing out the fact that it creates friction, which is just a fact of life.   
To infer that I'm racist because of that is both intellectually dishonest and childish.  Let's stick to the discussion, and not throw around bullshit, eh?

People seem to compare bitcoin to the internet of the late 80s and early 90s, but I think a better analogy is is the internet in the early to mid 70s.  At that time basic infrustructure was being built and invented and discovered, and those inventions eventually led to powerful applications like the web (which really caused the mass adoption).  
Bitcoin seems to be much more in the phase of basic architecture, if any analogy is to be made at all.

Or they can invest that 0.1 BTC and turn it back into 1 BTC.  


They aren't paying less.  The amount of BTC might be smaller, but it'll still be representative of some amount of labor or energy.  Just like as a currency inflates, my paycheck might get larger but I'm not receiving greater purchasing power.  The employees in this hypothetical are being paid less BTC, but (as you pointed out), the cost of electricity is also less.  As is the price of other goods.

The headline then compares that to the amount of energy used though, implying that the bitcoin network is inherently more efficient or better designed.  The reason it can use so much less power is because it's not a general purpose platform. If the top 500 supercomputers were only doing double sha256 they'd use a lot less energy... in fact they'd just be the same as bitcoin ASICs.

If I was going to run a BTC trading platform (or anything of that sort), I'd put up an exact mirror of the site on a completely separate server.

If they get in they can keep whatever bitcoins they can steal, and I'd send them some more if they detailed how they exploited the site.

I just don't think even Satoshi knew what bitcoin was supposed to be, or what it would become.

Arguing that "Bitcoin is supposed to be &lt;x&gt;" or "Satoshi wanted &lt;y&gt;" isn't very useful imo.  All sides of the argument are equally valid because it's a decentralized technology and people will eventually vote by either embracing one plan or another.  Any argument of "Bitcoin is supposed to be..." is just one's opinion.   
I'm arguing against the type of argument being presented though, not the details of what is being proposed.

While I'm no expert on the matter, I can speculate that Bitcoin has very simple and basic Public / Private Key encryption as it's basis (AES256?).  This is tried and true, and and underlies much of our communication infrastructure.  
The blogger makes the point that security vulnerabilities can present themselves in novel ways when applying cryptographic solutions in new ways.  This is true, but also a constant in any application of cryptography.  That is no reason to assume that the idea is fatally flawed.  
The way bitcoin is designed, it's not as though some evil mastermind can just do some math and poison the whole currency.  Their blocks wouldn't be consistent with the network and they'd be rejected.  
If you can break Bitcoin then the world has much bigger issues than problems with peer to peer currency.  The blogger brushes this point aside, but it's still true.  Breaking Bitcoin in a fundamental way requires tearing down the foundations of our current encryption technology.

Keep in mind bitcoin is still in its infancy.  I'd expect any currency to be volatile at this stage.  While it probably is some sort of bubble, I'm having trouble seeing how it could be.  The increase in price has risen directly from demand for the currency.  With the fixed supply, and demand only positioned to increase, I'd imagine it could possibly go quite a bit higher.  
@_date: 2011-05-09 15:47:14

@_date: 2018-04-16 22:34:48
And there's the tribal mentality I'm talking about.  Bitcoin cash is just a fork with different consensus mechanisms.  You can choose not to use it because of perceived central control (which can also be argued in both directions), but it's certainly not a scam.  Im not a big fan of Roger Ver, and think craig wright is an idiot at best, and a con artist at worst.  But that doesn't make a scam.  It's just a fork of an open source project.  
I actually think Lightning might work pretty well if it ever really gets off the ground,but it is quite a departure from what the community was thinking back in 2013 (i can't say before that because i didn't really get into bitcoin/crypto until that time) when it was assumed the blocksize would increase.  But in the end it doesn't matter, one or more coins will be successful, and the scams will fall by the wayside (probably to be replaced by other scams, haha).

Anyone can learn the basic mechanics of bitcoin.  You don't need to understand the mathematical details of hashing algorithms or pub/priv keys in order to understand basically what they're doing.

I agree.  There are intelligent arguments one can make regarding fiat vs gold-backed currency, and their relations to Bitcoin.  He's not making these arguments.  
I don't know what will ultimately happen with Bitcoin, but there are a few things that (to me) make it really interesting.  Those are the facts that it works now, and that it'll be very difficult to slow down or stop.  
It's not a question of weather or not Bitcoin works, but how it will scale in the current environment.  The question is: will the forces working against it be enough to retard it's adoption significantly and stop it from gaining  a useful critical mass?
There's a discussion to be had, but this blogger is missing the point and doesn't seem to understand the factors involved.

A plan to decrease mining centralization by introducing a central authority to verify miners... no thanks.  
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:44:25
I also generally like coinbase, they've been instrumental in bringing bitcoin to where it is today by providing a simple way for normal folks to buy bitcoin.  Though, upon my last transaction they attempted to deduct the amount of bitcoin i bought multiple times costing me quite a bit in overdraft fees.  I've heard of others having this issue recently, and it really makes me question their technical infrastructure.  
As a result I will most likely not be using them anymore, nor will i recommend them.

I remember deciding it wasn't worth my time to go to Gavin's bitcoin faucet every single day when he dropped it down to only 1BTC/day instead of 5.  I mean, you could always just cheat it and give it different addresses, but why bother for just 1 BTC.  
Maybe someday I'll come across a hard drive with those wallets on it, but I'm pretty certain they're gone.
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:07:44
You're certainly right about it being a bit overkill.  That said, if I had large amounts of BTC I know I'd take every precaution i could.

I haven't done so, so I might be wrong, but i don't see any reason why you couldn't send a transaction to the blockchain without ever touching the wallet assuming you know the private key.   
Sure, in that case you're exposed while actually generating the transaction; but with adequate safeguards I'd imagine exposure is limited.

These are just engineering and UX challenges though. They'll be worked out by the market once bitcoin begins to mature

Just want to point out that the salt doesn't need to be secret, and each user should have an individual salt.  
You can store a salt for each user in your user's table.  The attacker having the salts isn't a big concern because they still need to generate a rainbow table dataset for each user's individual salt.

I think the volatility is to be expected, and would happen to any new, non-fiat currency when adoption begins to increase dramatically.  There's a (comparatively) large amount of money being pumped into a tiny market.  I'd imagine over time the price will become much more stable.

Basically, from my understanding thus far (just casually listened to security now 424), this could allow one to use their wallet for login.  
The website could show a (public) wallet address that belongs to you, and you sign a token proving you own that wallet address with that address' private key (just the same way you sign transactions to verify you own the address on the blockchain).

Can't really sue someone for shitty customer service.  
BFL is a shit company, but they were quite clear about dates being estimates and there being no promised ship date (At least through the majority of 2013, I don't know about the first batches of orders).

The Bitcoin protocol has the ability to handle microtransactions built into it already, it just hasn't been used / implemented widely yet.

Great response to his question.  I just want to point to something tangentially related.
Bitcoin essentially has kickstarter built into the protocol, which I think is super neato.  
It's not really implemented yet, but check out SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY for more info.

I ordered a Jalapeno a while back, glad I didn't go for the $200 for 2 extra Ghash.  It runs at a solid 8Ghash, has done so for about a month.
I don't have much sympathy for OP.  By the time he ordered there were multiple notices throughout the process stating that there was no estimated ship date, and estimates / projections from third parties were pretty accurate by then.

He shouldn't need to bring it online ever, since the account doesn't need to be online to send bitcoins to.

If that were the case they probably wouldn't go through the trouble of building a working ASIC miner and sending out review units.  Once you've spent the money to engineer the hardware, there's no point in sitting on it.  
@_date: 2013-09-10 04:13:55
I ordered a jalapeño around the same time.  By that point they made it quite clear that there was no promised ship date and no refunds. 
I can understand some people getting angry about their 2012 orders (assuming BFL was promising to ship by a certain date), but by April 2013 the terms were quite clear and the history of the debacle quite well known.

Wouldn't that make more sense as microbit rather than making a new name for the µ sign?
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:55:53
I agree.  Even if they should have stopped taking pre-orders (morally), they never did anything illegal.  Everyone who purchased one (at least after the initial few months) knew they were purchasing something that didn't yet exist and with an unknown ship date.  
BFL seems to be run like shit, and have horrid customer service... but they haven't technically scammed anyone out of any money.  They're just dicks, but that's not illegal.

A market for insurance will form once adoption grows enough for that to become a major issue.  Someone will start a company that'll replace your bitcoins when stolen in exchange for monthly premiums.

I can't speak much to what SQRL intends to be, but regarding bitcoin:
The addresses themselves are usually relatively disposable... with new addresses being generated for new transactions, change addresses, etc.  But that doesn't mean your wallet (the software that generates and manages individual addresses) can't be programmed to generate one specifically for use with SQRL which it always keeps around.  
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:26:43
I'd imagine you'd just see these things naturally consolidate with each other over time, if both bitcoin and SQRL are successful.  Since they're doing very similar things, it could end up being trivial to have all SQRL handlers be able to just use a wallet.  If most people already have a wallet, why not?  
It's mostly a usability and logistics question, and time will tell how the actual interactions evolve.

While it isn't a major concern, there is a risk when many miners suddenly pull out of the market.   If enough miners left all at once the difficulty wouldn't adjust immediately.  That means there would be a long time period where no transactions can go through because none of the remaining miners are able to solve blocks.  I believe this scenario has killed some other coins  
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:53:04
I think the third party bitfunder sends you through (weexchnage.co) really hurts them.   It looks like an unfinished website from 2001, very scammy feeling.  It seems to work and be legit, but their lack of any care for the website is a real turn off.  If they don't care enough to hire a professional web developer, why should I have any trust that they're keeping my account safe?   I wouldn't trust them with anything more than some extra dust.

There are engineering an logistical problems still, but you can trade them semi-securely with paper wallets in the same way the cassius coins work (with a tamper-proof way of hiding the private key).
In that case there's still the issue of being able to verify that the paper wallet is legit and not counterfit (as i don't think you can do this without revealing the private key), and that the issuer has not kept a copy of the key to themselves... but these kinds of issues with fraud and counterfeiting exist with physical cash as well.  
I'd imagine, if in time bitcoin becomes more usable and popular, various trusted third parties will spring up to provide (reasonably) tamper-proof physical notes which can be backed by the company and their insurance policies.  
Conversely, with the rate of adoption to technology always increasing, this might all just be a moot point by then.

In that case they still have to store the key to decrypt on their end, which will most likely be compromised in the event of an attack along with the rest of their data.
