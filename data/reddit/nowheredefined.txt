Lol I've considered this myself, wouldn't put anything past the Russians.  It's clear Ron Paul's audit the fed and implement the gold standard (which is so popular in these crypto subs) is their baby.  However I haven't seen anything yet to indicate Vitalik is working for them.  The Russians do like their crypto tho as it makes for great money laundering and bypassing sanctions.

How much is the filing fee for small claims court?  In my local it's around $50 iirc, a registered letter is like $20 or less.  If $5k is something you can eat as a loss then $70 is pittance to attempt recovery.

If everything you say is true and documented I imagine this will make a slam dunk small claims suit.  Send them your registered notice of impending legal action, I'm sure that will be more likely to generate some assistance than support tickets.

Ya I see all that but so far he seems also consistent with someone who just got away from Russia and wants to do his thing academic work here.  I'm not saying he's not GRU I'm just saying I'm not 100% on it yet, I'm watching him with suspicious eyes though.

Fair enough. I just really dislike the guy and wanted to take the time to point out that's he's probably working for the Russians and that would be why he has such crazy policy ideas that would actually harm the USA.  He was, at least at some point, a regular on such Kremlin propaganda outfits such as RT and Infowars.

Agreed.  Sensible regulation is a must.  Just because the tech is new doesn't mean it has to stay in the wild west forever.  Regulation will bring stability and adoption which will help further the goals of decentralization and personal empowerment

That was an amazing article, thank you, I'm going to have to read it a second time.

While I am personally *suspicious* of tether there is nothing in this article to raise alarm.  The fact that tether purchases of Bitcoin go up when the price of Bitcoin drops makes perfect sense.  The whole point of tether is to sell your Bitcoin for tethers when the price is high and buy back the Bitcoin when the price is low.  The fact that these buybacks cluster around $500 price threshold seems to me to be indicative of psychological factors but the article makes these out to be some kind of red flag as if people were supposed to be buying back randomly.  
I'm all for investigating tether and reasonable regulation to prevent market manipulation but these articles just make me scream out "that's not how this works, that's not how any of this works."
What does interest me about the printing and price of tether is: why would backing tether by dollars keep the price fixed at 1$ to begin with?  The demand for tether is obviously going to fluctuate with the price of Bitcoin so in order to keep it stable one must manipulate the supply of tether.  Of course he who yeilds that power over supply may get to manipulate the market.  For this reason I really think there should be no stable coins.  Tethering to fiat seems like a recipe for holding back crypto itself.  
But what do I know I'm just talking out my ass here.

Well Gmail is already anoynmousz they don't require you give them your real name. If you want less tracking coming after you though you could use a provider hosted in Switzerland or some other country with stronger privacy laws (e.g. protonmail).  Of course you can still be tracked, maybe what you're looking for is a tor hidden service email, since if you want any real anonymity you're going to have to use tor anyways.  
However if you're just looking to make purchases on a darknet market you don't need an email.  Just learn to use tor and PGP, research good vpns that don't appear to keep logs (don't just believe them when they say they don't keep logs), and make a tails boot sitck or learn to use some other privacy OS that you can run in a virtual environment.
