Gold is scarce but metal isn't.

I am not aware of any upcoming fork (last ones were Bitcoin Gold in October and the canceled Segwit2x fork from November), but I am still pretty much a newb myself and might have missed something.
Generally it is recommended to move your coins offline, as exchanges can be hacked and you do not own the private keys. 
You can do that by using paper wallets or by getting a Hardware Wallet (Trezor or Ledger Nano S) to send them to.

When did you buy your BTC? 
Ledger should give you an Option to select between Bcash and Bitcoin (Legacy or Segwit). If you bought before the August fork, Bcash Balance should appear.
BGold (October fork) can be split using the instructions provided by Ledger:

Does Coinbase/Gdax already support turning BCH-&gt;BTC? (Don’t have an account there so I can’t check for myself) 
I’m puzzled that BCH still keeps holding its value...

Bitcoin movement today shows how irrelevant temporary sell walls are (considering how much time some people spent last night looking at a wall at 17250). New walls can come up quickly and create downward pressure again.

Yes. Use Segwit and familiarize yourself with the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:19:21
I would like to transfer my BTC to the Segwit address. 
Do I have to do that with all BTC at once or could I hold BTC in both Legacy and respective Segwit address?
Also: does my current 24-word seed still work to restore the coins on a new Ledger Nano S after transferring to Segwit?
Any other advice for this, or any risks?

What is the current view on the massive energy consumption for Bitcoin? To me it does not look sustainable to use this much power for running the network.
Is this acknowledged as a problem or is there any outlook that makes it less of a problem?

You can compare your receiving address with a mail address. Just because people know it they can’t access your mails.

The same way people are convinced a 12,5 bar of gold is worth &gt;$400000 today.
And: you do not have to buy one full bitcoin.

Bought at $4000 and it dipped to $3000 in the next hours.
4 months later this is where I am now. Trying to put things into perspective.

Love it that Germany taxes gains on Bitcoin only if sold within the first year (no taxes after 12 months hodling). 
Forces me into the long game and keeps me much more relaxed during these dips/crashes.
There would have been no way for me to time this so that I would still make gains after taxes.

What in your opinion is the best Andreas Antonopoulos talk to inspire newcomers about the revolutionary force behind Bitcoin?
I was watching the Canadian Senate hearing that got me really pumped about Bitcoin, but it's a bit long with roughly 2 hours runtime.

I used a paper wallet before importing the seed to my Ledger. The paper wallet still exists (in a fire-proof safe).
Two questions: 
1. why would I need to wipe the device and restore if the first import worked? There should not be any different results, right?
2. How can I add a passphrase on top of the seed now? (besides the PIN to access the Ledger)
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:06:26
Neither.

Just 4 months ago I was in your position at $4000. I made the decision to go in and didn't even "time the next dip". I was convinced that I was already pretty late to the Party and $4000 seemed outrageously high at that time. Media was reporting about "the bubble" as much as today. There were regular articles about "the incoming crash" as today. Anyway, I was convinced that the marketcap is still small given its potential. And that's still the case today. 
You are early. Don't be afraid of some dips that will inevitably happen (one day after I bought in, it dipped to below $3000 - I wasn't happy). Don't look at the price everyday. Hodl. :)

For future forks, wait what Ledger is going to provide as instructions. 
By the way: which forks do you mean, or is it a hypothetical question? I haven't heard of any scheduled forks.

In my country I only have to pay capital gains taxes on Bitcoin if I hodl BTC for less than one year. This greatly reduces the attractivity of day trading and also lets me stay calm when Bitcoin dips as I anyway want to see where Bitcoin is once I could cash out tax-free (though I probably won‘t after I held it one year).
Germany = hodl-central.

Try the Blockfolio app. You can add our different purchases and their value at that time and it will calculate your portfolio value.

I'd be interested in that answer too. 
+ should support Segwit.

Is anyone else afraid that whales might be using the CME Futures to short Bitcoin and let it drop after mid Dec as discussed in the r/Bitcoinmarkets subreddit? 
People there seem to be quite certain that the pump from last weeks has been largely coming from whales and not been driven by new adopters.

Nice, then the target for the next bullrun is set!

After the previous ATH (~$1000 End of 2014) it took a bit more than two years until the ATH was hit again (E/2016, iirc).
If the cycle is about the same, we would hit 20k by end of this year. The current climb seems a bit premature, now there is plenty of time to climb steadily throughout the year (with some setbacks of course).
Another (obvious) point to make: the price rose by 2000% vs. the previous ATH (1k-&gt;20k). While 400k (2000% of 20k) would be a real moonshot (basically overtaking the market cap of Gold), I don’t think that 30-50% of that is unrealistic for the next cycle.
(Hope my calculations aren’t off. :D).
