I use the piper... piperwallet.com easiest cold storage.. I have a mac pro so it is easy to remove hard drives, but piper is the easiest. I think you'd like the piper for ease of use and convienency.

Not too much of a background creating something of this sort. I like the open ATM, but I want something with a user interface.

I would write up a paper about how Bitcoin is better than dollars and make it seem really smart...

Hey Andreas,
Minining btc or buying btc, what's better?

Google "project sky hook" they have a neat little ATM for $1000 probably the cheapest you can get.

Haha removed, thanks.
The paper was already submitted. I am 14 and in 8th grade.

Just ordered one myself! Super excited to get it!

Good luck Bruno, you can come down and take cover in stl if you need to! 
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:35:27
Thanks, this is closer to what im looking for, but the price really isn't that different than a SkyHook which kind of defeats the purpose.

Right, but this isn't what I was asking. I was wondering if I could accept credit card as a merchant and have it automatically transfer to Bitcoin and deliver to me as Bitcoin.

How? I haven't seen how to do this on Bitstamp. I've seen no mention of it.
