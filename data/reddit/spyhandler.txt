I would be strictly looking at Bitcoin Price and the sentiment of Bitcoin.  
While the study can be far more bigger in reach, please having in mind I have limited times on my hand, and that I am lone researcher.  
Complicated researches are made from multiple people + their assistants.

Hey there,  
there are already studies on the topic. In order to avoid giving links, Google : Google searches Bitcoin price pdf and same keywords about twitter.  
Sentiment has not been tested as of now.

I was thinking to use BLX index, since it has a grip of all exchanges + their liquidity.

I focus on the media part more, and its effect on Bitcoin. Blockchain is not that important in the case per se.

I see what you mean, good point. The thing is that texts need to be longer for the software to give a better, more accurate results.  
Also, words are with predefined meaning / sentiment, i.e. it is not developed to the level where it can define that "I am mad about you" = positive, "I am mad at you" = negative. Mad is predefined as negative.  
Longer texts usually neutralize such small confusions.

There is a very clear distinction between money and currency. Relying on investopedia / wikipedia is a bad idea.  
I would recommend looking for "From Chengdu to Stockholm: A Comparative Study of the Emergence of Paper Money in East and West." if you can find it.  
The 9 year old is well set, if he only knew...
Meanwhile currency / money:

Nothing better than insightful, credible academic works :)

If not mistaken, it is called payment system in the bitcoin whitepaper itself.

Hey, do not kill the messenger. I just found it useful. Actually I am planning to give it to my 9 years old nephew and see how it goes. I agree the intro is a bit long, but then I agree with all three points. I guess there is no perfect way to go at it.

I found it weird too, but then I guess online is more common word than electronic?

I am thinking about what you said that people have been using "digital fiat currency". I do not fully agree. I mean, society is switching to being cashless, but the money is digital, just because technology allows it. The currency itself is not digital. There is difference when it comes to money and currency. When you do a bank transfer you the other person gets digital money, and by withdrawing on ATM it gets physical. The currency stays fiat.

I agree on that!
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:35:43
You see, that is it. We are holding digital representation of fiat currency. Bitcoin is digital currency. I agree digital money would be easier to understand, but there is subtle, or not so subtle difference between currency and money.

Will they be having another round of funsing other than this 1M already given?
