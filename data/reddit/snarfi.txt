Ehm no? Tezos Foundation for example has fucked uf to make a KYC and now the swiss banks hesistate to take fiat converted from ICO funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:51:34
thanks for that. i just simplified it, because for foreigners its hard to understand what a "bundesrat" is. hes one of 7 leaders of switzerland in your mentioned departement.

Thanks man.

So many plebs I know from work and such begin to buy again and question me about blockchain? Is this hapoening on your side too? Havent heard much from them the last 2yrs.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:05:54
they do that with Euro to ensure that Swiss Francs are stable compared to euro. maybe one day... 
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:38:39
Thanks for this. So the big traffic on the network 2017: Was that coming from people transfering coins to/off exchanges and between people or is the most traffic coning from inner-exchane trades? Like, im not sure how this exactly works but i think every buy and sell on exchanges is a transaction on the blockchain right (Or os that only on DEX?) ? Its not like, they do just update the numbers in your hotwallet and when you withdraw off the exchange its getting payed out(sent) by a main wallet of the exchange? Sorry if my english isn't understandable enough.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:17:05
Thats worth it.

Will Bitcoin handle the huge amount of tx nextbullrun?
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:41:45
What about this comment or my account is trolling? Enlighten me.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:49:29
Okay, first time i heard about that. But anyway, my question is valid isn't it? I remember 2017 when many transactions getting stuck.
Isn't it the best way to answer such a question with knowledge than calling it trolling?
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:54:34
Ehm sorry but why is someone retarded just because late to the party? The party has just begun.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:07:07
Im not a noob per se. Ive interested in Bitcoin aince 2013. Just haven't read much the past two years. So yeah, im activated again. So since you're this informed, might share your knowledge about the tx/s problem and when the market explodes like 2017?
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:54:33
And the blocksize part?
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:31:08

I don't like that corporations gettin their own money. When we can't trust goverments, who trusts multicorporate enterprises?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:44:03
And why do they receive the fees already? Isnt it profitable enough?
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:51:54
So nice to see that people share. Thank you for everything. Good Karma! 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:19:02
Are exchanges allowed to trade on their own platform? Havent they a massive advantage doing so? They know how many users registering or in process, they now then fiat is transferred, they know about hidde orders in book and so on....

Ah okay, i always thought its possible to see the whole orderbook somewhere and based on that you could see what people are willing to pay or something like that.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:38:08
might have a look at tezos. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:32:55
Always though it would be interesting to know how many BTC are needed to push the price to zero in a split second. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:01:19
how can you now that? serious question, where can you see "support"? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:13:47
You mean OVER 9000 !!!!!!!!

They can buy the bitcoin and sell higher to the poor.

@_date: 2018-03-14 21:24:41
but in th early days when 1000 computers challenged each other, is different then now when dozens of thousands people would try to mine independent again, no? what if mining pools are getting targeted in general?
is it still profitable with so many competitors, assumed everyone mine completly independent on their office computer? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:31:28

@_date: 2018-02-23 10:19:03
In what timeframe can we expect Bitcoins second layer smartcontracts? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:20:46
How much fees you pay to buy/sell? mostly its such a rip off that most people wouldn't buy anyway :(
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:02:47
my guess ia because we "lost  many Q4 investors of last year. they hopped on the train, sold or hodl in january and don't look at the charts anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:40:39
no offence, but i can imagine what your average customer is like. Shady people with a lot of fiat no bank will accept.  
Generally, dealers are not tech savy, have a lot of physical fiat, are willing to buy overpriced Cryptocurrencies, to get rid of physical fiat. But seriously, 20%?!
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:57:40
juat don't sell so you dont have to pray it does go down again. hodl is still the best strategy. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:07:03
Lets only read good news and chill. Swiss + russia news &gt; china news.

@_date: 2018-03-11 07:56:57
no its not. it scare all the people away. normal people like your friends, family and people you work with. thoae are the people who must adopt the tech to succeed.

While its true that its not all news, I also want to point out that its not the worlds end if some countrys speaking against crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:11:19
why so mad? sold at 7k huh? sellers are cancer because they try to influence othera to do the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:42:35
so basicly you're saying they are smarter than their audience. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:27:52
yeah got it after reading it again. but its ment hypothetically anyway. you don't need bitcoin anymore to make a good Blockchain with a useful coin.
Not saying Bitcoin is obsolete but referring to "every other coin is a shitcoin".

Dont really know, but the feature to buy BTC is provided from another company, not the swiss railway itself. Its just their hardware.

Not unaffected by the traded price but unaffected by returning money they raised though an ICO. Have not researched it but this is what he ment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:43:08
Have a look at the possibilitys of the blockchain and the amount of start ups creating applications. Its just amazing how this will impact our economy we know today. 
Its not only about bitcoin, but ethereum/NEO and others.

- Can pay govement taxes in chiasso with BTC in the beginning of 2018
- digital identity with ethereum blockchain in the City Zug
- Bundesrat said 2014 bitcoin is legal and there are some regulations and taxing
- Very crypto friendly, crypto start up hubs with high qualified advisors
- you can get bitcoin on official Swiss railway ticketmachines
- so on

But he is right in general. Bitcoin is not ment to place it on a bank.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:06:22
The greed some people have, destroyed our current economy and will also hurt cryptocurrencies. Fuck all people who want to get rich fast and brag with over expensive cars.

New Firefox is *really* fast. I use Brave because i like their principals on privacy and because its also very fast. sadly some scripts doesn't get executed correctly, so some drop downs malfunction etc. but overall suprisingly good!

Yes the fees are really high. Dont remember exactly, thought it was 6%.

2008, no bitcoin no blockchain. 2018 no bitcoin  still blockchain.
im not hating against bitcoin at all. just saying that just because things evolve differently, it doesn't mean its all shit. Also because it has sometimes different usecases. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:37:29
All those salty people who try to fear because they sold. thats fucking cancer. late 2017 investors have sold or just doesn't care anymore. thats why the volume is so low and now easier to manipulate. downvote everyone who fud guys. they don't do it because they care about you or your money, but because of their own greed. they also dont care about blockchain and what itcan do for the world. just money. fucktards. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:39:38
If someone is ceptic on Bitcoin, ask them: 
What  do you think is the Chance that Bitcoin is still a thing in 2020? 
Next Question: How high is the chance to win in Lottery?
Why don't you buy then? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:04:47
If they ban non decentralised exchanges, they force the chineese to use bitcoin as its ment to use. Peer to peer and not through a bank (exchange).
@_date: 2018-04-12 09:24:04
why? think it would be interesting too. I think its less than 10%.

If you created your paper wallet safe. Still looking for the absolute solution. Maybe im buying a cheap laptop, set up linux and crate the paperwallet offline. Would be great if someone could write a nice tutorial for that.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:08:06
Im thinking about to just make a paper wallet. I've created one and put 1 LTC in it. If it's still there in a few weeks, I send my stash over there. Maybe make better more than one paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:14:14
For example if I have 1 BTC and want to buy a cup of coffee, i would like to have 1 BTC after and not less. So i dont want to go home and buy them egain on an exchange. If the app/wallet automaticly compensate that with a autobuy order, i dont have to care about that.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:28:59
So how to claim them back? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:29:59
You can still trade them to other coins, but not withdraw.
