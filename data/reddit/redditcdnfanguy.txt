More hype to push us towards a panopticon ecash society.

Nope, he paid it himself and the annoying bit is I  was in the shop earlier and completely missed the sign!

He twigged to it the second I explained it to him.
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:17:04
Good luck to the Fed - in bitcoin they should be seeing their doom.
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:22:33
Here he is in all his [post haircut splendor]( - sorry girls, he's taken... :-)

I'm trying to avoid that sort of thing. JD was excellent for that - there was the occasional losing day but nominally it was up on a regular basis.
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:45:29
The Fed is the ultimate scam. Hello, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:53:32
All this and the place was absolutely straight up. Now you see why I miss JD.

The Internet is awesome because it was designed with no input from suits, lawyers and vice presidents in charge of things.
I am extremely concerned that they won't let it slip through their hands a second time.

True, but Buffet stays away from damn near evrything.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:33:30
Me too - I hope it goes to a nickle each so I can get in on the starting days I missed.
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:19:31
I'm fascinated to hear what the delay has been, NSA threats, maybe?

The crypto currency the banks will bring in will be able to track every penny. No privacy AT ALL. You'll be watched by an ever-improving AI all the time.
They'll tax it, make sure it's for nothing they don't like and freeze your personal account with a mouse click whenever they want  to.
@_date: 2010-12-10 04:31:21
correct - since I think it'd be about 200 days just to have a 50% chance of hitting a block even at 800 k hashes / second
@_date: 2010-12-13 23:13:39
No, I still know it's the future but I did give up on generating my own block and joined a pool - I made .35 BC the other day.

Why did I read this in Mr. Burns voice?

The current miner pool 91.121.29.91 has been down for DAYS. Anyone got another one that is UP?
@_date: 2010-11-28 01:08:52
This is not how it works. BC works because it is a CONSTRAINED currency, that is, the govt. cannot reach up it's ass and pull a trillion of them out, like they did the late lamented US dollar.
@_date: 2012-01-11 03:31:06
I used the Mad Hatter back before the crash - never a problem.
@_date: 2012-06-27 09:37:55
Nice to see someone playing BTC poker. I visited all those sites and they always seemed empty to me.
@_date: 2012-11-29 23:28:05
Give it time. The supply just halved and the demand goes up every day.
It HAS to rise.
@_date: 2012-10-26 02:45:57
This had to happen - you can't have everyone downloading the entire economy onto their laptops.
What's the data rate of Mastercard? A gig a second? If BTC takes over, that's us! We can't handle that!
@_date: 2012-06-27 09:39:33
I have one too. I have it on a hat and hope people will recognize it. No one has yet.
@_date: 2012-11-25 19:15:09
The Multicoin people have turned starting your own crypto currency from really difficult into just difficult.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:46:27
SWEEEEETT!!!! I mean, good job lads!
@_date: 2012-10-13 01:06:29
Ok - demand is going way up, supply will halve....
@_date: 2012-07-31 01:06:21
Mistyping an address and having it accepted by bitcoin is effectively impossible.
@_date: 2012-01-29 01:06:04
Haven't we seen this movie before? Personally I hope it drops to a nickel each, I'm still pissed I didn't buy it back then.
Also, keep in mind that in 2013 the yield per block will drop to 25. Panic buying will happen then.
@_date: 2012-12-17 04:59:31
It'll drop because the reward halved - then the price will go up and it'll start to rise again.
@_date: 2012-10-12 02:18:40
Would that be about November 30 ?
According to my calculations, it will be at 5:12 am EST
@_date: 2012-01-29 00:51:25
They'll have a bit of a job finding them on the TOR network.

If Ahmadinejad went on TV today and said 'Fuck you, we're moving to Bitcoin', all Hell would be out for noon.
Money from a major oil power would come rolling in. Everybody would have to get on the band waggon. It would be like pouring the ocean into a bucket.
BTC would be $100,000 each by next Tuesday. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:48:06
if 'like the silk road' you mean selling dope, then yes.
BUT OB has a LOT of legal uses - just see what's available right now!
@_date: 2012-12-24 18:36:27
Ok, I didn't know that. I did my due diligence (googled mybitcoin and madhatter) and people think nanimogold and The Madhatter are the same person. 
I say: unlikely. I have dealt with them both and NG is a short tempered jerk and the Madhatter was a always a decent fellow.
Again, I have repeated example of me sending cash in the mail to him and never a problem. 
Doesn't seem like a crook to me.
@_date: 2012-06-16 14:25:53
Which is ironic since the btc script is deliberately not Turing complete....
@_date: 2012-12-23 23:08:32
It's too bad the Mad Hatter in Edmonton disappeared. I sent cash to him three times and he never screwed me once.

Never happen. The Fed and the world's best people who run it will never tolerate competition.
@_date: 2011-04-27 00:42:33
If they do then the difficulty will come down so more individuals can mine. In other words, it won't work.
Also - how does pulling BTC out of the ether launder money?
@_date: 2011-03-02 04:12:37
Not quite - the supply of gold is still growing, it's still being mined. Bitcoins will basically stop.
@_date: 2011-04-13 18:34:45
No, on the contrary, BTC or a fork of it, will take over from the dollar and the damned Fed.
@_date: 2011-09-30 18:37:03
Because it still pays better.
@_date: 2011-02-23 06:43:27
yes - it's the proof of concept for digital currency.
@_date: 2011-09-18 20:29:48
There's nothing wrong with the Bitcoin system itself, its the sleezy people and dodgy websites around it that cause all this trouble.
@_date: 2011-05-10 06:10:26
You are exactly right. Fixed.
@_date: 2011-07-31 19:11:07
Creating a new genesis block is actually quite the technical challenge...
@_date: 2011-01-06 07:17:53
No. It is the fact that BC are CONSTRAINED is the thing that makes them valuable.
@_date: 2011-09-15 00:39:10
if you're in Canada, send cash to the mad hatter in edmonton. Seriously. I've done about $400, no trouble.
@_date: 2011-04-20 03:02:10
You will never get a single coin. 
The difficulty is right now is 82,347 which is to say you are tossing 48.3294284713473 coins until they all land heads. The average time to do that at about 1 million hashes (tosses) per second (on an average laptop) is 12 years and 2 months. This for a block that will very very likely take ten minutes for someone else to generate. That's what the difficulty is calculated to do. 
Join a pool.
@_date: 2011-05-22 20:55:55
Markets vary. Also, BTC prices went up parabolicly and they tend to come down again that way.
Not to worry, it'll resume a nice upward trend real soon now.
@_date: 2011-03-16 02:56:16
I'm a miner and I bought some L$ on second life with them.
Otherwise, I think they an incredible investment - especially after block 210,000 when you start to get only 25 BC per block instead of 50...

Thanks to Keynesianism, economists can now reluctantly take power over zillions of dollars and still not be Marxists.

Don't care about them. If the project is technically sound, they'll show up eventually.
@_date: 2011-04-20 03:05:15
Time magazine article - but wait until about two years from now when it hits block 210,000 and all the blocks start turning out 25 BTC instead of 50. Panic buying.
@_date: 2011-03-10 03:20:27
Scam. Bitcoin hasn't been forked properly yet.

@_date: 2011-08-07 01:39:06
Not yet. I hope it hits 5 cents, personally. Then i buy.
@_date: 2011-03-30 02:49:13
No. On the contrary, they will go up even further than before. The reason is they are constrained, that is, the government can't pull a trillion of them out of it's ass and give them to the pigs on Wall St.
@_date: 2011-04-30 00:45:17
Someone has taken the code and modified to do another, different bitcoin-style currency.
Bound to happen.

Tell him it's the first currency in the history of the world that cannot be debased by it's issuer (or anyone).
If he studies economic history, and he does if he's good, he will know that that is a game changer.

I meant the rate of supply.
@_date: 2013-01-22 10:21:56
Bound to happen. Supply halved and the demand goes up every day.
@_date: 2013-02-14 02:52:25
Yes they are. It is the first currency EVER that cannot be debased by the govt.
Also, a Bitcoin style currency that is distributed to everyone is how we can handle the day in about 15 years when no one can get work without elite skills as robots will do EVERYTHING.
