I'm sorry that the vast majority of commenters here are idiots. Hopefully they didn't infect you too badly with their brain diseases.
A ponzi scheme, according to wikipedia:


Treasuries are loans to the US government, not investments. Further, the interest on loans is paid out by a pool of revenue, money printed, and other loans, not just treasury loans themselves.
Currently the interest rate on 5-year treasury bonds is 1.66, which is less than the rate of inflation. What that means is everyone who buys these treasuries right now is actually paying the US government for them to loan money to it. Crazy huh? The government _makes_ money on taking out this debt. The long-term average of inflation is actually higher than the 1.9% it is now, so in the long term the government actually makes money on most if not all the treasuries it sells.
Hyperinflation has happened in places like Zimbabwe, but we haven't seen it in America (the worst it got for a 10-year average was ~9% from 1910-1920, a far cry from the 44,850,000,000,000,000,000,000% for Zimbabwe's worst decade). The deficit hawks are constantly bemoaning the oncoming onslaught of hyperinflation due to QE here, but it never seems to happen. (Hint: it's not going to).
The U.S. debt will likely never be completely paid off, nor will the national debt of most countries, but that's not an especially big problem, as long as the interest payments are manageable. Debt for countries works very differently from household debt - the majority of our debt we owe to ourselves, to programs like Social Security (which is the biggest single holder of US debt).
Additionally, fear-mongering by most debt hawks would have you believe your children will be enslaved by this debt, but the fact is the debt is being paid now. It doesn't have a dramatic effect on the lives of citizens because it's worked in to the government's budget. 
What has a far more direct effect is actually the lack of spending that's happening right now while we're in recovery - we're basically in austerity mode, which is a far bigger threat to us than the debt has ever been. (By austerity I mean reduced spending, which comes directly out of the GDP, the growth of which is the metric for whether we're in a recession or not). That's another discussion but we can pursue it if you like. 
If you take one point away from reading my comment it should be this: don't take economic advice from people in r/bitcoin. It's idiots all the way down in here. Read some of Paul Krugman's blogs on debt, austerity, even bitcoin, to get some legitimate perspective.

Now, what I said was the money _from_ new investors goes to the early adopters. I.e. new investors buy bitcoins with fiat and the people with hordes of bitcoins get the fiat.

@_date: 2014-06-06 05:00:09
The recent rise does not directly reflect the idea that recent good news has spurred increased adoption. Indirectly, it does:
If you look at how the price has been climbing, it's been mostly in big, short bursts, which level off until the next big, short burst, instead of a gradual and continuous increase resulting from many buyers purchasing small amounts.
What we are seeing is increasing activity from the big players. For whatever reasons (likely taking recent good news into consideration, elapsed time since the last big bust), they have chosen this time to start pumping the market. We also see sudden drops, reflecting these same large players selling what is likely those same bitcoins, only to immediately buy again once the price has fallen.
What this means looking forward is if the whales can successfully harness positive sentiment we should continue to see sudden jumps and falls in price, on average moving up, until one of the falls causes the next widespread panic and we get a massive crash.
If, on the whole, new investors continue to move in, the bottom of the next crash will level off at a higher level than the previous one.
This pattern will continue, the price heading ever closer toward the moon, with the biggest players taking the vast majority of the gains. 
That is, until the new investors run out, and we reach the point when everyone in the world has either invested in bitcoin or will never invest in bitcoin.
Once that happens the whales will exit for the last time. That is how bitcoin will die.

This is sensationalist nonsense. Dramatic graphics / music, fear mongering, the works. He doesn't even get the terms right - the U.S. dollar is in fact money, because it is in fact a stable store of value. Stable doesn't mean unchanging - it means it changes at a predictable rate. 
He also cites the constitution incorrectly - it doesn't say that the states can only pay their debt in gold and silver, it says they cannot make a tender of anything except gold and silver - meaning states themselves are barred from issuing their own currencies.
As far as the mechanics of creating money he is largely correct (though he peppers his explanation with libertarian dog whistles), but he conveniently leaves out the fact that the government has control over the money supply - and that the fed will aim to keep inflation between 2-4% by using these controls. This is why we don't get the doomsday collapse scenario he and other deficit hawks like to rant about.
He also throws around pejoratives like "fraud" and "scam" yet fails to describe why he things the modern banking system fits this description. We do create money out of thin air. There's really no other way to create money. Historically we've used things like gold as money, which presents a huge problem: since you can't create gold (and easy sources of gold are mined out), you can't increase or decrease the money supply. With a fixed money supply and a growing money supply, you get deflation, which is hugely problematic (  ). Bitcoin has a likewise inelastic money supply.
We finally got off the gold standard completely in the 1970s, and no modern country would throw its economy away by returning to a fixed-supply monetary base. It is for this reason bitcoin is a terrible candidate for a currency, and this fundamental flaw is one of many things that is guaranteed to keep it from becoming what bitcoiners want it to be.

Even if everyone used bitcoin there's no reason to believe it would ever stabilize. The price of gold has always been volatile, even when the world was on the gold standard.

Gold certainly failed. It got us through to the point where markets started becoming globalized, but that's where it failed. The inability to expand or contact the supply of money along with the economy became untenable (see: the great depression) and we had to unhook the dollar from the price of gold to get around this. It didn't start in the 1970s - we began devaluing our currency in the 1930s. Read more:

We armchair economists say things like "bitcoin is deflationary" because we understand why deflationary currencies are so problematic. 
Basically, if you don't have an answer to each of the 3 big reasons deflation is toxic that Krugman lays out (which, since we began devaluing our currency in the 1930s, has been conventional wisdom), you haven't a leg to stand on:
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:08:30


That may be what you believe, but that's wrong. "I" have authority to force compliance with the laws here, and "I" will enforce that on you.
If everyone followed only the laws they liked that would be the same as having no laws anywhere. You have the freedom to leave and to renounce citizenship, the US will not pursue you. But by staying here and/or keeping your citizenship, you are consenting you be governed by the law of the land. That's how it is everywhere.


You mean like creating the internet or funding space travel or research or distributing vaccines? Show me one society that has a good plumbing system not built through a governing body.


If you actually believed that you would have left already. The fact is you greatly benefit from the infrastructure it provides, and would fare rather poorly without it. There's no libertarian society in existence that is by any measure of success, and that's not because  "the statists" have prevented it from happening anywhere, it's because libertarian philosophy is incompatible with the creation of a functioning society.

@_date: 2014-04-17 16:38:25
On the contrary - as a monetary instrument, bitcoin is more of a fossil than a cutting-edge tool. We figured out that deflationary currencies (i.e. gold) are toxic for economies in the 1930s when we were trying to escape the deflationary spiral called the Great Depression. We began devaluing our currency then and "officially" left the gold standard in the 1970s (though devaluing our currency at all is a de facto departure from the gold standard, so the 1930s is really when it started).

The utility of a thing for a purpose isn't dependent on the presence of a party. Even if all the humans in the world disappeared, gold still has the capability of blocking radiation, and that is part of its intrinsic value.


You simply can't disprove something that isn't falsifiable. You need something to test, and there's nothing to test here - in the same way you can't prove music theory false, because it isn't falsifiable. 


In case you haven't noticed, dollars have been sent digitally for far longer than bitcoin has existed. I used the comparison to gold to show how awful bitcoin would be as a currency - I completely agree with you that gold is an awful currency. 
But ultimately, it really doesn't matter if you think it would be a better currency. The reality is that its way way worse. That's a simple economic fact. In the same way it wouldn't matter if you disagreed that the world is round. We can tell both from empirical observation.

Krugman actually does a pretty decent job of providing links to sources of the things he's talking about. 
But it seems like you didn't read what I said, didn't read the link I posted, didn't read the study you quoted, and didn't read the quote you copied. And looking at your upvote ratio neither did most readers here.
First, that study doesn't deal with the general effects of deflation, it just investigates if there is a link between depression, specifically, and deflation.
The worry with deflation isn't that it causes depressions, it's that it makes them _so much worse_ when deflation does coincide with depression. As in the paper says, deflation and depression were linked in the 1930s because they coincided and sent us into a deflationary spiral - meaning deflation tends to exert deflationary pressure on an economy.
To quote the Krugman article you didn't read, 


This is how depression in the 1930s turned into the Great Depression, and if we were to adopt the same monetary policy that we had at the beginning of the Great Depression now, we would surely be in another Great Depression. Even with all the QE we've had, which has been substantial, inflation was 1.5% in 2013 (it had dropped to 0.1% in 2008, when we hit the recession).
If economic growth were guaranteed to be positive, deflation wouldn't be so big of a worry. In fact, deflation will often coincide with economic growth, because an expanding economy exerts deflationary pressure on a monetary base. So in many (especially less-recent) cases where an economy experiences periods of growth, you'll also see deflation (see America in the 1800s), but even then it's highly problematic (  ).
That is to say, if an economy is growing at a faster rate than its monetary base is expanding, you will get deflation. Since deflation tends to depress spending and isn't desirable though, a government will devalue its currency enough to keep the rate of inflation just slightly positive.

No, this is always true.
If they "leave" it in the bank, the loan is *deposited* into their account. Of that deposited money, the bank can loan out only down to the reserve.

They won't diminish them, they will simply massively outweigh them. Since bitcoin is such a poor store of value, it doesn't matter how easy is it to transact because the risk in being exposed to that volatility, and difficulty in exchanging between bitcoin and other stores of value, make it not worth it for most people.


No, governments will simply continue to not accept bitcoin as legal tender, and everyday people just won't want to use it because it doesn't solve any problems for them.


Credit cards provide protection as well as credit to consumers, which people value. It's why I, and many others, prefer to use credit cards over cash. Bitcoin can't afford me that protection, and taking out loans for bitcoin is out of the question for the same reason that bitcoin is a bad currency.

People with guns telling you it has value does, in fact, make the money good. You know as long as those guns are working that the value of a dollar will be highly predictable and will be useful to pay debts in this country. 
But you're right, the guns aren't why the _inflation_ is good. The ability to do that just makes it that much better.


This is just stupidly wrong. Inflation lessens the burden of debtors (and makes it less risky to take out loans). This helps anyone with a negative net worth - and anyone who owes a debt and doesn't keep their assets in dollars. 
Further, it makes it risky to hold onto large amounts of liquid money, providing an incentive to invest it in non-liquid assets.
It also avoids the problem of sticky wages that contribute to unemployment in a deflationary environment.
tl;dr: inflation is good because it avoids the 3 big problems of deflation: hoarding/disincentivizing loans, worsening the burden of debtors, and the "sticky wages" problem. The guns are just the icing on the cake.

You sort of immediately fall apart when you mischaracterize what a ponzi scheme is. It involves paying out early adopters with money from new investors, which is actually what's happening with bitcoin.
Like other ponzi schemes, assuming nothing catastrophic like  51% attack or worldwide government clampdown on bitcoin occurs, bitcoin will collapse once the supply of new investors runs out. This will happen once everyone is either invested in bitcoin or will never invest in bitcoin. 
So, like other ponzi schemes, the trick is to get out just before the collapse.

You pretty much couldn't come up with a heuristic for measuring money velocity that couldn't be tricked by creating bogus wallets and sending money in between them or by hoarding, that's the problem. We don't even know who has what money because individual people don't have to reveal themselves for auditing to a central authority, so you can't actually get a true measure of money velocity.


This statement suggests you don't understand what printing money actually is. All money is created as debt, the the fed doesn't just hand the money out to bankers and say have fun. The money is either loaned out at a (low) rate or it's used to buy securities from commercial banks to provide liquidity. The fed actually turns a profit and returns this money to the treasury.
In the case of bitcoin miners it would literally just be free money to those at the top. 


I'm aware this is sarcasm, but the bare words are spot on. By keeping the money supply low they would keep the free money flowing in from this central computational source that just looks at money velocity. There's no reason not to just sit on their cash because it's a risk-free return on their investment.
And on the other hand maybe you just have someone with a giant amount of bitcoin that keeps it swirling around a few wallets to keep the velocity artificially high to keep deflation high. One of these two sides win out and the economy loses.


Fixed money supply currencies are the joke - and what's even worse is most of the community has this hard-on for deflation, so even if we pretend there were some magical heuristics that could figure out the money supply needs of a base that it can't audit, there's no way it would be adopted.
I'm not saying it's impossible to come up with an algorithm to determine optimal expansion/contraction for a money supply, I'm just saying it's impossible with the blockchain.
The real way to fix bitcoin is to throw it away, and do something completely different. Or just use the system we have that actually works.

For something to be used as a medium of exchange it needs another party; that is not something intrinsic to any object. 
You're pretty much sticking your head in the ground at this point. You can't really disagree with a definition, definitions aren't opinions, neither are they falsifiable. Defined terms are simply shorthand for more complex ideas. We just use the term "intrinsic value" to convey the idea that bitcoins cannot be used for anything apart from trade, i.e. on their own they are useless, much like fiat. The difference is there's no government backing bitcoin, so it is worse than gold as a currency.

The point you raise is a very valid reason to be laughing at bitcoin.
These companies used the technologies of the time to meet their needs, but bitcoin as a monetary instrument is ancient. Fixed-money-supply currencies are the dinosaurs of the economic world, the last shackles of which we shed 40 years ago in favor of better economic technology.
It's a big reason why bitcoin can never be a good candidate for a currency (as in, being accepted as legal tender for debts to a government).

This article is not entirely coherent. You're getting an awful lot of stuff confused here.


"Scarcity" is brought up by skeptics, but that argument you bring up has generally been the response to the criticism that the money supply of bitcoin is inelastic. The skeptic viewpoint doesn't really care about altcoins. That'd be like saying the US dollar isn't scarce because of the existence of the Euro. Altcoins are neither a problem nor a solution to bitcoin's problems.


Trust me, the skeptics are not arguing that bitcoin is capable of this. They're just conceding that you can use bitcoin in a limited capacity for exchange. It's weird to argue against the concession of a skeptic if you're pro-bitcoin.


That’s the case for why Bitcoin is grossly undervalued.
You're conflating "undervalued" with the idea that bitcoin is insufficiently valued to be a world-class payment processor. "Undervalued" implies it's worth more than its current price. The fact that it is insufficiently valued to be such a payment processor does not imply that bitcoin, itself, is undervalued.


If it doesn't stabilize at some point, it's guaranteed that bitcoin will never reach currency status.

You need the money supply to be able to expand and contract with fluctuations in the economy, or you can get bad results like hyperinflation or deflation. High volatility. 
No blockchain has an elastic money supply, and if it did, you'd need a central authority to issue or remove money from circulation, which would be antithetical to the whole idea behind bitcoin to begin with.
The only possible out would be to use some of that wasted processing power to determine how much to increase or reduce the block reward by. But even that would create liquidity traps, as all the extra money goes to mining pools who could just hoard the money meant to produce inflationary pressure.
It's a problem that blockchain currencies can't actually solve without becoming centrally issued. This is the _fundamental flaw_ with these currencies. The insurmountable roadblock for bitcoin is bitcoin itself.

Hey asshole, you clearly misunderstand the spirit of the system. Bitcoin is still a paradise for non-agression for a very specific reason, and that is because it equalizes all players on the field.
With a decentralized system like this, the _real_ libertarians can make use of our greatest credo - _caveat emptor_ - that anyone too stupid to not get scammed is rightfully separated from their money of their own volition. The free market lets people get scammed, so scamming people is therefore _good_, and therefore scamming is _good for bitcoin_ and bitcoin is _good for free markets_.
All the exchanges that close and internet institutions that appear, take everyone's money, then leave, _they_ know what bitcoin is all about, unlike idiots like you who want to pretend the uglier side of libertarianism doesn't exist.

USD is very well-managed; it's one of the most stable stores of value (if not _the_ most) that exists today. Yes, you can point to individual implementations of fiat currency that did not go well, but when done well fiat really shines in comparison to gold (or bitcoin). When you look at the world as a whole, fiat has replaced fixed-supply currencies almost entirely. As you mention, only when a fiat currency completely falls apart is it possible for a fixed-supply currency to take its place. Fiat is seriously that much stronger than fixed-supply.

Bitcoin is a solution to problems most people don't have. Doesn't leave much for a Musk-like character to work with.

Or you could just buy more bitcoin than you could ever hope to mine with the money put into the electricity/hardware, and perform all those other functions on the computer you already have. 
The machine is a money loser by design.

The amount of btc you could buy with the money instead is greater than the btc you could ever net by buying a chip and powering it yourself. Even an automated recurring buy would be better. There's literally no advantage to trying to micro-mine it.

Only if you horde all your assets in cash for literally years, which nobody does. People's assets are largely houses and 401(k), if any, not huge bank accounts.

You can steal literally any product. What's wrong with you?
@_date: 2015-10-15 01:08:30
That's not what I said, or even implied. The premise is that these machines will never produce enough btc to cover the hardware and electricity costs incurred by mining - regardless of price fluctuations and mining fee increases in the meantime.
If there was a reasonable chance they would, the company would just mine with them instead of selling them to you.

That's right, buy a bitcoin.
Don't buy any video games, don't "invest" (_gag_) in a girl that might not be "yours" in a few years, don't take vacations, don't buy books, don't invest in indexes. You don't need any of those things.
 
Buy a bitcoin and stare at your paper wallet in a cave for the rest of your life. Bitcoin.

I said black market purposes, like selling drugs or weapons. It is not illegal to trade in baby clothes. They will not convict anyone for selling baby clothes. What are you thinking.


Yeah, or the encrypted peer-to-peer connection you have is with the feds themselves.


No, the problem silkroad is that they thought they could outsmart the resources that the federal government has at its disposal, and people using openbazaar will have that same problem.
Big players doing this in the states will get caught. Tor will not save you. Encrypted connections will not save you. Openbazaar will not keep you out of prison.

Yes, society.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:31:33
Lol if you think that's the case you haven't been paying attention. They'll just bring charges against people who use this software for black market purposes. They caught Ulbricht despite TOR and whatever other useless measures he thought would keep him safe. How will openbazaar users fare any better?

That clock broke five years ago. One day you'll be right. Stay broken, my friends.
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:38:46
Don't do it convince me, do it to convince other people reading here. You've basically just said "You're just blind to the value of bitcoin, so I'm not even going to tell you what it is!"
From an outside perspective that makes it pretty obvious you've got nothing.
@_date: 2015-10-19 04:31:34
Think before you speak.
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:29:15
I think you don't understand what makes a good store of value. A bitcoin could be worth twice what it is today tomorrow - or half. It is difficult to predict the value of a bitcoin ahead of time and that *necessarily* makes it a poor store of value.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:25:33
Commenter doesn't understand what intrinsic value means.
@_date: 2015-10-15 06:36:04
Assuming for a minute that grandma wants btc-app capabilities, buying a mining chip that costs electricity to run is less efficient and more complex than buying a computer that just comes with keys to a preloaded btc wallet. Any way you slice it, this is an idea that never should have left the drawing board.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:33:58
What, you think saying "its decentralized!" will persuade a jury to acquit? Or discourage the feds from throwing people in prison?
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:09:39
Mixers exist to launder this kind of money, that's the point.
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:12:39
"secured with math" is a pretty dumb catchphrase to advertise bitcoin with. All encrypted traffic is "secured with math" and has been long before bitcoin came about.
