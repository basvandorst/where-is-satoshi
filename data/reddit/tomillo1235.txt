No, I try to understand you. I'm not a deflactionary fan guy, I simply try to show you that people must have liberty of choosing the features of the money they want to save in.
'I'm pretty sure you'd disagree with someone earning income just for existing. I'm very sure you wouldn't call that liberty'. Yes I call it liberty (I mean a poor person alone in an island is poor and powerless but have freedom, nobody coerce him), the problem is that you mistake liberty with power. The problem is that you think getting a loan it's going to give liberty (power) a person in that situation. Saving gives liberty (power), getting loans are not going to do that.

'In a deflationary economy the vast majority of resources are idling because creditors are attempting to turn sterile money into actual wealth'. No, money is lent by an interest rate depending on the risk, but that money lent is not created of thin air, it exist previously. If your investment fails, you lose your money. That's all. If people speculate that deflactionary money is going to rise in price against inflactionary one is because they prefer the monetary characteristics of this kind of money, the opposite also occurs. It's called market. It seems bitcoiners prefer the first option, deflactionary money. They take risk and can lose o gain. Again, that's all, there is no feudalism nor coercion.

Ok, but the humanity is still waiting for a 'prudent allocator of new credit'. Even more, I don't know why  that 'prudent allocator' must inflate the monetary supply. I don't see any problem having part of my portfolio in money that cannot be debased and other part in a elastic monetary system. Prices between the two systems fluctuate and balance themselves. Saying deflation is slavery is a rather strong statement. And also, 'premium stakeholders' didn't 'took risk early', they took risks al along the period from buying to the moment they sell the bitcoins. There is a lot of resentment and envy in your statements. If you don't like bitcoin's monetary system don't buy it. Stay with the fiat system waiting for your 'prudent allocator of credit'. Some of us are fed up.

Thanks for you answer.

First, nobody force you to get a loan. Second, if you get it, you must honor it independently of the monetary system. It's your choice, it's called liberty. I don't see coercion nor feudalism in deflactionary money.

First: So, why do you want to coerce people to choose the monetary system you think is best? It's rather arrogant. I think people must choose by themselves. Second: Liberty is the absence of coercion. I think people are powerless because the lack of liberty, And that's bad. but It's not the same concept. Third: You think deflactionary money increases its value 'per se'. No, If there are better options or people think there are better option it's value will decrease. Sorry for not being able to correctly format the answers and have enough pattience with my crapy english. Thanks.

Thanks for the response, I was wondering if it is possible to execute a transaction script offline (as oppossite than Ethereum which execute the script in all the nodes) and give a proof of correct execution to release the bitcoins. You could have the benefits you have explained, because the script execution is deterministic and it's useless to execute it in all nodes.
