Oh i know he owns very little of it, he's moved on. What i mean is that if Microsoft took that course, he'd kick up a huge fuss. The work he's doing now to better humanity and the world, censoring bitcoin is the opposite of that. He wouldn't allow it to happen, i don't think.

Not quite the hashwar i was hoping for
