I mean its common when buying into bubbles they are riding that high that gets them to keep buying into said bubble.  For me mass excitement and constant amazement at how meteroic a rise something has are a big push towards either realizing some of what i have or to not buy anymore.

Gold has been a universal currency for 10s of thousands if years, is tied to multiple national currencies not to mention has many practical uses. Has nasa started using bit coin on it's spacesuits or did I miss something, or has it been a staple of personal jewelery. Size though has nothing to do with future success.

There becomes less and less probability that Bitcoin remains relevant enough for new money to buy in year by year either through a better competitor or better technology or just to out traction it and nothing actually protects the floor of bitcoins.
