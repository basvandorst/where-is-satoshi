I did some trading with just .1 BTC on Mt. Gox, just for shiggles. I lost money on every single trade.
I just decided I'm not cut out for day trading.

I really just use blockchain with watch only addresses to monitor paper wallets. There's no funds in the actual blockchain address itself.

You have to do both. When you click on "Verify a Bank Account" it should give you two options. 1) They'll charge (or deposit? I don't remember) two small &lt;$1 transactions into your account and ask for the amounts. 2) You can put in your routing number and account number then they'll ask for your online banking login credentials and you're done in around 3 mins.

Great story! Welcome to the community!
I'm really intrigued by this playing video games for a career thing. How does one start something like that?

Just tried to go to the grocery and buy some Heineken with BTC. The cashier didn't understand.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:14:54
I would think you'd have a better chance of being able to actually pay BTC for prints at an old local print shop. They're usually mom and pop places and when you use a place for years and years you build a relationship with them, making it much easier to introduce them to the idea.
Beautiful photographs BTW. Your style is very similar to my girlfriends. Great use of texture and they are very calming and soothing to look at. Good work.
Send me a PM please when you start accepting BTC for prints. I will happily buy some.

I saw Coinbase around $520 and I couldn't even buy :(
It just won't even load.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:07:40
You can do instant bank account verification on Coinbase.
I set up an account, verified a credit card and had an instant buy limit of 1 BTC/week within 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:10:47
If you make a purchase it should go through instantly then.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:28:20
Seriously? We're only about $450 away from your lowball. We've gained that much in the last week and a half.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:40:14
I didn't know that. I've been at work and haven't been able to check in since late last night.
That couldn't be the cause of the shortage yesterday though could it?

I'm in America, so I don't know about you guys. Sorry.
He specifically asked about Coinbase so that's what I went with.

Charlottean here, we have our hipster areas. I'm actually surprised at how many people I've talked to that have at least heard of Bitcoin.
Maybe not all that surprising, this being the banking capital and all.

They only have access to about 23K BTC that was in the Silk Road wallets. DPR's wallet is supposedly still secured.
I doubt they would sell them on exchanges. They would do some kind of public auction. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:50:18
I would get on that right away. I pull my funds out of exchanges as soon as I make the buy. Very risky just leaving them there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:22:06
Failing that, if you want BTC right this second you can go pay a premium at localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:28:02
You put nearly $10,000 in a mobile wallet? That's ballsy.

Pretty sure it's based on payment method. Have never used anything but coinbase in the US so I can't speak from experience.

I do hope he figures out what happened. And I do feel for his plight.
However, it was a dumb move... Sorry OP.
It's an expensive lesson to learn, so I hope he does learn from it and not make the same mistake twice.

Honestly? I didn't even bother to read the article because the site design made me nauseous.

I understand the 'it makes Bitcoin more appealing to the masses' argument. But every time I see this, I just think they're preaching to the choir.
We all (mostly) understand Bitcoin and the divisibility of it, so why keep bringing it up?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:20:02
I had an idea similar to this a while back. Unfortunately I don't have the know-how to make it happen.

No, the purpose of the economy is to most efficiently utilize resources. Machines are just more efficient than human capital at a lot of things at this time and they're rapidly improving.
And you say machine intelligence is not capable of creative thinking. At the current time, I'll give you that point. However, the point is the day is coming when that's no longer the case.
I'm not doom and gloom about it at all. It's my opinion that it will usher in a new era of prosperity and progress like we've never seen. I'm thrilled that I get to experience the next few decades to see how it plays out.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:54:30
I'm in Charlotte, and so far we just have a cleaner that takes BTC. Next time I need dry cleaning, they'll have my business.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:15:29
Coinbase has a function to send BTC through email. I've never used it so I'm not sure if they just send a link to claim the BTC and sign up for Coinbase wallet or what.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:30:29
I feel like I've seen 'it's just getting ridiculous' posts since $200.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:05:33
I just know we dropped from $900 to close to $500. I just want to buy some coins and I can't get anything to fricking come up...

It could just be some company moving funds around couldn't it?

So educate them. Don't act like a pompous prick about it.
We don't want a reputation for being asshats. That's not what Bitcoin needs.

Just looking out. I had no idea this was a thing until recently. Didn't find out the hard way thankfully.

I love the podcast and am also very interested in what they would say.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:31:54
That's noble of you to try to spread awareness of the issue. I /only/ use mobile wallets for small spending amounts, which at the moment I'm not even spending BTC. So I mainly use it for watch only addresses to monitor paper wallets.
The truth is, you only get what you put in when it comes to security. With Bitcoin the onus of security is on the user, and unfortunately, most users just don't understand what it takes. Good on you for trying to educate and tackle the issue.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:33:46
I'm still buying as the price increases. And will continue to buy if the price drops.

From the title, totally thought this was someone begging for Bittips.

I feel like this is rash. Its been said time and time again here: don't put all your eggs in one basket, diversify, don't put in more than you're willing to lose...
Unless you're okay with betting the farm and losing it, I'd steer clear of this type of thinking.
EDIT: Also I'm very bullish on Bitcoin. I think it's going to grow into something truly amazing in the future. I'm also not stupid and know things unconsidered could happen and really screw you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:17:12
That is definitely true comparing it to fiat. I was thinking more along the lines of the relative wealth comparative to other participants in the market.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:00:01
For the umpteenth time, don't bother with mining. It's too expensive and you won't see a return.
Buy and hold.

It was today when he transferred them.

I've been following him for some time and while I'm a believer in the singularity I think Kurzweil is often overly optimistic on timelines and specific developments. That's why I like his predictions so much though, it's nice to hear good things sometimes.

I don't think there is any specific period that the 'common' man as a class could buy in and be elevated as a whole. To raise a whole class like that would create what is, in the trading industry, called slippage. For every percentage of population that buys in, the price goes up. As more and more people buy in the increased price means they are able to buy less BTC with their dollars, and thus have less return as a group.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:51:32
This is a bad idea. It's called structuring and will get you in a lot of trouble. If you're going to deposit in a bank, you'll have to pay taxes.

You could use it to print out a token with a QR code on it. Not as cool as Casacious coins though.

What happens when computers have human level intelligence and are able to complete any task we do faster, better and for prolonged periods?
Human capital becomes next to worthless. This is happening in manufacturing. It will happen in every other more intellectually demanding sector eventually. And by eventually we're talking in the next twenty to thirty years.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:38:56
I also would buy one. Very cool

I just used instant buy about 20 minutes ago. Worked just fine.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:39:55
Oh I'll absolutely make it right.
I just sent them an email asking if they could just charge my account the market rate at the time of the original transfer. It was right around when we were at the $600 level.
Wouldn't want to over pay, right? ;)
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:24:20
I don't think Bitcoin Wallet let's you put a tx fee. I used it only for a couple days though before making Block chain my mobile hot wallet so I could be wrong.

Yes it is, and it's very exciting!

And that's something OP will have to explain. Receipts from his exchange should clear everything up.
He said he was wanting to make a down payment on a house with it. I don't see a way he's not going to have to report the capital gains even if he changed out with localbitcoins.

What an immature way to act.

It has more to do with money laundering than taxation. Money launderers will pay taxes on their illegitimate funds to make them *seem legitimate... It's still money laundering though.

It gives saving power back to the people. From an economic prospective, we'll see GDP skyrocket as production efficiency, due to machine intelligence, increases. And deflationary currencies purchasing power increase with GDP. This is assuming full adoption and BTC being the only currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:21:50
I withdrew .5 BTC earlier this evening during the time they were 'down'. It didn't show up in transaction history at all so I tried again.
They deposited the initial withdrawal a few hours ago and around 10:00 I had a second deposit and now they're saying my account has -.5 BTC. It was sent to cold storage so now I have to dig out my paper wallets to send it back to them.
Not exactly convenient Coinbase...
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:20:02
Also it's not 'ultrasonic' but I'm absolutely sure that can be done. Computer speakers and microphones have a wide frequency range that can hit 20kHz. This is undetectable to the human ear and could, in theory and according to this article, be used in an audio modem.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:04:06
Epic use of username.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:11:42
They use Bitstamp. Now why they've exceeded their buy limit? I don't know. I find it hard to believe that they 'ran out of bitcoins'. I have a feeling it has something to do with funding. The way I understand it, when you purchase on coinbase, they make a purchase at Bitstamp on your behalf and transfer them to you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:00
No worries man, keep doing your thing.

I was scammed by an electronic cigarette 'business.'
It was a miniscule amount of BTC which is now worth $54. I didn't do any research into the company at all. C'est la vie... I'm not too torn up about it. It was a (relatively cheap) learning experience.

The idea is that innovation and progress is correlated with exponential increases in information technologies. If you look at adoption rates of technologies we're definitely taking advantage of new technologies faster.

That is called Structuring and is punishable by fines or 5 years in prison, possibly both.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:56:50
I think the point isn't necessarily robots, but machine intelligence taking on more and more sophisticated tasks. It's very feasible and likely that in 20 years time any job today accomplished by a human could be done with better efficiency and more accuracy by machine intelligences. We're not just talking manufacturing but also legal, medical, research, information technology, the list goes on.
I'll grant you that yes, new 'jobs' will be created, but the exponentially rising abilities of machines will quickly over take any niche skills humans would still exclusively offer.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:54:47
A good friend of mine knows you and has like 15 of your Freakers. I will totally buy one with BTC, welcome to the club!!

And my point wasn't about taxes at all to be clear.
By not depositing all the money at once and 'structuring' deposits, that's an offense in and of itself without any other crime being associated with it.
