A private blockchain solves all of the external actor problems, but removes the purpose of using a blockchain at all. You could just publish a regular database.
I don't think this project is at the "tell your friends and family" stage. It needs to go through the white-paper, Bruce-Schneier-blog stage first.

So not real time.
Your website seems to be bust (you don't provide a link so I guessed  so I can't check if these have already been answered, but there are a pile of questions that go with computerised voting. How do you deal with them?
How do I verify my ballot was entered into the blockchain correctly? If I can verify it how do you handle coercion and vote buying?
Specifically with an alt-coin, is there anything that stops me repurposing my warehouse of mining hardware to 51% attack the vote?
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:53:50
Dead people voting, ballots being discarded and alterations can happen because it's a secret ballot, and it's a secret ballot so your vote can't be coerced or bought. You can't solve both of those problems at the same time.

**Use of end-to-end encryption by communication service providers only, is under threat.**
Things that are not communication service providers:
* Banks

* https
* bitcoin, neither the protocol nor your wallet
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:31:00
I can though demonstrate ownership of a bitcoin address and thus the related transactions. Doing that here compromises the secret ballot. Do you have a protocol that makes it easy for me to verify my vote in a non-provable way?
Either way, dead people voting is out of scope of this project because presumably the impersonator will have valid id for the dead person.

Ah, different definition of trusted. In security terms, a [trusted system]( is not the one that you believe is operating correctly but rather the one that ruins your shit if it does not.
I don't trust you, not because I know anything about you but because I don't depend on you. It doesn't matter how perfect your voting system is, if the resulting government is corrupt then you are humped anyway. Thus the government is a trusted system.
If course it stands to reason that once you've identified your trusted systems, you devote maximum scrutiny to them over systems you don't have to trust.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:11:17
It's a timing attack. Mixing wouldn't help because the trip from ballot to mixer is public too.
Adding a layer to prevent timing attacks is plausible, but timing attacks are subtle. You can't just slap a random delay on the vote and call the job done.
I'm unclear why this requires a blockchain. We trust the government (they could just stuff the ballot anyway) so they could just publish a regular ballot.

That would be very interesting to read.
One of the other claims I've read is that bitcoin cash is essentially an effort by bitmain to keep their asicboost advantage viable. Segwit apparently breaks that and segwit is also apparently required for LN, so if they are on record saying yes to LN if required then that does undermine the asicboost claim.
I think it may be more complicated than that but really a link to them saying that would be great.

What if I made a crypto currency backed by a real thing. The value would be stable because I could sell more units into a rising market and buy out a dropping market all at a profit Vs the underlying asset. All the benefits of the real asset plus all the benefits of crypto.
Maybe I chose dollars as my underlying. Since it's tethered to the dollar I call it usdt.
Now, how do you be sure I have the underlying asset I claim I have and it's not all a massive con?
What if your exchange says you are getting dollars but you are actually getting tethers because surely that's close enough?

You'd be looking at hedging your buy with a sale option. I don't think they exist for bitcoin yet. But the idea is you'd buy the option to sell at $3000 and if bitcoin craps its pants you'd be able to exercise it. If bitcoin goes way up then you don't exercise the option.

Block size wouldn't impact the time to mine significantly. All of the transactions form a Merkel tree and only the top of the tree, which is a constant length is included in the proof of work.

The entire purpose of the hardware wallet is to protect you from a compromised computer. If you transfer directly from the exchange to the hardware wallet you should be fine.

Personally I think using bitcoin for everyday transactions is kinda silly. It's not the fee. It's the twenty minute wait while my kitkat purchase confirms that does it.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:15
It's still in development. That's why you see everyone getting excited about individual transactions, and cross implementation trades. The protocol is defined, and anyone who's writing a wallet should be implementing it.
We'll have to wait and see how popular it is. It's not all things to all men. It's got cases where it really shines. Anywhere you need to make repeated payments would be ideal. Like if I wanted to do a big sell but A) Don't want all my coins on the exchange at once and B) don't want to be eaten alive by miner fees. I could use this to transfer small amounts over time securely.
It's got shortcomings too. It's a hassle to pay someone new and the other end has to be online during the payment. No "Hi Mom, send bitcoin" here. But there are plans to make it more flexible in future. Imagine something like a Patreon button in the browser for micropayments to access the next page of a webcomic or to access a newspaper website for a day. You are actually paying Patreon and they sort out paying the artist. We'll see how that plays out. It could really cut down on banner advertising, but probably increase the number of paywalls.
Mainstream use needs a killer application, I think. How *you* go about using it really depends on what shows up in your wallet of choice.

They don't detect the order. Front running is illegal.
Most orders can't be filled from a single offer on the market so it is filled from several open orders. When the first execution happens, that information is broadcast and the bot buys the next best order and realists it at a higher price in the hope of being included in the next execution. To pull it off your bot needs to buy and relist before the true buy performs its next execution.

The basic technical problem with bitcoin right now is you can only fit so many transactions into a block and you only get one block every ten minutes. That's why when it gets busy the fees go up. People are trying to skip the queue to get into the block faster.
The obvious solution is to make the blocks bigger, but if your plan is to make the same number of transactions as e.g. Visa, you need something like 8GB blocks, and most people don't have the capacity to download that every ten minutes.
The Lightning solution is to unload some of the work from the blockchain. Do trades off the network but settlements on it. Then I can net ten, or a hundred or a thousand trades to you into a single settlement action. Vastly increases the capacity of the system without grossly inflating the data everyone needs.
That also makes it a load easier to do things like renting an internet connection by the minute, or other kinds of transactions where either the value is very small, or simply not precisely known up front.

Your wallet's purpose is to keep track of the private keys for you. As a guide, never delete a private key or an old wallet. You shouldn't re-use addresses, but you may get transfers to old addresses so you still want to be able to access them.
When you send/spend your BTC, your wallet will work out which addresses to take it from. Lots of small amounts in lots of wallets will incur greater fees, but you can't avoid that by merging them before spending.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:12:12
Your private key is, in the end, just a number. Numbers can be written on paper. If you write your private key on a bit of paper then it becomes a paper wallet.
We typically fold them so that the receiving address is written on a QR code on the outside, to make it easy for a sender to scan it with their phone, and the private key is folded inside so it is hidden.
When you want to spend it, you open the paper so the private key is visible and scan it with your own phone which can then spend the funds. The "Hi Mom, send bitcoin" guy was essentially holding up half a paper wallet.

A future is a promise to buy in future for a price we fix now.
It is interesting because futures can be traded on regular stock exchanges so more people can get involved.
I think the effect will be less than people expect because these are settling for cash, not for actual bitcoin so there is a disconnect between these and the actual bitcoin price. But I think that means the price will go down to undo the crazy run up we saw this week.

Imagine I want to send you money for beer. I don't know if I'm having one beer or three (spoiler: It's going to be more than three).
I can broadcast a normal bitcoin payment, or I can send just you a transaction. If I want more beer then I send you a replacement transaction for the previous one + a beer and you discard the old one. You can't use both, that would be a double spend.
When I'm done, you broadcast the final transaction and all my individual beers go through as one transaction. Any undrunk bitcoin is included in the transactions I'm sending you so when you settle up you also give me my change.
The setup needs me to commit enough to cover my estimated beer. That stops me double spending halfway through. That does go on the chain so it's irrevocable. And your broadcast goes on the chain so then the coins are settled to you. An unlimited number of transactions just between me and you in between those two points.

There is a term called a short squeeze. When you short, you are borrowing from holders (for a fee, usually) and selling, with the idea you can buy back later at a lower price and repay the loan plus profit. Naked shorting is selling before you've borrowed the asset. A short squeeze is when you are forced to buy back at a higher price to repay the loan and that drives the price even higher.
If, as you are suggesting, bitfinex has sold bitcoin that they don't have then they have been effectively doing a naked short. Now that they have to make good, they might be encountering a squeeze which is forcing up the price.

I'm not sure of the exact process, I've not done it and I don't plan to. But my understanding is: Find a broker who trades on [CME]( or [CBOE]( and ask them to place a short for you. In theory your order could sit on the market, but in practice you'd probably buy someone else's long order because you are relatively small fry and the broker wants his commission right now.
There's no underlying commodity to borrow (yet) because it's a future so you wouldn't need to pay that part. Broker fees depend on the broker but are unlikely to be savage. More problematic is your broker will want you to have at least some significant cash stored with them (the initial margin) in case the future price moves against you.
However, the underlying principle of "You can't short if nobody is willing to go long" still stands.

When you want to do more than two transactions with the same person.
My example is that one day in the next few years I'm probably going to want to sell a couple of bitcoin. Exchanges make me nervous so I'll want to keep the amount of cash and coin on the exchange limited to limit my counterparty risk. If I want to do the sells in four parts: Transfer in, sell, withdraw cash, repeat. I would need to pay four transaction fees. Do the same routine on LN and I only have to pay two and it will be quicker to do.
In fact the more outrageous the fees are, the *more* likely I am to bother because it'll save me cash.

Tethers do seem to be really dodgy. I'm not sure who's accepting them for their coin and I suspect they'll be left holding the bag when the dust settles. Maybe I'm wrong.
Anyway, the market cap of bitcoin is ~$200B. All the tethers in existence are ~$1B. Numbers heavily rounded. If the arse falls out of the tether market and that value vanishes then Bitcoin will drop by 0.5%. Any random day does more than that.
The bigger risk is people panicking at poorly understood headlines and bailing out, or bitfinex which appears to be related to Tether the company getting caught up in whatever causes tether to fail and people losing their coins on that exchange.
Anyway, MtGox went kablooey back in the day and that did a lot of harm for a long time, but here we are so patience seems to pay off even if things are looking bad.

It's true that if they filled all the buy orders available they'd push the price down, maybe even for a long time, but it wouldn't break bitcoin as a technology and we would assume the price would recover (to something less than today because it's mental today).

The setup and settlement steps of a lightning network channel are the only bits that interact with the blockchain directly so those are the only parts affected by confirmation time. The transactions happen off-chain so chain rules don't apply.
Assuming everyone is relying on six confirmations (which is now an *epic* amount of processing power and arguably overspecified) it takes an hour to set up the channel. Transactions are then instant for however long you set it up for. Then an hour to settle everything and close the channel down.
e.g. I open a £200 channel for my local pub. I do this on Friday afternoon. It takes an hour and costs one transaction fee. I then buy beer and vodka at whatever it costs. Per glass. Per round. Doesn't matter. Each transaction is free and instant. Then at the end of the night I pour myself into a taxi and the pub settles the evening's binge. Takes an hour. Costs another transaction fee.

A future is a contract to buy something in the future. Imagine a farmer selling the carrots he is going to grow this year before he grows them. He trades possible maximum profit for an assured price. The purchaser of the future does the same, trading a possible minimised cost for an assured price. It helps manage their risk.
Now I have no interest in carrots, but I've looked at the long term forecast and I think the carrot crop is going to fail. I'll buy a carrot future now, and sell it before it matures. Someone else would be delighted to buy my future that means they can still get carrots at a massive discount and so will pay me a premium.
Better yet for me, is that we can arrange this up front. Call it a cash delivery future where instead of my ever getting carrots, the they can just be sold an I'll get the cash difference instead.

I reckon the basic reason a government wouldn't do it's own version of bitcoin is that it doesn't really get anything from it.  They would have no problem with making a centralised system because they consider themselves trustworthy.  They don't want to have limits on adding or removing coins.  They *definitely* don't want a public register of who's paying whom.  Can you imagine the analysis that we'd put into campaign donations?!
The other reason is they already have something similar: Credit cards.  They can mint coins at will. They can see the transaction history whenever they want.  They can freeze accounts and mandate morality.  This all being one step removed to VISA and Mastercard just means they don't have the hassle of maintaining the tech as time marches on.
All that's missing is the basic ability for anyone to accept credit card payments with the same ease as they make them.

A quick question since you brought up coloured coins.  As I understand it, I would colour e.g. 1000 satoshis and we would all trade them as 1 hour each.  If I want to pay you one hour then I'll have to include a transaction fee.  Do I pay that fee in regular bitcoin?  I'm assuming specific wallets are required that handle this gracefully.

I *know* the bitcoin I have is genuine, but it seems the only way to be sure of the gold is to be part of the Good Delivery chain, and the only way little old me can do that is to buy paper gold.

My first answer would be mining yourself, but that could be an unreasonable order.  The next best option (I think) would be buying directly from a miner so there is your transaction that comes directly from a freshly minted set of coins.
I can imagine your transaction could be tainted by fees paid for a transaction that later turns out to be illegal, but I would be hard pressed to question your integrity on that point.
I'm also not sure how you would find a miner to trade with, but I'm assuming there's more than one or two on this forum.

One minor correction:  The difficulty of getting the next batch is related to how many people are looking, not how many have already been generated.
The difficulty is set to try and produce a block every ten minutes and is re-evaluated every two weeks.  (roughly.  Actually every 2016 blocks, which would be two weeks at one every ten minutes, but if more people start mining we get there sooner).
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:51:08
Totally possible.  The underhanded C contest covers inserting tiny, malicious bits of code.  Winning entries can often be passed off as typos.
However the open source/closed source dichotomy doesn't really make a difference.  Closed source programs are just as capable of having a malicious programmer on staff as open source ones.  C.f. all GPL software.
I think you can generate addresses using utilities that aren't designed to be Bitcoin tools so are less likely to contain bitcoin specific exploits.

Bitcoin is not appropriate for doing your grocery shop.
If there's a queue then you're the jerk paying for his fish supper by cheque on a Friday night.  Don't be that guy.  Be the guy buying a car in indisputable, unforgeable money and enjoy that ten minutes with a coffee and small talk while the guys in the garage fit a new number plate, top up the gas and bring her round front.
Bitcoin is great if you need to be absolutely sure, absolutely anywhere and can wait ten minutes.
Remember "Hi Mom! Send Bitcoin"?  I could slap a massive QR code on my roof and wait for Google Maps to update.  Even the guy who accidentally showed the private key of a loaded paper wallet on TV and got his coins swept.  It might have caused a few red faces, but it was damn interesting.
QR codes are great at being almost free, easy to make, copyable, mashable and forgettable.
That's not to say Bluetooth LE won't enable some awesome things by itself, but we want to look for things where it isn't just a bit better than the alternative, or even a lot better, but where it does things the other tools simply can't.  Like using the two way comms.  Instead of me getting an address and sending my transaction via mobile internet, how about I just sign a transaction and pass it back to the other terminal.  No mobile internet chopping out because the venue is in the basement of a building.  The venue can add a second input to top up the transaction fee if they want to play it that way.
Bluetooth is great at being interactive.
Play each tool to their strengths and we'll make some magic happen.

I don't see why you would reject the Euro and switch to bitcoin.  All of the arguments about not having control of your own currency apply to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:23:49
I don't believe a country will ever move to bitcoin.  
The problem bitcoin solves is distributed trust.  Governments don't need that because they already trust themselves and because they are by definition in charge, we are pretty much obliged to trust them too.  They might move to a wholly digital currency, but it will be one they can mint at will, forbid illegal transactions (somehow) and occasionally break anonymity with.
People at large might accept bitcoin.  Like where you turn up in a camera shop and ask, "Do you accept dollars instead of &lt;local currency&gt;?  How much would that cost me?" and the quoted rate is substantially better than the government approved one, but bitcoin is much to slippery to be acceptable to governments.
If this is the future and you are pointing out I made this clearly-by-now erroneous prediction, then please link so I can re-read why I thought this.

If you've got some time, read [reflections on trusting trust](  
tl;dr: Nobody reads the machine code, so make a compiler that will identify a key program and insert a backdoor.  Then also make it identify the source code of the compiler and insert the same injection code into the new compiler too.  Then you can rebuild *everything* from source and still be compromised because your initial tools were compromised.
tl;dr was tl;dr: You are probably hosed.  Good luck with that.

I'm all for the middle ground.  I reckon bitcoin will find a few niches and everyone will get along just fine.
When people say that we can develop solutions that will let us buy gum in a store just as easily as if we had a dollar in our hand, I'm reminded of the [Cory Doctorow DRM talk]( line about how Luther Bibles need a rent-a-priest before they can compete.
Bitcoin does a lot of things well, but (IMHO) we shouldn't be looking at how it can replace traditional cash, but rather at what is only possible because bitcoin exists.

Your address is the hash of a public key. While there could be a problem with quantum computers deriving private keys from public keys, you can't derive the public key from the address.
That's why you shouldn't re-use the same address. The first spend transaction posts the public key and opens up this (as-yet theoretical) vulnerability.

You'd lend bitcoin for the same reason pension funds lend their shares. They plan on holding them for the next fifty years. There's going to be some ups and downs and more than one recession in that time. To funds like that, those are blips because over half a century it'll go up.
On the other hand, they can lend them out while they hold them for a fee or interest and get more long term value from them.
If I lend you a bitcoin today and it goes down by the time it is recalled, I don't care because I'll actually be keeping it for another ten years.
Of course, pension funds aren't stupid. The loans are collateralised.

So who are you trying to keep 'em anonymous from?
I'm going to assume your planning on doing something nefarious (why else would you want to be anonymous? /jk).  You buy at coinbase, you transfer to local wallet, you e.g. buy drugs.
The fuzz pick up the dealer and find the bitcoin.  They can read the transactions and know that they came from an unknown address and before that they came from coinbase.  So they phone up coinbase, slap a warrant on them and demand to know who made that transaction.
Coinbase fold like cheap deckchair and you have some uniforms on your doorstep the next day.
You can't just shunt them through four or five wallets you control either.  There's no reason four or five people would each buy this many bitcoin and then sell on that exact same amount.
Splitting them up so it looks like you used small amounts over a few days looks better, but if they end up recombining then it's obvious they stayed in your control all the while.

Traffic fatalities can be accidental and deliberate. Gun deaths can be accidental and deliberate.  I will tolerate lots of accidents because shit happens and trying to pretend it can be prevented will never happen leads to trouble.
Deliberate killings with guns or vehicles, abuses of those things if you will, should be met with the full force of the law. And we've set things up so there are likely consequences.
You are discounting the motive in your examples and suggesting they are in some way equivalent when the motive is the only thing I care about in civil forfeitures.
Misuse of civil forfeitures seems to benefit police departments and even when they are found to be in error the cost is externalised. The is no penalty for misuse. Perhaps the rules should be rigged in some way to make that not the case.
I have no problem with the seizing of the proceeds of crime.  DPR losing his stuff would seem to be perfectly legit, but he was charged, convicted, etc.
If you search my car and take my stuff that should always lead to an investigation and a finding that maybe the forfeiture was legitimate even if they can't prove a crime or I get it back. Not that I lose my stuff now and I have to apply for some due process.

An adjustable transaction is defined in [the bitcoin.it wiki](
Basically you send your kid the signed transaction and he can broadcast when he wants. Later on you send him a replacement transaction that uses the same inputs but gives him more of the outputs.
This goes on and on until the kid decides he's accrued enough of the outputs and broadcasts the transaction. Then you start again.
So you can send him the transaction that gives him 0.1BTC in the morning and one that gives him 0.2BTC in the afternoon. Because only one transaction ever hits the network you only pay one fee for the day's transactions
There's additional smush to handle not trusting the payer which does incur and additional transaction but we assume parent and child trust each other.

So any interpretation that is supported by the text is valid. Mine doesn't invalidate yours and vice versa.
To me the story of all three movies is about choice. From following the rabbit, to his boss in the office, to the pills, to the architect explaining why the One exists in the first place and Neo choosing Trinity over everyone else, to the very end when Smith asks Neo why he keeps fighting.
Even the Oracle, a character that would seem to deny choice, is into it.














Smith rebels against the system just like Neo does but he doesn't choose to, he is forced.








Smith ends up equally as invincible as Neo, but undefeatable does not mean always victorious and without choice he can't break the stalemate. Neo can choose to set aside how power and die, knowing that in victory Smith will be exposed to The Source and destroyed.
I don't like the recursive matrix theory simply because it undermines all these choices and it becomes three movies of nothing actually happening.

Like anything that describes people and minds, there are theories that model people's moral reasoning and vicious rebuttals. YMMV. Here goes.
Stage 1: I will be good because bad people are punished. This is the most basic level of moral reasoning. This is where extremely young children are when the Naughty Step is a suitable punishment. Everyone here saying "Because I don't want to go to jail" is operating at this level.
Stage 2: I will be good if there is something in it for me. Once they are past being threatened, children can be bribed. Tidy your room and there might be dessert. People saying "Because it pays for your services" are operating at this level.
Stage 3: I will be good people people like good people. We have grown to realise the world isn't all about us. We'll play nice because we want to fit in. People saying "Because it's a dick move not to" are operating at this level.
Stage 4: I will obey the law because people should. If you didn't pay your taxes then society wouldn't crumble, but if everyone didn't then there'd be a problem. People saying "Because if nobody paid their taxes then anarchy would break loose" are operating at this level. This is also where most people stop.
Stage 5: I will pursue justice. The law is malleable, to be followed when it is just and changed when it is not. People saying "Because it's part of the deal of living here." are operating at this level. This is also ostensibly where democracy operates.
Stage 6: I will pursue morality. An unjust law is not to be tolerated until it can be changed, but actively disobeyed. If it is right that you should pay your taxes, then pay them. If not then don't. If you operate at this level then nothing less than the convincing you that it is morally correct to pay your taxes would convince you. People don't live at this level but they can take individual actions here. They tend to make the papers when they do.
I am conceited enough to think I work around stage 4. People should act in a way that if everyone did things would turn out ok. If everyone pays their taxes then things will probably stumble along fine. If everyone stops then the shit will hit the fan just spectacularly.
If you chose not to pay taxes on your bitcoin because you have decided that is the Stage 6 morally correct thing to do, but you still pay taxes on your fiat, then you are lying to yourself.

It depends on the miner. You should not depend on it being dropped. Rather you should "double spend" the same inputs with a higher fee to ensure the previous transaction is rejected.

I got an extortion email too, though mine had a different story and a more sensible demand. A simple way to check is to see if the wallet has had any transactions to it already. The wallet I was told to pay to had already received bitcoin but there was no mechanism to tell who had paid. Clearly a mass mailing that several people had been sent.
Of course, if nobody has sent that wallet any money then that doesn't prove the scam is legitimate. Just that everyone else has not fallen for it.

The Matrix was a big exploration of philosophy and choice. Having all of those choices be ultimately fake cheapens the story.
Neo could have powers in the real world because it wasn't hard sci-fi. He had to be genuinely, superhumanly powerful so that his final choice to lose to Agent Smith, to sacrifice himself, was meaningful. Insert Jesus metaphor about being effectively omnipotent but choosing to die on the cross.

The software knows what time it is. It has to in order to work out the actual time of the next adjustment vs the expected time in order to work out how to adjust it.
You'd have to spam high fee transactions to push normal people out of the running. Certainly possible, but expensive. If they didn't have high fees then they'd just float under the real transactions which would get processed first.
Hypothetical solution to a hypothetical problem. Both parts of it are beyond me, but you'd really have to nail down the nature of the problem and how your solution addresses it before anyone would want to implement it.

[CheckTimeLockVerify]( (probably). The payment script requires him to include an nTimelock field with a value in the future.
If the CTLV time hasn't passed then a transaction with an network acceptable nTimelock will cause the script to fail and an nTimelock that will permit the script to verify will be rejected by the network.
Ballsy. I'd be worried the network will change in the meantime in a way that means what is a valid transaction now is invalid then.

You are thinking of Futures or Forwards.
Options aren't promises to buy, they are options to buy. Bob can choose to exercise his option or not.
Bob buys a call option (can buy at price). Sue makes the fee. Sue's profit comes down to the accuracy of her prediction and her ability to hedge risk for less than the fee she's making.
The article suggests this is a US option so it can be exercised at any time before the end of next year so if in August BTC is $20,000 then drops to $5,000 by the end of the year, you can still have made mad money. If it had been a European style option you'd be stuck to the maturity date.

If you can decrypt a message with a particular key then you also *know* it was encrypted with the same key. In the case of a public key pair, if I can decrypt a message with my private key then I *know* it was encrypted with my public key.
Similarly I can encrypt a message with my private key and you know if you can decrypt it with my public key then it was definitely encrypted with my private key and thus encrypted by me. My private key is never exposed.

No they won't. I'm not sure how business insider drew that conclusion but it's not supported by [the politics.co.uk article that they cite](
What the politics article actually says is they want a backdoor into facebook/twitter/whatever. It's banning the phone that can't be unlocked by the manufacturer. That is well short of banning encryption.
Yes, the UK can already require you to hand over your keys. Yes, that sucks. [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]( is the relevant legislation. [Section 53]( covers the penalties for failing to comply. Which is a maximum of two years in prison unless it's a national security or child indecency case, in which case it's five years. Both can attract a fine but I can't find the relevant max. Both of these outcomes require a real judge in open court to convict you. It's not guantanamo bay.
My point here is that unless we are accurately informed about the shit the government is trying to pull, we will not be effective in trying to counter it. Screaming about banned encryption will lead to us deciding it wasn't as bad as we thought it was going to be and letting the rest of it slide.

The process is [reasonably involved]( but the short version is the address is a hash of the public key.
When you make a transaction, you provide the public key so I can check it hashes to the wallet you claim you own, and a signature that matches the public key so I can see you really hold the private key.
Note that this is for pay-to-public-key transactions where the leading value of the address is one. There is also pay-to-script transactions where the leading value is three. In the latter case the address is a hash of the script that should be used to redeem the funds.

Paper, hardware and other wallets have the same theoretical problem. If the manufacturers are evil, they can make the random seed predictable to themselves. Then they'd be able to brute force their way through a much smaller list of possible keys.

It's your excel stacked area chart. Every band of colour represents the number of transactions at a given price. Miners mine the ones with the highest fees first.
As the mempool fills up, the bands get thicker and the graph grows higher. As the miners catch up they shave layers off the top.

Ok, you and I are having secret conversations. We already know The Man is spying on us because, y'know, Snowden. But we are cool. We PGP encrypt and sign all of our messages to each other.
The problem is The Man is logging our encrypted messages too, and if your key is compromised then they can decrypt every message I ever sent you, and vice versa.
So here's what we do for the *really* secret stuff. We exchange new, separate signing and encryption keys. We know the new keys are good because the transfers are still signed with the old keys above. I encrypt and sign my stovies recipe with the new key and send it back. You read the recipe.
Then you *discard* the new private key. Now the only way anyone is reading the encrypted message is brute force.
I *publish* my new signing key (usually just by sending it to you) and now anyone can forge messages on that key which means if my signed stovies recipe is leaked later I can still deny it was mine.
Because we establish up-front that you will be discarding the new key, it is not reasonable to believe that you still have it, so The Man can't demand it on pain of prison.
This is called perfect forward secrecy because a later compromise does not reveal earlier messages.

I'm pretty sure money laundering is, among other things, a means to achieve smuggling rather than the other way around. The problem with the smuggling is you may have to explain how you came to have something. Laundering is the creation of a legitimate sounding reason to have whatever it is you are laundering.

Stock borrowing and lending is a thing in the stock market. The loans are typically collateralised and pay a fee either regularly during the trade or at the end date.
If the loaned asset or the collateral changes in value significantly then a margin call can be made where either I return some of your collateral or demand more so that if either of us default on the loan then neither are out of pocket.
Looking at the bitcoin graph, are you ready for margin calls to take all your stuff over the next couple of years?

Two answers: First of all, the algorithm can be swapped out.
Secondly, Quantum attacks on encryption derive the private key from the public key. The public key is not published until the transaction is spent so as long as you don't reuse wallets, the only time a quantum computer can *begin* to attack your wallet is the moment you spend the money in it.

Your public key is hashed to produce your wallet address. When you spend it the bitcoin in the wallet you publish the public key and sign everything with your private key. That's all I need to check if the transaction is valid. If it is invalid I'll reject it immediately and it will never propagate into the network.
Transactions should never expire. Many wallets do expire transactions, but you shouldn't depend on that. The correct thing to do is create a new transaction spending the same inputs again, but with a higher fee. Then when the second transaction confirms, the first is rejected as a double spend.

Legal tender is a specific thing and only matters when there is a debt.
You rock up to a bookstore counter with a copy of the Davinci Code and a wheelbarrow of pennies they can decline because you have no debt, you have an invitation to treat.  They can decline service for any reason, especially because you are being a smartarse.
If you have a debt on the other hand, restaurant bill, credit card, government fine, your cash being legal tender is important and can result in the debt being discharged if declined.  In the UK there is a cap on how much of each denomination constitutes legal tender (e.g. 20p of pennies) but in the US there is no such restriction.

When you go to the counter with a basket of goods, you have an invitation to treat and the seller can say no for any reason including they don't accept fifties in payment for a chocolate bar 'cos it fucks up the float.

The G-man wants to make the next court order stick so they want to enforce back doors in the products. The UK implementation of this doens't mean the encryption needs to be weakened, but rather the encryption is between my device and their server rather than between my device and yours. That way Apple get a chance to copy the cleartext. Of course, this is still objectively less secure than end-to-end encryption.

There's a technology called homomorphic encryption.  tl;dr is that it lets you do maths on the encrypted values without needing to know what they were.

If you could reverse SHA-256 to turn an address into a public key, that still wouldn't let you spend the coins. You need the private key to spend the coins.
But your underlying point has two outcomes. If the encryption is cracked then your coins are gone forever unless we change the algorythm to something more robust. Changing the algorythm is something that can be done though.

You can't get away from that. If I tell you I have some shares and wish to sell them, but I intend to fail to deliver then it doesn't matter if I have them nor if I don't deliver in ten minutes or two days.
Counterparty risk is managed via delivery versus payment transactions. Currently via using the same agent for both legs of the trade, but easily also by the blockchain in the style of counterparty. However we can reduce the risk still further by verifying our counterparty actually has what they claim to sell.

First of all, SHA256 is used as a proof of work. It's what makes mining hard. Finding a way to do it faster doesn't let me steal your coins. It would give me a massive effective hash rate so 51% attacks or anything else that depends on lots of power become available.
However, brute force and an undiscovered weakness in either the hashing or the crypto are both the same shape of thing: The maths we are relying on don't behave like we thought they did so we can replace them.

My primary question about the rootkit debacle is where the hell were the AV companies while this was going on?

Up front I'd like to say thanks for speaking to us. It's good to get the word of someone at the coalface. Also I'm a bit envious of your t-shirt.
Let's ignore the buffer overflow and that activeX (perhaps Sony only planned to give themselves unfettered access to your pc). What they shipped was a rootkit designed to subvert my computer to hide programs. They used it to hide drm. Gamers used it to hide their cheats. Viruses used it to hide themselves.
That is where I expect AV companies to step up to the plate.


Wait for it...

It's quite possible my understanding may be wrong, but I thought Mark found it independently (through his rootkit revealer program).
I'm aware of the security holes (is it a security hole if that's how it is designed to work?) which is why I'm putting the AV companies on the hook.  If F-Prot detects and removes it then they get all the points as far as I'm concerned.  Can you link me to F-Prot's definition page like [symantec's](
Wikipedia says that other AV companies implemented detection "after public pressure" so I guess I have to update my rant, but only slightly because I shouldn't have to ask them to do what I pay them for.  Am I to assume they are sitting on other definitions of otherwise undetected malware because the author has a legal team too?
I did wonder if Sony would ship their devices with the rootkit pre-installed.  It would seem not, but Lenovo seems to have gone for it.  Will F-Prot gank this spyware too?

In short, your plan would work. There's no difference from the inside between the network being split in two and simply half the nodes quitting and going offline.
Your biggest challenge is controlling a network of that size and disorder. One, single missed connection and your first transaction would propagate over the whole network, and if you were spending five bitcoins in my shop then you can bet I'd wait for at least six confirmations before my stock left the store, so you've got to hold that split together for at least an hour.
It would be considerably easier to isolate one particular target, either to prevent them broadcasting or receiving your transaction while you attempted your double spend.
The defence against this is that it's not very feasible. A lot of attacks on bitcoin become possible if you assume you control the whole Internet.
Edit: It occurs that if you isolate my shop so I can't ship out your transaction then it will never be confirmed and I'll never release your goods. Same problem if you isolate my shop so I can't see your transaction before you come to me to do the double spend.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:52:31

Oh yes, the hashing process uses a lot of energy.  Something that's more efficient but does the same job would be very welcome.
But that's energy spent *securing* the network.  The value of bitcoin comes comes from it's utility.  Bluntly, it's worth what people will pay for it and that's not related to the electricity spent on mining.
That lack of relation is what I think confuses the article when it talks about consumption rather than possession that acts as proof of prior possession.  Like (I'm assuming) many people, I have a few Bitcoin but I've not seriously engaged in mining.  They are just as much mine as those owned by the mining pools are theirs.

There isn't anything to stop governments forking bitcoin and making one for themselves, but they'd probably want one that behaves more like normal money.

To my knowledge the only incident in bitcoin has been an occasion where someone made a transaction that credited themselves with a lot of bitcoin that wasn't part of the inputs of the transaction.  Details [here](

Everyone buys tickets
Salt random number with a public number that has an uniform distribution.  The numbers rackets from back in the day used the fractional part of the closing daily price of the stock exchange.
Mod() your randomly selected numbers with whatever you decided were the possible lottery results.  Or mod() the number of raffle entries if you are doing a raffle. (Lottery doesn't have to have a winner every time.  Raffle does.)
Publish the original random number so everyone can see and audit that everything was above board.
However, I recently posted in and was immediately reminded that I shouldn't be posting things like this from memory, so googling "Provably Fair Lottery" should clue you in on the details that I've no doubt missed.

Those cards are kind of cute.  Not really practical that I can think of, but I've wanted to own a lump of gold for a few years now.  However, it does make me think of one thing:
I might accept strange trades in lieu of cash just because I fancy some gold or similar.  But I can't assay your gold while you are there.  I *know* the bitcoin you just sent me was valid though, otherwise the network would have rejected it before I ever saw it.

As in generic CPUs?  Even if you got them for free and only had to pay for the power to run them you'd still make a terrible loss.  They went out of the question when people moved to graphics cards.
Graphics cards are getting replaced by custom hardware so spending that cash on ATIs to mine is still going to be a losing proposition.
As far as I can tell, miners are making a short term loss all the time, but keeping the rewards long enough to make it worthwhile, and a more convenient way to do that would be to just spend your cash at an exchange.

For what it's worth, I think the answer to this question will be what makes bitcoin a winner.
When people talk about how vending machines could totally take bitcoin, if only...  Well they're not wrong, but I'm reminded of the Cory Doctorow talk where he compares that to saying what will make your Gutenberg Bible go prime time is when we can include your very own priest to interpret it for you.
When we start building things that could only be made with bitcoin.  When they are worth the trouble of buying.  That's when things are going to take off (even more so)

The problem is bitcoin doesn't price itself.  There are two common ways to peg a currency. By decree: where I say bitcoin is worth one dollar and make it illegal to trade outside of my approved exchanges. Naturally nobody has that authority over bitcoin but countries do try it, and black markets usually spring up pretty quickly. I think Argentina is trying that just now.
The other way needs a lot of bitcoin and dollars. I rock up to an Exchange and set a bunch of buy orders at 90 cents, and a bunch of sell orders at $1.10. Then the price will sit in that band. This is sort-of how most countries operate pegs, but it needs substantial foreign reserves.
The second problem is if the 'real' price is too far out of that band then you run out of resources to maintain either the buy or the sell orders.
I suppose you could build something so when the price goes up then so does the reward, but implementing it would be a political nightmare and I'm not sure how effective it would be.

I concur.  If you've got that kind of power over bitcoin, then the most profitable thing you can do is try and make it more robust and useful, and therefore more valuable.

depends where you live.  And nobody here is a lawyer.  Not even the guy who actually is a lawyer.
In the UK, the distance selling regulations say if you get sent something you didn't ask for, then it's considered an unconditional gift.  This stops me sending you a pen or something then invoicing you for a silly amount.
However: There is an incident where [PS vita bundles were shipped by mistake, instead of just the game,]( and they are lawyering up to get their stuff back.
Their argument is they didn't ship something unasked. They were asked, but shipped the wrong thing so the unconditional gift rule doesn't apply.
Personally, I would contact the seller and ask how he wants the others back.  Ideally I'd like him to arrange a courier to collect them at my convenience, but I'd accept him paying my shipping costs if he'll wait until the weekend to have them in the post.

Under [UK law]( you can get a stay at Her Majesty's Pleasure for "forgetting" your encryption keys, but technically the wallet is a signing key.  Doesn't decrypt anything.
I wouldn't think they'd need to control them to prove they're his.  The public keys from the wallet (maybe not encrypted depending on your client) would provide a preimage for the addresses the server was sending BTC to.  That'd convince me.

I'm curious why not.  I wouldn't buy into this either, but mainly because I play these games for individual moments of triumph rather than any expectation I'll be off the bottom rung at the end.
If you could solve cheating in some magically perfect way, I could see that sort of thing gaining some traction.  Look at all the other weird junk people gamble on.

I would like to say, "The same way they get industrial quantities of goods from mines to ports where there aren't currently roads.  Big honking trucks with a high wheelbase."  But that's not really a fair comparison.  Population densities, existing infrastructure, etc.
However, roads are a common good.  Having everyone who gets benefit from a road to cough up some cash to disparate groups of road makers and getting a decent result is never going to happen.
What would work is if the roads and their maintenance was privatised.  I own the road and I'll slap a toll booth on each end to pay for maintenance.  You pay by some scale of weight (because more weight means more damage to the road) and by the mile.  All fair, right?
The good news:  Congestion holds up traffic and costs me money, so my roads are going to be built to keep traffic moving.  For a start, I'll implement peak time charges on my routes to encourage trucks and other non-essentials to stay away when it's busy.  Sure, you kind of get it in the shorts because your daily commute has gone up, but walmart is happy and that's what we're after.  Let's get rid of pavements too.  Pedestrians aren't my customer so we'll free up the space for more cars.  Maybe a VIP lane so CxOs can get home faster.  This'll push pedestrians into cars as well, which'll help my bottom line.  Bikes are forbidden.  Too slow and charging them the same as a sixteen wheeler never goes over well in the press.
Also, I'll do recovery services.  If someone breaks down I'll scramble a sky-crane to maglift that car out of there within ten minutes.  If that's your car, then I'll charge you a pretty penny for the rescue, but insurance and a modest co-pay will cover that.
Of course, like health insurance, they'll be total gits about paying up, so I'll take lower amounts from them and make up the difference on the uninsured.  Also, your car repairs count as pre-existing conditions, so if you break down again in the same car, expect to be paying for the recovery yourself.
Now the bad news:  Unless you live in an urban area, you can forget about it.  I'm not putting in a road so some hayseed can drive a tractor on it.  There's no money in that.
We can take a lesson from internet providers as to what happens next.  People here complain vocally about comcast and verizon being varying degrees of awful, but they have no choice.  Google fibre announces they are going to roll out service in a new city and suddenly prices go down, speeds go up and you aren't required to rent your modem from them anymore.
Except the general architecture of a city is pretty much defined by not having enough room to lay down another road beside the one that's already there, so reality enforces a monopoly, which means I can charge whatever I like and have the entire complaints department staffed by a single, deaf, senile old man who only want's to tell stories of the time he went to Shelbyville.
You might want to build your own routes in your neighbourhood.  Maybe out the the nearest mall.  Sounds good because you could buy a house and actually get road builders to compete for the maintenance work.  Except I'm going to sue you, just like the internet providers sued communities for trying to build their own broadband infrastructure.  And I'm not having your home-made driveways connecting to my professionally maintained network.  That's dangerous.  I'll own the road including the bit in your garage, so you can pay me while your car is parked too.  I'll get around to tarmacking it real soon.  Just don't have your car parked there when I turn up two days late, because that'll be a job for the recovery team.

Must I provide a shipping address?  For example, I could pass you the URL of an Amazon wishlist and have you deliver everything on it to the shipping address associated with the list.

And the question immediately following the two you cited doesn't seem remotely related to your situation?
Just to be clear, you should be using plurals in the sentence above, because showing the guy a misleading subset of what you took to be the correct advice is also "not the best moral/ethical decision."  So you got to count them both.
And while we're talking about "not the best", I'm having trouble thinking how you could be doing more wrong in this transaction.  Short of disputing the charge and making sure he doesn't get paid of the one he meant to send you too.  Maybe I shouldn't give you ideas.

You can give it one of your own public keys.  Just any address that's already in your wallet.  Like 'bitcoin:19ZgE3bDSs9pC6eySc1RWHz2jtcLTC9VVz' in the input string.

Alternatively, nobody builds any roads and Wallmart doesn't even build a carpark.  It's cheaper for them and nobody argues about what to do when Wallmart roads meet Tesco roads.  You can pay for a 4x4 to get around.

Imagine someone owes you $10.  He writes you an IOU.  You want to buy something off me so you jot a note on the IOU saying you are passing the debt to me.  Eventually I get around to meeting the first person and he gives me the cash.
Now instead of writing it down, what if he emailed an IOU.  He can digitally sign it for non-repudiation, and he can include your public key in the message so you can an addendum saying you are passing the IOU onto me.
The problem here is you signing the emailed IOU over to me doesn't use up the original message you got, so you could sign it over to two people.  This is called double spending and is the problem the blockchain solves.
First of all, all transactions are broadcast to everyone and logged so we can see that the IOU was passed on and reject any future attempts to sign it to someone else.
Next the transaction log includes a proof that a certain amount of work was done so it becomes impossible for you to fake up a history that claims the IOU wasn't spent because you can't do the same amount of work as everyone else in the world put together.
Each person who manages to create the next entry in the transaction log gets to add a few bitcoin that come from nowhere and get paid to them.  That's the reward for doing the work. This process is called mining.
The tricky concept in this explanation is: There was never an original IOU.  Bitcoin just got generated and was effectively worthless to begin with.  Fiat money gets into the system by people like me saying "Mining is too much like hard work.  Can I just give you some cash for some of yours?"
It is very risky because all kinds of things could break it.  But it's also quite interesting and can let us do some really useful things that were impossible before.  To take one example: If I pay you in bitcoin then you can't use that information to steal my identity and spend more of my money like you could with credit cards.
Do you have more questions?

I think cheating would kill this instantly, but if you could magically solve that I wonder if it wouldn't work.
I've always found these games more fun when I play with people I know rather than internet strangers.  I wonder if that's partly because I'm risking bragging rights.  Bitcoin would let me put a tiny amount of cash on the line for similar risk and theoretically more enjoyment.

Are you on PAYE?  Your boss would calculate everything in £, pay the relevant taxes and give you the remainder in BTC.

Supply and demand.  If more people are selling than buying, the price goes down (because you want out and I want cheap coins).  If more people are buying than selling then the price goes up (because you want in and I want as much cash as possible).
Spending doesn't affect the price directly, but the seller cashing out adds to the number of sellers, so everyone spending more than people are buying would drive the price down too.
China making it difficult to use the exchanges reduces the pool of buyers, and some people are selling out because they only got in when they heard they could make a lot of money from China out of it.

I saw someone suggest using bitcoin to play for quakeworld.  Everyone buys in to join the server, you get paid based on your relative kill count.  Because quake 1 is open source these days, you could write a wallet right into the client.
Nice idea, but it would encourage cheating in a big way, and that'd be the same for most other games where you could get money out in some way.

In my opinion, Esperanto and Bitcoin have a very similar problem: The lack of a killer application.  Something that makes the barrier to entry worthwhile for regular people.
Esperanto might find its in education, but that's not important here.
Bitcoin has some very useful traits, but it doesn't do anything an "average" person can't recreate (maybe poorly) with normal money.  Of course, on the day that "maybe poorly" becomes more trouble than doing it in bitcoin we are going to see some excitement.

That's going to be tricky.  Bitcoin acts kind of like a commodity so supply and demand will affect the price.
Various countries peg their currency to e.g. the dollar, but maintaining that peg takes work and tweaking economic policy.  Not to mention it can slip of the gap between what the government wants and what the markets decide are too different.
A version that lets the creator print and destroy coins at will would be able to be pegged, because they could use that mechanism to control the price.  I don't think anyone else could do that because, well you shouldn't trust me to have that kind of power and I shouldn't trust you.  Governments already act in that way so it's a smaller step for them.
