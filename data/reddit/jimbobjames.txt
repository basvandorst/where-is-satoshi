Something like 16 Trillion in the Cayman Islands, IIRC.

Isn't that only true if you calculate ROI at current prices.
I mean, historically Bitcoin has trended up, doesn't that give opportunity for a return?

Exactly. Why buy that car today when it will be cheaper tomorrow.

If I have an older miner that uses an older version of the bitcoin client does that mean it will stop being able to mine blocks?
I'm at total noob at bitcoin and just mined to learn it a bit.

That's because the calculator runs out of decimal places.

History says otherwise. The police force is made up of US citizens, doesn't seem to cause them any issues..

Yep, good luck fighting the governments AH64 Apache's and M1 Abram's with an AR15.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:15:27
Sure, right now it is.

You'd look serious too if you'd died years before the invention of bitcoin.

Just to be clear, Douglas Adams wrote comedy so he's not being serious.

Yeah, I bet all those people in Syria are really enjoying their "freedom".

It's just a stupid viewpoint to believe that the forces won't do as they are told if the above hypothetical situation were to arise. 
History teaches us time and time again, that good people do terrible things at the behest of those in power. The US armed forces are no different to any other.

No, I'm simply stating that this is being highlighted as a negative of bitcoin but where are the numbers for traditional banking? How can we know if the figure for bitcoin is really as bad as this statement makes it look?
My guess is that the banking sector will use more power than bitcoin does currently, but we are only hearing one side of the story.
Ultimately, if we want any form of global currency trade it's going to require power, but lets have all of the facts so we can make an informed decision.

£500 would buy an full ryzen 2400g rig. Depending on the system someone is running it could be a huge boost in gaming performance.
You could then add in a discrete card later on. The APU's have been priced the same as the two lowest end Ryzen CPU's.
If you have a rig already you could upgrade cpu, board and ram for £350

I wonder how the power usage compares to traditional banks with their rows and rows of servers, networking gear and not to mention the local branches they run?
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:12:37
Yes they are.
Perhaps you missed this line from the wik -

Yes, of course. It's called a bank run and its very real. The whole reason fractional reserve banking exists dates back to the days of promissory notes and some enterprising individual realised that he didn't need to keep all the money that had been deposited all of the time.
In real terms both people have the same amount and can spend it, upon which it gets deposited into another bank and the cycle continues.
Your basically arguing symantics at this point.

Using bitcoin, things like wallets and the address's. How do you even remember them?
Usability in general is not simple enough for the mass market.

I'm a very technical user who does IT support and much of Bitcoin seems utterly baffling. 
Bitcoin as it stands is horrifically user-unfriendly, I understand it is early days but it really needs a shake up if it wants to be used by everyone.
