Lol you made the prediction 2 years ago buddy, anyone can call a number and wait a lifetime for it to hit.  You knew nothing, losing trader.

And yet 2 years ago you were out giving advice on the crypto forums, here you are admitting you lost nearly all your profits at the same time you were arguing with a bunch of us.  
Good thing I followed your profile and have been watching your stupidity ever since 2017, you have rarely if ever been right about anything and now we have you here admitting you have no idea what you're talking about rofl.

Question is, how low is it gonna go though, you think it'll still be able to short after 10-15?  Seems in those price ranges it's closer to it's real value if any, that's just in my own personal opinion.

Careful of this guy, over 2 years ago he was running around advising people as if he was a pro trader making obscene amounts of money.  None of his predictions came true, he continues to post on reddit as if he understands the market yet here he is admitting he's lost almost all his profits.  That's just what he's actually admitting, iron is just another losing trader scrub much like the rest of 95% reddit.

I dunno what to say about the "xrp plebs" that lost 90% , I'm not one of those people.  I can trade insults calling people "useless lifeforms" all day with anyone on the internet, it bores.  
So you personally think that XRP is going to hit 15 and possibly 10 cents?  If this is so, how do you expect it to blow through the massive 20c support?  
Also, suppose you personally are looking at this from a "traders" perspective, what happens at 10 or 15 cents for you?  Is that where you personally think a "bottom" is going to be and you're going to load your bags or is that where you think xrp will just fall to stay, or fall and stay until yet another short until it eventually hits 0?
I've been out of the XRP game a very long time so I don't take any insults or opinions you have about the company personally.  I do however still watch the price and how things continue to develop.  I don't think we agree (correct me if I'm wrong), as it seems you're a trader and do not think the utility and adoption of XRP will -EVER- drive the price up.  I on the other hand feel as if I've been watching them make big moves however, if that's to happen I still think they're at least a couple years away from that starting to make a big difference in any price.  I respect if we disagree there.
As I asked above about what you think about the 20c support vs your 15c/10c levels and what you think will happen.  Personally, I formed the opinion after it lost the 30-33c zone that it would probably come down to around 16c, I'm just curious as to what it'll take to break that massive 20c support I mentioned.  Anyway, I'm curious to what you think if you're interested in a discussion.

What's the XRP Discord?  Dunno why you keep calling me an XRP brainlet lol, I've been shorting it too.  All I care about is when it's hitting 10-15c bud, whatever XRP children that are throwing a fit, f'em.
You're right, we did bust through and now it seems btc had a deadcat bounce for now, I'm not seeing where the real next support is for XRP until 15c, I'm just waiting for those 10-15c levels post your short here instead f those discord kids.
