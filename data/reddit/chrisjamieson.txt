same here also - also different bank. i'm assuming it's the added attention. flipping through recent posts on the subreddit, it looks like coinbase is suffering a number of issues - even people who have gotten verified are going through having their transactions flagged as 'high risk' and subsequently cancelled. it's a bummer - they're the only place that i've found in my limited experience here that made it easy to make a purchase - probably the reason for all the delays.

it is stupid. however, coinbase was the most prominent way to purchase btc that i could find listed anywhere in this subreddit, so despite the questionable feedback, it was worth trying to get verified. several days later and given the amount of negative feedback within the subreddit, i'm going to back out of trying to process a transaction even if i do eventually get verified through them. however, i've tried to review the sidebar and other posts here and i can't find any other alternatives other than localbitcoins, which seems comparatively wildly inconvenient. is there another option? perhaps instead of posting in every single coinbase-related post with "stop it fuck you", introducing some alternatives to promote other methods of btc purchasing might help the cause.

have you been able to successfully conduct any transactions through coinbase? the bank account i gave them is my primary checking account and despite the fact that it's not exactly scrooge mcduck's vault, i still feel apprehensive about giving my bank credentials to a website i'm new at dealing with. many other people have said that even though they've gotten verified, they are still having trouble processing transactions.
