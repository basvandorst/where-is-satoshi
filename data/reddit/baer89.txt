Plug it in here and see if its a legitimate mnemonic phrase. 
If so you can check the address of the phrase to see if it matches the actual wallet.
If you find a match you can open the wallet with electrum using the seed phrase and transfer it to a secure wallet you own.
edit: Trouble is how do we know what derivation path they used for the address?

This must be a hint? Code, easily, attack, early are all white BIP39 seed words in the image. Also goes with clue as they are paired.

Use it as incentive to learn. This knowledge isn't intrinsic to anyone, they all had to learn it.

From the whitepaper:
"The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's **R**uin problem."

Image has transaction and transactions. Probably didn't treat them as the same word.

Just in the way they wrote the sentence.
Code easily
attack early
No idea how to use that info though.

You are a lucky motherfucker, time to reclaim all the shit from your pants, were you gray-hatted or how did you recover the coins?

I reckon if he is hiding the money then the bankruptcy is fraudulent and is no longer protected.

Because if you ever want it to go mainstream it needs to be friendly for all transactions. It is supposed to be a currency and not a bank so ideally you use it for all transactions big and small.
Imagine it is mainstream and you can buy anything with it. Buy a $2 coffee. Now it's $2.25. Do that another 5 or 6 times through the day and you've spent several dollars in transaction fees.
It won't stick around like this. It either needs to change or people will find an alternative.

Move it to a wallet you own.

Made me go look to see if there was a massive spike. What is the point of this if it isn't true?

Yeah that's not a scam...
