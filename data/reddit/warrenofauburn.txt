She says she never made a mnemonic or a backup, so I don't think she has one, unless blockchain automatically makes these things for her.

they did the same to me too. they still have not corrected the mistake, and it took them over a week to respond to my emails

by spam, you mean a transaction of a small amount? who's to say what's spam? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:47:09
same thing happened to me about eight months ago, but they refused to cancel the transaction. they told me just to sell it if i didn't want it anymore

interesting. how do you know it's associated with omni?

my coins die with me!

Ok, thanks! I also was wondering why there have been no orphaned blocks recently. Any ideas? I posted it here, but have yet to receive a response.

ok, just to update. I contacted Dave Bitcoin (at walletrecoveryservices with a guess of the password, and he was able to run an algorithm that recovered the password. It turns out that she had indeed misremembered the password. Dave Bitcoin took 20% of the recovered funds as we had previously agreed, and he was very professional and friendly in my email correspondence with him.

I could go back to the genesis block and mine a longer chain while manipulating time stamps to keep the difficulty very low. Hence, my chain would be longer, but have less work. Would this be possible (ignoring the checkpoints)? Also, note I would not be breaking the rules of the protocol
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:02:14
I see. Putting an upper bound on the times stamps indeed stops this attack. Interesting. I still don't like it though. It should be the chain with most work, then we wouldn't have to worry about time stamps. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:34:41
I'm not sure I follow. Mine would be the right hashes, since I started with the genesis block and followed the protocol.  My blocks would be different, but my chain would still be valid and longest 
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:46:20
Although one would expect the miner to be incentivized to only mine on the chain with the most hashing power (hence more likely to win), the above analysis seems to imply that it doesn't matter how he divides his hashing power. What am I missing? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:53:37
the difficulty adjustment is based on the time stamps if I'm not mistaken. I could just forge the time stamps to make it look like a block was created every ten minutes, so the difficulty would remain as low as the genesis block difficulty 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:45:56
I understand. So why wouldn't my hashes be valid? Remember I am forging all new blocks going back to the genesis block
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:49:37
I thought so, it just seems funny that Satoshi says longest chain in the whitepaper. Was it ever longest chain? Also I can't find the scoring function in the code (probably because I'm code illiterate) 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:08:00
well, in this attack my time stamps would be well after the median time of the previous 11 'valid' blocks. is that the only criteria on time stamps?
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:25:27
way too many inaccuracies 
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:53:44
yes, it's reached the point of an unhealthy addiction for me too

why is everyone assuming the halving will cause the price to double?
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:31:54
the supply is not halving, only the block reward
