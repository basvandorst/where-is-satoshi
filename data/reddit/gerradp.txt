Yeah, because worldwide, Bitcoin is the EASIEST way to get a refund. Except for places that don't do any bitcoin refunds whatsoever, or if the merchant says no and you have no bank/company to do a charge back, or if their policy isn't instant bitcoin refunds and they say it will be a couple days, or any other situation happens.
Your argument is so poorly constructed it's almost funny. What you are saying makes no sense. You are basically saying that Bitcoin is the best for one of the things it doesn't do well at all. Next you will be saying bitcoin is easy, bitcoin is fast, bitcoin is anonymous, bitcoin is price-stable, bitcoin is....
You are just an idealogue with no clue about the real world. Saying something over and over doesn't make it true, and IF someone were to get into bitcoin on your "promises" and find out the truth, they would be fucking pissed. Rightly so, I say. Make arguments based on facts and not your neckbeard emotions if you really want to attract greater fools that will stick around.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:58:39
Wow, you left a lot of detail out in the main post. Now it's not "seconds" into your account, it's many many minutes and several steps. That, and you have never used credit as you said above. Oh, and you are saying that there are instant credits on CC, but you have "never experienced them."
All these details, plus the fact that you are at a merchant's discretion, and that many merchants offer NO bitcoin refunds, and that there are no chargebacks, make this post seem really silly. Don't you agree?

I love the shit out of it. We don't go around "embarrading" ourselves by letting multiple-murder-for-hires go unpunished like they would in the utopian future of AnCapistan. We also don't believe that some guy running a billion-dollar drug market, selling weapons, poison, counterfeit cash, and every kind of dope is a "hero."
Apparently we must be missing the part where Mexican drug lords are also heroes, trying to change the status quo through the incredibly effective method of "doing nothing at all to change the law, but making a lot of money keeping it in place." Or are they not heroes because they aren't young, white, incredible privileged libertarian nutcases? You're right, brown people can't be heroes like Ross Ulbricht can, even though they are doing the same shit.
I'm just glad that reality sides with us, the sane people, who think that trying to have someone tortured to death, have someone's innocent roommates killed, and running a drug empire are actually crimes and not acts of benevolence. It must hurt to have reality lined up and firmly disagreeing with you on every topic; knowing that it will never change in your lifetime because your ideals are fucking insane and NO ONE wants them in practice. Meanwhile, I will enjoy the fact that I find reality to be comfortable and agreeable.

Yeah, Bitcoin will surely remove you from the influence of the government of the country you live in. After all, your wages are paid in bitcoin, you pay your bills in bitcoin, and you will never have to worry about a tax man getting curious how you make your living. 
The future is here; surely governments will stand idly by and pass no legislation while a bunch of libertarian nutters slowly topple their entire empire. War is over, no more pain in the world, hunger is solved; thank you bitcoin!

That doesn't really line up with what you say in the OP, does it? 
Saying that because you had ONE good experience with a BTC refund, that "bitcoin wins," is absurd. Many outlets offer no BTC refunds whatsoever. There are no chargebacks, so you are at the vendor's discretion, you can't contact your bank or exchange and have the money put back in place.
How you think this is the "clear winner" would be a mystery if it weren't so clear that your ideological zealotry is the main issue here, not the true benefits of credit vs BTC.

You realize just because you haven't seen it, that doesn't mean it has never happened, right? A lot of things in the world are made real despite never receiving your sensory inspection. I have had a lot of instant debit refunds, instant credit refunds, etc.
Bitcoin has benefits, but you are making shit up. If the merchant didn't want to refund you, he doesn't have to and there's no one you can call. There are no chargebacks. If their policy is to refund you in two days or a week, then they can do that. Many outlets say specifically that there are no bitcoin refunds.
Maybe you can explain how that is better than a credit card? Or is it only better because credit cards and debits don't align perfectly with your ideology and fragile worldview?

Yeah, Bitcoin Incorporated and Satoshi should march down to city hall and file a lawsuit immediately! Of course, as others are stating, this is completely different than BitCoin, will actually see widespread use, won't leave you with lost funds, and has a distinct lack of Karpeles, so obviously it is an inferior design.

Just in the last twelve hours you wrote a manic-psychotic screed about bitcoin betting with zero math OR specifics, and called it an "investment whitepaper," claiming it was "how math worked." That, and threw out the shitty idea of a bitcoin history subreddit without being willing to do even cursory work on it.
Usually methamphetamine gives people insane ideas and the energy/determination to see them through. Somehow all it gives you is an inflated sense of self-worth and god-awful ideas. You need either less meth, more anti-psychotic meds, or a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

Yeah, this is just absurd. This is like saying "the good thing about a loan shark is their flexibilty," it is just the opposite of true.
If you pay any attention to your credit card bill, you will never lose a dime to credit card fraud. You have layers and layers and layers of protection, and the company actually ACTIVELY looks for fraud and cuts it off as soon as possible.
With BitCoin you have none of that, and the amount of fraud that goes through with full success and zero recourse is staggering. People are losing millions of dollars to mining hardware companies, MtGox, those gold sales companies that fell through, etc. We are talking about much more than half a BILLION dollars of fraud that we know about. No credit card holder has had anything close to these situations, and with modern cards and a third grade reading level you never need to suffer any losses at all.
What kind of doublethink does it take to somehow think Bitcoin is a superior option for prevention of lost funds? What the fuck?

Legendary. So you are buying bitcoin so your artifical intelligence warrior can have the power to strike down the illuminati, and the government views bitcoin to be as big a problem as terrorism, hence the private military contractor that employs me and my brethren.
I can't believe a single top mind was able to put this all together, and I also can barely believe that a government as inept as ours has managed to keep it all secret up until now. You'd think with the 24 hour news cycle and tens of thousands employed in the efforts, someone would have anonymously leaked this or found reference to it in the Snowden documents.

"The main purpose is to break the stereotype that Bitcoin is only used by cyber-criminals by showing the real faces and stories behind 1,000 everyday Bitcoin advocates."
Bullshit. The main purpose of the site is to make money while doing nothing, which fits in pretty well with some of the people around here. This is doubly hilarious because you don't even want to buy the bitcoins you mistakenly think will bring you to the moon. 
This is pathetic, transparent, and poorly executed. If you were more honest about the 'main purpose' maybe people would be more sympathetic, but I doubt it, because this is a bullshit move.

So somehow this physical wallet will have a team actively working 24 hours a day to prevent fraud, and offering to cover the wallet holder in the event of any funds being fraudulently spent? That sounds incredible, with these features it will be approaching the power of a credit card from 1980!
Oh, it will never have those features? That sounds killer. It will still require my grandmother to understand high-level cryptographic concepts and operational security, and have the benefit of taking longer to verify the insecure transactions when spending? The FunBuxx revoution is here!

Buttcoin is more hilarious than it has ever been. It is about four times as funny at $337 than it ever was at $1200 (not exactly, but it will be that funny in a couple weeks). 
I think the funniest thing is how everyone misses the point of the subreddit and simultaneously proves everything we think. The most vocal among you, and seemingly a majority, are not even bitcoin enthusiasts, you are fucking cult members. You have shields impervious to anything apart from 'good news' and refuse to see that, although every major business seems to be getting exit-scammed, there are mostly bad actors in the community.

I have heard a rumor that a lot of people manage to obtain sex without paying any money at all. Sometimes they may have to buy a movie ticket, dinner, or drinks, but those have intrinsic value of their own.
The killer app in this case would be something you could use to buy a personality and some social skills using the magic of FunBuxx. Then you can just use the good, old fashioned Tinder to get your dick wet, and you get to keep another fantastic benefit: your dignity.

His voting stance is absurd. The other 10,000 opinions he espouses seem to be a mix of sensible, very cool, and a few absurd ones.
He is trying to do the right thing, and I think that most people see through the absurdity of the voting comments. However, he should realize his fanbase is mostly young people, and stopping them from voting only exacerbates the problem of conservatives being much more interested in turning up for the vote. How does stopping youth from voting help that, fair point.
He does seem to hold many reasonable opinions, however.

Yeah, the whole nation agrees, tax dodging is patriotic. That's why it is a centerpiece of July 4th celebrations, political campaigns, and discussions on the spirit of America.
Other things that are patriotic: pedophilia (kids have the right to consent), animal fucking (it is my animal, after all, and it is part of the non-aggression principle or something), and theft of things that aren't secured (should properly nail down anything you don't want stolen).

So every comedian on earth has some severe mental instability; all satire writers living or dead and anyone who attended elementary school in their life is mentally unstable. Yep, that is exactly how it is laid out in the DSM IV.
Maybe you could provide some links to the concept that making fun of anything makes you mentally unstable? How about some backing for the idea that an employer would completely lose respect for you because you make fun of idiotic cult devotees such as yourself? I suppose that would be true if the employer is in another ponzi-cult, like Vemma, CutCo or Amway. 
You also understand it undermines your point a little bit when you hyperbolically make shit up about associated psychological effects of making a joke about someone, because that is effectively doing exactly what your are trying to take a stand against?

Secondarily, why not put a small Raspberry Pi terminal attached to a turnstyle at your entryway, this way your radiant personality (that includes charging your friends for drinks) can generate ancillary income via all the loads of people that completely fail to show up. It is a win-win.
Next step is a large LCD television with loops spreading the Good News from our friends at Butterfly Labs, the homeboy Karpeles, his waifu Andrea or whatever that vapid annoying broad's name is, and other luminaries and captains of industry. If there is one thing people adore ASIDE from being charged for liquids at a friend's house, it is being forcefully proselytized to about your insane FunBuxx. 
This is without them them having brought it up of course, and possibly with them having asked for you to "please lay off pumping your ponzified Monopoly money or digital Chuckie Cheeze tokens or whatever." You know that if they only understood the truth, they could really benefit from the inability to be protected from fraud, the fun of investing with the rare ability to lose 75% of in one short year, or the possibility of losing literally all of it if you get involved with the wrong wallet or "bank."

I think it is because your post is absurd. The amount of additional income that Bitcoin brings in is minimal at best, and you are concerned about the fact that merchants want to actually receive the funds you spend?
They should apparently hold the Bitcoins so you can see your "currency," which is also apparently an investment for you that everyone should treat delicately, inflate in value for your sake. While they are doing their duty to your portfolio, why not offer a discount in addition to thank you for allowing these merchants to help you get to the moon? It is only fair.

If only I had gotten in on these gravy trains, I would have nearly a third of all the money that I hadn't lost in the eight or ten major scams. From those, I would have none of my money. How do you think it feels to look at my bank account and realize I could have bought in with Dollar Cost Averaging around $2000 or more, including scam losses? It is heartbreaking.

Libertarians are the most self-absorbed, entitled group of fuckwits I can think of. Go live in an unclaimed woods, outside of borders then. Or just collect your income in bitcoin and wait for prison, you deserve it because you really ARE stealing then.

So now you just "think" it is a sign. You are dumber than a fucking fencepost, brother. You lack ANY self awareness. The posts you are making here, the cult insanity, the complete disconnect, that is exactly what Buttcoin makes fun of. You are literally exemplifying and embodying the ethos of the entire sub, while trying to decry it. 
The irony is potent here, and your shortsighted inability to understand what we are REALLY making fun of is just one great example of why Buttcoin is so funny. If you think anyone spends "hours" a day on Buttcoin you are nuts, most people probably spend between 5 and 20 minutes and get a dose of humor bigger than any other sub. On the other hand, BitCoin lunatics really do spend hours making log charts and setting up alts to lie and pump about how "their bank manager is terrified" or some other equally hilarious shit. 
You are like an Escher painting folding in on itself with how nuts you are about some satire sub, and how perfectly you embody the subject of said satire. Never change, little buddy. We need you.

I don't even disagree with you on this point. Of course insurance companies fight to keep any money they can, they are fucking vultures in many cases. However, the answer doesn't seem to me to be "stick it to them every time you can, whether the insured needs a new roof/siding or not. Even if they have one shingle or a few dents in their siding."
That seems like both you and the insurance company are in the wrong, and in this case the only one I know FOR SURE is in the wrong is you, based on your own statements.

Yeah Bitcoin is just as useful as email, no additional utility in instant communication all over the planet. Compared to a shitty value storage medium with zero consumer protection and three times as many scams as actual uses, it pales in comparison.

Your entire life has been possible because of tax revenue. Hospitals and roads and schools and police and fire and water and the economy and military protection. 
The country you stand in exists because of tax revenue. If you want to dodge "theft,"  you pathetic misfit, then leave and go live in the wilderness of unclaimed land. Outside the borders of nations. How you can justify dodging imagined "theft" by stealing yourself is just so absurd and shallow. You are not as deep a thinker as you imagine yourself, you are a craven simpleton. 
Alternatively, just don't work. Work is not required. Go forage and live off the land. You choose to work, then choose to steal by depriving the government you benefit from of your tax revenue. I get that you are really a sixteen  year old who is hated by all his peers, but play along. 
If you really think that the government will sit back while you accept wages in bitcoin on some future date, without putting you in pound-me-in-the-ass federal prison, then do it. I hope you do because it would teach you a quick lesson, you dimwitted thief.

The economy blew up in 2008, leaving the world in a post-apocalyptic hellscape where dollars and Euros were no more, and roving bands of organ thieves and murder enthusiasts ran the streets.
Cannibalism was the lucky way out, but for most, it was rape-cannibalism that would prove to be their end. Then, the Bitcoin whitepaper was published, and all was saved. Cannibals and stab-hobbyists, meth-addled body modifcation addicts, and human-crocodile hybrids renounced their ways and converted to the wisdom that is the Blockchain.

The banner at the top of this page is hilarious, and the argument that this service and coin mixing are the solution to the problems mentioned is even more so. 
Bitcoin is an idea, the idea that all men are created equal and can fall for the same ponzi scheme. If they are lucky, 70% of their investment can evaporate in 12 short months (beat that, Vemma). When they have legitimate concerns about privacy and anonymity, they will be referred to services run by unknown charlatans, many that are defunct and inoperable, others that are compromised by the NSA and charge exorbitant fees.

In addition, $80k? There are 3200 subscribers to so JUST running the buttcoin subreddit costs a quarter billion dollars. For that amount of cash, the government could sink and destroy bitcoin anonymously in a matter of days. 
You people are so delusional. Could it possibly be that THIS stuff, where you are sure the government cares enough (or even NOTICES bitcoin) to the point where they are employing 3200 people in secret bunkers, is just hilarious beyond words? The cult rhetoric and insane conspiracy creeps up as the price rockets down. This subreddit and buttcoin are funnier than any website on the internet, and it is all thanks to your insane paranoia and the ludicrous amount of bad actors in the community.

I am not sure who is the butthurt party in this case. Maybe you don't know either? Buttcoin is about the opposing message to the insane, cult-level optimism-only pump attempts that pervade this sub.
We are not butthurt about anything, and the fact that people seriously try to claim we are pretty despondent about not losing 60% of our investment in the last year are only reinforcing our point. I think cryptocurrency has a cool future, maybe not BitCoin necessarily due to the drawbacks. The insane bullishness over every news story and bump in the road, no matter how drastic, is the source of our enjoyment.

No one in the respected business community would ever base the possible value or implementation of a currency off of something completely unrelated. Firstly, the company is a going concern with profits and expenses, and BitCoin is none of these things. Secondly, are you thinking that because BerkShire Hathaway is a company and they are worth ~$480 billion that somehow a digital currency is just bound to be bigger because, well, ANY company can use BitCoin? That is the shoddiest, laziest fucking argument I have ever heard anyone make about BitCoin, and that is a massive undertaking.

When have you heard of a credit card costing thousands of people a half a BILLION dollars total? 
The amount of dollars scammed versus the amount of bitcoin actually used for commerce paints an utterly damning portrait.

Is there anything on the horizon in Bitcoin or any crypto that will reduce all this to a few steps? 
I ask because I am interested in the concept, have bought bitcoins to purchase.... some items before, and it seems like there is actually money and progress to be made. Some kind of software/hardware solution that condenses all this down to a couple steps and a cheap, secure device, I guess is what I am wondering about. Because honestly, doing this to avoid a single wire transfer, when you have the possibility of losing a chunk of your housing down payment, seems pretty silly to me.

Because we don't have a violent warlord terrorizing us, raping us, stealing our money when he wants. We know the rules, we know our tax rate, we know that there is someone to save us.
I understand you will say that there is no difference, and I understand that is because you are an absolutely loathsome and stupid reductionist without a shred of logic. I say to you: go, leave. If it is so terrible here, go find your paradise of liberty. Go make it, because you keep on going on about how incredibly productive you are. Just because you can play word-games like a fucking five year old, it doesn't change the fact that our lives are much better than Rwanda, Somalia, and many other countries with hands-off governments and little intervention. I would ask if you are too stupid to see that, but I already know the answer.
For now, I will just take an incredible amount of comfort knowing that the state coerces you to live my way, uses violence to ensure you will never have yours, and that it will be like that for the foreseeable future. Why not take all your mentally-fifteen morally bankrupt reductionist idiot neckbeard compatriots and just fucking leave already?
You will never, ever, EVER get the feudalistic corporate nightmare that you want in this country. Go get your money stolen in Galt's Gulch by and with all the other immoral fuckwits and leave us in the loving embrace of the State.

Yeah, of course. MANY times. Cops have helped me recover property from a burglary. I have dealt with dozens of cops, and even been let go for minor drug offenses. A cop gave me back a film canister of LSD one time and told me to clean my life up and stop fucking around. I also made friends with several drug squad members because a few of my friends got busted pretty often (they were out of control) around my house.
If all you do is stay inside, live in a basment, and read Reddit articles about police brutality, then your perception is deeply warped. The police have problems, and the stuff over the last 18 months has illustrated that. Body cameras should be a thing.
Every cop is not your enemy, and in fact, most of them are polite if you are polite to them. I understand that is hard for defiant autist neckbeards such as MeanOfPhidias, but it can be done.
 
The thing that neckbeards don't seem to understand is that, if you want to debate someone, you have to share common ground and a few common points. Saying that all cops are violent warlords and tax is theft and taxes are RAPE is just going to make 95% of people dismiss EVERYTHING you say. Your extremist bullshit doesn't make it possible to have a reasoned debate, because you sound fucking nuts.
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:04:30

The worst case scenario is a violent warlord ruling over whatever area he can control, with rape squads and murderers and mercenaries for hire helping him. He would rule with impunity, there would be no one to stop him, and he could make up the "rules" as he went along.
You are such a simpleton that you can't even think up to the FIRST logical conclusion, can you? Look at any place where government is neutered or near non-existent and you see warlords, gang rule, horrible atrocities, and then governments from other nations have to step in and stop it. That's because people with little empathy have guns, and they have no reason not to use them.
No one wants your shitty idea of society, and no one ever will.
The best thing about this is that you will forever feel your impotent rage about this issue, and you will never, ever get any satisfaction or see your insane little ideas put into practice anywhere but maybe Somalia and Gult's Gulch. It feels good to be a statist, because reality agrees with my ideals quite often. It's not perfect, but at least I am not opposed to literally every single thing I see and hear like you are. It must be painful.
Being a morality-free neckbeard ancap on the internet accomplishes nothing. If anything, things are progressing nicely towards more progressive, european ideals here in America. It makes me laugh to think about how frustrating that must be for you. Enjoy your basement, and keep with that failed, unrealistic ideology... it's working out great for you.

THEY DID NOT SENTENCE HIM TO THE MURDERS.
They used the fact that he didn't even CONTEST that he had done them, and in fact said that the evidence was him "roleplaying" (basically admitting he did it) to shape the sentences for the other crimes. He will be tried for the murders in Baltimore; it's already under way.
When I "roleplay," I very rarely wire and send in Bitcoin $650k dollars and ask for photo evidence of the crimes. I usually don't write down my roleplaying scenarios in the journal containing my real day-to-day activities, nor do I just act like they really happened and never break character ever.
How hard is this to understand? He as much as admitted that he had them attempt-murdered, he wasn't sentenced for having done so yet, it was just a consideration when sentencing his other crimes. It painted a much more clear picture of how pathological he was: he was willing to kill innocent ROOMMATES of people that blackmailed him for no reason. He wanted a man tortured for information and believed he was TORTURED TO DEATH. 
Don't you think these facts, undisputed by his OWN defense, are kind of relevant? I can only hope you are fifteen or have oppositional defiance disorder, because otherwise this is just some dumb shit to be arguing about

@_date: 2014-12-09 23:03:59
The Fed definitely sets rates. How would inflation set the rates, do banks just consult the inflation for the day to determine how much their money costs? 
The Fed determines how much base interest rates are, and other rates are pegged to that. Inflation is determined by how much new money is printed, and how that effects overall supply. The two are related but one doesn't decide the other completely.

He hasn't been sentenced for those crimes, and it's not entrapment when you SEEK someone out to help you kill your former friends. He asked several times if Ross was sure that he wanted these people dead, if he wanted the innocent roommates dead, if he wanted the guy tortured before death to get information. MANY times, on record, in various ways.
Ross was VERY certain. 
I know you have no fucking idea what the legal standard for entrapment is, because you sound like a complete and total moron, but that's not it. Not even close. Even if it were... Ross didn't dispute he agreed to the hits, nor that he sent the money. He tried to claim it was "roleplaying." Yeah, dude, I always spend three-quarters of a million dollars on roleplaying, ask for photo evidence of the "fake murders," and then I never break character again for twelve months while carefully transcribing the information in my journal where I keep my real-life happenings.
The great thing about this is, no matter how many uninformed mouth-breathing neckbeards try to equivocate, make excuses, and dodge the truth... justice has been served here.

Given the history of the sperg-shekel economy over just the last few years versus the relatively stable and secure, easy-to-use dollar over the last several hundred, I am going to go ahead and say that the bitcoin "top minds" just might leave something lacking.
Aside from losing your money in exchange "hacks" and failures, losing seventy percent of your value in a year, inability to handle more than 3 - 7 transactions a second, absurdly slow confirmation times, and no consumer protections while still charging fees, a dozen other problems, and the community, you are right. Bitcoin is superior.

zee4da would never act against his self interest by failing to send out a product he already has full payment for. Libertarians are inherently of an almost perfect moral character, hence their belief that there is no need for the jackbooted thugs of government. Their projection of any hypothetical actor's behavior is like something out of the Bible (the good parts) and it's tough for them to imagine someone taking advantage of someone else. 
This is only further entrenched in their minds by the complete lack of uncouth or illegal behavior in their community, so they are like lambs to the slaughter. Imagine if your parents were neckbeards that never taught you that stealing was wrong or what it even was, but constantly harped on you to avoid getting your shit stolen (because that was clearly your own lack of preparedness). That's a microcosm of the Butt-munity.

When I was thirteen years old, there were email groups on AOL that claimed to be hackers/"carders," and they advertised a ridiculously discounted bill of goods such as dual-processor Pentium Pro motherboards with CPU and memory included, absurd monitors and televisions, game consoles, etc.
Being the stupid, greedy, overzealous, headstrong, and ridiculously overconfident teen that I was, I sent them a money order for $450. That was supposedly payment for an order consisting of one of those dual-cpu board/RAM/CPU pair combos, which would have put me in the top ten supercomputers in the planet at the time. Strangely, they stopped responding to my emails shortly after the money order had arrived at their extremely-real and totally-reliable headquarters.

Incredible neckbeard singularity spotted off starboard. I can barely escape the pull of its flaxen, amber chin stubs even with full engine power... if we push the core any further, we will be exceeding Fedoral limits

But they must be processing literally DOZENS of dollars for Microsoft, and getting a sweet cut of that (perhaps upwards of a dollar). Then keep in mind that neckbeard pesos are making huge strides in price increase (negative 80 percent in the last twelve months) and you have a recipe for a hot business model!

So you are saying that history is repeating itself... in the future? Fucking awesome. 
Or are you saying that it is repeating itself in the specific way of "it is not repeating itself." Either of these propositions is fascinating to me
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:18:24
Yeah, the three people that showed up from Buttcoin somehow managed to subvert your entire sub's opinions, given that you are 50x as large. OR could it be that this is a terrible thing to do to your kids when they expect to find cash and candy, and instead find neckbeard pesos everywhere they look... and even realizes it.

How did the government manage to get all those bitcoins they put on auction, then? That seems a lot like confiscating, and they are definitely a third party.
In addition, don't third parties like hackers make off with coins quite frequently? How about Ryan Kennedy, or Karpeles, or other hackers/scammers? They are a third party, they confiscate the shit out of people's coins, and they are the reason that 'sorry for your loss' has become a pretty hilarious catchphrase.
In addition, if the gubbermint wanted to "censor" bitcoins, they could do it very easily through cooperation with exchanges, banks as the source of funds, and even ISPs if they really wanted to get technical about it. So how is bitcoin secure from confiscation or censor proof, when it absolutely isn't?
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:57:10
Yeah, they should really have functional markets and economies in fucking prison. They can just tuck their PrisonBucks into the wallet that all prisoners carry, and use it to buy all the goods and services that prisoners go out into the wider world to buy.

There's no need to lie, Bitcoin is the only currency with the power of ChargeBack technology. It is in the whitepaper (have you read the whitepaper?)
As soon as people find out about the incredible convenience of chargebacks, it's all over for fiat (aka Shiat, right?), and the lunar lander will be coming in for a soft landing on the sea of tranquility. ChargeBacks, a vital part of Fundamentals™, you heard it here first folks.

Dude, you have no idea what you are talking about. People are not going to wait an hour to post a comment, or several minutes to be served a comment page. The blockchain solves zero problems that the site has. It could be done with a simple distributed P2P protocol if you wanted, you just think that throwing in buzzwords makes it better.

So you mean like paying Dog the Bounty Hunter (or the darknet equivalent) some bitcoins to go bag-and-tag that wacky Russian ponzi creator? 
You don't mention him being actually charged with anything or even what crime you think he SHOULD be charged with, so I will just assume you want to send private citizens to kidnap another private citizen. This, in your mind, will somehow vastly improve the image of bitcoin as a cryptocurrency.
Hmmm... yeah, that checks out on all fronts. You have the go ahead from Citi psy-ops to set up a .onion private server to collect the funds in escrow. Then we will send out some Soldier of Fortune types to snatch him in the middle of the night and force him to stand trial before an anarcho-capitalist corporate court (on some charges to be determined at a later date, I suppose. Don't worry about it, you are an ideas guy, not an implementation guy, I can tell).
Man, this is some real "Zero Dark Thirty"-type shit here, it's pretty exciting to just set up your own espionage operations internationally without the slightest regard for human rights or international law. Let's hope it goes just as smoothly as your post predicted, I'd hate to think there was something we failed to think of!

Don't let rampant security holes at every exchange, massive losses of funds, and constant threat of total collapse jade you or make you change your idea of "trustworthy" financial instruments. That is just profoundly foolish.
Bitcoin needs your belief, your faith, and your love. It needs it whether you lose all your money or not (you will, though). How can bitcoin survive without you throwing good money after bad constantly and without fail?
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:14:11
Yeah, it is the fiat people who are the religious zealots, whereas Bitcoin is a community of reasonable and well-grounded thought.

Still, he is one of the most prolific names out there in the darknet murder-for-hire game, even if he was doing it as part extortion and part undercover deception. He probably still knows a guy, and he could sure use the money for the legal fees.
Either that, or you could provide him with a fresh prosecutorial bargaining chip in the form of somebody to serve up and snitch on. Hit him up, I am sure it would work out AT LEAST as well as it did for ol' Ross Ulbricht

You'll have to exchange it for Paycoin first, then use Josh Garza's experimental Paycoin-to-Tire-Money converter. Currently, it works about 10% of the time, and sometimes it ends up eating your whole Paycoin and Bitcoin wallet, sending them to Garza.

None of those companies accept Bitcoin, they work with a company that allows them to never have to see a single satoshi. None of them have held so much as a single bitcoin, ever. It's a publicity stunt, and one that has been shown to be pretty ineffective if "Bitcoin Black Friday" is any indication (it is).
It is also funny that you are implying that having your credit card "hacked" is a disaster, as opposed to the ever-consumer-friendly digital asspennies. Waiting a few days for a card is really a hassle compared to getting Goxed or the many dozens of other scams posted monthly that result in complete losses of funds with no recourse.

If there was ever an argument against life-extension technology, it is the fact that it would be offered to people that believe in nonsense. So you believe that somehow you won't be able to obtain immortality pills if you don't have digital ass-pennies?
Where is the evidence for this? Considering that the technology doesn't exist, and Bitcoin isn't accepted by a single medical institution or doctor of any kind anywhere on the planet... maybe you are reaching a bit? I, for one, think that they should offer immortality only to those with an uber-rare beanie baby.

Nothing draws supporters or shows the legitimacy of your claims quite like accusing everyone of being a paid shill, calling everyone but yourself fucking stupid, and telling those of dissenting opinions that they disgust you. 
It's the written equivalent of wearing a tinfoil hat: an instant sign of well-thought-out argumentation and deep understanding of the issues.

People have perverted the word "whitepaper" to the point that it means virtually nothing at this point. AmericanPegasus' whitepaper is basically just him spouting off ideas, this guy's whitepaper is just as silly.

We cannot blame the tech that makes it possible!
It is entirely the victims' fault, how can you statists not see this!!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:10:49
Are you arguing that Bitcoin is used for criminal enterprise, lacks chargebacks, has fees paid by the user, attracts LEO attention, and has a lot of instances of theft and fraud? Those things are all entirely true.
There is no agenda here. If you think the bitcoin wiki is going to say "cheep coinz now, get in before the dollar collapses or you are a statist shill," you might be disappointed. It explains the uses, the tech, and the many drawbacks. How is that not fair? At least they don't have a section where they list the neckbeard peso/autism shekel euphemisms.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:26:15
This is one of the big problems with thinkers in the bitcoin userspace: "we will fix that later." Making announcements for something that people have lusted after for 30 years requires more than a pre-pre-pre-alpha "whitepaper" that is basically just a bunch of lofty promises.
It's good to have high aspirations, but claiming to solve one of the biggest problems in computing EVER takes a bit more than a bunch of buzzwords.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:29:46
So every keystroke, as the computer makes changes to the stack, needs to be verified and might take between one and three hours? That sounds ideal.
