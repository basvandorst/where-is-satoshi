That said, if no rejiggered transactions show up on the network within a few seconds of the original going out, you can be confident that the original is going to take precedence, right? So unless the attacker is mining his own blocks, it would be difficult to exploit this without being detected, as long as the software is looking for this.

That's a good point. I can think of a couple limitations:
- It only works if (everyone thinks that) the market will punish the price by more than 2x. That sounds obvious now, but will it always be obvious?
- Some altcoins (Namecoin maybe?) are valuable for things besides their exchange rate, so the attitude of the market might not be a deterrent there.

It's not quite fair to compare the durability of *one* paper wallet to *multiple* electronic wallets :) That said, it's easy to underestimate the durability of paper. If you put a printed piece of paper in your dresser drawer, and your house doesn't burn down, that paper will still be there in 100 years. You can't say that about most electronic storage. Not only does the material degrade over just a few years, but you also have to worry about whether hardware will be compatible that far in the future. Will anyone still be using USB? God I hope not.

You're right. The efficiency of the new price doesn't follow from trades that would've happened anyway. For those trades, the price change just means a transfer from the guy who liked the old price to the guy who likes the new one. The efficiency comes from trades that would not have happened otherwise. A higher price brings sellers into the market who weren't interested in selling before, and vice versa.

The legal structures around telecom are extremely complicated. They go back more than a century, including decades of the government-sponsored AT&amp;T monopoly. It's anyone's guess what phone and cable companies would look like today without these rules.
It's also not clear what a level playing field for data would mean. It's a simple fact that talking to servers close to me is going to be faster than talking to servers far away. That means that companies who can afford to buy a bunch of machines all over the world are going to get faster connections for their users than companies who can't. That much will never change.

It makes confirmation times more consistent. Sometimes we go an entire hour without a new block. With 10x as many blocks, that would be much less likely.
There are also [some double spend attacks]( that don't work on 1-confirmation transactions, even if that confirmation is weaker than today's. Quicker confirmation times would make it easier to guard against those attacks for merchants who might need to.

I think "only worth what people are willing to sell you for them" is true of both btc and dollars (since 1963?), since there's no one who promises to accept any particular exchange rate in the future for either of them.

Having more than half the power of the network means that you, by yourself, will generate a longer blockchain than everyone else. You can control the transactions that make it into your version of the blockchain, and then publish it whenever you see fit. Legitimate clients will accept yours over the "real" one because of the length (or technically I think, the difficulty). Depending on which transactions you included, that means you can make the network forget about transactions everyone thought were confirmed.
There's some randomness involved, like you mentioned, but if you wait long enough your chain will always grow longer than the "real" one. This is very different from having, say, 10% of the network. There you'd occasionally be able to surprise everyone with a few of your own blocks, but you'd have to act immediately when you mined them, and you wouldn't be able to predict the timing.
The main thing you can't do even with 51% is spend other people's coins, because you don't have their private keys. You could only try to double spend your own, or maybe prevent others from spending.

Yes, but they could ruin bitcoin more cheaply by just criminalizing it, or by buying a lot of mining hardware and messing with the blockchain.

No. Yet.
Cryptography is not forever. You have to think of crypto in terms of the *probable number of years of security* it buys you, because your messages will stick around forever while computing gets faster and faster. Flaws in algorithms get discovered all the time, and very few things are provably secure.* The best we can do is to say we don't *think* there's an easy way to reverse SHA2 or factor big numbers. But we used to think that about MD5, and now we know it's broken. Flaws in implementations are even more common; we just found a big one on Android this month. And if nothing else, quantum computers might eventually break the ECDSA algorithm that bitcoin relies on: 
If bitcoin itself is still around in 20 or 30 years, it will have to transition to the new algorithms people are using then. There might be mistakes. The breaks could happen before anyone can transition. There is real risk something will go terribly wrong, as there is with any currency or investment. Please don't spread the wrong impression.

I'm just skimming these articles, but this story sounds pretty different from Cyprus. Cyprus is taking *bank deposits*, which is very scary to everyone involved, because the whole point of banks is that you put money there so no one will take it. Poland, though, is messing with Polish government bonds. The money you make on bonds from less-than-perfectly-creditworthy governments reflects the risk you assume, that that government could just stop paying. So it isn't as shocking when bondholders lose money.
That said, it sounds like a lot of pensioners who didn't have much of a choice might get hurt, and that sucks.

As shwag mentioned, the thing that gets published is your randomly-generated wallet address. There's usually nothing connecting that address back to you. Some features in the bitcoin client (like sending back change from a transaction) are specifically designed to make addresses even harder to track. There are also mixing services that try to do more. It's not perfect anonymity, but it's probably better than anything else.
Making bitcoin illegal would stop legitimate businesses from using it, though, which would make bitcoin useless to most ordinary people. That would suck. A government could also buy enough hash power to take 51% of the network, and then destroy trust in the currency.

Another way to describe the same equivalence is, if you're going to buy something for $20, why not pay in bitcoin and then buy $20 worth of bitcoin at the same time to keep your investment holdings unchanged?

No, I don't think it applies to any currency, not according to the very specific rules of Wikipedia. Bitcoin is mentioned in conjunction with online crime by most of the sources that describe it, in a way that dollars and euros and yen are not. It doesn't matter that the sources *could* have made similar comments about other currencies. When it comes to subjective topics like this, the arbiter of truth in Wikipedia is *the way the topic is actually discussed by reputable sources*.
Rules like this are really important on Wikipedia. It's how they manage articles like "evolution" and "homosexuality". It's how they weed out problem editors like the Church of Scientology, not because they're wrong, but because they don't follow the rules. *After* bitcoin is more successful and broadly supported, the rules will make sure that that gets reflected in the article.

I think you can do it after a few seconds with pretty high confidence as long as your monitoring the network for double spends. Once you're sure that all the big miners have your transaction, and you still haven't seen a double spend attempt, then it shouldn't be possible unless an evil miner is specifically working on a block to defraud you. Pretty unlikely for ordinary small transactions.

To summarize what a lot of other people are pointing out, there are different kinds of double spending attacks. Many of them require the spender to be able to mine his own blocks, which would be totally impractical for scamming on small purchases. The ones that don't require mining can usually be detected by listening for bad transactions on the network for a few seconds, depending on how safe you want to be. In short, zero-confirmation transactions will probably be safe enough for most day-to-day use.

No, markets are deeply unpredictable in an important way. If you could predict a future price that was higher than the current one, you'd want to buy until you pushed the market into line with your prediction. Everyone has an incentive to do that, so current prices tend to reflect everyone's average best guess about what the future price will be. The current price of bitcoin is already based on everyone's expectations that demand will rise in the future. If demand rises in line with expectations, the price won't move. Only if demand *exceeds expectations* will the price rise further. Past evidence can't easily tell us whether we'll exceed expectations, because past evidence is exactly how those expectations were formed. And it's actually worse than that, because there's no way for us to ask what the market's expectations really are.

If you're in the US, a lot of people use Coinbase. Their flow is pretty self-explanatory; you connect your bank account like you would with PayPal. They can also send bitcoins to an email address.
In Europe, a lot of people use BitStamp, which works well with SEPA banks. That's more of an exchange, with fancy features like "limit orders" that you might be familiar with from stock trading.
Those are the two I'm most familiar with, anyway. Any hosted wallet will let you send bitcoins to a local wallet address if you want to hold them yourself. This is a lot of fun to play with with small amounts of money, but be careful with large amounts until you're more familiar with the software.
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:48:39
Any of the clients that run on your computer will create a wallet file for you (in their own special format) that stores your list of addresses. IMPORTANTLY, they will also help you encrypt this file, to keep anyone who might break into your machine from easily stealing your coins. However, they won't back up this file for you, so you'll need to make sure to do that yourself. Paper backups are very popular.
Any hosted wallet site will let you sent bitcoins to your local wallet, yes. Definitely give that a try with small amounts of money, just to see how it works. But I wouldn't recommend it for large amounts of money as a beginner, since there are lots of ways to accidentally lose/destroy/forget the password to your local wallet.

Bfgminer has a "--coinbase-address" flag, which is probably where you want to supply this address. NOTE that I've never tried this myself, and I don't know how you should test this to make sure it's doing the right thing. Be careful.

Part of the problem here is that the term "wallet" is overloaded. See  On that site, they mean choose your *client*, like the software you run on your computer. But in other places, like when you talk about the long strings of characters that you're sending money to, "wallet" can mean *address*. Or, kind of in the middle, it can mean the set of usually many different addresses that most clients use to do transactions and hold your bitcoins.

**Edit:** Aaaaaand I was totally wrong, as pointed out. I emailed Alan Reiner (the main developer of Armory) to ask about this, and he got back to me really quickly:




**My original, terrible comment:**
I don't think any of the previous comments are explaining this correctly. Here's my understanding of how it works, or at least how it might work, since I'm not really familiar with Armory.
When your offline wallet is first created, you generate a few hundred(?) different public/private addresses. Then when you create the watch-only wallet, it takes just the public keys. It might look like it's creating new public keys for you when you use it, but actually it's just taking them out of this big list that it saved at the beginning. You're right that if the watch-only wallet were generating new private keys, it would then be possible to steal them, which would defeat the whole point of having a watch-only wallet. I suspect if you kept creating new public keys over and over, eventually you'd run out and hit an error message. But I got up to 200 when I tried just now, so I'm not sure :p
Quick side note, your description of how public key creation works isn't *necessarily* accurate. Take a look at  The RSA public key is actually generated first, it turns out. I think bitcoin uses a different signing algorithm though (ECDSA?).

Listing "increased impulse buying" as a downside to credit cards sounds a little random to me. Couldn't you have said the same thing about every new form of payment or credit?
That said, it's interesting to think that the biggest payment revolution of the 20th century was also a credit revolution.

Many important caveats:
* Even if you were certain of a future value, you don't know enough to invest unless you know *how long* it will take to get there.
* Even if we believe in the future of cryptocurrency, that might not justify a bitcoin investment in particular. Bitcoin could have competition, or an unforseen security flaw, or regulatory problems that last a long time.
Not saying doom and gloom, just that investing is hard, and everyone needs to be careful.

It takes a substantial amount of effort to do a double spend, even when the recipient is willing to accept 0-confirmation transactions. Most brick-and-mortar shops really have nothing to worry about, plus their sales aren't anonymous to begin with.

Yes that kinda sorta could happen in theory, but the way hash targets work, one additional leading zero requires 10 times more work to find. Take a look at the current target:  To run out of leading zeros, you'd have to have something like 10^45 times more computational power in the network. That's just not going to happen. (Carl Sagan could jump in here and explain that you'd need an ASIC for every molecule of water in the oceans, or whatever.) And if it did happen, that would mean that people were generating full SHA256 collisions, and we'd need a new hash function anyway.

If bitcoin hasn't been replaced or evolved by then, the assumption is that fees will rise to cover the costs. But fees may not need to rise much if usage expands dramatically. In fact, if the exchange rate goes up in response to growing demand, the fees might actually need to be reduced.

I tried day trading with a few hundred bucks worth of bitcoin last month. I lost a little money, but I learned a lot about markets and uncertainty. Really important lessons, and I'm glad I got them cheap. Back to index funds for me :)

It definitely depends on who you're talking to. Here are my thoughts:
Bitcoin is a digital way to hold and send money, kind like PayPal or WoW gold. The big difference is that bitcoin doesn't rely on any company or government to manage accounts. That's why it's become so popular, because using bitcoin doesn't mean trusting any particular person to hold your money. You only need to trust the software -- or at least all the very smart people who've already audited it.
The more technical side:
Most of how bitcoin works is based on public key cryptography, which is very common in the computer world. It's the same technology behind the https:// sites that you visit in your browser. This solves the basic problem of making sure that money can only be spent by the person who owns it. The inner guts of bitcoin -- the "blockchain" -- is actually designed to solve a much more subtle problem: how to get everyone on the network to agree on what to do when two transactions try to spend the same money. (Remember how bitcoin doesn't rely on central servers anywhere? That means there's no central decision maker either. Getting everyone to agree becomes very tricky.) The creator of bitcoin also used the blockchain to solve another subtle problem: how to distribute new bitcoins in a way that everyone can agree is fair. That's where we get the concept of "mining" blocks.

I'm not sure how to put an absolute number on it, but I'll assume you meant how safe relative to other web wallets or private wallets.
Most web wallets are probably more secure in practice than most private wallets. There are lots of ways for a less-than-expert user to either lose his bitcoins or get them stolen. So while a pristine paper wallet with multiple backups might be theoretically more secure than a web wallet, you lose a lot of that security by doing things like typing your password on a computer that's touched the internet.
In a similar sense, blockchain.info might be theoretically more secure than other web wallets in the sense of never storing your password, but that also exposes you to the very common risk of losing your password. Even if you're sure you'll never forget it, did you remember to leave your password in your will for your family, in case you die unexpectedly? There are lots of practical situations where you will be thankful for a maybe-less-secure web wallet where a human on the other end can actually help you.
So I guess my tldr is: more secure against attacks, but less secure against mistakes.

I like this way of putting it. Bitcoin has taught us that "intrinsic value" shouldn't be part of the definition of what a currency is. But "stable store of value over time" probably should be part of the definition.

Much like every other form of money in the world today.

Coinbase you might think of as the PayPal of bitcoin. You register your bank account with them, and they let you buy and sell bitcoins, store your bitcoins on their servers, and send/receive them to/from any other bitcoin wallet. And like PayPal, this means that you're trusting Coinbase with some amount of your money.
Blockchain.info is more like the bitcoin clients that run on your machine, except it happens to run in the browser. It's only for sending/receiving bitcoins, no buying or selling with dollars. They do store your wallet on their servers, but they store it in such a way that it's unreadable without your password, and it's only ever opened inside your browser. You still have to trust that they're doing what they say they are, but in theory that could make your bitcoins more secure than on Coinbase. (Like the difference between a regular bank account and a safe deposit box.) One downside is that if you lose your password, your money is lost forever, and by design there's nothing that Blockchain.info can do to help you.
Blockchain.info also has a cool search feature that you can use to see details of any wallet, transaction, or block. You don't need an account to use it.

If your number of transactions is small, you can just tell users who want to use bitcoin to email you. Then you can send them a wallet address for payment, using whatever bitcoin wallet or service you like. If you want to actually do commerce on your website with bitcoin, mattmcegg mentioned BitPay, and there's also Coinbase.

The reason for all the trouble, for both PayPal and Coinbase, is bank fraud. Here's just one example from earlier today: 
@_date: 2013-08-13 02:20:45
Yeah, everything here is probabilistic. But in the realm of cryptography, lots of things work like that. Your private key, for example, is basically just a big random number. What stops you from generating the same key as me? Nothing really, except that it'll probably never happen. For sufficiently strong definitions of "probably", that's good enough.

Thanks mods!

Yes, good point. For that matter, they could also just change their policies without telling anyone, while electrum would at least need you to download a new client (that other users would presumably inspect).

Take a look here: 
Expect the transaction to take 3-4 days. Your bank probably debited your account immediately, but it will take those 3-4 days before Coinbase actually receives your funds. This is the primitive banking system that we're all looking forward to replacing.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:49:37
Yes. Then the argument becomes "I don't spend bitcoin because I don't want to pay exchange fees," which is perfectly reasonable. It's the particular idea of wanting to hold on to your investment, which isn't coherent.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:51:21
I don't think this is correct. The problem with moving from an unencrypted wallet to an encrypted one is that any *old copies* of your wallet are still unprotected. If an attacker finds one of those, in your backups for example, the contents are still readable without a password like they always were. There's nothing inherently unsafe about continuing to use the same addresses, if you're sure you don't have any unprotected wallets lying around. The benefit of generating a new address after you encrypt your wallet is that you can be absolutely certain there aren't unprotected copies anywhere.

The rules are partly about trying to be unbiased, but even more important, they're also about resolving disputes between editors who are biased in different ways.

Agreed on checking out the more conventional options. Bitcoin fees are low, but if you're converting back and forth multiple times it might eat up the savings you're getting. Note that on top of the 1% + $0.15 or whatever in conversion fees at each end, you'll be paying the "bid/ask spread" (the difference between the buying and selling prices).
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:12:04
Agreed.
