@_date: 2018-05-27 01:05:21
85% btc dominance at start of 2017, and it’s 38% average in 2018
Clear indication that altcoins are now a popular money maker which gives btc a more popular use case

Bubbles really help the economy, the smart and rich can sell high and buy more capital at a lower point which creates more push for it to go higher next time

Bitcoin mining blocks half every 4 years, so when this cycle happens everyone buys and hodls until a boom
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:53:17
Your not the first or the last, everyone that sold bitcoin from years 2009-2016 are kicking themselves,
I had 3btc and sold for $750 each in 2016.
Now I’ve spent 6k just to buy 0.35 in 2018

The fact that btc is still strong even after these power house comments, gives me faith in the future of btc.
Wouldn’t be surprised if they just causing fud so they can buy more cheap btc
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:50:05
You just gotta rebuild again, learn from your mistake. Never sell BTC. It’s either going to boom or crash. Either your in or out 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:03:03
altcoins/shitcoins just help big players generate more btc 
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:39:00

Bitcoin is the gold, I reckon other coins will be used as currency such as dash/Litecoin

@_date: 2018-02-15 05:57:49

@_date: 2018-03-27 04:42:42
