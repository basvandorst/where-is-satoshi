That doesn't make it a scam, yet.

Ok I'm starting to get a better picture of it. But can you elaborate how to find such a hash? What space do I have to search? And I assume that to find the next block it depends on the last somehow? Basically, how do I know that I found one?

Interesting. If they approve it, would it be like a bitcoin bank then?

Ok cool. So the full-nodes are also the mining nodes, right?

I could imagine that the small silver particles that are left on the qr code might screw up the detection. Or is it robust against it?

Just like they want to fuck our car industry.

Are they storing the whole documents in there or just hashes? Can somebody explain how this might work and why it is a good idea?

What does an ETF do? I've read that they "expose bitcoin" and have only a vague idea what it means.

Great, thanks.
@_date: 2016-10-14 12:00:04
Yes, sweet.

I tried to use Kraken from Germany and it was the biggest pain in the ass. That verification process is ridiculous.

@_date: 2016-10-06 22:08:45
Ok there were some good explanations

Hi, thanks for the answer.


Where do these blocks come from? I remember reading something about block discovery, is this it? And could this number go up, like to every 2 minutes?


Ok there is a set of transactions that people want to make, and there is a set of blocks to write these into. How does my wallet (I assume my wallet does that) select a block to put the transaction into? And only if that node is filled my transaction "goes through"?

What rule might change? And to what could it change?

Interesting short story.
