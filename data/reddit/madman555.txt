The problem is that there are thousands of bitcoins at Mt gox.  Let's say that the go bankrupt.  They will not have enough money to cover all people and those that get the money will take a long time to get it.  Also no one knows what happens to the bitcoin that are owed to the people.  Do those bitcoin dissappear?  Do they get sent to peoples account and there being possible dupes to make it look like everyone got there coins.  Also if they do not go bankrupt and allow withdraws it will hurt bitcoin price.  People will be flipping out coins until there is not that much of a spread I between them.  This is a huge issue since mt gox affects so many bitcoins and is or at least was a major market maker.

Why would you buy now?  If it Mtgox breaks 400 than there is big downside.  You can buy it for much cheaper if that happens.

If it can hold the 100 mark than it might be an OK trade if not I see this falling to around 75 and im not sure where it goes from there.

I don't understand how you can say not to worry about this price drop if you are investing in bitcoin.  The whole point is to try to make money.  No matter why any investment goes up or down you should be concerned so you know where you at with your investment.  Just because it was very volatile a few weeks ago doesn't mean I shouldn't be concerned on where its heading now.  Not saying that bitcoin will fall hard here but if you are a true investor you always what to know what is causing price swings.  I think bitcoin is a good buy now as long as it doesn't go below its 750 resistance level.

This is a normal thing in most markets.  If there is to much activity or price swings they can and will halt all trading.  Now for the US stock market it is only 10 minutes but with everything that is happening right now I would say this is a good practice.  It can be looked at as a negative but as long as they allow activity to resume on friday it should not be that huge of a deal.  4 days is a bit of a stretch though.

How it is still a market mover.  It would only be irrelevant if it didn't trade anymore.

You all understand this is to help with the repo market? Without it lending rates would increase dramatically as they did in October. It's just to help interbank lending.

If you don't want to be tied up and you are fine with taking a lose I would say to sell part of your investment.  You never know if will go back up or down.  You can offset some risk by selling now.  It might net you a lose if it goes back up big but it will also be a good sell if it continues to fall.  So I would probably sell part but if you believe in bit coin at least hold some.

Hey so if we continue to have the same rise in difficulty as now I would have to say that it would lose about 3500 dollars at the current price.  If the price rises to 1500 each you will get the 6k back in 244 days.  Also if the difficulty rises or falls then that can change things.  Check out the calc at bitcoinwisdom.

I thought I read somewhere that the losses this year will not be able to be written off.  That starting the next year the IRS will allow you to take the capital loss.  I could be wrong.  Or maybe someone reported it wrong.  Wish I remembered where I saw that article.

I totally agree but if you are day trading there is a lot of easy money out there.

I think some will leave but when will the pumpers leave?  I mean information is nice but people just posting "bitcoin to 10000 in a month" is just as bad.  There is a lot of junk in this subreddit though.  Looks like bit coin may be headed above 600 tho.

Actually you would.  Do you remember when Netflix raised it subscription rate?  Well they missed earnings and dropped like 30%.  Everyone was say that it was all over for them.  So this is just normal that everyone is flipping out.  It matters what happens in the next few weeks that matter.

Shorted it at 1103.50 feeling pretty awesome right now.

I would wait until you see a actual bottom.  Today you could see spikes and then it would just crash again.  You need to be watching the charts and make sure that there is actual force behind a move and its not just because the book orders were light getting to a new price.  Once you see that there is an actual trading bottom I would say you could invest.  This might not get you the best price but it will make the trade a little less risky.  I would expect there to be some more bounces on the way down.  But it should stabilize relatively soon.

You have to loan shares from someone who is willing.  Then you have to pay a spread.  There are some sites out there that are doing it.  I have 1 more day to cover.

You can try out BTCjam.  Just be really careful as you can lose more than you invest shorting.

Heres an example right now.  Bitcoin is trading from 600 to 680.  Now if you look at the sell orders there only has to be a sale of 400 BTC to get it back down to 605.  So is the price stable there.  No.  A true base will have much more size and there should be buying movement that is not right on that order.

For a short term trade the charts look like it might bump up to 600.  Not sure if it will break 600 though.  This could also just be a suckers bounce.  Maybe invest a little but don't buy it all at this level to much risk.

Just because you can't make new deposits doesn't mean there are no funds at the exchange.  A lot of people still have money and bit coins there.

Worst part is you get nothing for taking the loss.  At least with stocks you can take the loss as a tax write off.  It really sucks.  Hopefully you are selling on the bounces and averaging down on the slides.  Probably your best chance short term but you might be fine in a few days/weeks/months.  You never know with bitcoin.
