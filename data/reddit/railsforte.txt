Lol, the vast majority are ignorant, racist, and all that other bullshit you’re spewing, eh? Time to turn off the television, pal. You sound impressionable as fuck.

Isn't this the guy who predicts a project like Safex will moon hard?

I mean, Coinbase listed bitcoin cash without anyone knowing beforehand, which magically coincided with a massive spike right before and after  it happened. Coinbase is corrupt as fuck. Insider training out the ass

Seriously, though. A LOT of people seem to think bitcoin is going to continue to bleed and fade away this time, out of the market learning how certain currencies have no utility or use-case. I hold a decent amount of bitcoin to be honest, so please, pardon the "fud" if you consider what I'm saying to be that. Does anyone with more bitcoin knowledge than me (if you were around in 2016 or earlier), who understands futures, media FUD and the competition between bch and what not have anything positive to say about btc right now? I've been around for only about a year and a half, so I've seen a few considerable dips, but I keep hearing people say that "this one is different," and it's annoying the crap out of me. Again, I apologize for sounding like a weak hand, I'm just looking for some optimism if anyone has anything to offer, other than, "it always goes up!"  Thanks, folks!

I like how the only one you specifically mention is the one that DIDN'T go to the tune of the Willy Wonka song, lol.
