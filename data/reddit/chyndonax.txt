People can't pay from mobile (eg coffee). If people can't send from Coinbase or Binance wallet, then Bitpay is missing out on 99%

Faketoshi is an invalid transaction and not worth my node's time.

When [Amazon.com]( accepts BTC we will be there ($150B in sales last year).

I'd be surprised if OB has done more than a dozen transactions that didn't involve their employees. Have you seen the garbage on there?

This. How is OpenBazaar still a thing?

As much as I'd like to be hyped about AirBnB + Bitcoin, this makes a lot of senses. Simply accepting bitcoin will have negligible impact.

This is surprising. Quick story on my experience with bitcoin so far. My goal was to set up a wallet, buy bitcoin, and spend it somewhere. 
Thanks to great suggestions on I signed up for LocalBitcoins, met a stranger at a cafe, and received bitcoin in Bread wallet. Despite the face to face encounter, flawless so far.
I found lots of mentions of OpenBazaar on this subreddit, so I downloaded the software. However, the software was so buggy - I found it practically unusable. I understand it's v1, but if an astrophysicist has a hard time with it, I'm not sure who can figure it out. 
Once you finally get it finally setup, there's only garbage available to buy. I literally found trash for sale. Who buys this nonsense? After all this, I still tried to sell a new GoPro for half the price that it would sell for on eBay. It did not sell in 6 months. What an utter waste of time. I _am_ glad I tried bitcoin, and I eventually found a site where I spend most of the original bitcoin.

No disrespect, but it seems you guys did the same thing today. Can you link me to code / specification for Confidential Assets?

If Litecoin can't activate UASF, I don't see how a Bitcoin UASF stands any chance...

Proposals and specifications for Lightning did not go through BIP process. I guess it could be seen as bitcoin-core specific (I wouldn't disagree). I agree blocksize increase should be included in SegWit column, but I can see where they're coming from.

Just got done going over the [spec]( Will go through code next. This is actually the **best** scaling proposal I've seen. SegWit via Soft Fork + Lightning (even co-authored by Lightning creator Joseph Poon). With BitPay's CEO onboard, it's probably the most likely to get adopted as well.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:32:59
Well, they published code and spec. I don't know what else they could have done besides livestream the entire duration they've been working on this...

SegWit, SegWit+2MB, and Extension Block are all safe upgrades resistant to ASICBoost. 
Why do something risky like UASF? If Litecoin successfully activates SegWit with UASF, I am open to change my mind.

Is the code available? Would love to start playing around with this. I wonder how robust it is compared to Ethereum.

You should really look at the data before coming to a conclusion (there's a lot of misinformation out there!). They mine empty blocks once in a while, but so does BitFury.
