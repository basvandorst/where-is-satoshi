If it was super easy, why do you need a tutorial?

Because being USABLE isn't something that makes it valuable.  
LN will have centralized channel hubs that will likely require you to sign up with your identity.  It just might be very close to being a 2nd layer bank.

It's not,  it is literally Bitcoin talk in r/Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core forked too... the BTC from before the BCH split occurred no longer exists.

Just withdrew BCH close to instantly from Coinbase.

Food for thought... segwit was the fork,  not bch.

Correct, "You are information isn't accurate."

Seems unbelievable, so I clicked out of curiosity.  It identifies in the first paragraph that it is talking about transaction value, NOT transaction volume.

BTC's roadmap/ideology has changed from the way Bitcoin was originally proposed to work.  BCH forked off to preserve that original vision.  
BTC kept the original name/ticker, while BCH kept the original vision of being a usable currency looking to take over the world rather than just a store of value.

Nice shilling.  
Roger Ver didn't create Bitcoin Cash... also, it was forked to prevent certain changes to Bitcoin; not to make changes.

From how Bitcoin was supposed to operate? No, it was not.

Sorry to say, but if you actually watched the video and heard the wording of the bet, Tone Vays lost the bet.

Investors?! I'd prefer users. Investing won't turn out very well in the long run if more people are not starting to actually use it.
