What I learned: Martingale will never work, felt the pain of losing 17 in a row, only lost around $1.7 dollars in real life so who cares. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:57:28
How does that work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:40
They are the ones who can manipulate it lol. They are the ones with billions. Not us. Use your head.

I watched the sell walls get eaten away on gdax last night. Whoever was buying wasn't your average joes. 20-50btc sell walls eaten away in seconds. Wall Street is here, and they are excited for shorts because they can manipulate the market so easily in their favor.

You do realize us getting to 15k this fast is only because of them buying it all up. You think their going to HODL like good little boys? lol. Oh and I do own btc, I've been a very large supporter. I'm just realistic with myself unlike half this sub who all think they are going to get rich.

I guess you don't remember what happened in 08. They don't care about a trend. They will pump the price only to crash it back down to profit from their shorts. You think wallstreet gives a shit about a trend or bitcoin?

I suggest you go look at the platform before commenting something like this. There are useful metrics. Just go look.

I am saying we use the exact same measures Reddit uses. We know its an issue, that doesn't make a platform useless. Every network based platform is prone to this. Reddit has these issues, facebook, everyone, that doesn't make a platform useless.

andreas antonopoulos called it before anyone else! Guy is a legend

What other think is 99% of cryptocurrency. People go on reddit to figure out what others think of a coin. We translated that process to our site. You don't understand, thats ok.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:41:48
Good question, do you know how Reddit combats them? We do the same thing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:04:08
Guess Reddit is useless then. I appreciate your feedback, but respectfully disagree.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:55:53
You get a macro view of what the community thinks on many different aspects to any given coin. That doesn't exist right now except for individual reddit comments.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:38:29
I mean real USD, also created out of thin air hahahah
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:40:09
If they created it, they can track the transactions. This is the next best option with a failing fiat system.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:40:08
The "Satoshi Wallet" contains a fuck ton of Bitcoin. You think its just sitting there with no one having access to it? USD is the world reserve currency and is failing and backed by nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:05:11
You're right, shilling and people giving their opinions on altcoins definitely doesn't exist on reddit!
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:58:16
Very bad. That has been my only problem with BTC. Love the idea, but the Satoshi coins are the black swan no one asks about. But to be able to hold from when they were worth .000001 to now requires huge balls. He may be dead.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:10:18
I'm asking who owns those coins. Someone does. Some guy named "Satoshi" who conveniently no one knows and is completely anonymous raises red flags.  
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:15:01
This is hilarious
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:49:48
Exactly, does that make reddit a flawed platform that no one uses and is useless?
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:32:50
Let me know if you guys have any comments or suggestions, we appreciate it!

Coinbase is really starting to piss me off. We can't really do anything but wait. I really do not like coinbase, with their huge fees and slow speed. I think we need around 3-6

@_date: 2017-06-11 21:36:58
I have no clue, this is pretty ridiculous. Going on 2.5 hours now... 
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:06:58
Still 0 lol 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:24:48
Just transferred some coin about a hour ago and still waiting with 0 confirmations. Its sad.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:43:13
Yeah, Bitcoin will never scale if it can't even handle this amount of traffic lmao
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:53:02
Let me know how you can have bitcoin work without exchanges and then we can talk
