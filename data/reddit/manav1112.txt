I was hoping you were talking of some unknown and smarter way that I did not know. Lol.
Sorry to break it to you but that's a very very unrealistic thought. Why?
1. Currently all those are miners are individuals and mining companies. They aim to make profit through this.
2. If the chinese government somehow just takes them over then people would not use Bitcoin and their mining income wouldn't be profitable
3. Supposing you mean that China sets up their own mining farms than taking over the existing private ones then that would be out of budget. 
4. Anyways what benefit or motive would China have to censor transactions on Bitcoin

On a technical level, how can the Chinese government take hold of an address or censor transactions or blacklist addresses?

Okay let's just see why would they? What is the benefit for them to "own" the blockchain

Who said that the chinese government would have anything to do with a hard fork? I don't think it even hits up on their radar of concerns. ����

First give me some proof that Bitmain controls 40% of network.
Secondly, my question was different this time. First question was how can China gain by "owning" the blockchain. This time the question is that what do they gain by censoring transactions and blacklisting addresses?
Thirdly, I am on r btc but that does not mean I am blindly in love with BU. I understand the good and bad of either side. Can I not contribute to the discussion on both subreddits?

Just learnt there is such a thing - If they do come back I would switch to them.

Haha wow! Here in India, the authorities cracked down on it a few years ago and we never saw again that kind of activity here. Great to see just across the border that its flourishing.
By the way I am around 30-40 minutes away from Lahore (in Amritsar)

I always wondered how it is across the border... probably the same in many things to be honest!

Ah, if only I could do that here in India... At one point of time in my small city called Chandigarh even a hair salon started taking bitcoins... Then the government cracked down on it! 
I guess I cant celebrate it then!

They are! But we didn't see the industry expanding too much like the best thing we saw with the expansion was the ability to pay our mobile phone bills. Back in 2013 it was expanding so rapidly I could even pay with bitcoins at a local hair dresser even though I am not in a major city.
