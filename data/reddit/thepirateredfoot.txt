"Foreign Transaction Fee  -  3%"  What is considered a foreign transaction fee, let's say I live in Botswana.. all of my transactions are subject to 3% fee?

After looking at a few different options I found that they're all pretty much the same... If you're outside of US, EURO, UK, every transaction is a 3% 'foreign' fee, which sucks, but such is life. Wirex are planning to bring that down to 0.25%, so I went with them preemptively.

Same question that I asked E-Coin:

Yeah, the transactions are also not free. Small fee, but not free.

Xapo required a mobile number for activation and other things, and I was unable to receive their SMS with my provider (something that has happened before with other companies outside my country). After some back and forth with Support which was not helpful [there was no other way offered by them to proceed without mobile activation], I decided to go with another provider — E-coin (rebranding as Wirex) and it works beautifully.
