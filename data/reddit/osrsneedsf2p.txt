Monero scales same way as BCH


Do you know how Monero works?
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:26:41
I developed pretty easily. As far as the complexities, all of that is abstracted in APIs and tools. It's about the same difficulty as it is to develop on BTC.

They created a list of "Fake news websites" and wouldn't display them, but they were all conservative news outlets. Many alt-left websites were reported but never made the list somehow.
For a time they also denied Trump was running for president. If you googled who was running, you would get HRC, Jill Stein and Gary Johnston.. that's just off the top of my head.

It's hard to say. It's not a stablecoin by any means (in regards to both BTC and USD), so it's not an ideal tool. There's a subreddit dedicated to investing in Monero as well (so I would call it like Bitcoin and say it has both.

Mine shitcoins, swap for bitcoins.
Bitcoin mining is done with designated hardware, but some coins are better mined with your computer (because you're not competing against hardware-specific miners).
I think Monero is one of the best to mine, and it's easy to swap Monero for BTC :)

Cryptonote syncing requires rescanning the full blockchain - but that's because it's an entirely different protocol from Bitcoin Core or ABC. The concept of a "Monero full node" is really only loosely similar to the concept of a Bitcoin full node.

But that's because Bitcoin can't fork itself. Some coins have community agreements that they'll all fork on one day to bring in new updates, but still remain decentalized (to a degree) and leaderless.

Where did you get the funds to trade on the exchange? Where's your entrance and exit points? 
Bitcoin is inherently public. That's why there's tools and dedicated cryptos for helping you stay private. 
Edit: you're also trusting your VPN provider. Too many variables. You need to be more private.

You don't understand stealth addressing at all it seems :/ 
As far as fresh addresses go, however, they obviously have that as well (although they're called sub addresses). I think you should really take a closer look at that one component though, it addresses your first 5 points.

You can make smart contracts on the lightning network. Also Wasabi doesn't give fungibility, it just proves you mixed your coins. And I think there's only like 200$ worth of hosted stuff in the entire Siacoin project, lol.
@_date: 2019-03-17 05:34:42
Worth noting that Monero uses more than just ring signatures

What do you possibly hope to accomplish by posting this ponzi here?
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:49:57
Thanks for recommending me the series my friend makes :P
But just to clarify, what you're talking about was based on one of two assumptions; the first is the knacc attack, and the second is stealth addressing fails. In the first example, you need external information other than the blockchain, and in the second you have to break ECC.
@_date: 2019-11-09 02:15:01
Say that to people in Hong Kong
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:50:01
Just out of curiosity, do you know how Monero works?
Like, you can't just casually break ECC like it's no big deal. You would have to correlate who's broadcasting transactions based on IP, but even then you would have a hard time with Ring Signatures. If you go for the transaction amount analysis, you get slapped with RingCT, and you're hopeless there. I'd say Ring Signatures are the weakest point, but you have stealth addresses to go through if you go that route.

Probably what you want to do. Bitcoin is a very good store of value, and has the lightning network for pseudoanonymity features and micropayments. Monero was designed to be Bitcoin's more private counterpart, so for what you're trying to do it's definitely a good tool that can do the job.

I enjoy that you brought that up, because I run a crypto service and use crypto every other day. I don't think I've ever used BCH, but I do use altcoins unless Bitcoin is the only one accepted just because of the confirmation time.

@_date: 2019-12-13 09:04:35
The altcoin only has 0 fees because people don't use it. If people used it, fees would go up.
Exceptionally, if you look at Ethereum, it has more people using it and the net fees to the miners have at points been higher than Bitcoin, but their blockchain size is in the terabytes, and the majority of the nodes are pruned.

I don't like the argument about blocksize being too big and expensive to store detracts from Bitcoin's decentralization anyways. A small blocksize just makes transactions too expensive and has the same effect anyway, just now we can't use it as easily.

Amazing how quickly people forget all the good deeds he did.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:49:51
That's really inaccurate because Monero doesn't mix or use Coinjoin. They use stealth addresses and ring signatures/ringct
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:57:14
Would blockstream ever support a consensus-level change in block size, not to decrease fees, but just to increase throughput?
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:11:46
Correct. On the other hand, using Wasabi means you took an opt-in step for privacy, whereas using Monero just means you're conscious of it. There's a lot of trade-offs to be made, and I think it warrants a much larger discussion than just this post :p
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:52:41
PoS is definitely more secure for anything that isn't Bitcoin, but it's completely centralized
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:47:05
Use Bisq. Let's you own your keys while you trade, and is decentralized.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:14:42
Monero works wildly different from Wasabi. Regardless of ring size, Monero doesn't even coinjoin/shuffle/tumble coins in that regard. I would say Wasabi is very good at what it does, with tons of usability, but you can't make a direct comparison with Monero.

The first two explicitly said the information wasn't leaked since it couldn't be verified. You can't have it both ways.
The third one is literally written by two SJWs who got offended that Wikileaks doesn't support feminists, and says nothing conclusively about selective leaks.

For sure. I like GloBee, they donate a lot to FOSS projects so they're quite down to earth. Maybe they'll change once LN becomes more common and after you click BTC it gives option

It's a pretty good multiwallet, if you're into that. But it's also nice and simple for Bitcoin, and allows for recoveries when you fuck up and wipe your device installing a custom ROM.

This is actually really cool. I've liked Edge for a while and didn't see this coming :) lots of good turns.
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:47:17
If the BTC was actually tainted they'll ask how you got it. You say Bisq and hand over your chat logs which show you bought it legitimately. 
So long as the vendor didn't explicitly be like "oh bro help me out I bought prostitutes with this dirty BTC can you buy it for me" then there's not much you can do to determine if it's actually dirty. Kinda dumb, but whatever. LN increases fungibility so this will be less of a problem in the future anyways.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:07:00
Late to the party but merged mining is cool
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:45:45
How can you possibly assume the BTC for Bisq is "Tainted" and the BTC from TradeOgre or whatever isn't?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:15:31
Because it doesn't do anything.
HTTPS is to prevent intruders from listening in and modifying your data. Sounds like the perfect place to use it, right? Well.. No. And for almost every reason people bring up, it's not helpful.
For security, all your packages are already verified with trusted keys that you already have to make sure they're not modified. So, HTTPS does nothing there.
Additionally, you have to now suddenly trust certificate authorities. That's not helpful at all, considering who's behind some of them. So, HTTPS doesn't help you there.
For privacy, HTTPS doesn't actually do anything since an attacker can already see where you're connecting to. So, HTTPS does nothing there.
The only reason I could see someone needing HTTPS from their package managers is to stop replay attacks.. But most package managers have that included by default anyways, so HTTPS does nothing there.
edit: I'm not arguing against more privacy or more security. I'm arguing against a false sense of privacy and security. HTTPS does literally nothing for privacy when I can just monitor the size of your packets to see which files your downloading; it's not like there's an infinite number of them.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:21:06
Relative to BTC it has. If you're comparing USD to USD it's stayed the same. So has BTC
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:00:24
Great question :) I can see where the fog sets in, so let me try to keep it a little simple with how that would play out.
The Lightning Network net knows Joe's Coffee shop has received 2.5 btc, so Joe has two options:
1) Perform a (single) transaction to close his channel on the LN and bring his 2.5 Btc back to "Layer 1" (the blockchain)
2) Send his 2.5 Btc to an exchange on the LN, where they'll credit his balance as normal
Joe doesn't need to worry about redeeming all his transactions on the LN back to the blockchain, as that would defeat the entire purpose of how it works.
Hopefully that clears some stuff up, let me know if you have any other questions :)

Segwit only about doubles the transactions per block though.. I'm really hoping lightning network can remove a lot of noise
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:02:32
Why would I need to do this? Why not just sent my BCH to shapeshift to get BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:26:44
When you broadcast the transaction, each node knows where to send it to next, but doesn't know the final destination. However, with enough resources you could monitor it.

I thought Segwit would make the blocksize "pretend" to be 4mb in theory if 100% of people used it. If 40% of people are using it, why aren't we getting more tx through then let's say a 2mb BTC shitfork?

You're not winning anyone over by shilling like this. I don't disagree with you and I know you're not wrong, but if you really want Bitcoin community members to support Monero you should be a bit more considerate of their discussion space, and if you want Hong Kong FP to be more aware of Monero's existence you should get support on instead.

My stance is if enough masternodes coordinated together to record data about privatesend transactions, they could deanonymize them. 
You're trusting the masternodes won't do this. I would prefer an anonymity method where you don't have to trust that because anonymization is just done through cryptography.

The thing about zero knowledge proofs is you have nothing to go on. Sure, with enough time you could compute the prime factors of 629149163818183, but you can't compute the prime factors of a number you don't know.
I'm on my phone so I don't have any links handy, but you seem to have a pretty good understanding at what's going on. Google "into to Zero knowledge proofs" and take a peak. It's really neat!
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:00:06
Yeaa but then you have to fill up a 32mb block with transactions just to double-spend.
It's harder to do than it sounds, but yeah pretty much 0-conf doesn't work for large txns and that's why other cryptos are doing things to avoid it.
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:32:32
wtf they went straight to 8?
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:55:47
They call it 0-conf. Since they've increased the block size so much it simply cannot fill up, there's no way to double spend a transaction. If there's no way to double-spend, there's no need to worry about waiting for it to be mined in a block.
If you don't have to wait for a block, well, you've got instant transactions!
The only downside is now nobody can run a node without having some sort of supercomputer and you can flood the network for free. But that's just details

@_date: 2018-07-24 23:34:15
So algorithms like Sha-1 and Md5 are sort of like math functions. If I say "What's 9x12", you say "Oh okay well let's see, 10x9 is 90, plus 18 is 118". But if I came out of the blue and said "What's 118/12?" you would be like uhhh, and it's quite difficult.
Those are the sorts of things Sha-1 is, and it's a very standard type of cryptography. Make it obscure enough, and it will be very difficult to reverse.
In a nutshell, a "Zero knowledge proof" (usually has tradeoffs) but will be more like "If you know the output is A, there is *no mathematical way* to determine the input".
They're usually really really tricky and require tons of peer-review ([which is why Monero raises money to get their cryptography audited externally]( but the end result is amazing. In the end, we get a piece of code that no matter how good quantum computers are in the future, they *won't break* the privacy.
Monero does also rely tons on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which is *not* zero-knowledge and in theory breakable by quantum computers. But they don't use it for everything, and for all of our sakes, I hope the day ECC is broken is far, far in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:43:06
Not Qtum. Also, as a noob I recommend you disregard anyone who says "Quantum computing". It means nothing lol, and all the coins that claim to be "Quantum resistant" are just bs

Why are you everywhere debunking everything I say
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:46:41
Then why make it 32MB in the first place? It would also only cost dollars to fill up these blocks 24/7 and hold down the network.
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:01:34
Ok well let's brainstorm
At 1 satoshi per byte and BCH satoshis going for 0.000014 USD, I reckon I could pull off probably 700k bytes worth of transactions for 10$ each, or 32mb with 450$..
Yeah that's expensive :l. Do transactions get accepted any cheaper than that?
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:51:24
For sure. Monero would be much better suited for this.
