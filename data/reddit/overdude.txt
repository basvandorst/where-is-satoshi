I would put that sticker right on top of the gaping wound. PM'd you :)

That's why he made this post

They have certainly done a lot for Bitcoin. Two giant and identical public figures go a ways towards mainstream understanding and general credibility. 
I despised the the Winklevii for years, but now find myself being appreciative of what they are doing.

How about a mac? I don't have a wallet locally.

Big difference between some random person on Twitter and Satoshi himself.

I'm a little sketched out about this. Seems like a way for people to launder stolen credit cards... In a way that ties my home address to the transaction. Am I wrong? I hope so because I would love to use the service.

You have some malware going on there, dude. Might want to get that looked at.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:45:52
Try spending your bitcoin instead of "cashing out"
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:25:51
Everyone has seen this like 10x, why are you reposting it?
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:11:10
Pretty old news that was thoroughly covered on reddit. 
When reddit creates the news, you don't need to link to second rate sites covering reddit, on reddit. We were all here when it happened. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:33:55
Ok, I despised the public image they projected.
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:05:59
Agreed, crap site = no i wont buy from you
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:59:55
Seriously. That is such a deceptive practice. Their ads look more and more like their normal search links, yet they'll still allow you to arrive on a domain different than what is displayed. Horrible, horrible practice.
edit:  further reading indicates this is actually a violation of Google's policy (see this:  Still can't believe they wouldn't prevent it from happening.

I want this shirt. Where do I send my money?

So if I clicked the link, it loaded for a second then I closed it. Am I exposed?

Your website needs a serious revamp, my man. 
* The biggest text is "Made in San Diego". Is that what people really need to know when they go to your site? I barely give a shit that my alcohol is made on planet earth. Try a marketing message of some kind. Or a bigger logo for the actual brand, instead of where it is made.
* Make it clear that I can buy your stuff on the website from the moment I get there. The little "Purchase Online" link is not enough. 
* The "Similar items" thing at the bottom of your posts is probably the worst implementation ever. I had no idea what it meant, at first. Try a picture of the mead, not of that dude. Two items - show two different bottles, Three items, three bottles. Maybe call the thing mix and match. 
* Here you are talking about not getting enough bitcoin purchases, yet there is no indication you accept bitcoins until someone is almost done checking out.
Some other people on this thread have some good points too. Lack of bitcoin transactions should be a pretty low priority given the general crappiness of the site.  
I could go on.. but.. I'm writing this instead of revamping my own crap website.

I now have you tagged as "asshole who wants to steal bitcoin"

When you're an organization as large as Wikimedia, every percent counts.

so what, the irs is going to subpoena reddit to get this guy's ip because he posted a pic on the internet? 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:32:42
If you were asking a question that wasn't facilitating the overt fucking over of the other users of this subreddit, maybe it would be better received here. 
This is like asking someone "Hey, if I stole your car, how would I hide it?" You have to be seriously dense to think what you are doing is acceptable to this community.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:31:54
I said that I appreciate how they are driving mainstream understanding and credibility. Not that I appreciated any sort of winklevii related price increase. 
For all you know, I could have only .001 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:23:00
My comment was not a reply to the OP.
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:07:50
Asking enthusiasts how to steal in their ecosystem is not going to be well received.

I will be there, look for the dragon mask. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:08:56
That's exactly what I said I do above and you shit talked me for it. You don't even do the cash transactions you were arguing for? What the hell, man. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:54:11
You literally say "I actually buy bitcoins from Coinbase all the time" in another comment - so yes, we. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:29:35
That isn't how market caps work.  
Curren market cap = current outstanding * current price
You don't need 800 billion for the current price to rise to 100k; price rise is a function of supply and demand.
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:43:27
Gotta say, I totally agree with what said and think that you're either trolling or an idiot if you actually think *most* people would rather do a cash transaction (pay more, have less convenience, have to meet some random person you don't know who knows you're carrying a bunch of cash, etc) than the simplicity of an online transaction. 
Far more convenient to buy from Coinbase and mix the coins for the same privacy benefit. Which I can do safely in 10 minutes at home.

There is a difference between an IOU from an exchange/anyone and an actual, real bitcoin. That is the distinction here. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:53:46
Can confirm
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:38:13
At the time I was actively trading and just happened to place a sell order at that price. 
Thanks :)  there is a small chance that I will get a fraction of the coins back, eventually, but I'm not exactly holding out on the idea.

I sold the most expensive coins on Gox at $1242: [
That sale only ate into part of my ask, so pretty sure this was the most expensive sale on Gox, ever. Too bad it went belly-up :(
Ah, nostalgia.

Part, yeah, but I lost about 15 btc to Karpeles.

It is also the second time that the exact same thing has happened. Did you guys not learn the first time?

Keep in mind that in order for someone to pay Walmart in bitcoin, they need to have purchased those bitcoin via an exchange. Walmart won't be mysteriously receiving bitcoin payments in a vacuum. People exchange dollars for coin, coin to Walmart, Walmart to dollars. 
If you are going to argue that Walmart will be receiving a billion in bitcoin payments, you must also consider that people have paid a billion for those coins. This will cycle. The cash WILL go back into the system. How can you ignore that?

Consider the possibility that all these items are not correlated but simply coincidental.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:42:29
Guess I should have specified "so far on MtGox"
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:39:08
Most expensive so far... on gox
