" However, as stated above it's one of the most important jobs in the country and therefore they need to get paid more. " 
 [ 
Also, farmers are more important than any other profession arguably. Does this mean that farmers should be the highest paid job? Obviously not.   
" They also have fixed dates off work aka a mid-term getaway is not possible."  
They are also given some of the most desirable weeks of the year off. EG: Christmas  
Also this website says they make more than 80k NZD on average.

So it appears that the length of the school year in NZ is 40 weeks. or about 75% of a year.  
According to this website "average GROSS salary in New Zealand is **NZ$ 75,947** "  [    
If these figures are correct, and your figure of 80k is correct, teachers in NZ are making more than the average person in new zealand, while working less than the average person in new zealand. That doesn't seem like "under paid" to me.

Teachers aren't underpaid, thats a cultural myth.

Teachers are not even "paid shit".  
The average teacher gets paid an above average wage, work 9 months a year, and take home about the same in a year than the average working american.   
Getting paid average for 9 months (rather than 12 months) of work is not "shit pay"  
According to the social security administration, the average salary in 2017 was 48,250 dollars.  
 [  
Here is a run down of average teacher salary. They literally make an average amount of money, for 75% of the work.

I understand why someone would want to hold bonds over cash, but what I don't understand is why someone would pay $108 for a bond that pays $100 at maturity.

Paying $108 for a bond that matures and pays out $100 doesn't make sense to me.   
Even if holding $108 dollars in cash means that a portion of the purchasing power is lost due to inflation. The purchasing power of the $100 the bond pays out is also subject to lower purchasing power due to inflation.  
I'm really confused why someone would pay more for a bond than it's face value. I must be missing something. IDK.
