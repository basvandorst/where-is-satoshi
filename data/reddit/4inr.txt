Yup, join the feels brigade.

I'm hoping buying into alts could come close in the next decade, but only time will tell.

Lol. Yes. Bonus karma if a rollercoaster gif is involved.

I had a similar problem before.. How high was your transaction fee? If too low, it could take a day or two to confirm. 
If it's not that, then I'm not sure, sorry.

Yeah, I noticed this too. Recovery for a SSD is different than a HDD. Unfortunately, I think hard drives have better chances.. not that I know for sure though. Good luck, op.

Ha yeah, I know about slope. But your note is a good reminder to focus on the forest and not the trees. We have to look at all the data, not just the most recent. 
I definitely was going through that "ah should have bought again" feeling when I commented earlier. Haha. Gotta just take our shots the best we can. Good luck to you, too!

This, exactly. The perceived "stable value" of fiat currencies is a more limited range, but a fluctuating range nonetheless. 
I guess op just needs to weigh the cost differences between fiat transaction fees versus crypto slopes.

It's coming up right now, I'm seeing 2075. Here's hoping it drops again.

Wow, haven't seen that one in a while.

To be fair they also use way more banking security than is standard in the US. The need to authenticate everything with multiple validations is real.

I'm confused that BCC apparently stands for both BitcoinCash and BitConnect, another altcoin. Did they not realize that abbreviation was already used?
