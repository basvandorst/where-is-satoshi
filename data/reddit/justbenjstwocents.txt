I always thought Kraken would be the most trustworthy exchange out there. But now, i recognised finally... they are not. I guess, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Bittrex and even Poloniex are the more reliable exchanges out there. What a pity... I will try to get my money out of Kraken, what is already difficult enough if you read through some other experience reports... and maybe also try some japanese and korean exchanges.

Sorry but, your reasoning is pointless...
It's not just a "legal mumbo jumbo" because there is no law in Germany, which would impose a cryptoexchange to be always the counterparty. 
Please think first or at least inform and research and then reply or comment. And you will see, this thread is not pointless but your previous argumentation is.

"By clicking "Submit Order", **you acknowledge that Kraken is the counterparty to your transaction** as described in Section 7 of our Terms of Service." 
Section 7:
"Payward does not purchase, sell, or exchange any Digital Assets on its own behalf, **except for trades conducted on behalf of German users where Payward fulfills each order on a spot basis as the counterparty** to both sides of the transaction." !!!
**No, all trades are between users except trades of German users and "Market Orders" of all users**... 
Do you really think all trades are between users? If so, we should end the conversation here.
This is the reference that you get when you try to execute a "Market Order" Please, read carefully.


 
and this the reference when you try to execute a "Limit Order" 


 
Find the mistake.
All the exchange functionality **should be** exactly same...
But is not :/

No, that is not a reasonable explanation because in the past it was always possible to buy and sell coins ( with Limit Orders ) without this new reference. 
They changed their Terms of Service without notifying the German users.
In the past, there was and there is still a similar reference if you try to buy or sell some coins "Market"! 
But this makes sense, because if you want to buy "Market" and there are not enough coins ( or rather, users who are willing to sell their coins ) Kraken/Payward "sells" you the coins that you want. But if you buy with a limit Order you should always get your coins from other users who are willing to sell their coins. Just like in any other country and reputable exchange. 
Apart from that, you only have to look at all the complaints about Kraken/Payward when it comes to the withdrawals. A trustworthy, reliable exchange looks different.

Because I'm fed up with their fancy excuses that you get from the Kraken Support if you are not making it public. 
I have accepted already for a long time now, that the prices suddenly go high, like magic as soon as you want to buy coins and the prices fall like magic as soon as you want to sell coins. Or the exchange/site is not reachable, every time you could make really good money when the prices exploded or break down. Because I can not prove in that point that they manipulate the prices or every time the servers are overloaded as soon as user could make really good gains.   
But this here is obvious.
