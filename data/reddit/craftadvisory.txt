Is bitaddress safe??
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:30:07
Is the risk of using it on an internet connected computer because the computer could be compromised at the time of generation? or are there other factors to consider going forward? like could a key that has been safe for years, but was generated by bitaddress online still be compromised in the future?

Daddy gave him the money to start a business. He's not some fucking genius. He had all the opportunities in the world and he took advantage. That doesn't mean he will make a good president. His inflammatory rhetoric has already caused real harm to many people. What could be good for BTC could be very bad for the US economy. Economic instability could lead us into WW3. You're brainwashed if you lump an entire group of people such as "Liberals" into one huge group of idiots. Your just as bad as the lefties with your us against them mentality. You partisan fools will bring as all down into the dark ages unless you wake the fuck up and realize the only way forward is to work together.

I remember a post a few years ago calculating how much BTC would be worth if it grew to have a marketcap of 190 billion, basically the size of a company like VISA. Could any math wiz figure this out?

This is the most ridiculous bullshit I've seen in this sub thus far. The gains from a fully developed BTC remittance market alone will crush your theory.

Many millions of people across the world send money home to relatives overseas. Men of working age will travel to an area where work is abundant, but then, as immigrants, struggle to use the local banking system and run into a bevy of issues. BTC totally solves this issue, and slowly but surely, this remittance activity will harness bitcoin. That *alone* would cause the price to skyrocket. We aren't quite there yet, but blanket statements like fail to take factors like this into account. I wont even go into what would happen if a major nations economy starts to experience hyper inflation, but the TLDR of that is that BTC would likely be used as a safe haven asset. That would cause another massive jump. There are just so many factors that go into BTC price outside of marginal production cost of mining. I majored in Economics myself, but it cannot be applied in a blanket way to every economic event in the real world.

I honestly don't understand what any of you are talking about. I use Coinbase and there is a message that informs you if you are buying coins based on a future price point (it shows not only the date but the time aswell.) *This message appears after they have reached their daily sell limit.* If they **have not** reached the daily sell limit, you buy coins at the **current price point**. So even if you buy 10 BTC on monday for 100$ USD and the price rises to 150$ USD on friday, **you still get 10 BTC for 1000$ USD**. Anyone who can read should not have a problem.
