The strategy you describe doesn't make sense. It would only reduce the profitability of that single miner. If they are simply mining their own transactions that they did not broadcast to anyone else, there is no net gain, except for the block rewards. They might as well mine empty blocks.

Whatever percentage of the total hashing rate the alleged spammers couldn't bring on board with their spam attack, they would lose (on average) that same percentage of their money spent on spam attacks. That still sounds like an incredible amount of money lost every day. That doesn't sound reasonable. You would have to at least show me some back-of-the-envelope calculations showing me that such an attack would be profitable.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:43:20
What you are describing is an overly-complicated scheme that effectively only accomplishes a smaller block size (because it's limiting the amount of block space users' transactions can get into). Instead of doing what you said, the miners could simply mine small blocks (like 1MB). But it doesn't appear that this would work anyway. Remember that miners are greedy. To collude in such a way would require all the miners to ignore tons of transactions with fees from users until the users started paying fees at a level the colluding miners desire. But it would only take a few miners to ruin the entire scheme by mining all the real transactions before the fees get bid up super high.

It is one of the two major coins that forked off the original Bitcoin protocol, yes.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:32:49
The attacker that you describe would only get his transaction fees back on the transactions that he happens to mine, which would be approximately the same percentage of hashpower that he has on the chain. So even if you control 50% of the hashpower, you would still have to spend 11.5M USD/day to raise fees to $5 per transaction. You would only profit on such an attack if there were more than 4.6M transactions per day on 8MB blocks.

I came up with pretty much the same answer except instead of measuring GDP I measured the total amount of money in the world (about 75 trillion dollars worth of money right now). 75 trillion divided by 21 million would be about 3.5 million (in 2014 dollars) per bitcoin. Of course that is assuming all coins are able to be spent (probably a couple million coins unspendable), all coins have been minted (not true until about 2140), and the current wealth of the world (expected to go up with time). So if Bitcoin annihilates every other currency in the world (which is what I expect), be prepared for extremely valuable individual bitcoins.

A lack of imagination is not a good excuse to dismiss anarchy. 
There is a great quote by Ben Goldacre that says, "You cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into.” I believe that it is also safe to say that if someone has reasoned himself into a position, you can only get him out of it with reason. I have reasoned myself into anarchy. I have spent countless hours reading, studying, pondering, and applying morality and ethics. I am a student of history, government, politics, and economics. I say this to let you know that you will not move me out of my position with the same old emotional arguments that have been made for thousands of years. The moment that you present me with logical arguments that are more sound than the reasoning I have previously encountered, I will listen.
Referring back to that quote, it doesn't seem like you have reasoned yourself into your position so I will make no attempt to reason you out of it. In case I am wrong about that, PM me and we can discuss it.

The US government will not survive a transition from fiat to Bitcoin; at least not anything close to its current form will survive. 
First off, central banking becomes impossible in a Bitcoin economy. That is how the government gets most of its funds.
Another problem the US government will face will be "[hyperbitcoinization]( - the rapid adoption of Bitcoin due to the extremely swift death of the dollar. If everyone transitioned to Bitcoin basically overnight, how would the US government pay its employees to do anything?
Additionally, government employees are [likely to defect]( when they stand to gain more by embracing Bitcoin than what they would get by enforcing government edicts. [When the government can't pay the employees]( the employees will become corrupt, steal government resources and privatize them.
Another thought: Even if some type of state survived, a cost-sharing system could be developed to insure against the possibility of being prosecuted by the state (think Liberty HealthShare, but instead of being for healthcare costs, it's for tax evasion). Tax evaders could band together monetarily to protect each other in terms of financial costs associated with fighting state prosecution. Each additional member of the community would embolden more and more people to also stop paying their taxes.

No, you don't. You can do that if you want to but don't force me or anyone else to accept your funny money.


No, it's not. Growth is achieved by investing capital into the early stages of production, thus increasing productivity, which in turn lowers the cost of providing goods and services, which increases the purchasing power of consumers and increases the real wages of workers.


A monopolistic and powerful system gets to decide how much money gets printed - money that we are all forced to use. This is not okay. 


A massive problem that hardly anyone understands.


Speak for yourself. All the new money that is printed goes exactly where the politically-connected and financially-elite want it to go, at the expense of everyone else. Every new dollar that is printed is a tax on every single asset that is denominated in dollars. How is this okay?


Good thing our lords and saviors in the government and banking system are making sure that all that new money goes into successful ventures that benefit everyone. Oh wait, actually that's the opposite of reality.


And everyone knows that the banksters are infallible, right?

Take a look at the [security threats FAQ](
If someone were to steal your TREZOR they would have to know your password (if you enable password protection) and your PIN. The TREZOR is built so that it is basically impossible to brute force the PIN due to wait times after incorrect guesses. It would take 6 days to try 20 PINs and it would take 17 years to try 30 PINs. A PIN can be up to 10 numbers long (no zeros).
You can create multiple accounts if you enable password protection. Even if you don't even mean to, you can enter the wrong password and it won't say "Incorrect password". It will just open a new wallet that has no funds in it. You could potentially create an alternate wallet with a different password and make it look like anything you want and leave just a small amount of bitcoins in it. You can give that password to the attackers and there is no way for them to know that there is another password that will work.

It was a question to everybody (although it would be interesting to hear your bot's thoughts on the matter lol). I also suspect that "Moon" is several years away. 
I did some calculations a couple of months ago to see what we could realistically expect if Bitcoin managed to absorb all national currencies. I took the 17 largest currencies in the world, found the most conservative money supply data I could (either M0 or M1), calculated all their value into a (2014) dollar amount, and divided that by 21 million bitcoins. That came out to around $680,000. That's what I'm considering my lower estimate.
Of course, there are other considerations. For one, most national currencies were not included in the calculations (though they wouldn't have added a ton of value to the 17 major currencies). Also, by the time there are 21 million bitcoins, there will be a lot more people around and hopefully worldwide wealth will have increased by then. Finally, I used the most conservative money supply numbers I could find when, in theory, there are many more dollars and other currency units in existence.
What do you think of my calculations?

You use the word "anarchy" but I do not think that word means what you think it means.
Anarchy literally means "the absence of rulers". It doesn't mean "no law". It doesn't mean "isolationism". It doesn't mean "kill your neighbors" or "blood in the streets" or anything like that. Anarchy simply acknowledges that no human can be granted the right to forcibly rule over others, no matter what superstitions or rituals are used as an excuse (e.g. divine right of kings, violent revolution, voting, etc.)
I recognize that everyone owns themselves and the initiation of force against any individual is wrong (and ultimately destructive). I am an anarchist because the existence of the state necessitates the forceful taxation of people and a monopoly on law, which violates the self-ownership of all the individual within the state's jurisdiction by aggressing against them.

So I think I understand. A Bitcoin address is the base58 string of an extended RIPEMD-160 hash (with the first four bytes of the SHA-256 hash of the SHA-256 hash of itself added to the end) of the SHA-256 hash of the public key.

In the fiat economy, there is a demand for representations of real money instead of the actual money. This is because the actual money (gold for most of human history) is heavy and inconvenient to carry around and store. This situation always leads to fractional reserve banking (i.e. fraud) and massive amounts of debt incurred by governments and people.
In the Bitcoin economy, representations of real money are more inconvenient than the actual money. There is no demand for representations. Fractional reserve banking cannot develop without this demand. Because of this, whenever someone wants to borrow money, they will have to find someone who will hand over their actual bitcoins. Trust will be paramount so I expect that there will be much less debt. And when people *do* lend bitcoins, the investments will probably be fairly safe, leading to real economic growth. 
Another cool thing about Bitcoin is its deflationary nature (cap of 21 million bitcoins). After all the bitcoins are in circulation, in a growing economy, each bitcoin will be appreciating in value, giving people the incentive to save and invest, instead of spend and borrow.

Natural permanent unemployment is a complete myth. It can only happen when the government interferes with price ceilngs/floors or what have you. The myth is used to grant economic powers to the government. It plays into the belief that people are just plain stupid and cannot figure out how to succeed in the economy without a benevolent government (a government made up of people, ironically) ready to swoop in and make everything better. A deflationary currency is not that hard to figure out, even for the average person.

This is where a lot of people are wrong. Sure, government can demand taxes in a national currency **BUT** governments cannot mandate that wealth has to be **stored** in those currencies. If a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is doing much better than the dollar many people will ditch the dollar to store their wealth in that cryptocurrency. When it is time to pay taxes they will buy some dollars and send them to the government. If a critical mass of people were doing that, there would be enormous downward pressure on the dollar and it would not survive.

Here is what I am thinking: It has to be truly trustless so an external trusted source of random data is out of the question. I think the random data could somehow be generated by natural variations that are unique to a specific planet and can also be verified no matter where on the planet you are. Perhaps you could use variations in the planet’s magnetosphere (that could be complicated on Mars since it doesn’t really have a magnetosphere like Earth does). Or you could use the natural variations of what the Sun looks like from the planet, like different sun spots and the like (only available to roughly half the planet at any given time).

Certainly there would be exchanges between the different currencies. And so a mining pool on Earth could act rationally by using their outdated Bitcoin mining equipment to mine Marscoin. They would earn block rewards and exchange them for bitcoins.
A higher hashrate does matter. Let's say that Marscoin is just a Bitcoin clone that uses the same rules. Let's say that an Earth mining pool can get enough equipment together to double the hashrate of all the Martian miners combined (not unlikely if the Martian population is a tiny fraction of Earth's). Let's also say that Earth and Mars are 10 minutes away one-way. Let's see what happens when Marscoin launches at 12:00 UDT.
12:00 - Martian miners solve block A (and propagate).
12:10 - Martian miners solve block B. Earth miners receives block A and start extending the blockchain.
12:15 - Earth miners solve block B' (and propagate).
12:20 - Martian miners solve block C. Earth miners solve block C'.
12:25 - Earth miners solve block D'. Nodes on Mars receive block B' from Earth and reject it since they already have block C.
12:30 - Martian miners solve block D. Nodes on Mars receive block C' from Earth and reject it since they already have block D. Earth miners solve block E'.
12:35 - Nodes on Mars receive block D' from Earth and reject it since they already have block D. Earth miners solve block F'.
12:40 - Martian miners solve block E. Nodes on Mars receive blocks E and E' (from Earth) at the same time and could accept either one. Let's say they accept block E. Earth miners solve block G'.
12:45 - Nodes on Mars receive block F' from Earth and accept it as the longest blockchain. Earth miners solve block H'.
After 45 minutes Earth miners will have essentially "stolen" Marscoin. Using Marscoin on Mars will become just as inconvenient as using Bitcoin on Mars. Future Martians will need a way to prevent this from happening.

Not true. If you can transfer more value using bitcoins, there is more utility.


Those "greedy speculators" are the ones that ensure that your bitcoins have any value at all.

As the velocity of bitcoins approaches infinity, the value approaches zero.

You shouldn't have to do that. And you wouldn't want to either. Just get one TREZOR and keep the paper backup in a safe place, separate from the device. You can also memorize the seed if it makes you feel better (24 words can be easily remembered with practice).

Some people believe that Bitcoin and fiat will live side-by-side in a happy equilibrium. I don't believe that. 
Here's a thought experiment (from [this blog post]( to help you understand: Imagine Currency A and Currency B. For whatever reasons, they have the exact same characteristics and they are in perfect equilibrium, each worth the same with the exact same liquidity and utility. One day a rumor goes around that Currency B is not as stable as Currency A. A bunch of people sell Currency B and instead purchase Currency A. Currency A's price goes up, along with its liquidity and utility. Currency B's price goes down, along with its liquidity and utility. More people move away from Currency B and into Currency A. The cycle continues and, predictably, Currency B completely collapses into utter worthlessness and Currency A dominates the world. 
This is precisely what is happening with Bitcoin and fiat. The only difference is that in the thought experiment the two currencies had the same characteristics and started on equal footing. In the real world, Fiat started as king and Bitcoin started from nothing. Look where Bitcoin has gotten so far. How long do you expect fiat to survive?

I figure the network would just have to verify that the new block includes some significant sequence of the random stream of bits from the last couple of minutes, right? That is awesome! I know close to nothing about programming, but I’m guessing you could create the protocol of the coin so that the protocol itself broadcasts a constant stream of random bits based off the transactions that take place on it. That way the local miners wouldn't have to trust any external source of random bits and the Earthlings could never guess the data.

Believe me when I tell you I have reasoned myself into my position with countless hours of research. When I encounter logical arguments stronger than those I have previously encountered (which did not happen when I read your comment), I will change my position.
Since I can tell you want me to debate, I will oblige. The "utility" of paying taxes in a national currency will only go on for so long. The dollar, and all other fiat currencies, are on a path to complete destruction. They will be debased into oblivion. When that happens, how is the government going to pay its workers to get them to harass the citizens into paying taxes on their wealth (which will be in something else - I predict Bitcoin)? Additionally, the "utility" of paying taxes in a national currency does not require a person to store their wealth in that currency. Wealth can be stored in Bitcoin or precious metals or what have you. Eventually, people will only deal in the national currency for the sole purpose of paying their taxes. I predict that such a practice, if widespread (and I have no reason to doubt that it will be widespread) will put an enormous downward pressure on the price of the national currency, further eroding its value.
As for your belief in the effectiveness of the government in "controlling" our economy, [that hasn't really been working out so well](

I love space and I love Bitcoin. Therefore, it is only natural for me to mix the two, so I made a fun problem to solve. Here is my question that I asked a while back in its own post that not very many people saw:
I predict that mankind will spread to and colonize other planets. Let's use Mars as an example. People will be able to spend bitcoins on Mars but transactions would take a very long time to confirm (it can take up to 22 minutes for information to travel one way). Martians might want to have a cryptocurrency just for Mars. Let's call it Marscoin (yes, I know there is already a Marscoin). Even if Martians set up Marscoin and started mining it, there is a danger that superior mining equipment on Earth with a higher hashrate would be able to extend the blockchain further than the Martian miners. Then the Martians would be back to the same problem they had while using Bitcoin.
Someone who read my original post suggested that the Marscoin protocol could be programmed so that blocks would have to include very recent information from a local (Martian) source that constantly spewed out random data. The Earth miners would have no hope of including this data since they would be so far away. But that introduces trust in a local source of random data into a system that should be trustless.
To build off that idea I suggest that the protocol itself can generate the random data based on transactions that are occurring on the network. But that might be problematic if there is ever a communication outage between cities on Mars. Marscoin would fork, and if each fork is accepting blocks that include random data based on the transactions in the network, it would be difficult to recombine the forks after the communication outage is over. So, any suggestions?

I ran the numbers on a potential wallet for just such a purpose. I thought of a business with two partners at the top who would be in a 2-of-2 level, and then lower down the chain of command in the business, a 3-of-4 level, a 4-of-5 level, and a 5-of-6 level. It ended up being a 60-of-287 signature address. Here are the details:
* Level,	  # of keys,	effective % of spending authority
* 2 of 2, 	        30,	50%
* 2 of 2,	        30,	50%
* 3 of 4,	        20,    33.33%
* 3 of 4,	        20,    33.33%
* 3 of 4,	        20,    33.33%
* 3 of 4,        	20,    33.33%
* 4 of 5,    	        15,	25%
* 4 of 5,	        15,	25%
* 4 of 5,	        15,	25%
* 4 of 5,	        15,	25%
* 4 of 5,   	        15,	25%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
* 5 of 6,	        12,	20%
I have now learned that multi-signature addresses are currently limited to 20 keys. If that limit were to be raised or eliminated, a lot of cool possibilities like this example would open up.

This is an excellent article! Most people are oblivious to the criminal tactics that governments use because they haven't experienced them personally. However, as nations continue down their reckless path of endless debt, most people *will*, either directly or indirectly, experience the pain of sanctions, asset forfeiture, and bail-ins. Fortunately, this time they will have an alternative. Avoiding the harmful actions of government is the *killer app* of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:00:53
Bitcoins cannot be separated from the blockchain in any meaningful way. For a decentralized system to work (as far as anyone currently knows) there must be an incentive for people to cooperate. With Bitcoin, miners secure the network because they get new coins for doing so. The vast majority of miners do this because the new bitcoins are worth something. A decentralized currency *must* have a token that has value in order to function. Both the blockchain and the currency unit must succeed for the entire thing to work.

“Once one concedes that a single world government is not necessary, then where does one logically stop at the permissibility of separate states? If Canada and the United States can be separate nations without being denounced as in a state of impermissible ‘anarchy’, why may not the South secede from the United States? New York State from the Union? New York City from the state? Why may not Manhattan secede? Each neighbourhood? Each block? Each house? Each person?”

There is no way to know what US dollars will be worth in the future. That's why earlier I said,


For example, let's just go with my lower estimate of almost $700,000. $700,000 today could get you 700 [glass toasters]( That's how much purchasing power that amount of money has. So my estimate of $700,000 in today's dollars means that, in the future, if a bitcoin is worth that much, you will still be able to buy 700 glass toasters with it (of course, that assumes glass toasters will not become cheaper to produce in the future).

People often refer to the chicken-and-egg problem of consumer adoption vs. merchant adoption. Is it that consumers only get bitcoins because merchants accept them? Or is it that merchants will only accept them because consumers have them? It's the latter.
The first person to actually purchase bitcoins did so with absolutely no merchants in the world accepting bitcoins. Consumer adoption (AKA investing) comes first and is more important. Problem solved.

This makes it sound like bimetallism but even worse.

@_date: 2014-10-10 16:23:01
I'm sorry, but this is a really silly argument. All it takes to understand why this scenario would never happen is to think through people's motivations. Let me try to explain.
There is a world of difference between "people won't want to do something" and "people **won't ever** do something". Sure, people might not **want** to lower their nominal prices in a world where the currency is gaining value (e.g. a Bitcoin world), but guess what? They will **absolutely** do it anyway when they realize they're not selling their labor or goods due to the high prices they are asking for. We actually see this happen in some sectors, like technology. Computers and other things not only get cheaper in real terms, but nominally as well! People tend to act in ways that benefit themselves.
As for planning for the future, like how much interest to charge on a loan, Bitcoin is actually far superior because everyone will always know what the money supply will be. The blockchain will be a constant source of information on the current status of the economy. Price discovery will occur so that interest rates will make sense for a deflationary currency.
If you truly want to understand how a deflationary currency will work, you need to understand [Austrian Economics]( (i.e. real economics). The Austrian School is unique in that it is understood that economics is nothing like a physical science (e.g. physics) where hypotheses can be tested. There are no real experiments in economics because you **cannot** set up controlled experiments. Economics is based on [praxeology]( which is "the deductive study of human action based on the fact that humans engage in purposeful behavior". Go to [this website]( to start learning Austrian Economics.

I disagree. It is silly to pretend that a decentralized currency and a centralized currency (even a "cryptofiat" currency) can live together in peace. There is no equilibrium when it comes to money. One will win. That is because there is an opportunity cost to choosing one money over another. You can't hold the same wealth in bitcoins *and* dollars. It's just not possible. The newspaper/radio/tv analogy is false because there is hardly any opportunity cost to consuming one over the other. That's because you can consume both quite easily. 
I can't say it much better than how it is said in [this blog post](
"While it is possible for two social networks to coexist, the world is not big enough for two currencies. Any initial disparity between two currencies, no matter how small, positively reinforces itself, and there is no reason to expect this effect to end until one currency is driven out of existence. As the price of currency A begins to rise relative to currency B, holders of currency B begin to see that their investment is looking less and less reasonable. As more people flee currency B, its decline accelerates until it has effectively ceased to be a currency."
The decentralized currency will always win because over the long term it will always be a better store of value, away from the clutches of a centralized authority.

Your question about why Bitcoin is "necessary" is devoid of meaning. Necessary for what? Depending on what you want to accomplish, Bitcoin may or may not be necessary at all. But here is my take on the question you were probably trying to ask: 
The best money has always been scarce, durable, divisible, transportable, fungible, and recognizable. Gold fulfilled these qualities excellently for most of world history. Since it was always risky to keep and store all of your gold using your own means, banks became popular. People were happy to keep their money (i.e. gold) in the bank and then trade the representations of money (i.e. paper). States and central banks eventually managed to bamboozle everyone into believing that the actual paper is money but it is absolutely terrible money because it's not scarce at all. 
Then along came Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best money the world has ever seen. It is perfectly scarce (there will only be 21 million bitcoins in the entire universe), extremely durable (the blockchain is everywhere so it will never disappear unless humans go extinct), (potentially) infinitely divisible, transportable (send it anywhere in the world almost instantly), fungible, and recognizable (the Bitcoin protocol only recognizes real bitcoins so there is no possibility of fraud).
If states were actually responsible in their economic decisions, it would be quite unlikely that Bitcoin would ever gain traction. But states are not responsible at all. The political incentives built into the state ensure that fiat currencies (i.e. paper money) always fail (the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years). Someday the world's most important fiat currency (the US dollar) will fall and it could very easily drag every other fiat currency down with it. At that point the market will recognize Bitcoin as the best money ever. 
That is why Bitcoin is important.

Here's a little lesson on the Austrian Business Cycle Theory that will illustrate why central banking and the expansion of the money supply is ultimately harmful:
In a free market (no central banking), the interest rate (the price of borrowing money) is a function of the amount of saving being done by consumers. If consumers have a high [time preference]( they will not save much right now and they will work to satisfy their wants here in the present. If consumers have a low time preference, they are looking to the future and saving for later. High time preferences and less saving equate to a higher interest rate (there is not much savings available, so the demand for loans is high relative to the supply). Low time preferences and more saving equate to a lower interest rate (there are a lot of savings so the supply can satisfy the demand at a lower price). 
The people who are borrowing are businessmen who are focused on long-term investments in the early stages of production, investments that won't yield a return until much later. When interest rates are high, only the businessmen with the safest of plans for investment actually receive loans (low return). When interest rates are low, investments can be much more varied and many can be more risky (with a much higher possibility of return). This is simply what happens in the free market as banks decide who to lend money to.
When an investment in the early stages of production (e.g. building a factory or a mine) gets funding through a loan, that funding is actually going towards a lot of spending. Workers need to get paid and those workers need to buy stuff to take care of themselves and their families. Materials need to be purchased and the workers who create those materials need to get paid as well. This spending and the accompanying shift in the economy can happen specifically because of the saving that consumers are doing. Consumers are not spending and that allows the economy to cater to the spending that the investments in the early stages of production create. 
Unfortunately we are not in a free market. The money supply is manipulated by politicians and central banks. When the money supply is increased to a significant degree, that money always starts in the banks. Because there is more money in the banks, the interest rate gets lowered (often this is the exact goal of money printing). The lower interest rate is not due to the savings of consumers because consumers have not changed their habits (they are still spending as they were before). The lower interest rate is completely artificial. Even so, businessmen still have the incentive and the opportunity to take out loans to invest in the early stages of production. Many of those loans are risky due to the reasons discussed above. 
This increase in spending by businessmen who received loans and the continuing spending by consumers (who still have high time preferences) creates a competition in the market. Because the loans given out by the banks are not backed by actual savings, both consumers and businessmen are trying to buy the same goods and services in the market. This competition drives up prices higher than they were before. The increased costs result in cost overruns for many investments, including the risky investments (which are more sensitive to cost overruns). This process continues until many investments fail, businesses go under, and loans have to be liquidated. Because politicians do not want to preside over an economic recession that this liquidation causes, they print more money which starts the cycle all over again, all in the name of "economic stimulus".
In reality, the "stimulus" provided by the combination of politicians and central banking only creates artificial booms, not backed by real growth in the economy. These booms always result in busts and the only cure is for the market to correct itself by discovering the true interest rate based on the real savings of consumers, free from the intervention of an expansionary monetary policy. Only then can true economic growth occur.

It is wise to separate coercion from cooperation. Central banks are coercive and will tell you what to do. You don't have a choice. The Bitcoin community is all about cooperation where people will request that you do something, and you either do or you don't.

Yes, you bring up an excellent point that I have been thinking about for a while now. I think the best option might be creating timelocked transactions that spend your bitcoins to your heirs and then just continue delaying the transaction every-so-often until you die. But then it might be weird that your heirs can see how much money is coming their way. That may not be desirable. Is there a way to hide that? Perhaps you can create a transaction and keep it on a dead man's switch so that when you die it will get sent to the Bitcoin network. Or perhaps you can still do a timelocked transaction and then use a reverse stealth address (if that's even possible), so your heirs can't see it until it spends.

@_date: 2014-10-27 21:52:00
If you hold cash and that cash appreciates against other commodities and then spend the cash, you will not be taxed for the value that the money appreciated. If your bitcoins appreciate over other commodities you will be taxed. Money is definitely treated separately from other property. That is one reason why you see actual denominations on gold coins so that it can be classified as legal tender. 
And then the government decides to classify these crypto businesses as money transmitters. This is clearly a double standard.
