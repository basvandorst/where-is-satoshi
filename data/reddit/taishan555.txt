That makes sense. A follow-up question, is there a separate BIP for pass phrases? Or is it included in BIP39. I can just imagine that certain wallets may not recognise the use of a pass phrase - and furthermore, I would assume that the checksum in the seed words would validate with our without the passphrase - increasing heart-attack moments when people initialize their wallets (without including their passphrase) and see a zero balance.

Ignoring outside factors like technological advancements in production and price fluctuations due to rapid adoption, the deflationary property of bitcoin (or any fixed-supply commodity) means that it will always have the same or higher purchasing power.
For example, an ounce of gold 5000 years ago could buy you a tailored outfit and a decent pair of shoes. Due to gold's finite supply, today you will get roughly the same from an ounce of gold.
Bitcoin will never exceed 21 million coins. In fact, due to lost/burnt coins, it will never get close to that number. So its value in terms of an inflationary currency (USD) will continue to increase.

I think I've heard somewhere the following. Please confirm or shed some light on.
A passphrase in addition to a 12or24 word seed increases security by calculating a different starting public address for your wallet. Ie. Instead of the wallet generating public addresses from 0, it generates keys starting at x (where x refers to your pass phrase).
I'm just trying to get a better understating of when and why passphrases should be used in addition to seed words.

The strength of your passphrase doesn't actually have anything to do with BIP39. A passphrase is as strong as you want it to be depending on length, complexity and randomness. 
If by "crack", you mean brute-force, and you're actually referring to 12 or 24 seed words PLUS a passphrase, the answer is: A very long time, and a very powerful network of computers. The time and effort required would be better spent, and more profitable, mining bitcoin.

Simple answer: Yes
Depends on what exchange you're looking at and how much liquidity there is on that exchange, but when a large order is placed at the current price, and the buy or sell orders close to that price get eaten up, the price can fluctuate quickly - particularly where there is little liquidity.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:36:20
This is not that uncommon. It is the prerogative of the miner whether they want to include any transactions in their mined block. The incentive to do so is the transaction fees. This is generally referred to as selfish mining.
More likely you will find that this block and the previous block were found by the same miner (or pool) and are in close succession. After mining a valid block, the node propagates it to the network and IMMEDIATELY begins work on the next block, it doesn't need to spend the time to validate it. All other nodes on the network need to validate it before moving on - transactions made during this time may not find their way to this miner before another block is found. 
This is why larger blocks become a centralization problem - nodes are given an exponentially increasing head start on new blocks giving them a huge advantage on the network. Downloading and validating a 128mb block can mean the difference between finding the next block and not.
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:32:04
The major argument here is how the size of the blockchain would increase exponentially as demand increases. Yes, hard drives get bigger and cheaper, but propagation times will increase with bigger blocks giving large mining pools a head start as they mine a block. Ie, the time it takes for a node to download and validate a 32MB block (let's say a generous 20 seconds), that's a 20 second head start for the node that mined that block (since they don't have to validate it). Thus slightly centralizing the network power.

People stored their coins with different levels of security depending on the value at that time. This is why so many coins have been lost over time. This is why so many people lost their coins during the Mt Gox hack. As the value increases, the methods of storing become more secure. 
To answer your question - Either on an exchange (Mt Gox) or on a desktop computer wallet. The most forward-thinking people would have divided their coins into different paper wallets and stored them somewhere securely.

Soft fork basically means that it is backwards compatible. Because the blocksize is a decrease, it is still within the rules of the original chain. So the original chain could hypothetically validate the new 300kb blocks, but not vice versa.

If you don't want to be a professional miner, but you want bitcoin, just pay a miner for it. (Via whatever means you have available - exchange etc. )

It really depends how much you bought and what you're planning to do with it. 'Best' is so subjective. And 'most secure' isn't always the wisest call in some circumstances.
You wouldn't lock up a $5000 bike with a $10 padlock. Then again, it would be impractical to store it inside an impenetrable bank vault.

Basically malware is the threat for USB sticks. Private keys on a USB can technically be passed onto the computer and then through the internet. Hardware wallets receive transaction information, process them on the device and send back the complete encrypted transaction data for propagation. Ie, the private key cannot be transmitted from the hardware wallet to the device it is plugged into.
One other benefit is it's compatibility with a lot of mobile wallet apps for secure signing of transactions on the go. Ie you can plug a Trezor into your phone and use certain wallet apps to sign transactions without having to store the private keys on your phone.

Firstly, I disagree with your suggestion that a divide in the community could lead to bitcoin's failure. This has already happened a bunch of times and the community actually becomes stronger every time.

Don't lose your seed words. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 38 is how your seed words work. BIP38 is recognized by most (if not all) wallets, so you don't necessarily need to use Electrum of you feel like changing wallets or using a hardware wallet - you just put your words in and you're ready to go.
"Do I ever need to connect my wallet to the internet?"
Because bitcoin is just a mathematical protocol and the coins aren't ACTUALLY stored on your wallet, the answer is no. However if you want to send bitcoin from your wallet to another address (ie spend it), that transaction will not be valid until it is included in a block (ie. you need to transmit that transaction data to a miner somehow - most likely through the internet)

Bitcoin is adaptive, so it's very unlikely to 'fail'.

If you're already investing more than you can afford to lose, you're doing it wrong. Bitcoin is an experiment in its infancy. You will potentially lose it all. However, it may be a very rewarding risk. Don't get discouraged by fractions of a bitcoin - it may eventuate into everything you need and more.

Reach out to companies that are promoting bitcoin, see if they have bitcoin paying jobs available.

Mainstream adoption will drive its value up, however the real point you're missing is it's a hedge against fiat currencies. In terms of dollars or pounds, it will continue to increase in value while the fiat currencies continue (at an increasing pace) dying. It is a solid store of value - it was (arguably) designed to ensure you can 'put value away for the future' and be confident nobody can confiscate or devalue it.
Know this though - this is relevant to bitcoin only given its decentralised nature and limited supply. All other 'cryptos' are essentially garbage until proved otherwise. None yet come close.

Altcoins (or shitcoins) are a great speculative asset that generally feed off bitcoin's success. For short-term gains and get-rich-quick mindsets, go nuts. The bottom line is, sooner or later you're going to get rekt. A long term investor spends time and effort learning about bitcoin and how it is ultimately not effected by the rise and fall of the 'blockchain-wrapped' refuse you find listed on the deplorable and shonky institutions commonly referred to as 'cryptocurrency exchanges'. Eventually you will come out the other end with a small handful of satoshis and a better understanding of what a scam is.

It's easy enough to keep your btc balance in your head and just multiply it out when you want to check your 'balance' in terms of fiat currency. 
You could also set up a watch only wallet, but try to keep it separate from your identity since if compromised someone could know your balance. If your keys worked once upon a time, they will work again - no need to test them, however some people like to move their coins every year or so. Also diet and exercise is good to get rid of the fat.

Would not really recommend. To sell off your forked coins, you'll need to go through an exchange and lose your anonymity. However if you want to go through this process, ensure you move your REAL bitcoin to another wallet first so it's safe. Without expert knowledge you will need to use third party coin spitting tools, which will need your private keys. You can then move your bsv and then bcash onto an exchange (in that order) then sell them for btc. Then obviously move your newly acquired btc off the exchange. For anything except BSV and BCH (and maybe BTG and BCD) I probably wouldn't bother.

You're nearly there.�� Think of your public address like a glass safe. Everyone can see what's inside it, but only the person that has the private key can open it. Wallets generally help you generate a private key (and a bunch of seed words which is just a more human-intuative version of your private key). From that private key, your wallet can generate an 'infinite' amount of public addresses that are only unlockable with that key. So the hardware wallet or wallet app will calculate the entire balance of all those public keys and allow you to spend them as if it were one bank balance. (Obviously I'm discluding any technicalities to simplify my explanation). Yes, people do (and should) own multiple wallets. They cost nothing to generate and are not initially tied to your identity. Nothing stops a person sending coins back and forward between their wallets - this can be crucial in some security strategies. Fees are incurred through every transaction though, so technically you lose some bitcoin every time you send it to yourself.

I believe Coinmarketcap takes an average price from a list of exchanges. It's generally not a good metric, but it's probably the widest used for that application to date. I'm happy to say I've never used coinbase, but from what I understand it's a simple way to buy bitcoin (after relinquishing your identity through their KYC process) and it's one of the only exchanges that have not had a significant hack or security breach (yet). But it will. Buy bitcoin, then immediately (some people have waited in excess of two weeks) remove them from the exchange and hodl.

Recession in the US means no one has expendable income to speculate on 'risky assets' and hodlers may have to sell to afford to live. So theoretically price goes down. However, bitcoin is international, so other countries may benefit from a hedge of the US dollar and falling bitcoin prices. Coming out of a recession would be different - effected individuals would have experience and understanding of traditional market forces and be looking for somewhere safe to put their wealth. To answer your question to the best of my ability, initially BTCUSD moves into an extended bear market, and bounces back with considerable force as the recession comes to and end.

I think we actually need to think bigger again, change people's whole  mindset. If we consider bitcoin as the 'stable' currency and fiat currencies as a lesser inflationary medium of exchange, we should be illustrating fiats in terms of satoshis. This would also fix the issue you are raising.

If you keep your bitcoins on an exchange, you can't even verify they're even there, let alone protect them from theft. The exchange controls your private keys for you, but essentially they can tell you whatever you want to hear and you'll have to choose whether to believe it or not. What if the exchange loans out your bitcoins to someone else without your knowledge. Would you know? What if the exchange has less bitcoins than they claim to have? Would you know? What if the exchange gets hacked and your coins stolen, but your balance is still in tact? Would you know?

@_date: 2019-05-11 04:44:51
Know that bitcoins are not stored on your wallet. Just the keys to access them. This means, when coins are sent, they are simply sent to a public address. Your hardware wallet keeps the keys to spend them. So, you need to plug your hardware wallet in to initialize it. It will then provide you with a receiving address. It is bad practice to use a receiving address more than once, so every time you receive bitcoins your HW wallet will generate a new public address for you. However it is quite possible and generally acceptable to use only one address to receive bitcoins and never really need to plug your HW wallet in again until you want to spend the coins. You would be simply checking the 'balance' of that public address on a blockchain explorer (the public ledger for bitcoin transactions) which would obviously increase after each transaction has occurred.
Unless you need the bitcoins urgently (within the next few hours) the fee  can be set very low and the coins will still get through. This is done from the sending end (your dad would set the fee).
I'm not familiar with the 'how to get bitcoins' process in South Africa, but I'm sure there's exchanges available similar to what you're accustomed to in the US. Alternatively, if he knows anyone who is willing to part with their bitcoins in SA, he could buy then with local fiat currency - and get the person to send them immediately to your public address saving the need for another transaction.
Hope this helps.

Here's the ironic thing. If this is the US government stance, and you don't like it, bitcoin gives you the freedom to leave and find a better place. If enough 'obedient tax-paying workers' do the same, the government will have no choice but to accept its place in society. Understand this though, the long arm of the banking cartel has an unlimited cache of ammunition through the dumbing down of society to keep the majority in a state of fear from bitcoin (and from leaving the US) for a very long time.

One other thing that is less discussed is access to funds. If you control your own keys, you have access to all of your funds at any time. Giving your keys to an exchange means you have to 'ask them for permission' to access your funds. Ie, if they are doing maintenance or have a maximum withdrawal limit (or when they get hacked and the btc is not actually there), you may not have access to your coins.
Trezors are very good hardware wallets. It's fairly straight-forward to get your public key off it so you can easily set up a 'watch only' wallet on your phone (If you're obsessed with checking your portfolio).
You might a well sell your ETH for BTC since ethereum is basically a scam. Only hodl the best.
