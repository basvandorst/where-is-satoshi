Ignorance aside, I think you are missing the bigger picture here.
This is not a start-up trying to get off the ground, this is an established multi-million dollar multinational corporation.
For the sake of brevity let's keep this simple as possible. You have an existing distributorship and customer base of numismatists that have already bought in and are happy with what they have currently. This number is in the 10's of thousands of people. They are introduced to another type of 'coin' they can collect and trade. 
The Bitcoin economy is currently driven through gambling transactions. How do you not have issue with that?
In my opinion, this will add a level of stability to the economy.
Saying all MLM's are a scam is complete ignorance on your part. 
Who are you to judge and impose your subjective moralities upon the community.
I'm merely the messenger, you can shoot me all you want. But the truth of the matter is, as more and more entrepreneurial minded individuals see value in this no-one is going to stop the influx. 2013 is going to be special.

I will apologize then for saying you were ignorant. But I will say agree to disagree on MLM's because I will vehemently debate that they are not ALL scams. 
I've seen the inside, many feel it's emancipation of the 40/40 plan. I won't argue that many fail, that much is true.

All I'm saying is that it's coming. Regardless of how you or I or anyone else feels about the ethics of the business model.

Sure, I can do that.
It may turn out to be nothing, I'm just educating some inquisitive  numismatists.

I am not associated with the MLM in question, merely consulting on the merits of Bitcoin and this emerging economy.
I'm not passing judgement either way for any individual choice on the matter. 
Trying to remain as objective as possible here.
All that is happening is a company that currently leverages the sale of gold and silver assets is intrigued by Bitcoin and wants to learn more.
