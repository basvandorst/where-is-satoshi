I wonder what they use for cold storage. Paper? Plastic?
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:24:59
Could you tell us who you are and why you're making this presentation?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:11:49
I have another one stored securely. If I lose both, I have generated a few one time passwords on a piece of paper.

Weird, I had the feeling he was much more violent against the technology.

As a webdev, I honnestly couldn't use a web-based IDE. There are some nice ideas, but I can't really see me use such a thing.
Besides, how does it handle offline development?

Pierre Moscovici, France's economy minister, has already stated he's against Bitcoin, saying it's not money and it's affiliated to drugs and weapons, and wants it to be regulated at the european level.

On a side note, Yubikeys are absolutely amazing little pieces of hardware.
I've been using one for the past two years every day to log into my LastPass account, and it has absolutely never failed me. If you really want to upgrade your security, I couldn't recommend enough the use of LastPass with a Yubikey.

It's inflamapid. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:55:01
Wow.. So you're so pretentious that when people ask you about who you are you're suggesting to google for you? Fucking give me a break. I did googled you, and so far I've found nothing but bullshit.
Good luck with the presentation, I'm sure it's going to be [AWESOME](
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:37:17
I shall give it a try. I'm sceptic it could beat my Sublime Text + BTSync setup but what the hell ;)
@_date: 2012-09-08 20:55:55
I should've be more precise. I sold it on bitmarket.eu, so the bitcoins are just "frozen" until I send them to the buyer.
@_date: 2011-06-24 07:45:16
Once you go the Lastpass+Ubikey way, you never look back. 
@_date: 2011-03-23 22:52:00
That's often the problem with Gibson. He's a great guy, but he sometimes digresses in order to entirely cover a topic, and it can get a tad complicated.
It was his SN! episode about Lastpass that got me sold on this product.
@_date: 2011-06-05 21:27:39
A bit of layout would'nt hurt though ;)
@_date: 2011-06-12 08:49:11
Very well done !
@_date: 2011-04-05 23:02:36
Good podcast, but if I may :
you shouldn't use Youtube, unless your audio is backed up by video (even some kind of powerpoint would be nice)
you DEFINITELY need to write down your script. It's not fluent.
I still want to hear about episode 2 though ;)
@_date: 2011-03-23 22:49:02
Downloaded and printed, will read tomorow at work (yeah, I'm that busy).
Thanks for the tip, it does look very informative.

*SHA-512 multi-iteration salted hashing is in enabled and ready for when we get users reactivating their accounts*
At least they know the majority of their users won't.
@_date: 2011-03-23 22:48:11
will listen!

In the mean time, we should have a real reddit bitcoin market.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:11:57
Yeah I thought it was a bit weird too.
But I've been doing trades for a couple of weeks now on this market and I haven't had a single problem with this site.
Plus they're responding on twitter whenever I had a question.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:11:22
bitmarket.eu has a nice way of handling paypal. Bought my 10 BTC a couple of days ago over there without a problem.
@_date: 2011-06-16 23:14:07
Happy reddit birthday !
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:22:37
Do you know a client with no transaction fee ?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:12:25
I guess it'd be a win-win situation. Most tech-savvy people love video games, and they love gabe. I'm pretty sure they'd spend their BTC with a happy heart.
The publicity for bitcoin would be absolutely amazing, as it  would be the first time (?) a major online seller propose this currency.
And when you think about it, bitcoin is the perfect money for micro transactions. Hats on the TF2 markets could be easely sold for mBTC or even µBTC. People would still be able to participate to the fiesta.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:59:39
Wait a minute here. So they're a company offering to centralise bitcoin so that their customers can use bitcoin to make payments *through their service* ?
Isn't that centralising a decentralised currency ?
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:47:30
I totally agree with that statement. I was sad to see the [first issue of Bitcoin Magazine]( to show someone wearing a Guy Fawks mask. Not that the fact that Bitcoin can be used as a way to process funds anonimously for people acting against oppressing regimes/associations is a bad thing, but we definitely need to emphasize more on the fact that it most certainly can be used as a mean to buy things just like any other payment service, only way faster, in a way more secure way, and with way less fees.

The synchronicity with the news from China is a bit funny.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:37:41
Exactly. You have to remember that the protocol only transmits transactions. Coins do not exist per say, they're just the result of previous transactions tied to an address. 
Adresses of which the user has lost their private key can't sign and broadcast a transaction to the network. Therefore, the coins tied to these adresses still exist in the network, but are frozen. 
I find it absolutely beautiful that thanks to its architecture, the network can't destroy a coin. Once they're mined, each coin is eternal.

Really? I admit I forgot to search before posting, but I've found only one link covering the same story, posted 3 hours ago.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:40:45


I honestly thought that the SHA algorythms were open source.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:10:48


Sound advice. I've invested exactly 10% of my portfolio last week. While this crash is certainly a bad beat, I'm biting the bullet as it won't affect my day to day life.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:58:13
I wonder why reddit isn't launching its own currency. Karmacoin anyone ?
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:28:52
I personally think that the fact the first 50 BTC can't be spent is beautiful.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:11:45
I'm not a skater, but I love your product. Congrats on the successful kickstarter, and thanks for accepting bitcoins! :)
On a practical point of view though, how do you guys deal with BTC/USD fluctuation? Do you check the price every day and adjust the price on your page accordingly? Or is there some kind of automated process on your ecommerce site ?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:49:40


Couldn't we say the same about paper money? A $5 bill is not worth $5. It's just paper.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:41:23
Yup, my thoughts exactly. Also, the comments on how wallets can either be hacked or destroyed is a bit dumb imho, they should emphasis on the fact that people are RESPONSIBLE about their wallets and it's up to you to secure their cash.
It's kinda like if someone wrote a piece about the US dollar and would say "Cash. Can easely be stolen or lost, and does not sustain fire."
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:25:50
Thanks for the link. I really like their system. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:13:53
Hey, I've made my first bitcoin purchase ever yesterday thanks to you guys, and it went smooth as butter. Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:40:14
You did something honorable. I can't send you any BTC, so have an upvote instead.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:58:39
That's pretty sweet!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:05:40
Well I've been struggling for weeks with different exchanges to get my accounts approved, and the price was going up at the time. It was when we had announcements like china exchanges opening, and switzerland/germany giving credits to bitcoin as a "real" currency.
I honnestly couldn't forsee the price would drop so drastically. A friend of mine told me it was about to crash hard, and he was right.
Now the dumb thing would be to get out of the market and convert my BTC into EUR. I'll keep my BTC, as they still have value to me. They still allow me to purchase things, and thanks to systems like Bitpay, I can use them at their right value the same way I'd be using my EUR.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:39:03
I usually cringe at the comment section on news sites, but I tip my hat at the couple of dudes trying to explain in good fashion what is bitcoin and how it works.
Education is a strong weapon.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:13:06
Anyone knows if running a full node is something that can be done on a Raspberry Pi ?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:18:58
That's the reason people need to be more aware of the divisibility of bitcoin. 
My first bitcoin purchase was for $100, and I got 0.11 BTC. That may seem low, but it's still 11,000,000 satoshis, or 11,000 mBTC. I can buy plenty of stuff with this.
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Buy what you can.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:48:21
What's the deal with the guy putting those "stamps" on physical coins ? Do they have a wallet private key printed on them or what ? I really don't understand when they keep showing these physical representations of bitcoins as I don't understand if it has any value whatsoever, plus it's completely contradictory with the nature of a digital currency.
If anyone could explain this to me, that'd be great.
