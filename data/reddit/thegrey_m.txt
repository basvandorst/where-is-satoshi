I thought very long about that, if we should make it open source, but since we are making a startup out of this, we can’t make our most valuable asset public. 
But I understand your concern! I wrote a medium article about the security and how we handle your keys. You can find it on our medium site!

Every one started once like you. If you work hard and learn quickly, you’ll be able to write such an App soon too. This App is no rocket science yet, just a couple of API calls, presenting the data and a nice looking UI. Just saying ;) 
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:46:59
haha oh nooo, bear with us!
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:02:19
Great idea. In fact something similar will be supported in our app from this weekend on. 
We will send push notifications for the Top 100 coins if an all time high (ATH) is reached and also for all coins you favorited if the price went over 30% up within the last 24h. Does this go into the direction you thought of?
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:15:00
It’s happening yes haha
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:26:14
I know thanks for adding it here. I tried to post it earlier with links but Reddit is kinda strict with that. I felt they removed the article if I added all of the ones.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:27:00
Thank you for linking it here. Wasn't sure if I was allowed to do that in the text!
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:57:55
Would be great if that "Order Again" button still works for the same conditions!
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:59:13
Sorry we won’t do it again. We thought it was a catchy title. But you are very right, also we might do wrong to the girl who did it in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:03:50
That’s an interesting thought. Haven’t considered that. You track the coins all in BTC instead of fiat?
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:42:11
We definitely will do at some point in time depending how many people are using it and how/if the project scales. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:05:21
Yes we actually thought about that... hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:51:43
I actually just read about Flutter this week. For my day to day job I am working also with React Native a lot but I'm honestly not a big fan of those cross platform things yet. I agree that there is a real case and makes sense for a lot of Apps, but I'm so much faster with Swift haha how are your experiences with it?
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:04:59
Thx :)
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:16:40
Okay got you! Yes so so far we track the price historically in our database and then query once a minute how it was 24h ago + send out a push. But potentially we could adjust that also to 1h or 20 minutes like you suggested and make that query. If more people want that feature I'm sure we can prototype and implemented that for you guys!

I think this applies for any crypto exchange. Nothing is secure and all the hacks over the last years just prove that. Though among most exchanges I would consider Coinbase pretty secure, since it's a viable business in Silicon Valley. They usually know what they are doing. But you never know!
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:23:25
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:40:41
Oh wow. Didn't know that.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:04:39
Hey, good question! We only collect the coins you favorite and when you set price alerts to send you alerts for that. 
We don’t sell any data, since we really value our users privacy! 
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:27:16
Add me on LinkedIn if you want. We are considering expanding the team soon and would happily offer some motivated people the chance to help. Age doesn't matter if you are good! [My LinkedIn](
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:27:15
Thank you sir! ;)
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:29:58
That took a while. Wow finally!
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:32:07
Gamechanger! Was looking forward to a competitor for Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:23:26
Thank you very much. Yes we can have a look into it. Though it's currently not our main priority. Way more people write me about that Android version but I think we should make an Apple Watch App too at some point!
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:29:48
That is a very good question. So at the moment our features still overlap a lot with Blockfolio. Though we are planning to implement integrations to all major exchanges. Then you don't have to manually track all the transactions you make anymore and we can retrieve that for you automatically. 
Additionally Blockfolio and Delta offer a different perspective where you mostly follow your portfolio holdings. We want to showcase a wider perspective. So Coinance currently is more similar to Coinmarketcap, just with a cooler UI haha 
You should stay tuned. Once we integrate the exchanges, you'll see more differences to the two Apps!
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:36:01
Looks slick! Nice design!
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:30:07
Dude I totally get you. I also feel like every time the price is surging, I still have to wait another week for the next paycheck. 
I sometimes used my credit card for impulsive buy decision but regretted it always after since Coinbase fees are outrageous and basically decrease already the amount by 4% you get. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:27:17
We are currently developing it. It‘ll probably launch in about 3-4 weeks!
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:39:36
Great ideas, thanks! From next week on a friend of mine is joining us to code  and he has a background in data science. I'll let him know what he thinks about your ideas and their feasibility!
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:02:07
What are the consequences for people living there? What's the difference to a financial asset for them?
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:46:04
Yes. We actually support also Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken and Poloniex via API integrations!
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:27:18
Yes you have to connect it with your API keys. Yes I also wrote a separate medium article about that. All your keys stay on your device and are encrypted. We don’t collect sensitive data about you! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:47:06
We are quite new. Just launched on iOS 5-6 weeks ago, so no surprise. But spread the word of you like it. We are happy to work in any feedback you have for us and directly seek for feedback from our users.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:31:39
It’s actually written in Java so native for Android but yes we encountered that problem on older phones. It ran smooth on Samsung S7 &amp; S8 but we heard about lags on older devices. Which device are you using? 
We are working on making it also smooth for older devices and fixing that asap!
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:09:13
So within Coinance you can connect several exchanges within one App. This has the advantage that you don't need to visit several websites or exchanges to check your balances on your laptop. Within Coinance you can see all of your wallets and at the same time see the toplist from coinmarketcap.com and also get crypto news. You can favorite coins and get price alerts and much more. So it won't replace your bitfinex account, but making checking on your cryptos + info around it much easier ;) 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:42:17
Yes new update for iOS and finally Android support!
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:05:46
Thanks we'll investigate what caused that!
