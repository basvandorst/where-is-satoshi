You heard it here first folks. Bitcoin is $249 each with only 0.01% of Greeks invested. If it ever reaches a mere 1% penetration, we can extrapolate out and see that the value of 1 bitcoin will reach $24,900.

In what way?  Crime still exists.  Has it ever been empirically proven that money laundering reduces crime?  I feel like in some cases it might actually just create more crime.  
For example, criminals who would be happy to sell drugs and keep the money made are instead investing into other criminal areas as ways to launder the money themselves.

You say that like it is a good thing.  If X is legally defined as Y in one law, and another law defines X specifically as *not* Y, isn't that damn confusing and needlessly complex?  How is any reasonable person supposed to understand the legal system when such inconsistencies exist?
Also, I don't see how you can say they don't overlap when they both apply to the same thing, i. e. bitcoins.  Isn't that the definition of overlap?

Several years ago, people were saying exactly the same things you are now. They succeeded in convincing themselves that buying bitcoin at $1 was a terrible investment because the "early adoption" phase was over, after-all bitcoin had increased in value over 1000-fold to reach that value, surely that was the end of the line?
And then the same stuff happened after the brief peak to $28.
And then again at $250.
But maybe things are different now, right? Keep on convincing yourself.

Drug lord problems.  I have a huge pile of money but it's hard to spend it :(
I get what you are saying, regarding the limitations of spending cash.  But a lot of these criminals can't do anything else anyway.  What are they going to do, work at McDonald's for min wage?  They won't be able to buy a boat or house or probably even a car with that legitimate income, so what is the incentive to quit crime?
I look at it like this-
They can be criminals and ignore money laundering law, and get anything they want but get caught.
Or they can be criminals and limit what they buy, only buying things for cash at various small shops and never keeping records, live a pretty good life but can't easily buy a car, and pretty much can't buy a house or invest at all.
Or they can go legit, make barely anything because they have no legit work history and no real life work skills, and they still can't easily buy a car and they will never have money to invest or buy a house.
It just doesn't seem like money laundering laws are effective, because having cash that is hard to spend is still a hell of a lot better than not having any cash at all.

It dawns on me now that you might be trying to say the difference is that the WU parody ad is a photocopy of WU's ad, while Weird Al reproduces the music manually, so it's different.
But that is not how copyright works.  If you reproduce a copyright protected work in any way, including if you manually re-wrote the entire work, it's still copyright infringement.  The way around that is fair use, and parody is well defined as a form of fair use.

Not at all.  Measuring a loss, you need to compare BOTH supply &amp; value.  Measuring one or the other alone doesn't really give you any useful information.  
For example, if you have 34 bitcoins, and the value of 1 bitcoin drops by $10, did you lose $10?  No, you actually lost $340 in value.
In the same way, if you have $50, and the purchasing value of $1 drops to $.47 over 30 years of inflation, you didn't lose $.53 in value, you lost $26.50 in value.
If you are doing some retarded stupid comparison where you compare 1 bitcoin to 1 dollar, the bitcoin is going to show more loss (or gain, depending on the time span you are looking at) in value simply because 1 bitcoin is worth HUNDREDS of dollars, it's an idiotic comparison so I assumed you were comparing the total market cap of each.
Apparently I was wrong in my assumption that you were not making an idiotic comparison.  :(

Of course it was meaningful.   If you invest $1000 on $10 bitcoins and they go to $20, you doubled your investment.  If you invest $1000 on $500 bitcoins and they go to $1000 you doubled your investment.
If you invest $Y into $X bitcoins and they go to $2X, you have doubled your investment- the actual values are irrelevant, only the relative change in value.

That is incorrect.
In the past 30 years, the dollar has gone from being worth tens of thousands of bitcoins to being worth a small fraction of a bitcoin.
In the same time period, bitcoin went from being worth a small fraction of a dollar to being worth hundreds of dollars each.
The fact that bitcoin was briefly worth *even more* than that before dropping to the current value doesn't mean bitcoin value has dropped over a 30 year period, not even close.
Admittedly, all of that occurred in the last 5 years, but only because it's kind of impossible to compare two things at a time when one of them doesn't yet exist.

It's fun math, but in reality it doesn't really hold up. For example, while Gates may make $100/sec, he makes that passively, by doing nothing. Bending over to pick up a $100 bill would net him $200 for that second, because in addition to the bill he would still be making his passive $100/second. Thus, it's still worth while.
And for the OP example, you can't really buy things with pennies without spending more time converting them or carefully counting them out, so the true cost in time of picking up a penny is probably 2-4 seconds.

And arctic, seriously? Do you think the power and internet connections out there are robust enough to handle the entire mining operation?

@_date: 2015-08-15 00:23:53
I think it sort of does though.
The internet could be disrupted by a company spending millions and doing some disruptive illegal things, sure. But it doesn't happen because A) such an act would be suicidal to the company, B) there is no real gain, and the internet would bounce back in a day, and C) after one such attack, it would be exponentially harder to repeat the process because of fixes and improvements made in light of the disaster.
And so, much of the same is true of bitcoin. Super evil mega-corporation could spend millions to do a couple double-spends and reduce trust in bitcoin, but in the process they out themselves, don't actually gain anything (the double spends offer a lot less profit than the cost of controlling the network), and quickly encourage a more competitive bitcoin. In addition, in the process of buying up hashing power to commit this evil 50% attack, that simple process itself pushes profit into the mining hardware devs, making bitcoin bigger.
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:33:34
The scenario was that people start putting savings into bitcoin to protect that savings. So many people that it starts to hurt the value of the USD, and draws the attention of the government to fix it.
Well, people can't just put USD into bitcoin without moving the price. I was making some assumptions, but as an example, if just 1/10 of the US population (approx 32 million) put $5000 of savings into buying bitcoin, that is pushing 160 billion dollars into the system. That alone (even ignoring all current bitcoin investors) would put a hard minimum value of $11,000 per BTC. But you can't ignore all the current bitcoin owners, and many won't just dump coins instantly at the market rate, when in reality there are probably millions of bitcoins that won't move at any price (satoshi's, and any intentionally destroyed BTC, for example) so that value could be astronomically higher. Plus, this is only looking at US population- for the above scenario to be true, it would take people all over the world investing in bitcoin. Being conservative here, I'd say the value would reach $20k per bitcoin at a minimum.
Anyway, that pushes the value of a single bitcoin to values almost 100X current values. Mining companies work based on expected profit. If nothing else changes, mining suddenly becomes 100X more profitable. Well, something else would change, it's just human nature. Mining operations would increase their hardware budget by 100X, which pushes difficulty and cost of a 50% attack.
And then there is the actual action of investing in mining hardware to perform the 50% attack- word would get around that all the ASIC companies are sold out and/or have huge orders in place for superevil government corp or lots of little fake companies or whatnot. This huge interesting in mining equipment out of nowhere could push things even further. Remember, to get a 50% control of the system requires investing in 100% of the current hardware available. Basically, the cost of buying enough mining hardware to attempt a 50% attack would be increasing simply because of the impact of attempting to make that purchase. And if the purchase can't be done in a short time, it becomes a moving target.
It's just not that easy.

No it's not. Only technically inclined who are also willing to take risks are currently involved with bitcoin.

Then there is legal confusion in many places, NYC in particular. 
How can you honestly try to say "bitcoin is availible to everyone" with the bitlicense hanging over New York?

@_date: 2015-08-16 13:08:48
Yes, it's actually much easier to do it "right now", there is just zero reason to do it. The hypothetical I was responding to was saying if bitcoin grew huge and started to risk hurting the global economy, in THAT case building the proper mining hardware would be much harder and costlier and possibly even impossible in some scenarios.
Also, you seem to be ignoring experience as a factor. Remember the intel i810 chipset? Probably not. It was released early 1999, for Pentium 3 CPU. It had integrated graphics, and the integrated graphics SUCKED, hardcore. I mean, you could use it to run windows, but anything that required 3d acceleration was worthless, and even basic 2d stuff was bad in some cases because the drivers were horrible.
Now, advance 16 fucking years. That is a lot of time to learn, advance, and get better, isn't it? Intel's latest integrated graphics are vastly superior to the garbage in the old i810 chipset, but guess what? It's still garbage compared to the latest and greatest offerings of AMD &amp; Nvidia. 16 years isn't enough to catch up... yet you think Intel can dive right into bitcoin, and catch up with the current best ASIC producers in 6 short months? If anyone is deluded it is you.

If your "what if" scenario occurred, bitcoin value would skyrocket and mining interest would increase exponentially, so the cost of a 50% attack would also be exponentially higher. It eventually gets to a point where investing the necessary trillions into mining hardware just to try a 50% attack is so much money that it will trigger a serious economic collapse before it pays for enough hardware.

It seems like you are confused. If someone buys your property, and you are not advertising the current rent you are charging, it's literally impossible for the new landlord to decide to be nice and lower the rent. Your example has absolutely nothing to do with the things we are discussing.
Whether you want to give away money or not, as a landlord you MUST know the current rent before setting a new rent level, if you want to do so intelligently. I can't think of any possible scenario where a landlord would rather not know what the existing rent being charged is.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:24:47
You should be advertising the monthly rental incoming you are seeing, unless it's *that* low.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:35:31
No, most landlords are intelligent people.
If your tenants are currently paying $1200/month, and market rate would be $1000/month, it would be absolutely idiotic to charge them $1000/month after purchasing the property. They are obviously willing to pay above market rate, but you would just be giving money away by reducing the rent. You would obviously just keep charging $1200, all else being equal.
Since you seem to think revealing the rental income is useless, I can only assume it's below market rate, perhaps because something about the property makes it less desirable for renting. Because if you were seeing a good level of rental income, that would be a major selling point.
Goodluck on the sale.

Fee per transaction can remain low while fee per block increases.
That is, a block with 10 transactions each paying a fee of "2" = total incentive of "20", that is nice.
A future block with 10000 transactions each paying a fee of "0.01" = total incentive of "100", that is even better and it occurred with lower fees.
Scaling to more users will increase incentive much higher than a small fee increase would.

So what? That isn't relevant. Bitcoin can be open and peer to peer even if it isn't easy-peasy free to run a node for all.
Mining used to be easy enough to do on a CPU, and then it evolved into being only viable when GPU accelerated, and eventually dedicated ASICs took over, and now only a serious dedicated commercial mining operation can mine with any chance of profiting. Should we have stepped in and changed the method of mining so that mining wasn't pushed "out of reach of most of it's users"? Absolutely not. Progresses is more important.
Keeping bitcoin limited enough for the lowest common denominator results in a system that is only good for the lowest common denominator.

I don't think any of that is true.


BS. Hypothetical world where 90% of the non-mining nodes are compromised, valid transactions would still get picked up by mining nodes. 
Non mining nodes do not preform proof of work. Proof of work is the defining factor to determine trust in the bitcoin network. There is zero reason to trust a non-mining node, therefore the validation they do is worth essentially zero.


Anyone willing to use violence to control the network would go for the miners. The non-mining nodes have no control over anything. you are nuts if you think your bitcoin-qt install is of some huge value to the network as a whole, if you aren't mining you are not actually doing anything useful.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:18:13
Peer to peer doesn't inherently mean it has to be super cheap/free. Even if running a bitcoin node cost, on average, $1000/year, it could still be very much an open peer to peer system as long as anyone could buy the hardware and net connection needed to run a peer.
Following with the above analogy, 15 years ago anyone could throw together a few basic HTML pages with a cheap short .com domain name and have a website as good as most. Nowadays a modern websites require complex sites with database connections, and all the short .com names are taken and expensive, cost has dramatically increased- but still, anyone can do it. Costs scaled, but the system is still open.

Other countries also have internet service providers, do they not?
USA is actually near the bottom of the list for internet speeds. For example, in south korea - [10gbps]( Google fiber is helping to fix the situation.
But again, it's stupidly irrelevant. The block size isn't going to go from 1MB to 20GB overnight. You don't need google fiber to handle a 4MB block, or even a 20MB block. This is just a continually repeated slippery-slope fallacy argument that if the block size increases at all, it's going to be 20GB+ tomorrow and the world is going to end. That is BS. The block size can increase at a reasonable rate, and it's not going to be anywhere close to 20GB for a long time.

@_date: 2015-09-10 12:14:25
Are you aware of how bitcoin works? A node that isn't mining doesn't actually validate anything, it just passes along transactions. Only by solving a block can a node actually put a level of validation on a transaction, and the cost of mining a block is sufficiently high at this point that the cost difference between a 1MB block and even an 8MB block is trivial.


I don't understand why you keep using this stupid slippery-slope fallacy. The network needs to grow beyond the limits of pitifully small 1MB blocks, but that doesn't mean it's going to instantly switch over to 100GB blocks.
I mean seriously, if your only complaint is 32GB blocks, then I guess you are fine with increasing the block size up to any size less than that? Quit obfuscating the issue by throwing out irrelevantly huge numbers that have no barring on the current discussion.

I'm not sure that would actually help though.
Think about it for a moment. You have a small profitable mining operation, with $5 million worth of ASIC hardware. Evil government X tries to buy you out for $6 million, you don't take it because the actual profit you expect to make from mining is higher. Evil Government Guys eventually offers you $9 million to sweeten the deal. Okay, you can't resist, you take the money and sell your gear.
What are you going to do with the $9 million? If it was me, I'd immediately buy up another $8 million or so of ASIC hardware, recreate my operation, be happy about the extra million free bonus profit, and otherwise just continue on making steady mining profits with my now-larger operation, thanks to Evil Government Guys.
Final result- Evil Government Guys just overpaid for some mining capacity and actually caused the target value they need to acquire to increase.

I doubt it, but it's irrelevant. 
Bitcoin isn't going to handle the volume of VisaNet tomorrow. It almost certainly won't handle it 5 years from now. Maybe someday it will, but 30 years ago we were using 2400 baud modems and 100 MB hard disk drives, the exponential increases in the computer hardware industry will continue and bitcoin has plenty of room to grow before it gets unreasonably expensive to run a node.
Basically it seems like you are saying if bitcoin can't topple VISA, it might as well just quit trying to grow now.  BS.  Matching VISA would be an amazing accomplishment, but it's truly unnecessary today. If bitcoin reached 1/10 of 1% of the usage of VISA that would be some incredible growth. I am not sure what the point is in looking at fantasy-land situations that obviously won't be true for many years.
TL;DR: with current technology, I agree bitcoin would struggle to match the peak potential of VISA, but WHO CARES?  Peak potential isn't the same as sustained overall usage. Current technology is going to keep getting better year by year. Bitcoin is going to grow gradually, it's not going to go from 1MB blocks to 10GB blocks overnight - all in all this whole post just screams "the sky is falling" when nothing of the sort is occurring yet.

With google fiber, you are about halfway there to handling 20GB blocks already, with a cheap consumer internet connection. Given usual rate of progress, this will easily be met in the next 10 years. And as others have pointed out, sustained 56000 transactions per second is not the correct number, VISA does a tiny fraction of that number on average.

You have an odd definition for that word. Most people don't consider an unverified transaction to be valid, but you do, apparently. You shouldn't speak for others when your definitions are so far off from common usage.


You don't know that.  30 years ago, a 1MB block download would be unreasonably huge and nobody would be able to run a node on a home system. Luckily we have moved past the days of 1200 baud modems. Claiming that the network speeds and computing hardware capabilities are locked at today's levels is an absurd argument.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:22:33
You have it backwards. Every confirmed transaction has also been validated, but the opposite isn't true.
When it comes to common usage, a confirmed valid transaction is a useful thing, while a "valid" transaction that is never confirmed is the sort of thing that allows scams to occur. The fact that you seem to think a valid unconfirmed transaction is a super-important part of bitcoin makes me realize you are just a shill trying to push your own product. Which off-chain transaction company are you working for?
@_date: 2015-09-10 10:48:04
You keep use that word- "can" , stop. It is useless misinformation. Whether bitcoin *can* support 52,000 transactions per second today or next year is a useless bit of information, because we both know it won't. Even with exponential levels of growth, we are a long way off from that point.
And your idea of a "weaker" network seems to be entirely based on opinion and emotion rather than facts. I would call the current situation weaker than the hypothetical bigger block variations, based primarily on how easy it is to stop or at least greatly delay transactions by filling the blocks with spam.

The use case being: it makes sure your bitcoin "just sits there", in your wallet, instead of being stolen.


And can't be stolen via computer hacks or scams, making the above encryption and network required for bitcoin obsolete.
I'm not some gold fanboy, but your argument sounded silly. The advantage of bitcoin is ability to transmit it over the internet, sure, but the fact that gold "just sits there" is a feature, not a drawback.

"Unexperienced" is not a word.
I'm not sure why you think they are mutually exclusive. You can be both inexperienced* and illogical. And of course someone with little experience lacks the information to produce useful evidence.
It's also common that someone making a faulty argument appears to be inexperienced because they can't actually admit facts that contradict their argument- so instead they write around those facts and it gives the appearance that they are unaware of some of the most basic concepts of the subject.
For example- "No, the retards doing the "stress tests" have been "causing problems" only to themselves, and to the collection of assorted idiots that were too poor, or not mentally equipped, to adapt their fees temporarily. As far as Bitcoin is concerned, these "stress tests" are neither relevant, nor "stressful"."
You honestly think every mom &amp; pop user of bitcoin needs to watch the forums and news sites daily to know when they need to adjust their fee?  BS.  You think anyone who isn't an expert with years of experience is an idiot?  It should just work. It's not currently an effective working system.
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:21:33


That is a point that hasn't been proven. Computers get cheaper daily. Network connections get faster.

So does talking on a cellphone.  Should we make that illegal as well?  Some think so.  Talking with a passenger is a distraction as well, where do you draw the line?
Personally, I like drawing the line where the damage is caused.  If something causes no damage or harm, then how is it really a crime?  The problem with making something illegal just because it might increase risk is that it's easy to argue that anything you want to ban should also be illegal.  Life is full of risk, and plenty of things people enjoy and use are risky.  It's not worth giving up essential freedom just to reduce risk slightly.

That is not what is happening with bitpay vendors.
Wrong on both counts.
Samsung quotes in whatever currency they feel like quoting.  You select whatever currency you feel like using, and the price is shown based on the exchange between the two.
And... Bitpay's vendor quotes prices in BTC when you select bitcoin as a payment option.
Have you never bought anything off the internet before?
Here is how it works: you select a currency, you get prices shown in that currency.  It's not like the website has to pick one currency to use and can't show anything else.
What you seem to really be in a fluff about is what the DEFAULT currency is.  Apparently, a website that defaults to USD but also allows payment in BTC is the same as a website that doesn't accept bitcoin, in your opinion.  Don't you realize how stubborn you sound?  
Bitcoin isn't going to become the default overnight.  Getting it as a valid payment option is plenty good enough, and a great first step.  Instead you are rejecting this like it's some kind of bad thing and the only acceptable change is total bitcoin conversion.

Slight difference.
If you bought bitcoin at $.01, you made money.  It has proven to be a smart move.
If you bought bitcoin at $.10, you made money.  It has proven to be a smart move.
If you bought bitcoin at $1.00, you made money.  It has proven to be a smart move.
If you bought bitcoin at $10.00, you made money.  It has proven to be a smart move.
If you bought bitcoin at $100, you made money.  It has proven to be a smart move.
Now, this guy didn't do any of that.  Maybe this time is different, maybe now bitcoin really will crash down to 0.  I suppose there is some small chance of that.  But if you have a track record of being wrong so many times in a row, maybe that is a sign that your own instincts aren't very helpful.
This is different from your lotto example.  Lotto is statistically known.  Bitcoin value isn't, directly, as it depends on gaining popular usage.
Now, to turn things around, if you had a little box that gave out the correct winning lotto numbers 5 times in a row, and you just gave me the 6th number, would I risk a dollar buying a ticket with those numbers?
Sure, why wouldn't I?

Is my math right?  1 share costs ~2.5 btc currently.  Each share earns 0.036 per week currently.
My current home GPU based mining operation earns 0.77 btc per week.  To get the same returns from ASICMINER, I'd need a bit over 21 shares, at a cost of 53.47 BTC.  However, my home mining hardware only actually cost me $3300, or 30 BTC.  Furthermore, if I bought a BFL jalapeno or similarly priced ASIC, I could get even better returns at a cost of only 3 or so BTC.
Now, I realize there is a level of convenience in owning a stock instead of hardware that needs to be run and maintained, and I've excluded electricity costs, which cut into personal mining profit, and BFL jalapenos, while shipping now, are not an immediate delivery.
In time though, I think BFL or other ASIC produces will eventually catch up with the backlog of orders.  ASICMINER stock, at that point, will be heavily over-priced, and I expect to see a massive crash.

I agree with the OP, despite your points.


Why is this such an absurd notion?  It makes perfect sense to me.
I understand the *reasoning* behind our current system of laws and crimes, but I agree that it results in a lot of "made-up" crimes.  Lets take vehicular manslaughter.
It's illegal to kill someone by hitting them with a car.
If you hit someone with a car, you might kill them, so lets make driving cars illegal (nope, too restrictive).
Well if you drive while sleepy, you are more likely to hit someone, so lets make driving while sleepy illegal (nope, too hard to enforce).
If you drive while drunk, you are more likely to hit someone, so lets make driving while drunk illegal (we can do this!).
Okay, now it's illegal to drive drunk.
If you drink at a bar, you are likely to need to drive home, so lets make drinking at a bar illegal.
If you drink at home, you are likely to take your car out somewhere and drive drunk, so lets make drinking at home illegal.
If you are on medication that interferes with your sense of balance and slows reactions, you drive basically as a drunk would, so lets make medication illegal.
The problem with this sort of reasoning is there always one behavior that leads to another.  It becomes a very arbitrary choice as to which ones are going to be made crimes and which ones are not.  It goes against the concept of a free society.

The same solution can be used which is already used for credit cards.  When you swipe, you give your real name through ID (as you do when you hand over a credit card) and a sign a paper proving willingness to pay.  The merchant lets you walk away with a 0 confirmation transaction.  It's just as safe (if not safer) than a credit card transaction, which could end up being fraud or charged back.

Just look at the news.  We hear about school shootings, movie theater shootings, beltway sniper attacks, workplace rampages.  How often do we hear about attempted attacks that were stopped by police?  Not so much.  
While, in theory I can agree with you- a law against unlawful shooting even if nobody is actually hit could offer a real benefit if a shooter begins shooting at people, misses everyone until a cop arrives, and the cop is able to subdue him.  But is this really a plausible scenario?  Based on the news articles I read, it seems more likely that the entire massacre will be done and over long before any police arrive.
As for your eggs example, it's an interesting point.  I'd say the one with salmonella should be open to some pretty major lawsuits.  If a company uses the "highest standards" of food safety and yet still manages to get food contaminated with salmonella, it isn't really much of a consolation to the victims.  If your kids or parents died of salmonella would it really be much of a consolation that the company selling the contaminated food followed generally accepted high standards for food safety?  If you heard on the news that people were dying after eating Immunofort brand eggs, would you eat them yourself, just because you knew they used the highest standards for food safety?  Luck doesn't exist.  If you can follow the "highest standards" and still slip out a horrible deadly contaminate, those standards are not high enough, or the food you deal with is just not safe enough.
Nothing can bring back the dead, but I don't really recognize your point here.  If there is a dead person, the punishment is the same in either case.  If there isn't a dead person, you are suggesting that the risk of punishment will prevent one from happening in the first place.  I am arguing that if the risk of punishment was a successful deterrent, then the risk of killing someone being a known risk of shooting at people should offer the same deterrent.

I didn't say no one would cash out.  I said the cash outs have already been occurring.  The "crash" from $266 down to $50 occurred because lots of people decided to sell lots of bitcoins.  That is exactly what happens when people cash out.
Cash-outs will occur.  But there isn't anything special about the future.  The difference of going from $.01 perBTC to $100 per bitcoin was 10,000-fold.  If that kind of exponential rise wasn't enough to trigger the massive cash out scenario you describe, what makes you think a minor 10X increase from $200 to $2000 would cause it?
There is no magic number.  You might think it makes perfect sense to cash out at $2000, but for the guy who bought at $1800 it doesn't make much sense at all.  And for the guy who bought thousands of bitcoin at $1, he could have already cashed out at $100 if he wanted and walked away rich.
Yes people will cash out, but not all at once, not all at the same dollar, and it's not likely to be catastrophic.

Actually they didn't really, since I paid by credit card.  Most dollars are digital and thanks to credit and debt mechanics a business can hold dollars without "really" holding them.  I'm not really sure of all the economic consequences of this, but I feel like using credit for a USD business is probably not doing a whole lot to promote or push the value of USD. 
I feel that using bitcoin through bitpay or coinbase to make a purchase actually makes bitcoin a more viable currency, even if the business doesn't choose to hold any bitcoin.

That is false.  That are *only* interchangeable because the supporting corporations VISA Mastercard and Amex ENABLE the exchange of USD through their cards.  *If* you say that USD and credit cards are interchangeable, then you need to admit that USD is also interchangeable with bitcoin, thanks to the support of companies like bitpay.


In what way is this different from credit cards?  What merchant would ever accept credit cards without an account allowing them to get paid through such?


So what?  What are dollars, really?  Dollars are debt.  Dollars don't do anything by themselves, they are just a currency.  Nobody actually cares about money, not really- they care about the buying power of money.  Listing prices and selling things in USD is simply a convenience, it doesn't really make any real difference.  Bitcoin also doesn't do anything by itself, it's just a currency.  Buying dollar value with bitcoin lets you do everything you would ever need to do as a currency, so why is it such a bad thing to you?
Dollars aren't stable either, albeit the swings are less drastic than bitcoin- but this is not because of lack of acceptance.  
Bitcoin is volatile because it's going through a huge growth phase.  Right now, I'd guess fewer than a million people each have a few bitcoins, and some much smaller number have dozens or hundreds of bitcoins.  To reach true common usage, the market needs to grow a thousandfold, at least.  There aren't going to be 100,000,000,000 more bitcoins mined to meet this demand, so value must go up.  However, in any market with rising prices and limited supply, speculators are attracted, and speculative actions can cause both unnaturally fast growth and crashes, even within the frame of overall growth.  This can't be stopped.
Bitcoin may be relatively stable when they are done growing, not until then.  It's just impossible to have completely stable growth without artificial manipulation.

On the one hand, I think Josh can be needlessly abrasive and rude, but looking at all the crap he gets I think it's just learned behavior.  
I briefly worked in car sales, and this is EXACTLY how they taught us to deal with an abusive or angry customer.  Offer to cancel the deal and let them walk away.  99% of the time the customer realizes they really did want a car and they were not actually completely unhappy about things.  The other 1% of the time the customer takes the refund and leaves.  That is fine.
In this situation, you have a customer who is saying BFL's practices are unacceptable.  Is that not a request for a refund?  Why would you want to continue to do business with a company that does business *unacceptably*?

A transaction will be sent without fees if these conditions are met:
It is smaller than 10 thousand bytes.
All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.

Such a tiny transaction fails in that outputs are smaller than 0.01 BTC, and thus it must include a fee.  Fee is only optional if those three conditions are met.

It matters because that happens to be what I said.  If you are going to disprove my statement, disprove what I actually said, not some other number.
Why did I pick 90%?  It's a fairly big number and it's hard to argue against something offering a 90% reduction in something bad.  
Why not 13%?  Well, you could do a real analysis. and see if 13% is really a net gain or not.  13% of lives normally lost to drunk drivers is how many?  And how many people are being put in prison every year on DUI charges?  I have no clue what the actual numbers are, so i'll do a quick google search, I found this page: 
It says 12,000 die from drunk drivers every year, while 900,000 DUI arrests occur.  75 are arrested for each person killed.  It almost sounds to me like more lives are being ruined by the arrests than by the actual killings.  That is 900,000 people per year who have their license taken away who will probably lose their job since they can't drive and will probably either resort to driving on a suspended licenses anyway, or simply go without work and become a drain on the system.
It's a tough subject, is it worth ruining 75 lives to save one?  Maybe, because you can make the argument that the drunk drivers deserve to have their life ruined while the dead do not.  Except the statistics probably don't discriminate- the 12000 dead each year probably include the drunk drivers who die in car accidents, so maybe only half of that number are innocent victims.  So it might be 1 death per 150 drunk drivers arrested.
At some point I feel the costs outweigh the benefits.  How much are we paying the police to correct drunk driving?  How much are we paying to imprison repeat offenders?  How many DUI receivers become a drain on society and increase everyone else's tax burden?
And all of these arguments are being made based on a 50% reduction in deaths.  If DUI enforcement only results in a 13% reduction, that is only about 1800 lives saved per year, or 900 innocent lives if you assume half the deaths are the drunk drivers themselves.  Save one life, ruin 1000.  Is it worth it?  I don't claim to have the answer.

I don't think it's that much less likely-  I could see a small pool operator being more slack and failing to follow optimal security policies, such that the little pools are more likely to be hacked in the first place.  In comparison, a huge profitable pool such as btcguild would have the money and the desire to keep the pool secure at all costs.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:19:34
Yes, it's more expensive to make per chip.  But until you get into the millions of chips produced, the vast majority of cost is in development, not manufacturing.  For the quantities that the bitcoin mining market demand (very low) the development cost vastly overshadows the per-chip production cost.  So what if 110nm cost $.10 per chip and 22nm costs $10 per chip to produce, the millions spent developing each is what drives the price, not the proudction cost.

Hmm?  I thought the slippery-slope you were talking about was killing illegal&gt;shooting people illegal&gt;carrying guns illegal&gt;owning guns illegal.  Which isn't such a logical fallacy when you see that entire chain of logic being used to ban ownership of "assault weapons" in some states.
The comparison of made-up gun laws with made-up money laundering laws isn't a slippery slope argument, it is a logical comparison.  Both cases the "made-up" crime has no victim and inherently causes no damage, it just makes it more likely or easier to engage in a real crime.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:45:08


What?  I just can't understand the logic that must be going on in your head to come to such a conclusion.
Lets take 2 hypothetical examples here.
Samsung sells you a $600 phone.  When Samsung gets paid, they convert your USD to KRW and use that to pay their workers, manufacturing costs, and profit.  Nobody in the world would ever claim that can't buy a Samsung phone for USD.
Amazon sells you a $600 tablet.  When amazon gets paid in BTC, they convert the BTC to USD and use that to pay their workers, hosting costs, and manufacturing.  Yet in this case, because Amazon did the exact same sort of conversion as Samsung, you apparently aren't using the original currency, you are using the post-conversion currency.
Please explain the discrepancy.

Want to know a secret? USD isn't stable either.  It only appears to be stable because manufacturers and businesses work enough profit into prices to handle the small fluctuations. Also, a large part is due to it's status as the world reserve currency. If that changes, USD is in for a bumpy ride.

It seems like you consider the value of owning a pool at 0.  That is a huge error, IMO.  BTCGUILD takes 3-5% of the bitcoin mined, off the top.  It's a huge money-maker for the owner.  Throwing that away to do a single double-spend once would be idiotic and irrational.

You must have a different sort of credit card than the ones I have seen.  Most credit card accounts don't hold cash, they track debt.  When you buy an item with a credit card, you don't have any dollars in your account to give, yet you get the item anyway.  You eventually pay back the price of the item (unless you go bankrupt), but it's obfuscated and mixed with the payback of hundreds of other things that are also charged on the same card, and intermixed with credit card fees and interest.
To put that all into plain and simple words: you are wrong.  With a card payment, dollars DO NOT go from your account to the dealer's account.  To claim that is the case is a bold faced lie.
I feel like you have finally realized your errors, and now you just resort to lies to try to hold your argument together.

The entire economy of the world is based on profits.  The security of bitcoins depends on the simple idea that in most cases, nobody will spend X dollars to steal some tiny fraction of X, because it makes no logical sense.  
Is it a flaw in bitcoin that someone could spend a million bitcoin to engage in a 51% attack and steal 1000 bitcoin?  Maybe you think so, but I think there is no way around it.  This is how the world works, and generally it does okay, because those who are not working for a net gain don't have money needed to engage in the behavior.  Those who do have the money worked hard to get it and don't want to throw it away.
People are not always rational, but overall, they money will move and stay in rational hands.  The nature of such an attack is that it would result in tons of money flowing into the bitcoin ecosystem and a small fraction of it leaving in the actual attack, I don't think it would cause the collapse you think it could.

I ordered a pizza earlier today, online.  Interestingly enough I ordered it from Papa Johns online, using a gift card bought from gyft with bitcoin.  When I saw a car with a "Papa Johns" sign on the roof pull up near my condo, I concluded it was my pizza and went out to pick it up.  I couldn't prove it was definitely my pizza, the possibility existed that maybe someone else also ordered a pizza in the same time frame and this was their pizza, yet I still felt safe drawing that conclusion.
Anyway, I think the OP's conclusions are fine based on this being a casual forum post, rather than a scientific whitepaper.  Typically in *this* setting, if you feel someone made a significant error, you offer *proof* that they are wrong.  It's a lot more useful than simply arguing over semantics.

It's not a crime to hit and kill someone while driving safely?
In what world do you define safe driving such that it includes killing another human being with your car?  By most standard definitions, any activity that kills someone unintentionally is unsafe.


Wrong.  A drunk away from home *could* attempt to drive home.  It has that risk.  If you are not drunk, there is zero risk of attempting to drive home while drunk, but if you are drunk the risk is non-zero.
Now, you might get drunk away from home, and despite the risk you find a way to get home without driving drunk.  What is the essential difference between that and a drunk driver who is able to drive home drunk in a safe manner without causing any sort of accident or damage?

This doesn't make sense to me.  Why would they produce *any* 110nm or 45nm chips if they are capable of making 28nm?  The cost is in the development and design, not production of individual chips.  Developing chips on 3 different node sizes just doesn't make any logical sense to me... although it does sound like the sort of misteak someone might make if they were not really planning on producing any chips, but were just running a scam.

You can only spend amazon coins in the app store as far as I can tell- advantage for amazon.

I honestly didn't think anyone but was still reading this deep into the thread, it was a response in kind based upon his logic.  Remember, he said that he didn't buy bitcoin at $10 and still feels that that was correct even today, which said to me that he values $600 (current bitcoin purchasing power) at some value less than $10.  Seems absurd, so it required an absurd response.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:19:07


We aren't talking about "at the time".  This is now, today.  With the knowledge we have today, we can irrefutably say that buying bitcoin at $10 wouldn't just be a good decision, it would be THE BEST DECISION.  
Two years ago, sure you could look at the price and debate whether or not it's a good idea to buy, but knowing what we now know it's no longer a question under any debate.  Buying at $10 would have been the correct move.


The actual change is relevant.  The reason is irrelevant.  If price has gone up 1000%, you would have been very well off if you bought at $10.  Simple fact.  With the retrospect we have now, you can't deny that buying at $10 was a great opportunity.  Nor can you deny that buying at $100 was a great opportunity.

That isn't even my claim.  Your claim was that the law was fine because it was "better than nothing".  My point was that it has negative side effects, so you can't just assume it is better than nothing- if the positives are small enough, they might be outweighed by the negatives.  I am not saying that is definitely the case, I am simply saying that your assumption that any good at all that comes from the law guarantees that it is "better than nothing" is a fallacy, because there needs to be enough good to make up for the negative side effects.
As an example, lets say they make a law that requires everyone to wear a helmet while driving a car.  It might not do much, but in the cases of certain types of accidents wearing a helmet might protect the head and prevent a concussion, so you could say it's "better than nothing", right?   No, because forcing everyone to wear a helmet adds unnecessary inconvenience and may cause other problems, a real analysis is needed to determine if the law really has a net positive effect.

Exact fucking same thing as what happens when you use a credit card.  Do actual cash dollars flow out of the card into the cash register?  No.  The value of the dollars is applied in a little online account.  When you pay with bitpay, actual bitcoin don't go to do the dealer, but the *values* of those bitcoin are indeed applied to their account.


This won't happen in your lifetime buddy, get over it.  Bitcoin is growing, and it has a long way to go.  Exponential growth in usage, but only a tiny trickle of new coins means that value *must* increase over time.  On the other hand, for nearly all goods and services that would be sold for currenecy, value over time remains about the same or falls.  Result: pricing your shit in bitcoin means you need to change the price every couple of days if not weeks.  It's stupid.  Some people or businesses may do it just to be hipster and contrary, but most real businesses will continue to price in some legacy currency such as USD for a long time, even if bitcoin does become largely popular, because bitcoin value fluctuates rapidly.  Now, many places will only price on USD internally, and exchange rate based software will automagically adjust the outward showing BTC price, but the reality is under all the fancy software the prices are still being set in USD.  This won't change.
In short, your two specific points are flawed.  They are unimportant to the argument at hand and really just unimportant side-notes.

Well see, common sense isn't illegal either.  For example, a kid pushing another kid, in general, is a minor crime or no crime at all if they are just playing some game.  But a kid pushing another kid into the tracks of a metro-rail train and killing the other kid is a very serious matter.  We don't need to make kids pushing kids a capital crime though, because common sense tells the kid that while pushing is (somewhat) okay, pushing into an oncoming train and probably killing someone is not.
Going back to the drunk driving thing, common sense would tell you that driving drunk is a bad idea if it's likely to lead to committing an actual crime.  Those that lack common sense might drive drunk anyway... but how different is that from the way things are today?  Drunk driving being illegal doesn't stop everyone.
Sorry, your son died because he was hit by a distracted driver, nothing illegal was done until your son was killed.
Sorry, your son died because he was hit by a drunk driver, but as a consolation you should know that drunk driving is completely illegal and we would be locking up the guy even if he wasn't involved in an accident.
How is the second example any better?  If your son is dead, he is dead.  It's terrible and it's a tragedy, and the law being broken or not prior to the death is not much of a consolation.

It's an interesting thing when you look at it that way.  I think maybe the whole concept of crime should be looked at the way math is.  Start with a limited number of basic statements that are accepted as true, such as "murder is bad", and derive all other crimes from these given basics.  If a proof can't be shown that a given made-up crime is actually derived from one of the original crimes, then it isn't valid.  Then there is the whole issue of cases where something *might* lead to a crime, what % of likely-hood is required?  Maybe some crimes are lesser?  If a given act has a 10% chance to result in an unintentional death, maybe it should be penalized 10% as much as the act of actually causing the death would be?  I don't know.  Might be a fun experiment to try.

Upvoted because I like controversial discussion like this, but I completely disagree with the ideas of the article.
I'll start with one crucial point.  Nearly all of those top 100 list addresses have been holding bitcoins since the days of cheaper-than $.01 bitcoins.  If they are likely to sell, why didn't they sell at $2?  Why didn't they sell at $15?  Why didn't they sell at $200?  Why didn't they sell at $1000?  The opportunities have been there, repeatedly.
The truth: those who wanted to cash out, they *did* sell.  That is why we had a crash at $260.  That is why we have had unstable growth. Selling out doesn't cause a "liquidity problem".  It's really simple- if there are more people trying to sell than buy, the value drops, and if there are more people trying to buy than sell, it rises.
Some old miner might cause a minor crash, might even cause a major crash, but it won't be any different from the crash at $1, or the crash at $32, or the crash at $266.  Value will fall, and eventually recover.

The basic crime is killing someone.
The made-up crime is firing a gun at someone.  It should be okay to fire a gun at someone, it's just illegal to hit them and kill them.
But because firing a gun at someone is likely to kill them, it becomes a made-up crime, and becomes illegal.  Okay, fine.
So firing a gun at someone is illegal, and someone carrying around a gun is more likely to fire a gun than someone who isn't carrying a gun, so lets make it illegal to carry a gun.  Okay, sure.  It's been done in some states.
So carrying a gun is illegal.  Someone who owns a gun is more likely to carry a gun illegally than someone who doesn't own a gun, so lets make it illegal to own a gun.  Okay sure, it's been done in some places.
It's illegal to own a gun.  Someone who travels to other countries or states is more likely to smuggle in a gun than someone who doesn't, so lets make it illegal to travel.  It's been done (nazi germany).

I disagree with your basic argument.  If using bitpay or coinbase or osme other processor to handle bitcoin purchases makes them "not bitcoin", then I say using a credit card or paypal to handle your USD cash purchases makes them "not USD".  I can't think of any internet merchants that accept USD directly, without use of credit card or paypal or some other intermediary.
Does that mean no online stores accept USD?  No, of course not.  But it does seem to indicate that maybe using a processor like bitpay or coinbase doesn't automatically discount the fact that many merchants are actually accepting bitcoin.
The real test is pretty damn simple.  If I can buy stuff with my bitcoin at a merchant, than it accepts bitcoin.  I don't care if that merchant transfers those bitcoin into USD using bitpay, or if they exchange the bitcoin for dogecoins, or if they keep the bitcoins in a nice fancy bitcoin wallet.  Those possibilities are completely irrelevant to my interests or cares.
edit:  Also, funny enough, you *can't* simply walk into a dealer and buy a lambo with cash dollars either.  For that kind of a cash outlay, there is serious documentation requirements to prevent laundering of money, and no car dealer will accept $200,000 in cash bills.

I suppose it could be argued that way, but I don't agree.  Before the change, a smaller than 54 microBTC transaction was possible, but spending it later would cost more than the value of the transaction.  It doesn't make any logical sense for a bitcoin newbie to be told he has received "some" bitcoin, but the bitcoin could not be spent because the transaction fee is larger than the value of the bitcoin.  The "de-facto" protocol prior to the change was that you could send a very tiny amount of bitcoin to an address, and then those bitcoin could NEVER be spent.  Does that really make more sense than refusing to allow you to send an amount of bitcoin that tiny?
Also, 8.2 isn't out yet.  You have an odd definition of "pushed through", since we are talking about something that hasn't occurred yet.

For 2, it can't have that.  That would require giving the pass-phrase to a 3rd party.  It can have multiple steps of "enter the pass-phrase you picked" "again" "now write it down and save it, if you lose it you will lose all your bitcoins, forever and ever" or similar messages.  It's supposed to be a stand alone wallet though, and can't rely on the trust of a 3rd party.  If you want to do that, there are already options.
For 3, the more important part of it is the cash value calculation.  So if you enter 10 bitcoins instead of .10 bitcoins you get a reality check when the software says "ARE YOU SURE? This is $1,510.00 worth of bitcoins!"  The address check would largely be optional- if it detects the address as mtgox or bitcoinstore or whatever major bitcoin site address, it says you are sending to so-and-so.  If it doesn't recognize it, it says "unrecognized address, this is normal if sending to an individual or a newly generated sending address, proceed?".  Just a little extra double-checking, which might save some people from a typo here or there, but won't actually prevent you from sending to an address that isn't known.

I have another theory: if the cost to produce a bitcoin is significantly lower than the cost to buy a bitcoin, some potential investors who are looking at bitcoin will avoid buying them, because mining simply makes so much more sense.  Think about: if you could buy a bitcoin for $250 or buy a bitcoin miner that will produce 10 bitcoin over a month for $250, and you didn't need the bitcoin immediately, wouldn't you buy the miner device instead of buying a bitcoin directly?  My theory is that when value of bitcoin gets way too high above cost of mining, it holds back further value until mining difficulty can catch up.

But will they do it fast enough?  A BFL jalapeno, for about 2.5 bitcoin, offers more than 10X the returns of an ASICMINER share.  Do you think ASICMINER is likely to increase it's returns 10-fold before BFL finishes shipping?  
I feel like there is a very real chance that once a competitor offers a superior ASIC value ASICMINER shares will plummet in value.  A 10-fold advantage is hard to overcome, even if ASICMINER is constantly deploying hardware.

Nope, that isn't what I am saying. But the fact is we don't know how much it is helping, or even if it is helping at all.  For example, sleeping in your car, while drunk, can get you a DUI.  That aspect of the law makes it *more likely* for someone to try to drive home drunk, because at least they have a decent shot of making it without being seen, while someone asleep in the car at a bar while be immediately noticed by a cop checking the parking area.
In the absence of factual proof, we shouldn't be throwing away liberty for unknown gains.  If someone had some numbers and could say that drunk driving laws prevent 90% of all drunk driving fatalities, that might be something.  But we don't have that.

In 2011, the bubble went up to $31.90 before crashing spectacularly.  Even if you bought at the moment before the crash, at $31.90, you would have still have made a small fortune if you just held until the recent rise.
I believe bitcoin has a small chance of failing completely, it is a risk.  But if it does not, I am confident it will have another day and people will look back at $266 as being the days of cheap bitcoins.

I meant a 10-fold increase in hashrate, of course.
The problem is that right now, BFL has largely failed to ship.  Avalon has only shipped one batch.  ASICMINER has nearly zero real competition, and still fails to be more profitable than mining as an individual with purchased GPU hardware.  This is the best possible scenario, zero ASIC competition, and ASICMINER isn't really able to do anything amazing.  What is going to happen when BFL starts shipping in mass quantities?  
With ASIC bitcoin mining hardware, there isn't really any room for second place.  Over time, difficulty will adjust so that the most efficient mining hardware is slightly profitable while everything else becomes unprofitable.  It's one thing to take a risk on a piece of hardware that will theoretically pay back it's full value in a couple months.  It's a completely different thing to bet that ASICMINER will be the top ASIC manufacturer for years, given that is how long it will take to make a return on your investment.  With it's superior performance per watt, BFL hardware could put ASICMINER out of profitability.  Even if BFL ultimately fails to deliver in mass quantities, some other ASIC manufacturer might.  It just seems very foolish to bet everything on one manufacturer, especially given their current hardware is generations behind as far as power conusmption.

That can not happen.  If bitcoin was steadily rising by 1% per week, it would be an obvious buy and hold for value.  If it's such an obvious buy and hold, you get speculators over-buying it.  With speculators, occasionally they take profit, which momentarily crashes the market and causes panic.
No freely traded "thing" of any kind will EVER see steady value increase like you want, because natural human instincts to make money will cause that steady value increase to become spikey and erratic.  This is not the fault of bitcoin, and no currency no precious metal no stock NOTHING can ever be created that will avoid this pitfall.
The good news is that the erratic value and spikiness is divided by the market cap.  As the market cap gets bigger and bigger, the "damage" a speculator can do by selling out or flooding the market gets reduced.

Is the risk to others of a drunk asleep in the back of his own car really worth destroy lives over?  
[This just encourages risky behavior.]( Better to drive home drunk and risk maybe getting pulled over, rather than sleep off the alcohol and almost certainly get caught by a cop doing a routine patrol of the bar's parking area.

That isn't what I said.  I said by most definitions, any activity that kills someone unintentionally is unsafe, meaning your usage of the word "safe" or "safely" is a bit pointless.
If you are on an airline, and the plane crashes accidentally, but no alcohol or drugs are involved, would you describe your plane ride as "safe"?  No of course not.  If people are dying, it's not safe.  Safe, as a word, doesn't define fault, so it doesn't matter if the event is accidental or not.
I disagree with your explanation.


I can drive drunk without engaging in the undesirable act of crashing into someone causing death or damage, but it is still illegal because it *might* lead to that death or damage occurring.
I am using the same argument about drinking in a bar.  If you drink in a bar, it *may* lead to driving drunk.  Since we are fine with making drunk driving illegal due to the small chance of it resulting in damage or death, then we should make drinking in a bar illegal, as there is another small chance of it resulting in dangerous drunk driving.

That is the thing.  You don't need to bet if you are buying hardware with an expected payoff of a month or two.  Even if BFL ends up being worse GH/watt than the best choice, as long as you make your money back before it becomes completely irrelevant you come out ahead.  With ASICMINER stock you need over a year to see any profit, which means if ASICMINER falls behind before that happens, you lose.
The "ASIC Wars" aren't going to be over in a month, but they might be over in a year.  Any ASIC will make some profit for now, but in a year or so only the most efficient will still be viable.
Since ASICMINER stock requires 1 year + to show positive returns, it is depending on winning the war, which I find unlikely.

In the absence of all other options, maybe.  A know tax evader is found.  If it's cheaper to kill him than suffer the loss of tax revenue, he should be killed, right?  No.  He should be audited, tried, and forced to pay back the money.  Bitcoin, while pseudo anonymous, is not immune to audits and such.  It's fairly easy to find out if someone is purchasing and receiving far more than their taxed income indicates.  It's really no different from under-the-table cash or other non-taxed currencies, and can be dealt with the same ways.  The idea of the government spending billions to kill bitcoin makes an interesting fictional story, but isn't even remotely plausible to happen in real life.

I would not.  But I don't believe a law against it makes any sense whatsoever.
The purpose of a law is twofold.  To punish someone for causing damage or harm, and to discourage others from doing the same.  If you are willing to point a gun at me and pull the trigger knowing it could well fire and kill me, and you know that killing me in such a way is illegal, it shows me a couple things.  
Since killing is still illegal, even if risky behavior is not, you are not being discouraged by the penalty for committing a crime.  Therefore I do not believe that making the risky behavior illegal would serve as adequate deterrent either.
No punishment is needed, because if you did such a thing and no harm was done, I wouldn't even know or care.  If harm *was* done, you would be punished the same as any killer.
Basically, if the idea of committing a crime and facing the penalty is supposed to be the deterrent, then the risky behavior has the deterrent built in.  Why would anyone be deterred by some potential illegal "risky action" if they aren't deterred by a real possibility of killing a person and facing murder charges?  It doesn't make sense to me.
In the real world, even with all our laws, it's not hard to kill someone.  It is hard to kill someone and get away with it, however.  On the other hand, it is VERY easy to perform illegal "risky behavior" and get away with it.  Try driving the actual speed limit on the 495 beltway.  95% or more of the drivers will be passing you angrily while driving 10 mph faster than you, or more.  Do you know how often they get tickets?  Maybe once in 1000 drives.  Making a risky behavior illegal is not really an effective deterrent, especially when it's not enforced regularly.

The market segmentation is simply done by number of chips.  You want a cheap bargain priced miner?  Use 1-2 ASIC chips.  You want mid-range? use 10.  You want high end super-mining rig?  Use 100 chips.
Look at how AMD and Intel do it.  Neither Intel nor AMD develop new chips on multiple nodes, it's ludicrously stupid waste of development money to do so.  Each chip is designed for one node, and might be "shrunk" to the next node in the future but usually even then there are some changes.

Because the moment something becomes illegal, it immediately goes away?  Whats this whole war on drugs?  How come we still have drunk drivers, I thought they were supposed to be non-existent since it's illegal?
I posit that the current group of individuals who drive drunk illegally are about equivalent to the same group of individuals who would stupidly drive drunk even if it wasn't illegal.  
Is your argument that there are a lot of people out there who fear a DUI enough to not drive drunk, but who would jump at the opportunity to drive drunk and risk DEATH as long as it wasn't defined as a criminal behavior?

Sounds contradictory to me.  The 10 minute average confirmation is a common complaint, but realize that if the time was cut down to 5 minutes, 2 5 minute confirmations would offer the same assurance and security of 1 current 10 minute confirmation. A 1 minute confirmation would offer 1/10 the security and assurance, a 6 second confirmation would offer about 1/100th, and so an "instant" confirmation of less than a second is about 1/1000th as safe as regular 10 minute confirmation.  It's silly IMO to think about using a new chain to "fix" this problem.  If you want an instant transaction that isn't actually very safe or assured, you can already do that with a 0 confirmation bitcoin transaction.
