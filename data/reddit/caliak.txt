Is that part of your recovery phrase?

It has been over two weeks for me as well and I am still waiting

I want you to be saved, but only my “correct” way of being saved.
There is no way this could ever go wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:06:33
Verily yea

The report was for those who do not know about bitcoin. A report a year from now would be interesting though

The legends spoke of this day. In the old sacred texts they speak of “ profits and gains”. Maybe this is what they mean.

Coinbase is/was easy to start with but I feel the fees are high.
Doesn't Gemini take a long time to process the transaction though?

I use bread wallet, but can't buy direct in NY state through them. I Buy in an exchange then transfer to my wallet. Takes 10-30 minutes to about 12 hours right before the fork
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:01:49
That is amazing, I wish there were more to the gif
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:25:18
A lot of "ifs" there
@_date: 2019-10-18 19:38:26
Gemini will allow you to buy before the cash clears but not send it anywhere in case there is a problem with the deposit. I once had a shortfall and they dinged me $40... that I had to pay by wire transfer for the shortfall.
You can buy at the price you want but can’t move it until the deposit clears. If you want to keep doing this, pre loaf some cash and then buy after it clears
@_date: 2019-10-10 15:16:29
I applaud your goal of increasing your holdings, but why 6.25 specifically?
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:44:03
Usually you pay double for that
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:29:59
I know. It was a pain and took time.  
I set up a separate account though so there was a “circuit breaker” that keeps me from buying too much when I really can’t afford it or from selling during bad times. The added step/delay keeps me on a more DCA instead of splurge transactions
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:52:15
No, your price is locked in at the time you purchase it
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:41:54
You have to wait until your deposit clears, usually 4-5 business days, so probably next Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.

The 2019 accumulation was Jan-Apr.

The price will fluctuate but the amount of bitcoin stays the same.  That is why it is fluctuating.

kardashev scale reference! Nice.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:03:36
Kudos on the accurate scaling, is the logarithmic or hoperific?
@_date: 2019-10-18 17:33:16
Im from NY and have used Coinbase and Gemini. I’m upstate though, is it a NYC restriction?

Can you try an online bank instead of a major bank like Chase or BOA? That might help

There is speculation and there is this

The old school/new school duality in this one letter is amazing! I hope you made the order via Telegraph.

But by granting the federal government the franchise to coin money and any other form of remittances and debt instruments, doesn’t that prohibit states AND any other entities from doing it?
I can see another, different  way around this though since it’s not a national currency. For instance trading in British pounds is legal in the USA, but they are not coined or printed here. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:19:21
By that logic, isn’t every dollar I do not physically hold a fiction?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:39:51
I’m wondering the same thing...

It’s not that these articles aren’t worth the time to read, I believe they are. It’s just that you can only say these articles are correct after the facts become self evident and you know the crash is over.

Remember to tip your redditors 
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:01:02
The problem still seems to be this: What is taxable and at what rate? Capital Gains is fairly straight forward, but transactions? Is a donation to a charity going to be recognized as such?
If I do sell in less than a year is it short term Capital Gains or is it taxed as ordinary income? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:37:08
Is this just an ingenious way to allow the government to know who owns crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:03:17
Sounds about right

An oversized financial level that could allow me to provide for my family. A small investment now that could provide a large return for us down the road.

It might be an extended hold for the initial set up and with Labor Day.See if Gemini has a Reddit subreddit or a faq page online

You can buy right away but the funds need to clear before you can use them

“After America got defeated by the idea of democracy”?
That is an interesting way of looking at it

Thanks i am definitely going to check it out.

I bought a few days ago, but yeah I get your point
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:01:23
OK, so still a lot to learn. Thanks for the responses
