Since I'm trading at Bitstamp, I do all my analysis there (mostly). There is a strong support line, and currently BTC is touching it. If support will be broken, we are all fucked up.

Well, that is a separate topic. No one really knows what hights will particular crypto-currency achieve. Bitcoin bubble might explode, or opposite, will go above 250k and stay there until we all die. But I really think (hope) next couple of years will be really profitable.
Advise: you need to understand that if you earn money by trading crypto-currency, then somebody loses them. Do not make investments if you cannot afford to lose.

You need to invest to get a noticable profit from mining, it will (might) pay off in a few months. Without ASIC-based hardware your profit might be enough to cover a beer once in a month, and that's it.
It's not that I'm not recommend it, but you will earn much more if you get the part job right now, put 10% from monthly salary into, let's say, Bitcoin or Ethereum, and in three years you might not only pay for your college, but also build your own park with blackjack and hookers.

From my experience EU exchanges are the fastest way for deposits via SEPA. Register at Bitstamp (I highly recommend this exchange for EU based crypto-investors or traders, unless you trade something else apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or Ripple), deposit funds via SEPA bank transfer, in a couple of days once your deposit is credited buy Bitcoin, grab a whiskey glass, enjoy.

This ^. IMO Bitstamp is the best EU-based exchange. They will not terminate your account for no reason.
