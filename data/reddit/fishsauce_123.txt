Don't bitcoins only have value when they work (ie electricity and internet exist?). So I don't see how they are prepper friendly. Seems about the same as paper money. Both worthless unless there is a functioning society to make them have value. At least with paper money you can burn the bills for warmth.
I guess the question is, don't bitcoins actually make your wealth at greater risk and at greater dependency of the status quo continuing?

So the world goes to shit and government crumble... but your bitcoin wallets are safe in a hole. Dig them out after latest Madmax events. Find out that no society == no internet. So I guess I don't get the point of bitcoins as a "safe" store of value? ELI5?
Put another way - bitcoins are cool and work best when society is up and working. ??

Totally agree. USD would be toast too. Just saying that bitcoins are fiat money. Just like USD.

So you move your wealth from $ to bitcoin, anticipating that the USD is doomed. But if society crumbles how are bitcoins any better? No internet/electricity means no bitcoins. At least with USD you can burn the paper. What am I missing? Not a bitcoin hater, but it seems the risk in bitcoin is the continuation of functional society, same as the risk of any fiat money.

That is not much of a counter example.

governments are the personification of a society's will. You might be a total anarchist and say "the hell with government! we will succeed and start our own perfect commune over here". But very soon that commune will have some sort of leader to represent the will of the group. And that is government. I would challenge you to find any society that is completely dissociated so that there is no voice of that society - either in person or in group will.

Ok thanks! I am new, so wasn't sure if I was missing something obvious.
