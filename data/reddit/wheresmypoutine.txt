Awesome! So fast, East, and much much much better on the fees.

Where in bayshore?

I'm thinking instead the real answer is because of the number of subscribers.

Will check it out next time I'm there, thanks!

I haven't actually ever heard of a mycelium theft.  Not to say it's not possible, but, seems uncommon.   Anyone care to share/explain an experience?

Unless it's a clean, completely and always offline phone - with paper/other backup,  encrypted, password protected, not rooted, hidden away? Then it's not all that risky, really.  Still, not even close to Trezor for security, and I wouldn't recommend it for storing anything even close to significant of course!

You can use a credit card... I did, in Canada.

It's a little bit of leg work and a lot of risk vs. reward... But, can be very much worthwhile.  I'm no day trader but have done well just riding the spikes.

Works with my credit card in Canada no problem. Scotia Visa.

Not the brightest crayon in the box. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:11:15
Still huh?  So then, you are saying, you have nothing of value at all right now? That explains a lot. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:48:25
Darn, seems to be over.  I missed it!

Canadianbitcoins, but they'll be closed, on the weekend. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:01:52
Canadianbitcoins give you the coin while you stand there, after giving them money...If you go in person anyway.  I've never tried the other methods, but, they seem like a trustable company. There is also localbitcoins.com.   Or if it's a small amount,  quickbt.com via interac. They are great, fast, and easy.

I have used them several times, extremely reliable service.  It's generally fairly instant.  If you don't see something soon, send them an email.   It will be sorted out.  I've had to contact them a couple of times, they've always solved the problem quickly. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 10:51:14
I have been patiently waiting for this.  Why didn't someone tell me. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:55:07
Although I'm sure it's happened, and although I'm sure there exists malicious apps and code to hit Android, it's really not all that common.  I don't often see people saying they lost their coin from their phone, unless they did something dumb. That said, it's obviously not the safest, and not worthy of holding any substantial amount.   It's good for daily spending, like your regular wallet.

There is no volume.  This isn't even a real coin.   Ethereum hasn't released yet. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:12:20
Out of interest.. Why is this all over the sub? How about counterparty stick to the sub?  I came here today hoping to (and this part is crazy I know) read about bitcoin,  not about the latest code copied altcoin.

Happiness?

Not sure why this is just down voted. I imagine it's because of the price estimation no one wants to see.  While I disagree with some parts of that post for sure, there are still a few good and valid points in there.  I'd like to add that until the halving we're also seeing a lot of coins come in to the market daily.  Perhaps too many to keep the price up.  As a hodler, I hope for change, but this is reality. A lot of downward pressure right now.  Nothing we can't survive.
