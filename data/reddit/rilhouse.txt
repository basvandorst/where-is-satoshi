If you are a minor without ID then I think local bitcoin might be your best choice. Some sellers do require ID there as well but not all. Bitcoin ATM could be another option. Both have higher fees but you are basically stuck.

The question is how do you get the $ out.

Zim is headed towards hyperinflation again so obviously people are trying to get rid of worthless fiat. I don't see any way to profit from this since Zim dollars are worthless. USD is used widely but you can't export more then 1000$.

In this podcast Erik says that he does not like Bcash use of the Bitcoin name. I actually believe this might have been a mistake.

I've been there and also have some family there so I might ask them about it. They xray all baggage as you enter and leave the country. Foreigners are targets for bribes and shakedowns but it's actually fairly safe by African standards.

It would be risky. Would you sell for cash? There is a ton of counterfeit usd currency as well on Zim. Also getting cash out of the country would be difficult.

They primarily use USD

I was not talking about import Vs. sweep. Lots of info on that but I couldn't find anything on sweep VS. just a regular transaction. I want to burn wallet A so import is not a good option for me. It seems that I should just send from wallet A to B preferably during a weekend.
