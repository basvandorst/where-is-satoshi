MtGox... Brings back memories.
Was an old exchange several years ago. It disappeared with people's coins after some telling behavior.
Foundation has minimal real impact, as far as I'm concerned. Hell, I forgot they existed.

You can either Open it, or if you're looking at the .xpi file, drag it and drop it onto an open Firefox window. Firefox will then prompt you to make sure you wish to install the addon.
It's a Jetpack style addon, so it will not require a restart of the browser. A blue and white fox head should appear in the upper right corner of your window, on the row with your address bar.

Speaking of your Firefox download, have you considered moving it properly onto shapeshift.io for serving, rather than from dropbox?
Combined with the server being set with the proper mimetype, instructions to install for Firefox become easier: Click here, allow shapeshift.io to install the addon, and done.
If you're running Apache (I couldn't detect what's there),
    AddType application/x-xpinstall .xpi
could go into a .htaccess file in the directory the addon is being served from.
Also, if you eventually get approved for Addons.Mozilla.org (AMO), that'll take the load off you for future deployments.
Just a thought. :)

And [here we go]( 
Glad to see that you have the Gecko-friendly addon available, and it doesn't require a restart of the browser.
Hopefully, you'll submit that to AMO for future use. :)
