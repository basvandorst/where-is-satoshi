And how do these insurance groups protect themselves from insurance fraud? The whole process for determining whether a claim should be honored is based on a vote? Who do you sue if you don't agree with the vote decision? Couldnt I start a group and collude to just take the 1 or 2 people out of the groups money by voting against legit claims? 
Cool idea but insurance seems to have good reason to be centralized. Would like to see this idea explored further though.

He is trying to get someone to send him btc and plans to challenge the transaction with PayPal. Since his payee address is anonymous wallet the person who falls for this will have no way of proving to pay pal that they gave btc to hi  and thus will be out of 40 bucks.

The only way this argument works if is you assume it doesnt have consensus because core doesnt agree with it. The fork by definition requires a super majority of consensus.

In other words. Quit questioning things we know more than you.

Users should just be able to "use" bitcoin without having to take a 101 course on how to use it to make it actually work for you. Unless you are not interested in mass adoption, then who cares make it as difficult to use effectively as you want. 
Hey look I can get instant transactions if I compile my software from source with the appropriate flags and then send my transaction with a fee based on this algorithm! Not saying it is that bad but the exaggeration is there to make my point. To some people having to determine the bytes of their transaction and appropriate min fee to get a confirmation is just as complicated as that.

When there is a vast majority of people that don't like the WAY they are communicating it infers a deeper problem.

If we cannot use bitcoin for payments it will never be mainstream. And by default if it cn be used as a payment network,  can't it be a store of value. I dont see the point in designing it to be precluded as a payment network. Does it appear to be a difficult engineering achievement to do so while holding true to the decentralized ethos? I would say yes, but difficult does not mean Impossible.

Yea you are right. Passive aggressive jabs are definitely the way to go here. Good talk bro.

Technically selling bitcoin even locally in the US without getting info from who is buying is illegal. So good luck with that. And good luck with finding a service in the US that will not comply with court ordered subpoenas.

nah bro lets keep this in our parents basement and silk road..
it amazes me that people in this sub actually think that coinbase should somehow not comply with a legal subpoena for information.

please dont fact us. we have our pitchforks out here.

Bitcoin is anonymous but anonymity is not the primary function. Also bitcoin the protocol cannot control. How private entity's use it. If those private entity's want to be legally compliant like any other banking institutions in the country they will have to comply with subpoenas like coinbase did.
