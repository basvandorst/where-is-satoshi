Leave this sub or ask yourself; how did bitcoin become big?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:40:39
I have a simple test.
1. Do you believe in cryptocurreny long term?
2. Do you believe in bitcoin as a cryptocurrency long term?
3. Are you willing to invest not more than you can afford to lose?
If 3x yes: buy!

Im not to tech savvy, but when I look at the TX is see 2 ouputs  with "Unable to decode output address" - so how does that work? Is that some segwit made contract? And how does that btc return to the main chain?

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:02
Alternative which you can use offline:
Generate an 18 word seed, and use BIP49 derivation. You will now get a series of segwit adressess (starting with a '3'). The seed you generated can also be used in Electrum 3.0 (make sure to use the m/49'/0'/0'/0 derivation path).

When talking to n00bs; I compare it with e-mail. The e-mail adress is public and for anyone to know, but if you want to send e-mail from an e-mail adress, you need a password :) Anyone can send you mail when they know your e-mail adress.

It was also really understandable to do with a series of 4 YouTube video's from this user:  I booted up a docker via Digital Ocean, synced with Bitcoin core, ran a lightning node and funded a channel with "Sleepyark", the current Blockstream node. Got an error when I tried to make a payment while being connected to another node other than "Sleepyark" l, but I could easily close and fund a new channel. Also, with the current fees, I was able to get my remainng satoshis back onchain with only 1 sat/b in fees!
