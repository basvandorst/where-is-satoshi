With the coldcard you can keep it completely airgapped from the internet. I had a trezor and now the thought of using my web browser (which tends to be the point of entry for most malware) to access my private keys seems really reckless. 
The MK2 version of the Coldcard fixes the biggest issue that most people have with them (the buttons). I would also recommend if you buy one to get a power only usb cable PortaPow 3.3ft Data Block Micro USB Cable (2 Pack)   and or a portable battery pack /mophie mophie powerstation Mini External Battery for Universal Smartphones and Tablets (3,000mAh) - Black  to power it. 
Having those things will make the experience better and you will be assured that your private keys do not touch the web.

That is exactly what I was going to say. 
I get the feeling that the market in general has not hit the “Oh F$?c# I hate bitcoin I am never doing that again” point. People are too optimistic right now.

I'd settle for something that is not laggy as hell. it doesn't even have to look pretty but it has to be responsive or it is a no go

For example you get a new hardware wallet and generate a wallet seed ... is there the possibility that you in the randomness of the universe hit a jackpot and are given the seed to a major exchange wallet?

Just wait till you hear a few years down the road that your title company stored all your docs on an amazon bin that had the permissions set wrong allowing anyone to download that info. These companies need to have real consequences for not securing our data. At worst they get a slap on the wrist and we are the ones that get screwed.

Here is the easiest thing you can do if you are not trading and just Holding ... get an Opendime from Coinkite  [ 
You plug it into a computer it has a file on it with bitcoin addresses that you can send the bitcoin to. 
Those coins can't be spent from the open dime unless part of the device is snapped off of it. The keys are stored on an EPROM which is rated for 20-100 years (much longer than other forms of digital storage) You can be assured that your btc is safe on there. This is what I would recommend to my grandma if she was in your situation and I couldn't directly be there to help her

BTC still inflates just at a very slow predetermined rate ... 12.5 BTC with each new block.
Deflationary would be taking BTC away reducing the total number of available BTC

Welcome to the game, you are ahead of most of the world despite what others may say in here...
Don't be afraid to ask questions, that is how you will learn and hopefully make educated decisions from. When you first start out you have no way of knowing that using a certain wallet is risky or even why it is a problem. For now though you are probably best leaving the BTC on Coinbase till you read up and figure out some of the reasons why certain wallets are better than others, and fully understand the security that you are taking on by storing your own BTC. 
A few tips:
1. If you transfer your BTC to CoinbasePro before you transfer it out to your cold wallet you can avoid the fees. 
2. I would highly recommend getting a Hardware wallet  (Coldcard, Opendime, Trezor) buy it direct from the vendor (no ebay amazon,craigslist etc). Once you get it play with it and send yourself a small amount of BTC to make sure that it works like you think it should. 
3. Make a backup of your seed words and any passphrases or Pins that you use.. Hand write these on paper or etch/engrave them into metal and save a copy of this in a safe place. having a copy in multiple places is even better if you can trust where it is stored.

Your prices are way out of whack!  Not sure where you think you are getting 1000 fried shrimp for the same price as 1 Calamari.

Sorry for your loss. 
One other device that may have not been mentioned is a Cold card wallet... it uses a microsd card  to store the wallet file and create transactions on it. This device is clear plastic and looks kinda like a pocket calculator.  you will need the 2 part pin to be able to access the wallet. Do not randomly try numbers on it as it may be set to brick itself if the wrong codes are entered.

As long as you have your seed words and passphrase you can restore the wallet from the ledger to most any other hd wallet so you are safe there even if they go under. However I do understand the feeling, I had a Trezor and it sketched me out to be interacting with my keys in a web browser. I eventually got a coldcard and it doesn’t touch the internet ever.

When 50-100k is the new normal the network will be fine.... it is the drastic moves up or that get people moving their BTC in and out of exchanges.  Once prices stabilizes the tx counts drop and mempool drains

if you mine on nicehash you will get about 22 cents per day... if your computer is going to be on and running all day anyways it is an easy way  to build some BTC that one day will be worth way more than it is worth today. 
Effectively you will be taking a long position on the BTC that you earn today that may not pay off till the price goes to the moon. If you are looking to make cash for today it is not worth it.

you will make about $0.40/day

someone is storing data on the blockchain doing a null data transaction
this is the data in that output:  48098b1a9a5f758e3c7a8b55e2691560199f4cbb922d951565d297afe163ed31
it could be pretty much anything from a proof of life transaction to a stock ticker or just a random value for someones charting app
here is a link that explains:

As they refine their documentation and possibly add circuitry to clean up the incoming power to take care of the typing issue it will be possibly the best option out there for cold storage. I'm not upset that I spent the money on it as it seems to be worth every satoshi, I just had some constructive criticism to help make it a better product .

I found that using a battery bank for the power made a huge difference with typing... 
ran into the same issue with the p2sh wallet (I ended up having to restore my seed words into electrum and then send the btc out of that wallet, then wipe the CC and created a new seed). Very frustrating!
I agree there is a bit of a learning curve and documentation could be a whole lot better. I even suggested to their support to warn users that they can’t sign P2SH transactions but it sounds like they haven’t updated that.
I wouldn’t and didn’t recommend CC to my dad recently due to the learning curve (however I do trust the CC more than other options)

They are dusting your wallet ... those tx can be used to link you to other transactions. I am not familiar with Exodus wallet but some wallets have a feature where you can set those to be un-spendable so that they cant be used to trace and eventually identify you or anyone that you send BTC to.

He bought up the extra land that surrounds the Tahoe Reno industrial park (houses tesla, switchnap, apple, google and a ton of other places). If they want to grow the industrial park they will have to buy land back from him. 
Also there really are not any houses close by (25-30 min drive to sparks or Fernley) so developing housing out there will be very profitable.

The one I got had 1 payment but very small like they were testing the address. 
 
.0001 BTC
Also the one I got had him checking his email every 20 mins. Hmm maybe a script to send out various versions to avoid detection

@_date: 2018-12-18 15:37:39
Opendime is what you are looking for... you can get a 3 pack.  They don’t need to know anything to be able to keep the BTC safe other than to keep it like it is cash

I had that happen to me once, I hit use max and it did not transfer all of the Satoshi s 
... I manually type in the values now to be sure and got set up on a different exchange because of all the greedy fees that CB charges.
