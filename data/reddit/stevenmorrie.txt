Thank you!!  I new of bitcoin back when it was $2 per coin.  I didn't buy because I'm an idiot.  But, now I'm glad to be someone working for it because ultimately that's how we change the world.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:03:18
Yup. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:37:20
Sorry, I'll try and be clearer.  How's this?
There are two Q:
ONE: How can I earn 50k (USD equivalent) of bitcoins in Tue next 6 months?
The second, related Q is:
TWO:  what do those people who are 'rich' in bitcoins need the most? Or a lot of? What are they in the market for that I can sell? Or what work can I do for them that they'd pay for?

Thanks.  I will have a look.

I want to see this so bad.  What counts as proof?
You think I'm just a crank?
I could sent you a photo of my lawyer card?but I don't think that proves anything really.  
 I don't know what else I can really prove.  I'm legit though. 
I am a crank.  A little device that causes revolutions. :)

This would be a dream gig.  Essentially building an EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) for bitcoin and all online currencies.  Ive got the policy, advocacy, law and education to do it, but id need serious funding.  I didn't make this post with this in mind, but really, the community could probably throw down a couple hundred k a year to fund this.  I'd take 50 for myself and pay a few others to help.

I don't believe in fiat enough to trick someone into swapping bitcoin for worthless fiat.  
You have to take my response in context.  I was told the btc rich had a particular view (honey badger...) And so I responded to the generlisation.  I accept there are always outliers.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:49:00
I have a job that pays that, but I want out of that economy.  
Surely the bitcoins rich have different needs.  Not least bitcoin advocacy.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:58:55


Yes.  The latter is what I meant, it will become the basis of a factional reserve system. I understand there is a hard limit in the coin.  
As for people will avoid bit, well I disagree.  Try to imagine you knew nothing about how currency works.  Why would you avoid it?  
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:24:17
They have that same expression on wall street.  Ultimately, either bitcoin will be forced to go fractional reserve if the bitcoin rich don't reject that attutude.  Although I suppose if one is in the top 1%btc holders than one might legitimately sell out.  
I won't convert fiat.  I can't see how that is anything other than inflationary.  Sigh.  I suppose I hoped the rich here were not _homo economicus_.  In hindsight that was stupid of me.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:24:49
Hmm.  Lots. But ultimately banks are slave drivers.  Vampires. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:39:53
Interesting.  So how much would one pay to back up ones private keys?  Also id have thought there were many existing services for this.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:03:57
I can't do any (well I can code but am fucking rusty). 
I want to trade something real world.  I can make fountains :) or I can give legal and management consulting like advice.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:29:37
~~Maybe! Someone could put me on their payroll.  :)~~
Oh wait I didn't realize this was a thing.  I see.  Still means using fiat though eh?

In light of Bitlicense (for example), can I invite you to reconsider?  Old money (fiat, debt etc) has tens of thousand of smart people, and thousands of really really smart people spruiking for it.  Advocating for it.  'Fighting' for it.  
Bitcoin has lots of grass roots support, but who are the skilled advocates, professional manipulators, politicians, organized groups, PR people who are pushing for bitcoin?
And when you see Bitlicense, how can you avoid the conclusion that these people are failing. 
I don't want to take away from the genuine efforts of people who really support bitcoin both selfishly and also unselfishly, for the greater good.  But our opponents are skilled, and we need to arm ourselves.   
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:20:13
I'm 100% sincere.  It has to be possible, and why not come to the place where the bitcoins are to learn how to acquire them?
I hope your answer doesn't limit comments here.  Would you consider deleting it?
