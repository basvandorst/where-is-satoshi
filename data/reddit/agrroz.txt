Manufacturing a ASIC on a leading node costs 10s of millions of USD to begin with. That's before you have built a single machine, only really SHA-256 has the track record for investments like that from traditional companies.
I've not kept up on the memory algos like dagger in the last year, but I doubt even if it's feasible to create a profitable ASIC today for them (with today's ETH prices) I doubt that's where Samsung would go first.

There are still many problems with this theory though.
Let's assume the "Tether is air" theory is correct.
Where do the coins go that they are buying? if they are just unloading them for "real" USD then the net effect is pretty much 0. For them to pump the price it would imply them having to be "hoarding" BTC (real or imaginary). With imaginary I mean there's for example a possibility bitfinex is running at fractal reserve of BTC and using tether to buy real BTC to plug the holes.
Also short term all a tether collapse would mean is a "bank run" on Tether. People would sell Tether at any price pushing up the prices of crypto on those exchanges.  
Yes long term there will be negative impact since the perceived wealth of affected individuals has gone down. People who lose money in crypto do in many cases end up returning later however.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:07:10

If Bcash continues to slide we might see another spam/pump attack after next diff change of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:59:23
And where did all the crypto bought go? For the assumption to be true of tether propping up the price they can't have sold any serious amount of what they acquired. Every trade has a seller and buyer, if tether collapses it will create a bank run on tether itself. Guess what people will mainly convert their worthless tether into? Crypto.
If tether is a scam, any crypto gotten by imaginary USD has more than likely already been laundered out of crypto into fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:47:53
Or they realized that what Tether is doing (issuing IOUs pegged to USD) is probably illegal under US law or something without a license. Then they probably pulled out since they didn't want to put their name on it after that.

3-5 years seems reasonable, I don't see a real uptrend starting until the gox distribution is "diffused" and the threat of large supplies of coins being dumped is gone sometime next year, then give it another year before a real uptrend starts after the next halving happens.
Then again Bitcoin always moves faster and slower than anyone expects.
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:51:19


You do realize that Bitmain would more than likely be the first to market with whatever PoW we choose to replace SHA256 with? It is perfectly possible they would even profit from your "lesson" by having weeks or even months of complete ownership of all hash power. Right now mining is rather unprofitable due to the massive expenditure on electricity, if you were the sole holder of ASIC hardware you could let the difficulty sit at nearly nothing of current levels while still keeping general purpose hardware out of the mining game. You profits would be astronomical until competition showed up.
They have streamlined production and shorter time to market than just about anyone (this is the tech industry as a whole btw). They are extremely competent at what they do and already have the infrastructure in place for mass production. No western company can feasibly compete on agility in this space, you need to be located in China to shave days/weeks off delays on shipments and turn around that would otherwise delay your time to market.
The only people that could feasibly beat them in an open race would be Intel or Samsung due to the sole reason that they have control over their own leading node foundries. Having to rely on either TSMC or Samsung is the one chip Bitmain does not have in it's bags.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:46:18
Ah yes, let's piss off the market leader who at current date may or may not have enough mining power to 51% attack the network. You would also severely damage all the smaller miners that exist in the space (who cares about collateral damage hurhurdurh), these players have even less resources than Bitmain to get back into the space, have you given them any thought at all? Trying to harm Bitmain does more damage to them since they do not have the same resources at hand.
Also once you obsoleted all of Bitmain's gear and they are first to market for a new PoW you trust them to be benevolent dictators with their 100% share of global hash rate? I mean with this logic maybe we should nuke some random Russian city, that would teach them to stay out of western politics!

Yes and the price difference can be 5x (or more) depending if you pay retail prices or are a large customer. There simply is no equal playing field to be had in this space, just forget it. Also while there are several design firms of FPGAs there really only is altera and xilinx when talking high performance, cheap easy to be had FPGAs simply would be noncompetitive from a performance/power standpoint.
Also you still need the engineers for rapid FPGA deployment, while pretty much anyone can re-program an FPGA with the right instructions doing the initial design work is not, you would essentially be at the mercy of someone else releasing a design if you don't have your own design team/engineers.

@_date: 2018-05-13 07:35:01
The dangers of deflation are related to fractional reserve based debt, the simple solution is to never issue debt denominated in BTC but always anchor the the loan in a inflationary currency (even if the recipient gets BTC from the loan). 
This is why BTC and government fiat can go hand in hand, one is a store of value based on nothing else than networking effect, the other is essentially a credit score for the nation issuing the currency.
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:51:44

When prices were high they could rake in orders for "old tech" miners that were already amortized from RnD standpoint with ludicrous profit margins. Bitmain has always priced their miners based on estimated earnings in a set time frame, those earnings are A LOT lower now than 6 months ago.

It doesn't cost billions to develop and deploy a ASIC, at the high side you are looking at 1-200 million in total cost for development and tape out on leading edge nodes. This is not GPUs or CPUs where just development and research can run into the billions, mining ASICs are single application solutions that can rapidly be prototyped and deployed compared general purpose hardware. If you have the engineers at hand you could have working FPGA prototypes within days of a PoW switch, more optimized configurations within weeks that you would tape put. 
Even if they do not have the money themselves with their track record in the space they would have no issue raising investor money. They have the infrastructure and industry contacts to beat essentially anyone else to the market. 
The only other companies on earth that could arguably beat them at their own game would be Intel and Samsung since they have the benefit of their own foundries, no amount of money could get TSMC to move wafers at the speed trough a fab that Intel/Samsung could do if they dropped everything else at hand. 
But even they do not have the streamlined assembly setup that Bitmain is running, in the "normal" world 3-4 months delay in time to market does not make or break your product, in the mining world it does. This is one reason why so many projects have failed over the years while Bitmain was successful, say what you want about them but they are really damn good at what they do when it comes to manufacturing.
Edit: And if you say "you can't spend hundreds of millions on new designs if we keep switching PoW", that won't work either. There are older nodes with MUCH lower costs, single millions and even hundreds of thousands for somewhat modern nodes. You simply can't win a wack a mole PoW scenario if someone has resources and intent, worst case they would just build a FPGA farm and you wouldn't even obsolete their hardware, they would just need a few days to prototype a new design.

Also the fact that no alt coin ever truly goes to zero, as long as they retain any value at all and BTC doesn't go up in value indefinitely the BTC dominance will always go down. I mean Bitconnect still has a market cap of millions ffs.
Market cap is just a very poor metric when there are coins valued in the millions with almost no market depth and volume.

You have to distinguish between soft forks and hard forks, soft forks can be pushed by miners, and users can completely disregard that they exist since they are backward compatible, for all intents and purposes nothing changed if you decided to still sit on old client that has no Segwit support other than that you can't accept/send Segwit transactions.
However if miners try to push a hard fork which breaks compatibility with none supporting clients they stand to loose potentially ALL users, a chain with no user support has a grand total of zero value. 
Hard forks can only realistically be done with overwhelming majority user support, if you try do them without user support (or minority support) you end up with a minority chain that can not be considered to be the "real" "whatever coin" you started with and the value of the chain will be reflective of this.

The same was said for the tech industry/internet, yet it found it's uses cases and adoption came with it, If crypto is buried and forgotten a decade from now I would be highly surprised, the "I told you so" people always likes to gloat and misses the long term aspects completely.
Could this be the last purely speculatively driven bubble of crypto? Sure, doesn't mean we can't see higher prices in the future. Personally however I still think there is another speculation bubble to come, it will however take regulation and infrastructure to be in place first.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:15:56
It's one thing doing it when you have the infrastructure in place, another entirely if our entire society would be affected at once. "Hunting, fishing and foraging" could sustain a small fraction of our population only, the competition for resources would be fierce and a large portion of the population would simply starve to death. 
Even if we miraculously would manage to start farming all our current farmland with "traditional" methods overnight, the yields would be so low compared to today's farming that again we are looking at extreme famine on a large scale, to not talk about how distribution would be impossible.
There simply is no "going back to basic" for the western world without large scale depopulation. The developing world would fare a lot better but even they in one way or another rely on "the modern world" for many things.
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:46:15


The only problem then is that you need a very high initial valuation to make it harder for someone to try and corner the market. It's no different than Bitmain hording BCH and then trying to push it as "the real Bitcoin".

The idea is that gox might move into civil rehabilitation instead of bankruptcy (since gox is solvent now in fiat terms). That is the only way BTC claimants will get a higher distribution than their calculated fiat claims. 
To make that possible all claims have to be covered in full (all current bitcoin claims are valued in fiat), this also includes things like pending lawsuits (that may or may not pay out), also  claims for actual fiat etc. There is probably also need to set aside a substantial amounts of buffer funds to handle the civil rehabilitation and distribution etc, having mtgox go bankrupt again during civil rehabilitation would be rather pointless after all &gt;_&gt;

Back in 2014 the dropping miner revenue was compensated for by the vastly increased efficiency/performance of each new generation of miners. Now miners have caught up to the leading node of semiconductor manufacturing and there is no longer going to be any giant leaps, instead the best they can expect is 2x performance/watt per generation (every 2~ years).

The next halvening + Mtgox distribution should somewhat coincide with the time period when LN starts being usable/adopted. Give it 18-24 months before things starts moving again. Who knows, maybe the stars align and we have a Bitcoin ETF by then as well.
The upside of low price and low mining profitability is that companies like Bitmain has less ammo to fuck around with the ecosystem.

A large part of the gox coins have also been sold already, that means there is a large amount of fiat to be distributed, the whole thing could conceivably generate buying rather than selling pressure.
I do agree on the BCH situations though, it and any other forks distributed to gox claimants will have a bad time when it happens.
Edit: Essentially Gox has secured $480 per BTC claimed, this is why they sold, to cover all claims in full. As I understand it the remaining BTC would be distributed pro-rata after claims are paid.

The whole point of moving from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation as I've understood it is to enable payouts "above" the yen claim amount. Under bankruptcy law the claim amount would be the absolute maximum anyone would get, rest would be assets belonging to Gox itself. Under civil rehabilitation however the BTC Gox holds can be distributed pro-rata to BTC claimants unless I'm mistaken.
The selloff was probably a requirement for civil rehabilitation to be possible. Gox needed to be solvent and have enough fiat to cover 100% of claims and any other outstanding debt/running costs.

That depends entirely on tuning, without also knowing the performance/area it's hard to say how it compares to current 16nm offerings. It makes sense to "overclock" a design early on to get as much performance out of them as possible (to a degree), later on you start tuning for efficiency to keep them profitably as difficulty rises.
Just take the first antminer as an example, it did around 180 GH/s at the shipped settings if I remember correctly. Later on people were pencil modding resistors on the miners to drop the voltage and managed to get them down to almost 1GH/watt. However they had to pay a performance price for it since they could only get 100-120GH/s out of them at that point, but antminers at stock settings didn't generate profits anymore at that time so it made sense to do the trade off.

Number 3 is a big one that so many people misses when they critize BTC. So many people are trying to pin the block reward as a cost on transactions, rather than it being the feature of getting past the problem of initial distribution. 
When you ask them how to else solve initial distribution in a sensible way that doesn't either turn BTC into a security or is open for exploitation I've yet to get a answer that would work.

There will be a bloodbath when Mtgox distribution happens most likely for Bcash. If MtGox claimants have a similar distribution as the crypto community as a whole of BTC vs BCH there will be massive sell pressure. 
Even if every BCH supporter that gets coins from Gox decides to HODL the wast majority of will be dumped on the market immediately.
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:51:44
Some of the "lucky" people were those with fiat on Gox that bought when it crashed hard internally on Gox. From what I remember the speculations back then were that only fiat would be honored in a bankruptcy, iirc it crashed below $100 while the price on "real" exchanges was still $4-500. 
Those people who bought "Goxcoins" at those prices will make a decent profit after all of this is done. For every &lt;$100 they spent they will be given $480 + part of the BTC stash.
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:46:47
Gox already sold a lot of the coins, if we see a sell off or buying spree depends on the split between "HODLERS and sellers" of the Gox claimants.
What we know is that every claimant will be paid at least $480/BTC (in fiat) plus probably 0,1~ BTC per BTC claimed.

Not even necessarily new hardware, large operations more than likely have the incentive and ability to re-tune for efficiency.
Running at lower frequency and voltage compared to "stock" can result in massive increases in efficiency. Just take the old Bitmain S1 that shipped at 180GH/s but was kept relevant by it's ability to undervolt. 
If I remember correctly it was possible to get it as low as 100GH/s which put it almost in the ballpark of the efficiency the Bitmain S3 shipped at. It essentially gave the S1 another 6-12 months of profitability before it became junk.

No this is like the 5th time, it's just that previously it mainly affected AMD cards only. 
First time was in 2011 when Radeon 5xxx/6xxx were out of stock for 1-2 months due to the first mining craze. 
2nd time was around the 2013/2014 bubble, alt coins went crazy and r9 290/290x were bought in droves. AMD then decided to increase production and got stuck with inventory when the craze died down, this is the main reason they have been so reluctant to increase production this time around.
3rd time happened around the RX470/480 release, everyone tried to grab them to replace their aging hardware for mining ETH, the RX cards had much better performance/watt than Tahiti/Hawaii based cards. Margins were a lot lower back then so power efficiency was extremely important for long term profits.
It wasn't until the 4th mining bubble or w/e that Nvidia really got dragged in last summer.

It's kind of funny actually, people simply don't understand the semiconductor industry.
As long as the price was low it was easy for Bitmain to maintain a near monopoly. The tape out costs were simply to high compared to whatever part of the market you were expected to capture.
As the space grew and mining reward revenue skyrocketed the risk/reward of spending 10s to upwards of 100M on designing and taping out your own mining chips looked a lot different.
We were actually somewhat lucky the bubble happened when it did, it was just when the transition from 14/16nm to 7nm started. The advantage of the "first mover" in this space is never weaker than when all old hardware is about to be obsolete in the near future.

That's just Intel, Samsung/GF/TSMC all seems to be on track to roll out 7nm late this year/first half next year. Their 7nm is about equal in density to Intel's 10nm or slightly better. When it comes to performance (frequency scaling) Intel will most likely hold the upper hand still, that's one of the main things they tune their process for.
And I wouldn't expect it to slow down anytime soon. We finally are rolling out EUV after decades of research, this will lower the complexity with less need for multi patterning. 
The major hurdles will start to show up 2-3 node shrinks after "10/7nm", that's when the physics of silicon itself starts to become a serious problem.

Nokia reached the point where they were essentially competing with themselves, that situation is very dangerous since it leads to lack of innovations and forward thinking. All focus is instead of streamlining and short term cost cutting.
Just look at AMD vs Intel where Intel has been sitting on the same architecture with marginal improvements for close to a decade. They essentially gave AMD a free chance to make a comeback with a RnD budget a fraction of Intel's.
Now AMD has a architecture that offers same or BETTER performance per watt than Intel's offerings. How you allow that to happen is just mind boggling, Intel owned the x86 market and essentially threw it away to chase short term profits.

There are so many problems with a PoW change it's not even funny.
1. Who gets to decide the new PoW?
2. How do we ever trust the chosen PoW?
3. If it's ASIC immune how do we trust that no one doesn't have a advantage in optimized/exploitative gpu mining software? 
4. If it's not ASIC immune but friendly/resistant how do we trust that the chosen PoW has not had hardware developed behind the scenes or is broken in some way? 
5. Short of spinning the wheel and picking PoW at random on the day of the fork, how could you ever trust anyone's opinions/suggestions for the choice of PoW.
These arguments of PoW changes are so retarded I can't even get my head around them. Especially suggesting to switch to another ASIC friendly PoW algo. You just end up with the same hurdles and bar of entry. No matter what you do it will still cost 10s of millions to create a ASIC on leading edge node, whoever does it first will be the new Bitmain (do we then start over again?).
They want Bitmain's dominance to go away, they should find investors and start a better mining manufacturer. 
Bitmain would have no troubles dominating any new ASIC friendly algo (So what was the point of switching then?).  
The irony with Bitmain being the dominant manufacturer is that they were the "good guys", one of the main reasons why some of the previous mining manufactuers went bust is that they let themselves be ruled by greed. There was a time when Bitmain was almost the sole manufacture to sell their hardware to "normal" people. 
Where is KNC today? They had first mover advantage over Bitmain, they could have been Bitmain. Instead they choose to fill their warehouses with their miners and declared bankruptcy when "unfair Chinese electricity prices" made them unprofitable during the 2014-2015 bear market. Bitfury could also have been Bitmain, but they went a similar route and refused to sell hardware. They tried to be gold miners and forgot they were supposed to sell shovels to people who are bad at basic math, Bitmain has always been very good at estimating just how far they can push their pricing on miners.
Edit: I almost forgot, I suggest Bitmain to send some hardware to luke for "testing" like the much more reputable US based BFL did (hurhurdurh). 
Maybe then they can get on his good side, oh ye and didn't Luke also get one of the very first "minirigs" that were built by BFL? Way ahead of other people early in the queue (could be remembering wrong)

All it takes is a competent design team and money, then you can enter this market, after that it becomes a race to the bottom who can build the cheapest miner. SHA256 miners have also reached the end of their progress node wise, they are now sitting on leading edge node so progress will slow down.

How many Bitfury machines were sold to "normal" users compared to Bitmain? Bitmain survived 2014/1015 bear market by not relying on mining income alone, they were still selling hardware unlike companies like KNC. 
KNC essentially fucked themselves by hoarding equipment themselves and then when the bear market struck they couldn't stay profitable. Yes they blame ASICboost and Chinese electricity prices, but had they sold the hardware in the first place they would still have been around, killed by their own greed.

The industrial use of gold today is around 10% or so of production (except jewelry), if gold was seen purely as a industrial metal the price would be a fraction of todays, a lot of the pure gold mining operations would not be viable and it would mostly come as a byproduct from other mining operations.
If things were equal gold would be well below the platinum group of metals in price, they have far more industrial use and value (also all more rare than gold).

With horrendous cost per gigabyte, call me in 2 decades when nand finally costs less than traditional HDDs (if we even get there by then).
Unless nand fails to scale which is a real possibility, planar nand has serious issues with scaling on lower nodes. We reset the scaling by going 3D nand a couple of years ago, it made larger capacities using older nodes possible by essentially stacking several layers. However the same fundamental issues with scaling nand to smaller nodes still remains.
We have also gotten a lot of the gains by going from SLC &gt; MLC &gt; TLC and now to QLC. The question is however how far reading multiple voltage levels in a single cell can be pushed.

How do you plan to to scale this? Moore's law as we know it is in it's final years. The exponential scaling of computing power and storage we have built the IT age upon is coming to an end.
Yes we might sew new paradigms in computing, we might have a revolution in storage technology. However at the moment there is no clear path to keep progress going the way we have for the last 40 years. For all intents and purposes we are still making computer chips the same way as in the 70s and "spinning rust" is still the majority technology for bulk storage.
After 2010 storage density for hard drives have barely improved, yes we have gotten drives with higher capacity. That has been achieved mainly by increasing the numbers of platters used however, this has meant that the price/Gigabyte has not come down as much. 
There is some density scaling coming out with HAMR/MAMR, however even these won't restore the rate of progress we used to have. Worth noting is also that HAMR really is a "last effort" technology in many ways. It's been avoided due to research costs and problems with implementation (drive lifespan concerns) for as long as possible.

Yes they are doing perfectly fine with the shit show that is Meltdown added to the mix, their PR department might have made a good job at spinning it as no big deal (that seems to be where Intel spends it cash these days). However I can tell you outside of the public eye in the hosting/cloud business people are fuming about how Intel has tried to deflect the spectre/meltdown debacle.
The server industry turns it wheels slowly, it will take a year or two before the effects of EPYC and now Meltdown will start to have any effect on Intel's bottom line but it will come. Intel's days of charging whatever they want for products are over for now.
This might not mean Intel won't grow, the server business is growing after all, they will however lose market share and my guess is margins will go down.

If GPU mining grows another 200-300% there might be more GPUs mining than used for actual gaming. I mean what's the use for consumer hardware then when it all gets centralized anyway?

So when we are finally reaching a revenue level of SHA256 mining where other big players might want to enter the space we should change PoW? Smart move.
If we are in the same situation in another 2 years I would probably change opinion. However Bitmain partly got to where they are due to not being overly greedy. 
We had this Swedish mining company called KNC, KNC used crowd funding for their miners. They only ever sold any product to their pre-order customers, once that was done they only built miners for themselves, then filled their warehouses and had the audacity to do the same all over for the next generation of miners.
To bad for KNC we had a 2 year bear market and they eventually became unprofitable. Had they just sold hardware directly they could easily have raised enough funds to move to leading node. They also would not have had to deal with the massive overhead of hosting miners in Sweden of all places, I mean we are not known for cheap labor costs and low taxes are we? From a quote I saw from the KNC founders they were paying something retarded like 0,2$/Kwh, that's more than I pay for residential power in Sweden ffs.
Bitfury is a similar story if I remember correctly, use crowdfunding to get started and then stop selling to the community that bootstrapped them. And let's not get started about Avalon and BFL. At least Bitmain has continuously supplied hardware to other people than themselves.

As long as they share the same PoW as Bitcoin they will be considered worse. It would take a fraction of the available mining power to attack BCH since it's the minority coin. Essentially they exist at the mercy of anyone that has 10%~ (or even less) of total SHA 256 mining power at hand.

To bad it's not about the equilibrium we would finally end up at, we would have YEARS before we could secure enough hardware from Intel/AMD/Nvidia to be "safe" from actors that already have the hardware at hand. 
There simply is not capacity to manufacture that amount of hardware in the fabs available, also fab expansions takes 3 years or more. While Bitmain has been using quite a bit of wafer capacity at TSMC they are a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of silicon Intel ships each year.
Even then the way cloud services are growing single entities like Amazon might have enough hardware to attack the network at some point. Even at 5 billion a year in network rewards it's not enough to secure us versus state actors, it's chump change compared to the global volume of general purpose hardware shipped each year.

Alright I'll post this again then. You are missing how the semiconductor industry works and the time to market in this space. 
If Bitmain decided to increase planed production (what happened in dec/jan) They would be at the mercy of the following things.
1. First they need higher wafer allocation, this can be instant or take 3+ months depending on how busy the fabs are and how much pull you have with them (or are willing to pay). We know TSMC and Samsung have had very high utilization so to expect them to start production on Bitmain orders sooner than within 1-2 months of order date is quite unreasonable. Let's say 1 month, this is Apple level of priority, maybe Bitmain pays that well.
2. It then takes on average 10-12 weeks to for a wafer to go from a slice of silicon to a finished chip. Fab processing is not a "rapid process" as you describe.
3. You will need at least 1-2 additional weeks for transport/assembly, the mining facilities are not next door to the assembly plants, assembly plants not next door to TSMC/Samsung in Korea etc. That assumes no supply constraint or bottle necks in the assembly line, which you will have, no one has unlimited capacity.
In essence you are looking at bare minimum of 3-4 months from the date you are deciding to increase production until more miners starts rolling out of you factory. More realistic is 4-5, this is why the "why aren't AMD/Nvidia increasing production" complaints over in /hardware during the mining boom were so laughable, people think you can push out more product with a weeks notice in this space when production is planed 12+~ months in advance.

@_date: 2018-07-12 11:06:19


If you were more familiar with the semiconductor industry and the delay to market you would understand that what we are seeing now is still an effect of the Dec/Jan prices. Planed/bought capacity from back then is still being deployed today.
First of the fabs rarely if ever has spare capacity, getting wafer allocation can take months. If you are a large preferred customer or are prepared to pay higher prices you can get past it somewhat by jumping the queue (but only to a certain extent).
Then you are looking at something like 6-18~ weeks from start of the fab process until finish. It varies depending on your chip design, and I frankly don't know where the average mining chip falls on the spectrum.
Add another 1-2 weeks minimum of shipping of parts and assembly until the miners are ready in a mining facility. The 1 week time frame pretty much assumes expedited shipping of chips by air and that all other components/assembly facilities are available beforehand.

Is Bitmain's asicboost a conspiracy theory now? 
They have a significant profitability advantage when mining BCH and previously BTC.  The advantage they lost when Segwit was implemented on Bitcoin.
You don't think they had economic incentive to keep BCH alive and market price high to increase their profitability? BCH is a flat 15-20% mining profitability increase for Bitmain since asicboost still works when mining it, if you don't think that's incentive enough to try and fuck with the entire ecosystem then I don't know what to tell you.

So how else would you describe a gradual loss of importance and dominance that took over half a century to play out? To make sure we are on equal footing, here you have the dictionary definition of "fade away"
"to slowly disappear, lose importance, or become weaker:"
Even if WW2 was the sole reason for the shift it would be an apt description. It didn't result in a quick or even fast shift out of the sterling. It took 10+ years before Sterling even went below 50% of world reserves, 20 years before it went below 25%. That decline is not that much faster than the USD had during the 70s after Nixon dumped the gold standard for example. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:05:12
And yet Sterling reserves were 25%+ until the early 1960s, there was no mass dumping of Sterling, instead countries stopped accumulating and growth/inflation lowered GBP's part of global reserves mainly.
What is more worrying for the US is the demise of the SWIFT network, when they lose that bargaining chip one of their major sources of "soft power" is removed. It's what make US able to bully it's way around being able to sanction countries even if every other country in the world opposes them. All you have to do is wave the "lose swift access" card and almost every major bank in the world will come crawling begging for forgiveness.

And yet they weren't the first, KNC could have made enough money from selling their entire 28nm production to beat Bitmain before they got off the ground.
Instead KNC (and Bitfury) were betting on making more money long term from mining themselves. KNC also had a horribly inefficient/expensive product (comparatively), however that was a trade off to have fast time to market. KNC used a large monolithic die and used very expensive components for their VRMs, Bitmain simply beat them with a better design (and we want them to be punished for it?)
I have zero sympathies for the mining companies that are struggling/are out of business. Most of them fucked over customers in one way or another, many of them worse than Bitmain ever did. "But they are Chinese" some people will say, well tell that to all the people who got fucked over by Butterflylabs, I bet it will make them feel a lot better.
Ah ye who was it that got early miners from BFL now again?  I guess Bitmain has not sent enough hardware to Luke for "testing" to be on his good side. He also got one of the very first "minirigs" delivered, he might actually have paid for that one however (my memory is fuzzy). No question he jumped the queue however.

As in they can't brute force progress by using node shrinks anymore, Bitmain have been making their old hardware obsolete within 6-9 months for the last few years by jumping nodes. Now they are stuck doing node shrinks at the same rate as the rest of the semiconductor space since they have caught up.
This together with BTC mining total revenue growth due to the price increase in the last year makes it a lot more likely that big competitors will emerge. It was one thing throwing 25-50M$ at making a leading node asic when BTC was at 1k, another one entirely when it is at 5-10k. A year ago the total revenue didn't really leave much space for multiple actors, now is another matter. 
It's very similar to the issue Nvidia is facing in the AI/compute market. When the market was relatively small they pretty much were the only gig in town, now when the market is expanding everyone wants a piece of the cake. That doesn't mean Nvidia isn't growing massively in the space, however their market share over time will more than likely decrease as the total market grows.

What? It's you who seem to not understand I'm talking about attacks involving majority hashpower. Something government agencies and large corporations have enough general purpose hardware at hand to do to Monero, today!


You seem to have a poor understanding on how this works. Yes miners can't successfully do a hard fork without users also upgrading and following them since they would ignore a chain not following the consensus rules. Likewise a user implemented hard fork without miners would never activate.
However a 51% attack does not involve doing a hard fork and changing consensus rules. Rewriting block history and doing double spends follows consensus and all nodes will simply follow the chain with the most work done. Sine the attacker has majority hash power guess which chain has the most work done?

No I'm not, I said 3-4 months is bare minimum that is doable at all, but 3 months is unrealistic when you care about profits, the part you conveniently left out.

Yes, it took 2 world wars and the withering away of their empire. The process started way before WW2. There was no overnight overturn, no great collapse. Hell it didn't even destroy GBP as the UKs national currency.
At the same time you had the US emerge as a economic superpower, and yet it wasn't until the 60s that Sterling finally was sidelined by USD.  
Despite WW2 and Bretton Woods it took 15 years for the world to diversify away from the Sterling. Even in the mid 60s more than 20% of global currency reserves were held in GBP.

Who are open to attack from government agencies or large corporation that already has wast amounts of general purpose hardware. 
Also another problem with being minable by CPUs/GPUs is the cost detterant of attacking a network. If Bitmain started attacking the Bitcoin network all their investments into hardware would become worthless. 
If a government or large corporation decided to attack a CPU/GPU minable coin with their existing resources guess what their hardware would be worth after the attack? Essentially the same, the economic deterrent is part of the security model. Remove the deterrent and your security drops considerably.

You can't just look at a product like this and say "why isn't it better"
You can tune a 10nm product to have worse power efficiency than a 28nm, it's all about where on the voltage/frequency scale you decide to tune for. 
The important metrics are in the end production cost, 10nm should have a lot higher performance/area than a 16nm product if they are tuned for similar performance/watt. The only question mark is how mature Samsung's 10nm is, early node products are notorious for under-performing.

It also depends a lot on how much they are pushing the chips, it's the same as with over/underclocking GPUs essentially. Bitmain pushed effiency on both 28/16nm by using more chips run at lower frequency in late gen products iirc. 
What would be more interesting to know is the performance/area while matching bitmain on performance/watt.

Ye my bad, It's getting late over here in Sweden. I was mixing up power scaling as you rightly mentioned is cubed with frequency scaling. I meant to also add that needed voltage for increase in frequency is exponential in reality rather than linear.
However it still doesn't change the fact we can't judge the performance of the Halong ASIC until we know all the metrics, their seeming lack of efficiency could just come from pushing the chips as far as possible, or it could be a under-performing design/node. If I remember correctly Samsung's 10nm node is closer to their 14nm node rather than 7nm for density/power.

To bad the performance scaling of technology we have relied upon for the past 5 decades is breaking down or has already done so. Relying on exponential tech progress based on past history is rather naive at this point in time. When Satoshi made that post we were just starting to see the new reality of tech progress, now we have started to realise what the future will bring (or rather not bring). 
Dennard scaling already broke down around a decade ago (power/frequency scaling). More's Law (density scaling) is slowing to a crawl and we are nearing the end of the road of silicon as a viable material. As it stands we have another decade of pretending More's law is not quite dead yet. If we can find a suitable material to replace silicon we might buy us another decade after that.
The coming decades will have to see new approaches to computing progress, brute forcing it like we have done so far will no longer work. The 2010s so far have seen a large push for parallelization masking the slowing progress, however we will soon run into heavy diminish returns in that area as well as stated by Amdahl's law.

It's funny you would use this quote since Bitcoin and the scaling debate is in essence already a victim of it.
When Bitcoin was conceived we were at the tail end of the era where traditional semiconductor scaling was alive and well, since then the last shreds of hope of Dennard scaling returning are gone and More's Law as we know it is fading. We are reaching the end of an era of progress that has driven the computing world forward like clockwork, right now we have no clear path where to go from here.
We are currently in a paradigm shift, we either find new ways of getting what we used to get for "free" for the past 50 years in the tech sector or technological progress in the semi conductor space will massively slow in the next two decades (very likely, and it's already started). We have gotten by in the last 10 years by pushing for increased parallelization to overcome shortcomings in scaling, that will only take us so far for most tasks however, sooner or later Amdal's Law will come to haunt us.
I do not pretend to know exactly what level of scaling we can afford for the blocksize, I do know however know that those that use past technological progress as the basis for their analysis will be wrong.
