Ok... that might be enough to the keep privacy level reasonable. At least if the user who wants privacy themselves uses more than 2.

Preferably a piece of a automatic code should do the picking. Perhaps just pick every block that would've been valid at a significantly higher difficulty than the chain has at the time and use that as a way to keep the number of blocks sensible.
Of course, the newest picked block should be reasonably old too. maybe 30 day minimum age.

The biggest problems I'm aware of with Monero are that a) Transactions tends to be much bigger (in data size) than in Bitcoin and b) Using the built in mixing feature makes the transactions bigger than strictly necessary, so people tend to opt to not use it, which weakens the privacy for those that do.
An example of b is that, suppose you spend your own output and include only one other output in the mix. Given just your transaction, no-one can tell which output it was you actually spent. Now, if the actual owner of the other output chooses to spend it without mixing, that effectively unmixes your output too.

I suspect 5 years is a more realistic timescale for a hard fork that's mostly just cosmetic.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:53:07
Possible. If we manage to come into consensus about something else. However, once the soft fork is done, it should be trivially easy to come to a consensus about scheduling the hard fork version to happen 5 years later.
If a consensus about another hard fork happens after that, it'll then be trivial to piggyback segwit into it as well.

LN routing can be somewhat difficult to grasp if you approach it from a perspective of looking for the best route available.
First, it's important to realize there are two things in LN that are often referred to with the term "routing". One of them is *route finding* and the other is *payment relay*. *Payment relay* is the more critical part and that part actually doesn't have any scaling related problems. It's the route finding process that's the one where the scaling issues are thought to be.
However, with LN routing, the *route finding* process doesn't necessarily have to be blazing fast. Equally, the routes found don't need to be the very best ones available. As long as they're not too expensive, any route that works is fine. Also, not all the routes found need to actually work. As long as some of them do, that's enough. You will be able to verify all of them in parallel if need be and then pick the best one out of those. That's not an expensive process.
Another thing to note is that *you don't necessarily need to do the route finding step every time* you pay someone. The routes in the network will be relatively static, so if you have the routes saved from a previous *route finding* attempt, you can just check if one of them works and skip the *route finding* process most of the time.
These relaxed requirements allow us to use algorithms that might not even be considered for regular communications routing.
From these, the critical thing to take home is the idea of saved routes. Suppose you want to pay someone you have no route for and suppose the *route finding* algorithm takes hours produce results (to examine a worst case scenario). Also suppose that you both have a database of saved routes to other parties you have paid to (or routed through) previously. Now you compare your saved routes and find that some of those routes go to (or through) the same nodes. You can combine those routes to find a route for your payment almost instantly. It might not be the best or the cheapest possible, but it'll work and it'll work fast.
Now, there are obvious problems with the above as it is. For instance, you don't want to rely on luck to find a route. That'll fail too often. Also, you probably wouldn't want to reveal to everyone you pay who else you've paid. However, both of these can be fixed by also keeping a database of routes merely for the purpose of sharing and combining.
To make sure you always have routes with common nodes to combine. The simplest approach would be to use bitcoin block hashes as input to a pseudorandom number generator to pick the nodes in the LN network that _every node_ will keep a database of routes to for a predetermined amount of time after the block.
So, this only leaves open the question of how do nodes find these routes to the selected landmark nodes? One option is that when a node (or it's direct neighbors) notices that it's been selected as landmark (by a new bitcoin block), it'll send a "pulse" through the network along the channels. Every node that receives that pulse will then repeat it to all other neighbors with the channel the pulse came from added to it. That way every node in the network will get several routes to the node almost immediately after the landmark node is selected. (Obviously, the pulse propagation will need some kind of decay rules built into it so it won't spam the network forever. The specifics aren't important for what I want to express here, however.)
I believe this algorithm to be scalable enough that it'd be sufficient even if LN were to scale to 6 billion users each with several channels.

This will also make multisig transactions the same size as regular transactions, so the effect might be bigger.

No, because the algorithm was quite literally born in my mind as I was writing that comment and trying to explain in what way Lightning's requirements for a routing algorithm differs from the viewpoint of the writer of the earlier comment.


I doubt the exact churn rate can be predicted in advance. Also, I suspect the churn will start out higher than what it'll eventually settle out to be as people find more balanced channel configurations that reduce the need to close channels.

Did you know there's a saying that goes 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions'? This is a model case for why this saying exists. In this case, the scenario you just presented as an argument is a fairy tale. Or perhaps more accurately characterized as 'magical thinking'.
Any comparison between Segwit and this fantasy of yours is about as valid as comparing a real person to a fictitious character in your favorite story.
It sounds simple. Just increase the blocksize to 2MB. However, there's no-one who can decide to do that for everyone. Especially since everyone would need to do so at the same time. Especially so for Bitcoin as the lack of someone in control is like the whole point.
It's especially amusing since you claim no action would need to be taken by exchanges and wallet providers. The reality is that they'd be in at least as big of a mess as we have now. Potentially much much bigger.
Why? Well, there is no 'just increase the blocksize to 2MB'. There's _only_ 'Let's release an altcoin with a blocksize of 2MB and start it off with a copy of Bitcoin's ledger at block X'. 
The closest you can get to the fantasy is that someone releases the altcoin, convinces everyone to agree that it (and only it) will be called Bitcoin from now on and that no-one will ever use the old Bitcoin again. The more people there are that don't sign up for this deal, whether due to outright rejection or just due to not caring enough, the more trouble will be the result.
At this point, you're probably thinking to reply about Segwit not being any better and pointing at the mess we've already had. But it's not really caused by Segwit. In fact, we'd likely be in a much worse mess without Segwit.
With Segwit or without Segwit, eventually some well meaning (or less well meaning) person somewhere would have eventually released their altcoin with bigger blocks and convinced a sizable part of the community to abandon Bitcoin and move to their new shiny altcoin with bigger blocks. Without Segwit, it'd most likely be a somewhat bigger part of the community than it is now.

Not really, any sensible wallets will default to either simply not showing replaceable transactions before they're confirmed or clearly showing them as suspect.
So, if you're a wallet developer, you have to care about it. If you're the user of a wallet, you most likely don't need to care. That is, unless the developer doesn't do their job, which make me wonder why you would use their wallet.

Are you trying to say that 12 people own over 50% of all the mining power? Or is it pools you're talking about?
There's a huge difference between those two. Pools can misuse their power for a short time only, then they lose their miners.
If you're trying to say it's the ownership of the mining devices, that's somewhat more alarming. Although still, would make little sense for them to do anything that'd harm bitcoin. It'd directly devalue their assets greatly.

Also, nodes disappearing is not as big of a problem as it might sound. It's easily mitigated by having several channels. This also allows you to collect some fees for routing other people's transactions on the lightning network.
Although, I doubt most people would bother to have several channels just to mitigate against that. There's nothing to gain from that kind of behauviour. A simple trustless pseudonymous reputation database for nodes is enough to enable completely automated selection of nodes to make channels with. It just simply won't happen often enough in practise to be problem.

Since I'm unable to locate the original comment that contains that, quote, I'll have to guess at what he was actually talking about. The quote alone does not contain enough details to tell for sure. Also there's probably something wrong with the quoted text because the original been removed.
That 10x normal fee most likely refers to _bitcoin transaction fee_, because that's the fee you pay when you close a channel. The normal fee probably refers to whatever transactions would cost when done through lightning. When Bitcoin blockchain is near the limits of it's capacity, that could rise pretty high.
This quote has nothing to do with lightning being trustless or not. The decisive factor in determining whether something is trustless or not is not whether it might cost you something but rather whether the third party can profit by defaulting or not. It's trustless because _no-one can profit by stealing from you_. In other words, there's _no financial incentive for someone force you to pay that bigger fee_.
Adam might have written that, but if so, he also removed it later. That's like admitting it wasn't quite right. Which makes sense because there's no actual need for this sort of insurance.
Every channel is a two-way street. There's no rule that says whose money it is that pays for the reclaim transaction fee. It could even be 50-50, so both lose out equally much if it happens. Or any other split. It's very likely that merchants would be the people who voluntarily choose to shoulder that burden to motivate people to open channels instead of making regular bitcoin transactions to them.
Edit: Doh, found the original. Oh well, doesn't change my reasoning. insurance is not a useful way to solve that issue.

They've got a massive number of users. It's almost guaranteed that there's a way to monetize that big time. That's the reason for the valuation.

quantum computing is not very useful for breaking hashes like SHA-256. Just signature and encryption algorithms like ECDSA or RSA. To attack ECDSA, you need to know the public key. However, most addresses are made from the hash of the public key, which is not enough to start attacking ECDSA. You'd need to break the hash first, which won't be significantly easier with quantum computers.
TL;DR any normal address that hasn't been spent from before is safe. So, if you use Bitcoin the way the developers recommend and don't reuse addresses, your coins are quantum safe, at least for now.

I believe that's how it'll end up being, once miners are ultra-optimized to ink out every shred of profit they can. It's better to delay replaceable transactions because that delay in itself might cause them to be replaced with better fees. Not much hope for that in non-replaceable transactions. So, all else being equal, it's better to leave out replaceable transactions.

Wallet does not need to be open for a channel to stay open. As for channels, the need to close a channel should be extremely rare. Especially once segregated witness upgrade is done (I haven't seen anyone actually oppose that so far, so I expect it'll go through).
Closing one channel and opening a new channel can happen in one transaction. It most likely won't be needed most of the time though. You can just route the payment through the channel network to pay for your coffee.
Anyone with 2 or more channels open can route payments through them for others (and optionally charge fees for it). Whenever there's no channel available to pay someone, it'll be quite lucrative to make one yourself, so you can start collecting fees for routing payments there. I expect the wallets will automate this to a high degree though. You most likely won't have to even think about it, other than activating the feature when you setup the wallet.

This reasoning has a problem. It assumes 1MB chain and 20MB chain coins will be valued equally. It's not really hashpower that decides this matter but rather the markets. Miners will mine the chain that gives the best profits, yes. Just don't forget that the moment it forks, the coins in the separate chains will also diverge in value too.
That's the crucial point. If majority of people want to be on the 20MB chain and could still sell their coins on the 1MB chain, they will do so if it gets them something. If selling is not possible, miners won't be interested in the chain. If it is, well, one of the chains will see massive dumping and will see it's price drop and miners lose interest.

If you just look at the wording, it doesn't actually make any change to anything. The only danger is that harda seems to think Bitcoin XT is a contentious hard fork, which it isn't in my view.
The current plan is to only try to hard fork if the plan gets over 75% hashrate support from miners. Even then, there's 2 weeks before the fork happens and can still be canceled if miners withdraw support.
With the current plan, the hard fork would immediately bump the maximum to 8MB and double that every 2 years for 40 years. After that the maximum would stop growing.
of course, this can leave up to 25% of people unhappy with the situation and could potentially permanently leave us with 2 different networks. 
Ultimately it's a question of if there are 2 camps of people both unwilling to budge from their position or not. If there are, we're going to face some kind of fragmentation, no matter what. In this case we will end up with 2 (or more) chains. The only real difference is how they'll be named.

There'll be a balance with LN and bitcoin transaction fees there.
If the bitcoin fees are too low, it likely won't make sense to keep large LN channels open as that also means there's very little to be gained from routing fees. You do need a secure computer online to route LN payments through your channels, even if keeping the channels open doesn't require an online computer all the time.
When bitcoin fees are high, there's a large incentive to optimize your channels and make sure they're open and active (that is routing payments) so that you can profit from offering people cheaper payments than Bitcoin itself. This means more and more people will pay through LN and transaction pressure on bitcoin blocks will drop, causing the fee to drop too.
Between these two, there'll be a point of balance that'll be the actual fee level in bitcoin. This is the natural market balance that will form.
However, aside from this natural balance, the mining power does have a rather direct effect on the value of Bitcoin. What I mean is that if mining power drops enough, that will start dropping the price of Bitcoin. This means that there will be incentive for holders of bitcoin to cooperate and make sure there exists sufficient mining to keep the price stable. Exactly what form this will take is unclear, but the incentive is there. Hell, I'll organize it to happen myself if no-one else does it and it seems necessary.
As for relay nodes and risk. Well, this is the part that'll be decentralized to a large degree. But basically, if you find someone you can't pay through the current routing network, that's a good candidate for a profitable relay channel and you have a profit incentive to fix that. This network is self-healing in this respect.
a prompt commit does matter in some cases and won't matter in others. Basically, if you make money through taking a cut for routing payments, you'll want prompt commits when you're closing less profitable channels and opening more profitable ones. If you're not routing for profit, you might not care for a prompt commit. However, the other party in the channel might want it. It's not just your money tied up in a channel, most of the time.
The legal question is the trickiest one to answer. Mostly because I'm not a lawyer, but even if I was, I don't know which jurisdiction you're asking about and would likely not be able to answer even if I was a lawyer because I would not know the laws of your jurisdiction. So, all I can really say is that it depends on the country. Some will make trouble, others will not.

As far as I'm concerned, if something doesn't derive from a centralized authority, it's not fiat. If you happen to have another word to suggest that has the meaning I've been expressing with fiat thus far, you're welcome to suggest it. I'll consider it.

That's true, but I suspect many are willing to take those channel opens at 0 confirmations, at least for small value transactions.

Umm, not exactly. The people willing to burn the most money can influence the block size the most. Although, I agree that the difference is subtle.
However, the suggestion as presented is slightly problematic. If the resulting maximum blocksize is decided through averaging all the votes, then it makes no sense for anyone to vote anything but zero or maximum possible size because those give the maximum bang for buc... umm bitcoin.
Using the median vote for blocksize, however, could work. One satoshi, one vote.
However, the main argument for keeping the blocksize relatively small is to allow small (read poor) players to have the ability to run full nodes. This proposal doesn't look like it would address this. It invokes the classic coordination problem.
I believe the correct solution would not be that you vote by burning bitcoins.  Rather, those who want a larger blocksize should pay those who are disadvantaged by it. I haven't figured out a workable market model for that though.

Channels aren't dependent on your computer being online all the time. There's a longish timelock period for just this reason. If the timelock period is one week, you should make sure the computer is never offline for more than a week at a time. If you can only ensure it once a month, use timelock period of one month.
Although, you could also outsource the upkeep to a computer (or several) that's online all the time. Then you don't need to make sure you're online regularly enough and can make do with much shorter locktimes.
Then again, you'd probably want to keep your computer online, since that allows you to collect fees for routing other people's transactions through your own channels.

Bitcoin also has third parties. You just don't know who it is in advance and they don't know who you are. They're called miners.
It's simple, it's better than credit card because it's trustless. Bank needs to be trustworthy and trusted because they could take your money. A node in Lightning Network cannot.
In Lightning network, the people you pay through _can't take your money_. The worst they could do is lock your money (as well as their own) for a while. How long you ask? That's something you decide in advance when you open the channel.
Your mom thinks she needs to trust the entity the payment goes through. With Lightning network, there's no need to trust the individuals routing transactions. They can't take your money.
If you open channels to more than one entity, then you can also be one of the people routing transactions and collecting small fees for it.

a change to Bitcoin's structure that'd make that possible is a hard fork. I can't say it won't be attempted, but I can say that the original Bitcoin will not die out unless there's a technically superior alternative that does Bitcoin's thing better than Bitcoin.
The beauty of Bitcoin's design is that as long as there are people who want to use the original version, it will survive. Any attempt to change Bitcoin will only lead to there being Bitcoin and the new bastardized version at the same time. After that it's up to the users to decide which version to use.

This is a false comparison. The authorize that takes 10 seconds with a credit card is comparable to seeing the unconfirmed bitcoin transaction.
The confirmation period is what is comparable to the time until a chargeback is no longer possible.

There's one important reason Bitcoin is considered separate by many. That's because it doesn't depend on anything but the internet (as in, worldwide communications network) and it's users to exist. Bitcoin is independent in this way.
There are only 3 ways to kill Bitcoin.
1) Find an unfixable flaw in the system that makes it inherently untrustworthy or useless. (no-one has found one in 5 years so far)
2) Bitcoin can't exist without the internet, so if you destroy the internet, Bitcoin goes with it. (Well, certain countries seem to be going this route.)
3) Convince everyone to not use Bitcoin. (China appears to be trying this route.)
That being said, Bitcoin is an asset. That's what it was _designed_ to be. It'll be a part of the overall financial system. That's the whole point. However, it's not just an asset. It comes integrated with it's own independent system for transferring the value as well. That's what that makes it noteworthy.
What is being referred to with "the legacy financial system" are the frameworks built around all the existing assets that facilitate trading with them. It most definitely doesn't refer to the assets.
TL;DR "the legacy financial system" refers to banks and other institutions that have traditionally been used to facilitate transfers of assets between people and organizations. It does not point to assets.

You're vastly overestimating the artists' independence. If an artist can actually make it without any support crew, then he/she doesn't need to pay anyone. I have no problem with that.
However, the fact is, there are many arenas, such as movies and even music where artists do need services from others. There, no pay no service -&gt; no art to donate for.

trusting a politician is a very different matter than what is being said here. Politicians make a lot of promises _for what they will do_. Matthew's message this time is not a promise. It's advice, and frankly, _great advice_.
When you evaluate advice, all you need to do is consider the advice itself and how it fits in with your own goals. The person who gave it doesn't matter so much. Knowing the person who gives advice can help you spot potential bias in the advice but unless the advice is bad, it doesn't matter who gave it.
If Matthew was promising to do something, then it would make sense to speak of trusting.

The financial industry does not actually need very much space in the blockchain, as it is, currently. The things they want to do aren't directly supported by Bitcoin. However, they will most likely want to use Bitcoin for timestamping their own data. For that, anything more than one transaction per block is overkill.
The data itself can be published through whatever system they want and in any size they want. At least, the prototype will work that way. Once they've got a working system that's been built this way, they can work to get it integrated better with Bitcoin network. It'd just be a soft-fork to completely integrate it with Bitcoin.
Of course, considering the volumes of data they'll need, this might not be possible. Even a soft-fork requires a supermajority to actually be useful. So it could well be that the system will end up being only half-married to Bitcoin blockchain. This would mean that Proof of Work timestamping comes from Bitcoin while validation, storage and network capacity is arranged some other way.

What I can do with Bitcoin that I can't do with cash? Well, if you've got cash and you wish to buy a beer for someone who's in Berlin at Room 77. Can't do it. With Bitcoin, you can. Simple as that.
To put it in more straight terms. You can't give the cash to anyone who is not physically there with you. Bitcoin, you can give to anyone you can communicate with.
If you don't think this matters, I'm baffled why you ever got involved with Bitcoin at all.

In what uncomfortable position do you need to read my text to interpret a part of it as "ask if the pirates will be nice enough"? It's not relying on the pirates being nice. It's relying on them to see a good deal where one is to be made.
My main point was that you *don't need* the giant hammer the copyright law gives you. The internet has changed the playing field so that the artist can have the upper hand if he/she knows how.
The goal of what I described is not to make pirate merchants vanish. Rather the goal is to ensure that any fan who wants to support the artist and enjoy the art in a format they want, is able to do both.
If your definition of solving the pirate issue is no pirating at all, please come out of your dream bubble. That's just not realistic without a police state and possibly not even then.
There's no point in vilifying pirates. Glorify people who support the artist instead.
As for OpenBazaar. It's a system whose usefulness will grow with increasing adoption. I don't know if OB will be the marketplace of the future or not, but it certainly has the potential.
OB is more of a marketplace protocol rather than a marketplace in itself. The openness of it allows anyone to both participate as well as make use of the market data. It could well become something I'm not even able to imagine yet.
As for why someone should use it. It's an additional channel that will reach some audience unreachable through the other options you listed. Whether it reaches enough people to be worthwhile to use, I ca't say.

You must be pretty young. Banks tends to have a habit of giving young people preferential treatment. That is, until they go above certain age (or just don't notice the minefield in advance) after which it becomes quite expensive.
Also, individuals are generally charged very little while companies  pay double. At least in Finland, bank services are almost free for individuals but companies are charged 10-50 cents for each received _and_ each sent transfer.
I believe banks do this because the effect is that most individuals end up thinking banks are almost free while still paying through their nose for the services in reality.

The only way that you could even hope to do better would be to distribute the coins equally to as wide a population as you can.
Unfortunately, it'd essentially boil to the same thing. Most would sell them for whatever they can get for them. For them, they're not trustworthy, better get something for them now. Better than nothing later. 
So, we'd end up with those who realize the potential getting rich as they system starts being recognized for it's usefulness. Very much the same as with Bitcoin. If you want a strictly limited supply, there's just no way around this. It'll be cheap before it'll be expensive.
Even the people who recognise the potential wouldn't want to buy them at the price they expect them to be worth in the future. They'd be mad to be that certain of it.
The only way that I know of to avoid this would be to expand the number of units in existence as a way to keep the price stable. Which brings us the problem of who to give them to.

Right now, yes, you're correct. It'd be madness to give out loans denominated in bitcoins.
However, eventually, Bitcoin will reach a saturation point after which the value will be at least as stable as the biggest currencies are today. There's only a limited amount of room for bitcoin to expand. Once that room is exhausted, the rate of value increase will drop to sensible levels.
The reason for the high volatility today is that opinions for what the saturation point is are wildly different among different people.

It seems the is_new_seed uses a hash based checksum mechanism. So, you don't encode the checksum into the word choices but rather into the hash that results  from hashing the words.
It's a clever way to add checksum without a wordlist dependence but does seem to differ from the standard.
edit: It also makes it extremely tedious to try to pick the words for the passphrase yourself, which is excellent. With this it's actually less work to take a randomly generated passphrase and memorize it than it is to find one with your own word choices that works :) Should drastically reduce the number of people who do that and lose their coins.

I think the multi-sig greenaddress method works better. Basically, you pick a green address provider and form a 2 of 2 multi-sig address with one address from your wallet and the greenaddress provider's public address.
The greenaddress provider will sign any half signed transaction it's sent as long as the transaction is not a double spend of an earlier transaction signed by the greenaddress provider.
This way, as long as the merchant trusts  the greenaddress provider, they can accept transactions made this way with 0 conf.

It's the same problem with credit cards, really. Except, with credit cards, the "double spend" (well, they call it chargeback) can come weeks later. At least with bitcoin, it has to come in a few minutes if it's to come.
I doubt very many will try to double spend small payments in face to face payments. It doesn't happen with credit cards. I see no reason why it'd happen with bitcoin.
TL;DR There are types of transactions for which the "technically unsafe" in 0-conf transactions doesn't matter. There are other methods to discourage it.

Unless it's an overwhelming majority that agrees, the result will be a network splitting into two networks that are then separate networks.
If the change is uncontroversial, that is, a change that is not strongly resisted by a sizable number of users, then you can likely make do with a simple majority.
However, if even 5% of the users want to drag in their heels to prevent the change, the network will split and there will be two networks in it's place. Of course, it could also happen that these people would just sell their coins and then buy into an altcoin (whether brand new or pre-existing one) that promises to continue the "old way".

It's interesting that discussions about this focus on money. Money is a means of transferring claims to resources (things, work, etc) between people. Not valuable in and of itself. If you try to redistribute wealth from rich to poor through money, the effects will end up short lived. This is because the flow of money is structured by who owns the truly valuable assets.
For this reason, I'm inclined to support implementing UBI by legislating a fixed percentage of every company as owned by the people and directing the dividends from all those companies to the people as UBI. This means the UBI will shrink if population grows or the companies make less profit.
What I'm still undecided about is the percentage. So far I've been thinking about 10%. I don't think it should be high because that would discourage self-interested investing.
(Yes, I'm aware that this has similarities with communism. If you set the percentage to 100%, it becomes communism. With percentages less than that, it combines a bit of both.)

Your lack of imagination is in no way a sufficient argument for UBI and Bitcoin being incompatible. SebastianMaki sufficiently explained in what ways your imagination was insufficient, so I won't touch on that.
However, I suspect you've misunderstood what it means to add more decimals to Bitcoin, because what you're saying makes no sense.
Currently the maximum number of bitcoins is a little under 21 million and each of them is divisible into 100 million satoshi.
Suppose we add 8 decimals of accuracy to the division. We will then have 21 million bitcoins each divisible into 100 million satoshi. However, now each satoshi is now _also_ divisible into 100 million shi (I just made up a name for the unit).
This upgrade can be done without changing the number of bitcoins anyone has. The only thing that changes is that after the upgrade you can now send smaller amounts than 1 satoshi.
Exactly what about this would cause inflation? I fail to see it.

Online banking is equally susceptible to this very same thing. The main difference is in how simple it is to get away with the stolen money. I'd expect it takes somewhat more effort in the online banking case.
In the long run, you're going to need to be careful to use a secure system for dealing with anything valuable online. There is no way around it. Bitcoin doesn't have it worse than the banks.

The mining systems in use today are single purpose systems that are rather useless for anything else. Any general benchmark would put their power at most around the level of a weak smartphone and that's only because they require a general processor as a control device.
Most of the electronics contained in them is utterly useless for anything else but bitcoin mining. So, in any other benchmark, any one of the supercomputers would wipe the floor with the entire current bitcoin network.
For Bitcoin mining, however, a single Bitcoin mining system can outperform any supercomputer when it comes to power efficiency and will outperform most supercomputers even in raw computing power as well.

Actually, even with a fee there's no guarantee by anyone. Of course, if it doesn't get accepted, you don't pay the fee either. The fee just makes it much more likely your transaction will confirm fast.
Most cases where a transaction never confirms aren't fee related though. There's usually something else wrong with the transaction. For example, sloppy wallet software making a transaction where the change output is dust and thus ends up shunned by most miners.
There is no technical requirement for the fee. In practise, I wouldn't try to skip the fee unless I really didn't mind waiting possibly days for the confirmation. There are times when the network is congested and transactions start being confirmed in the order of fees.

But the thing is, the number of laws would diminish radically if the burden on enforcing the laws were put on those who support them. If people were given the choice, they would stop funding laws they don't really think are necessary.
Currently, people support all kinds of laws because it won't directly cost them, so they live in the illusion that laws are free to make. Simply because it's somebody else's problem to enforce them.
Of course, for this model to work, the taxation model and perhaps economic model as well would need a serious revamp. I'm not quite certain how to design such a system though.

It's not the absolute hashing power that matters but rather the power efficiency. That is, how many hashes it can do per watt of power consumed.
The first ASICs were manufactured with older fabrication techniques, which make less power efficient and slower chips but you'll get them to market faster and cheaper. When ASICs first started being designed, it didn't make sense, given the exchange rate, to invest into the more cutting edge fabs.
There are new ASICs being made with cutting edge manufacturing processes that will start being shipped sometime during spring 2014. Those ASICs have ... well, perhaps not long term but mid term potential too.
Still, the market being what it is, the short term potential dwarfs the mid or long term potential these devices have so that is how they'll be priced.
The miners devalue rapidly because there's a fixed amount of bitcoins available each day and it'll be divided between miners based on their hashrates. So, the more profit there is to be made, the faster the difficulty will increase and reduce the profit.

It's actually very difficult to conclusively prove your bitcoins were stolen if they get stolen. From an outside observer's perspective it's impossible to tell if you sent them yourself or if a thief made the transfer.
Nevertheless, it will happen. What should they do with all the people who claim their coins were stolen? Some of it will be fraud, some will be real cases of theft. No real way to tell them apart. punishing them all sounds a bit harsh, you're guaranteed to punish many innocents.

You know, it's not yet guaranteed that they were wrong. As far as I can tell, the biggest obstacle was that you couldn't legally run one on a public sidewalk in most places due to regulations.
The laws would've needed changing before it'd have been allowed on the streets. But since barely no-one uses Segways, no-one cared to make the change and thus barely no-one uses them as you can't use them legally.
We might very well see Segways or something very like them all over our sidewalks in the future.
TL;DR It's not that the people who thought Segway would take over sidewalks were just plain wrong. They just didn't anticipate that the law was already written in a way to prevent Segway from being useful.

I'm sure you think this was a clever way to make a point but this analogy fails for the same reason comparing copyright infringment to physical theft fails. When you infringe on copyright, the copyright holder still has their copy of the copyrighted work. When you take a bitcoin or something physical, someone else no longer has it.
Also, speaking of copying. You could argue that everyone already has a copy of everyone's bitcoins. It's a core principle of the bitcoin network that every full node has a copy of the bitcoin ledger. It couldn't work without. The crux is that there's a private encryption key that you use to prove you have the right to reassign certain bitcoins to someone else. Without the key, a consensus about the reassignment will not form and bitcoins will not change owners.
There's a culture somewhere on earth that's used giant stone discs as money for a long time. I forget the name. They're almost never moved, but they are used as a method of payment. When someone uses one of them as a payment, the trade happens in public and everyone knows of it.
The stones themselves are not moved. They just change owners by public agreement. This is conceptually the same system as Bitcoin. Only with different implementation and consensus mechanism. The only way to get the ownership of the giant stone disks is to convince a large majority of others to agree that you own it. With Bitcoin, the mechanism is the same but the ones making decisions on ownership changes are computers rather than people.

To date, I have seen no evidence that would suggest that bitcoin's being used for crime more than fiat currencies. However, I have seen some evidence that indicates the situation is pretty average as far as currencies go.
Thus, as an answer to the question "why is bitcoin always associated with crime?". That's because a) news tend to focus on reporting negative things b) people remember negative things better. Not because of any actual involvement.
I've seen a lot of people speculating that bitcoin will be favored by criminals. No actual evidence. Criminals merely using bitcoin isn't enough to come to that conclusion. You can't find a value transfer system that isn't used by criminals. You'd need to show a bigger proportion of criminals using bitcoin than other systems for it to count.

OpenBazaar is making selling things easier for everyone. No matter the product.
It changes the rules. The existing paradigm allows (or at least gives a very good illusions of) artists to use a very big hammer to swat at ~~potential customers~~pirates and hoping they and others will still want to pay you after being hit with it.
With OpenBazaar, it can be much more difficult, even impossible, to figure out who to hit. This requires a different approach. There's one advantage every artist has over the pirate merchants. That is their fanbase. Your fans like you, not the pirate merchant.
Yes, that's the gist of it. Treat your fans as your allies. You can ask them favors. For example, you could ask them to promote your official site or even your OpenBazaar site. Then release new artwork as your goals are being met.
Also, don't even think about DRM. Using that crap is treating your fans like enemies. They'll be much less likely to want to help like that. No matter how much they like your art, if the DRM makes it useless to them, they most definitely won't pay. They might even hail the pirate who removes it as their savior.
Why would they help, you ask? They're your fans, they want you to keep creating and publishing great work. These are the people who value your work greatly. They're the ones who'd be willing to put in a lot of a money in a presale too, if you decide to make use of one.
It's also important to realize that your fans could have much better ideas on how to proceed than you do. Don't just treat them like animals who lust for your art. Connect with them in ways other than through your art.
Once you've established your own shop as the number one place for your stuff. It's time to start looking at the pirate merchants. They're most likely very profit motivated and you just gained the upper hand in visibility. Selling or advertising the things they manufacture using your artwork on your official site is an excellent bargaining chip. They just might be willing to share a portion of their profit with you.
There, piracy problem solved with no laws required.

In the case of the system I proposed this so called "arms race of mining" does not exist as it's not a competitive system. It's a cooperative system.
In what I proposed, the "arms race" would be keeping the signing keys secure. Essentially equivalent to keeping a bitcoin wallet secure. Both involve keeping certain keys secret to maintain security. All the tricks you can do to keep a bitcoin wallet secure are applicable. Including multisig.
With a multisig solution, the security can increase exponentially as you add more keys. Also, any bank using Bitcoin will have to use similar security arrangements for their Bitcoin wallets anyway.
I'm not very convinced that it'd cost banks less to use Bitcoin.

That just means we were in a peak (as in, higher than baseline) for 6 months. If you trace the bottom of the graph (the one that excludes transaction to/from popular addresses, like satoshidice), you'll find a smooth expoenential curve. That is what I call baseline.
I believe the baseline comes from serious users and peaks are mostly caused by fleeting use due to hype and media attention. In other words, I believe the baseline is what is important in the graph, not the peaks. The peaks do sometimes make it difficult to see the baseline for long periods at a time.
Also worth noting is that people using bitcoin as a store of value won't make many transactions but will push the value up. That means the value will most likely increase faster than the number of transactions.

It does make economic sense to sell them rather than mine yourself. It's very profitable and the buyer takes the risk for how well the investment works.
That's the catch. It's not guaranteed running the miner will make you as much profit as investing the cost of the miner into bitcoins directly. It depends on how the exchange rate develops as well as how many others are running a miner.
If you sell the miners and too many miners get deployed, you actually make more money than you would've made by (just) mining yourself. 
About the long term potential argument. Even if their devices did have long term potential, it wouldn't make sense to mine with (all of) them themselves because doing so risks destroying that potential. If a single entity has half or more of the hashrate under their control, it risks destroying the trust in the system and thus destroying the value.
Most ASICs sold to date never had long term potential though, they were almost obsolete the day they came off the production line. The first ASICs with long term potential are only starting to come off the production lines in the near future.
TL;DR No-one, including the producers of minting machines, really knows how the market is going to move. Thus it makes sense to sell the miners to control the amount of risk you're taking. If I were making these machines, I'd prefer to sell them and buy bitcoins with most of the profit.

Or, to put it in other words, it's entirely possible that it's not worth the effort to find a cheaper place to save a couple of bucks per coffee.
It's simple math, really. For example, if you get paid based on results (rather than, clock time) and you make around $60 per hour. This is $1 per minute. In such a case, any extra minute you spend not working is costing you $1.

I'm not sure if I mentioned it before but this design I've outlined is based on Bitcoin, so anything I've not specified should be considered to be as in Bitcoin. So please consider that while reading.
I'm not intimately familiar with SQL Server technology but as far as I'm aware of, it has no mechanism for verifying that data hasn't been (maliciously and intelligently) tampered with. The thing with Bitcoin is that if you get all the data, you can verify it's correctness on your own, hence removing your need to trust the source of the data. That's a feature I believe I've accomplished with this design.
With Bitcoin, this trust is of the sort "I trust that no-one has enough hashpower to present me a forged blockchain". With my system this changes into "I trust that I wasn't given a forged blockbraid when I first started my node".
by the way, if someone was periodically making a bitcoin transaction containing the hash of one of the newest blocks for this system, it'd be technically possible for both of the above to apply for this system. With the caveat that you'd need to also partially verify Bitcoin blockhain to find all such transactions.
I'm running out of time to write for the time being, so as a final note, I'd like to point out that this isn't database technology. This is a protocol spec.

Yes, and I was pointing out that it seems we have differing definitions for what it means to solve this problem. I'm unable to figure out what exactly it means for you but for me the problem is solved if the result is a system where artists can make a living.


Handing over, even 50%, is a good deal if (and only if) your number of customers increases enough that you make more profit than before. Very simple. Whether it's sensible to ask for as much as 50% depends on that.
What I explained assumes the goods in question are physical. For example T-shirts with the artist's art on them. For digital goods, there's no way someone would pay a pirate for those when there are ways to get them for free.
In the T-shirt example, the ideal system (from my perspective anyway), would be one where the customer pays the artist directly rather than requiring royalties from middlemen who manufacture the physical product. That way the customer could be sure the artist received a sensible share of the money he/she spent.
In the current model, even when buying from the so called legitimate merchants, you have no way of knowing if the artist is actually getting as much as you think he/she should.
Suppose you, as a customer, see a legitimate shop selling the thing for $120 and another (possibly a pirate) for $60. You also know from a reliable source that they're of comparable quality. Manufacture costs are likely around $40. Handling and shipping $15.
Because you like the artist and would like to support him/her, you are considering the $120 product. However, lets do some math here. There's at least $65 portion of the price that's "extra" on top of the physical service. The artist will receive some portion of this.
Now the, question is, how much? Will he/she even get $10? Are you sure you want to pay $60 extra so the artist can get $10? For me, hell no, I'd rather pay the artist $20 directly and buy the $60 product. There are quite some purchases I didn't make because this wasn't possible.


It's your choice to see them as enemies. They don't have to be that. What I'm suggesting is a different approach. Do note, though, that what I'm suggesting won't reward or help them before they stop doing what you call stealing.

Mining will stop making much of a difference very soon. Currently the number of bitcoins is increasing at 12-13% a year. However, every 4 years the amount of new bitcoins from mining halves. So, 7 years from now, it'll be around 2-3%. In 11 years 1-2%.
But mining doesn't really matter for saturation anyway. The saturation happens when bitcoin use stops growing exponentially. That means almost everyone who might use bitcoin has started using it.

This is also the reason for the 11% bigger transactions when using Segwit's P2WSH address type when compared with regular P2SH.
It's not bad enough to be an immediate problem for at least a decade but the safety margin is getting way too thin. 
Basically, if you know one of the private keys needed to sign a multisig P2SH address, you can brute force an alternative payment script with the same hash with 2^80 tries. 
As a comparison, miners are currently collectively testing 2^68 hashes for each block they find. Current mining hardware isn't directly applicable towards attacking the script hashes, though, so it's just a comparison point. However, 2^80 is not a practical impossibility anymore. Merely hideously expensive to achieve.

If you make sure the transaction has big enough fee for worst congestion that can ensue, there should be no problem.
I'm not quite sure why not just send it before you go for the trip, though. If you wanted to take the presigned transaction with you so you can broadcast it from the trip, should you need coins in the exchange it would make more sense.
many blockexplorer websites allow you to copy&amp;paste a hex-form of a transaction for broadcast with just a browser, so you could probably even do it with just your smartphone.

@_date: 2015-05-25 13:18:43
I don't think you actually understand the whole picture of why Bitcoin works. It's not just the hash power race that secures the network. There's also the transaction validity rules. The hash power race is necessary for just one thing and that's timestamping transactions, so you can know which came first. If you can get that info in a verifiable way some other way, you don't need the hash power race.
Also, please stop describing this system as private. You're obviously reading way too much into that word. Much more than I intended to say with it. (By the way, governments tend to describe Bitcoin as a private currency, which always amuses me since it's actually more public than anything else)
That's what I set to accomplish here. a public data structure that both records all transactions and provides a way for the public to determine which came first in case there's a conflict. The private part is that banks would control the keys that allow *adding* to it.
Transaction validity rules could be identical to Bitcoin and every client could check that those rules were followed before accepting a transaction. Only transaction confirmation mechanism is different. 
Banks would have a strong economical incentive to not allow their keys to be used to sign forgeries. Allowing that gives the defrauded party(or parties) undeniable evidence that the fraud happened. Banks don't generally enjoy scandals, they tend to be expensive. Especially if they come with lawsuits.
This system lacks a hash power race in and of itself. However, if it really needs the long term benefits from having it, Bitcoin can be easily added to the mix as an additional validator blockchain or alternatively you could require each block in this system to be a valid Bitcoin transaction. You wouldn't even need to change Bitcoin in any way. However, banks would nevertheless retain control over adding new transactions. (Plus, they might have an incentive to pay significant bitcoin transaction fees to boost the amount of Proof of Work this gets them)
This is the economical argument for why the banks would not rewrite the blockbraid. It'd create undeniable evidence that could be used against them. Besides, a single bank could not do it. It'd take all of them, so it'd be far from trivial. The blockbraid contains several blockchains, but they don't have to be separate ledgers. They're interconnected enough to form a single ledger. 
It takes all the banks working together to even try to defraud anyone. Even just trying creates undeniable evidence of the attempt. I find it exceedingly doubtful if such a situation would ever even happen.
In Bitcoin, on the other hand, miners can be anonymous. There's no penalty for trying to double spend, other than the (admittedly very significant) costs. There's practically no risk of getting caught.
Do you seriously think this kind of system would not be preferable from the banks' point of view? As far as banks are concerned, it should be somewhat better than Bitcoin for their purposes.
Or is the problem more that you don't believe the system does what I think it does? I'm also wondering if you actually read my previous replies. I've stated there are multiple validators and thus multiple private keys. Why do you keep talking like it's just one?

DoS attacks would definitely be something that needs tackling in some way, but there are ways to keep websites online in the face of DDoS. The same methods would work here.
There is limited hashpower because the system doesn't depend on Proof of Work. It doesn't matter how much hashpower a would be attacker has. This system ignores hashpower. What controls the creation of blocks are the keys the validators hold. If you don't have the keys, the network will ignore any blocks you create.

I completely agree that with the current situation a gridlock is much better than BU becoming popular. If it results in Segwit not making it, it's a shame, but that's life.
With BIP16&amp;17 it was a clear cut one or the other choice since the changes were effectively the same aside from some relatively minor technical nitpicks. They were both soft forks too.

There have been some rumours about certain mining hardware manufacturer suggesting they might be selective about who they sell their hardware to and that that has been convincing pools to start signaling for BU. I haven't seen any proof about that though, but would explain a lot.
Another thing I heard is that the majority of those signaling for BU are actually running Bitcoin Core that has been minimally modified to signal for BU. Still, this is only a rumor also.

The reason reserves are required is that the money you feed into the ATM is not magically teleported to an exchange and ready to be exchanged into coins. Rather, it takes an expensive service to transport the money, first to a bank and then potentially several days of waiting for a bank transfer to reach an exchange.
In other words, this problem happens  because moving fiat is damn slow.

Your "blatant negligence" accusation holds absolutely no water due to Segwit being an actual capacity increase.


That's an apples to oranges comparison. intentional hard forks that change the consensus rules are very different from accidental hard forks where the rule difference is merely cosmetic.


Even so, doing it hastily is bad.

block size increase will have to be a hard fork anyway, so might as well disable the old transaction types altogether or at least limit their maximum size small enough that it won't be a problem.

There's also a shift of control happening. From centralized organizations (producers) to individuals. In the future, large professional productions will be crowdfunded by people who want to see the finished product rather than paid afterwards.

First, disclaimer. IANAL.
Any sensible court will realize that a) the blockchain is not meant to be a general purpose data storage system and b) Anything stored in the blockchain won't be readable without a special purpose software and metadata that specifies how it can be recovered from the blockchain.
Therefore, anyone without the software and metadata to allow recovery of the stored data cannot be considered to really have the data in question.

This activation procedure only works if the upgrade has support from the economic majority. Otherwise it'll cause a splitting fork after someone tries to spend a segwit transaction according to the old rules.
Economic majority is enough to tip the scales because the miners will flock to the chain where they make the most money and if the upgraded chain has more hashrate, it'll be the only valid chain left because any nodes running old rules will also accept it if it's longer.
However, the problem with this approach is that if mining power is slow to migrate to the new rules after activation, there'll be a period during which consensus can partially break down as unscrupulous people try to use the chance to make successful double spends. This very problem is the reason for the 95% miner quorum requirement in Segwit soft-fork.

One link between the different networks is all it takes for the transaction to spread to both if the transaction itself is valid in both. There's no guarantee someone won't do that just because they can. That is, run a node that only relays transactions, never blocks.
There's very little, currently, that can be done about it. In the future it might be different though. One of luke's BIPs introduces a way for transactions to say 'I'm not valid unless the longest chain contains block X'. However, that requires being soft-forked in to be useful, which might be rather difficult to get to happen before a hard fork at this point.

a physical bitcoin is just an offline wallet. Another way to store bitcoins. Does that mean it's redundant? Well, it depends. It's definitely redundant in the sense that there are many other wallets available.
However, in the case of coin shaped wallets, it looks like it's entirely possible for the physical coin to end up being worth more than the bitcoins it contains.

Chargebacks are pretty expensive, really. That alone most likely consists of a big portion of the fees credit card companies charge.
Certain kinds of businesses are a very common target for chargeback fraud. Any shop that sells things that are easy to resell will see significant chargeback fraud. It's not that uncommon to lose over 10% of your revenue to chargeback fraud.
Why is this bad for customers? Who do you think ends up paying for the chargeback fraud?  That's right. The customer.
When one of these shops starts accepting bitcoin for payments, they can offer the bitcoin customers crazy sounding discounts while still making double the profit they did before.

It's actually worth a read, despite the writer having a very superficial understanding of what people are arguing about. Because it doesn't actually talk about the argument but rather what happens if Bitcoin stays exactly as it is now.
Edit: But I'll write a TL;DR here. Basically, we're going to get a system that's structurally similar to LN but only between the very biggest centralized companies that do business on the bitcoin network and enforced by the courts and traditional laws instead of smart contracts like LN.
LN will be much less centralized than the system that will be born in it's absence.

That requires you to already have enough money to pay for all 12 months in one go. So, while there are use cases for this too, most of the people who want recurring payments wouldn't be able to use this one.

It's entirely plausible that bitcoin network itself will become a settlement network for a network of transactors. Lightning network, for example could facilitate this. The artificial 7 transactions per second limit will have to be lifted eventually in any case, but increasing that is not the only possibility.
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:13:09
The value of a network such as bitcoin increases exponentially with the size of the network. If you divide the network in half, each half becoming it's own network, the combined value of both is thus less than would be the total value of the combined network.
Hence, things will naturally progress towards one network that everyone will use because that's where the best value is.
Of course, that's not to say this network has to be just one blockchain. If users don't have a reason to care which blockchain they're using, then all of those can be considered to be part of the same network.
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:14:44
Of course. However, the security here isn't dependent on any single key. We're talking about a system for banks here. From a bank's perspective, why would they use Bitcoin when they could use something like what I described? This kind of system should shield them from each other well enough. Any foul play will be detectable.

On the convenience front, Ledger is much nicer. usb-stick with tails, you're talking 5-10 minutes waiting before you can make your transaction. With ledger, you just need to install a chrome app (if you haven't used the computer before), plug it in, type your pin and you're ready to use the wallet.
Also, on the security front you can plug ledger into pretty much any computer and trust that your coins are still safe.
With the thumb drive, you can't really just plug it into a computer you don't trust. The computer might modify the contents of the stick. For example, it might modify the bootloader to load coin-stealing malware that waits for you to unlock your wallet to take your coins.
with ledger, that just isn't possible.

This network would lack the concept of mining power entirely. In it's place is a concept of identity. The signing keys owned by the validators each embody their own portion of the "mining power". In other words, the system is set up in a way that certain parties have certain pre-defined mining power and no-one else has any.
Although, calling it "mining power" is a little misleading as the mechanics of the system make foul play immediately detectable and most likely users will hit emergency brakes on using the system if they detect any. The threat model is completely different from Bitcoin mining.
There would not be a longest chain principle because any forks in the braid would be evidence of foul play and cause a network halt. Validators would prefer to avoid that, since you'd expect them to collect transaction fees in one form or another.
Individual chains in the braid forking would probably not be a problem as long as the data in the braid allows unambiguously determining which fork came first. The whole braid forking, however would signal something is very very wrong.
The biggest benefits from using multiple validators are:
- It's then much harder to force a network halt.
- No single validator has complete control over what transactions are included in the system as a whole.
(by the way, there's actually an existing altcoin that resembles what I described even if there are some major differences. It's called BitShares. I suspect researching how it works might be a good learning experience if you're interested.)

It takes some processing to create a new block with transactions where as you can create an empty block with nearly no processing. Thus, most miners mine an empty block while they build the new block with transactions. Rarely the empty block becomes the next block (that's why they mine that rather than staying idle).
Also, most mining hardware doesn't support stopping a work run in the middle, so they'll basically work on an empty block for the first 10-20 seconds after a new block.

2MB before segwit would fail spectacularly. Even with Core devs behind it. Segwit first is much more realistic. At best you could hope to bundle the 2MB with Segwit so it activates at a much higher adoption point than SegWit itself. However, that is likely to delay SegWit itself by a month or two.

There are all kinds of things that developers might decide to change during testing that they would never change in production. One such thing is making changes that are mostly cosmetic, but nevertheless potentially forking.
Such a fork would never happen in production because no sane developer would ever approve such changes in production. However, in testing you absolutely would make such changes because you know that it'll be impossible after the code is in production.
This is kind of like the difference between the sort fork and hard fork versions of segwit. the soft fork version is structured in a way that seems very strange if you don't understand why it had to be done that way. The hard fork version is cleaner and easier to understand, but it'd change things that are already in production, so a sane developer won't try to do it without an extremely good reason (it's usually the case that such a reason doesn't exist).
This is why failure to upgrade related forks in testing don't really matter. The kind of changes that cause them just simply aren't done in production.

There's actually no technical reason to use pools for anything other than splitting the profits. Currently pools also build the blocks they mine, however, this is not strictly required.
You could have the profit splitting completely separated from block construction. Have each miner choose for themselves whose blocks they want to mine and just point the block rewards in the blocks they mine to the profit splitting group they want to use.
However, this would require a lot of coding and would probably not catch on fast, if at all. Pretty much every piece of software to do with mining would need an overhaul to work with this.

That only works if miners form a cartel and set a minimum fee they'll accept. The problem with that is that it'd be extremely obvious that they're refusing to accept small fee transactions and would make for a rather huge PR issue for them.
However, if the biggest miners, want to increase their profits and not get caught doing it, transaction spam would be the way to go.
For example, let's say 66% of the hashing power decided to do this. Each miner would invest an amount proportional to their hashing power for the spam. Effectively, that'd mean they each pay 34% of the apparent fees. This 34% will go to the miners that aren't participating in spamming.
This would make sense to do as long as the increase in average fees was more than the 34% they're investing into the spam.
More so, by using transactions, they'd be able do it in a tit for tat way, thus ensuring that if any party defects, the spam stops and the defecting party won't get any significant benefits by defecting and will actually make less money in the future from the lower fees that result.
Also, doing it this way, they can pretend it's not them and thus avoid the PR problem while getting the increased fees.

So, the worst that can happen is that you never receive money you never considered trustworthy to begin with. 
If you truly don't accept the payment, then you won't accept it at zero confirmations. If it confirms, however, then there's no replacing it with another transaction anymore. At that point it stops mattering if it was RBF or not because then it's as final as any transaction in Bitcoin ever is.

From a conceptual point of view, it's not that difficult. isolate private key storage, signature service and user authentication from the rest of the system. Then build a simple API through which transactions can be signed and sent. Preferably require re-authentication to confirm any sends as the final step.
They're already handling people's money, so the security should be top notch as it is. They do need to keep people's credit card details secure, afterall.

About those design requirements.
1 - is not necessary. Each bank only needs  a perimeter security around the system that they use to sign blocks. Also, from a technical point of view, the data could be entirely public with no problems.
2 - Correct.
3 - Not entirely "trustless", but not entirely "trusted" either. You could probably even have each bank doing their own chain and including hashes of the other banks' blocks in their. More of a blockbraid than a blockchain.
This design would make it very difficult to change anything in the history unless all participating parties cooperate. If it's published publicly, probably impossible. Or more accurately, any changes would leave proof of the change.
4 - signatures with a PKI algorithm (like ECDSA) would signal acknowledgement. 
Anyone with the data (one of the banks, or whoever receives a copy) could then use bitcoin transactions to record progress on this system with the Bitcoin blockchain and make it even more difficult to ever change the history of the system without it being obvious to everyone it's been done.

a private bank-only blockchain would likely not use Proof of Work primarily. Banks would want the blockchain to be invite-only.
Thus, all participants are known in advance and they can simply require each block to be signed by most banks to be valid.
This does not mean Proof of Work is not useful for them. Any bank could still timestamp their private chain through Bitcoin and thus obtain hard evidence for when each particular block was released.

LN is not the only kind of 2nd layer solution that's possible. For example, bitcoin exchanges could easily make deals between each other to allow off chain transfers of bitcoins between any two customers of the exchanges. 
You won't block second layers by blocking malleability fix, you'll just make it more difficult to implement them in a decentralized manner.
I expect the more centralized second layers will actually make more of a drop to the fees than LN would. There'll be more freedom to avoid on chain transactions that way.

Thankfully, with payment channels, that you need for LN anyway, Bitcoin banks will be effectively trustless. In other words, you will be able to decide for how long the bank will be able to freeze your money for in the worst case. Plus the bank will be completely unable to take your money without your permission.
Edit: What this means, in practise, is that you will be able to use several different bitcoin banks, at the same time and actually get a better service level by doing so. Doing so will also allow your node to route payments for other people, so there's even a monetary incentive for that. This effect alone means that the idea of centralized hubs is moot.

Simply because miners will quickly (in a few days) realize they won't be getting paid enough by mining it and then it won't take long until most of them are mining the old chain again.
A hard fork that's supported by only miners has no chance at all to survive.

A channel can be opened in any state. There's no requirement for both parties to put in equal amounts of bitcoins. A channel can be opened with one of the parties owning all of the money in the channel. In this case the channel is effectively one directional until a transfer is made in that one direction.

It's quite simple. With exchanges, I can vote with my feet. With miners ... Well, I don't really have a choice about which miners I support. I either support all of them (by holding or buying bitcoins) or I support none of them (by selling my coins).
An exchange will feel the effects if even a small percentage of their users vote with their feet. Miners can ignore users until people are angry enough to start dumping their coins.
The points you make are valid, but they ignore the fact that exchanges are very limited in how much they can abuse that power before they start to really feel the hurt. Any exchange that misuses their power badly enough will lose that power.
There's no mechanism for removing the power from a miner who misuses it. That alone is enough to make me favor giving the power to exchanges. Even if it's not perfect.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:45:45
I doubt they would actually do that under this kind of system. They stand to actually make more if transaction pressure stays high and transaction fees stay high as well. If they relax the pressure by increasing block sizes, they reduce the pressure.
Increases would likely still happen, but as a result of actual fee paying transactions rather than fakes.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:25:58
LN is not the only possible Layer 2. There are also centralized options. Many wallet services already allow payments between their users without any transactions hitting the blockchain. If miners somehow succesfully sabotage LN, those centralized services are going to start making settlement agreements to avoid making tons of unnecessary on-chain transactions between each other.
Miners aren't really blocking Layer 2 at all. They're only blocking the decentralized version of Layer 2.

If a retailer decides to outsource their handling of bitcoins to another company entirely, there's absolutely nothing that can be done about it. That's already possible even with just Bitcoin as it is today and LN wouldn't change Coinbase's abilities in that position significantly.
I expect Coinbase already is in that position for many retailers. That means they can choose who they will allow to pay the retailer through Bitcoin.
I guess the biggest difference LN would make to the current situation is that Coinbase wouldn't be able to base those decisions on the blockchain analytics data due to the better privacy features LN comes with. However, even then Coinbase could require payers to identify themselves before allowing payment.
LN makes no practical change to this problem and there really isn't much that can be done about it. Other than making sure plenty of alternatives exist that companies could make use of. I think the best way to do this would be to make sure there are easy to setup and use open source software for doing these things with good documentation.

Bitcoin Bank is not the best word choice here. The nature of payment channels makes them rather unlike the banks we have today. There will be practically no vendor lockin with the LN system.
So, I'll just call them LN hubs from now on. Anyone can start one merely by opening 2 or more channels with other nodes and making sure it's reliably connected to the network.
An individual LN hub can only refuse to route your payments. That's the worst that will be possible. Not much of a problem because there's going to be a lot of options to choose from.
The main difference with different hubs is the network topology around them. Payments to other users connected to the same hub will be extremely cheap. Payments to users further apart in the topology (that is, those connected to other hubs) will be more expensive.
However, by simultaneously using multiple hubs, you get the best of both as you'll be able to pay through the one that's cheaper for any given payment. This alone will mean neither hub will know all your transactions. However, if you also route other people's payments, they won't even be able to tell which are actually yours.

Even so, sometimes the contention is minor enough that it's more important to have one of the changes rather than noe change.
I supported BIP16 at the time. Today I recognize that BIP17 would've been slightly better, but even if I'd known this back then, I'd still have chosen to support BIP16. Yes, because I preferred to get one of them in than gridlock with neither.
Informal consensus gauging has the problem that it's difficult to express subtle things like this. There would've been no good way to support both while giving slight preference to BIP17.

UASF is an alternative method of activating a soft-fork. The difference is that it doesn't seek miner adoption but rather seeks to get adoption from the economically important nodes (such as exchanges and other services using bitcoins).
It seeks to upgrade everyone else so miners are left with the option of playing along and still getting paid or quitting entirely.

Let's see, what unstated assumptions might you have that lead you to think that... 
You probably think that:
a) Bitcoin network fees will increase so high that little folks won't be able to afford them.
b) You also think LN won't change this.
c) You think blocksize won't be increased significantly.
d) You think Bitcoin's blocksize has to be increased for fees to not increase to mad levels.
e) You think LN will require a lot of money to use.
Well... With the exception of c, those ideas are just plainly mistaken. Stop shouting bullshit and actually read up on what LN is and what it does. You clearly have no idea what it is.

100 million is just about at the limit of what can be assumed possible with just Segwit. They've found ways to solve the biggest problems caused by malleability even without Segwit, but that'd not be quite as efficient. The channel opens/closes would take more block space AND blocks would be smaller. So, in that case we'd probably looking at a limit of just 20 million or so.
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:49:25
The most important feature of Segwit is that it fixes transaction malleability, not the block size increase. However, the method of fixing malleability used on Segwit also makes it possible to increase the block size as a side effect, so it'd make no sense to not make use of it. There's practically no added complexity from doing the blocksize increase in addition to the malleability fix.

Urm, in a soft fork orphaning only happens for blocks that include transactions that are invalid according the the new rules. However, soft forks are made so that those transactions are NON STANDARD from the perspective of the old version. Miners don't include non standard transactions into blocks accidentally. Therefore, there will be no orphaning happening, in practise.

Miners are supposed to be like people who pile loads of transparent glass on top of the transactions people make so that it's prohibitively expensive to change them afterwards.

The expression you used "hash blocks", while strictly speaking correct, is an odd way to put it. It makes sense for Bitcoin where over 99.99% of the process is hashing. In what I proposed, however, the percentage of hashing would be much smaller.
Strictly speaking nothing prevents anyone from putting together a block. Yes, even in Bitcoin, that's the whole point.
The crux is in whether the system as a whole accepts that block as valid. That's what prevents double spends. So, I'm going to answer the questions reformatted as:
"What prevents the network from accepting blocks from someone else?"
"What prevents the network from accepting a double-spend transaction?"
The first question is easy. The network is setup to only accept blocks that have been digitally signed by certain (fe. ECDSA) keys. From now on I'll call the owners of these keys validators.
The second question takes some more explaining. I'll start from the conclusion. You can trust the blockbraid because the structure of it is such that if any validator allows (ie. signs) a double spend, it'll be immediately obvious to the whole network. As such, they won't do that since they want to keep their "job".
Now, the crucial point is that while each validator makes their own chain, they also record the last valid block in every other validator's chain. So, as long as all validators have effectively (the hashchain effect) signed a block, you can accept it even if you don't trust any single validator completely.
This leaves the event when all validators collude to double spend. If this happens, you will have a fork in the braid, with both ends signed by all validators. Well, this is direct evidence that they're all untrustworthy and will most likely lead to pause in economy while people scramble to get a new set of validators going. In any case, they can only do it once and will get caught instantly.
Also, in this model, building blocks is cheap and there's no competition, so block rate can be easily increased to new block every few seconds.
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:14:31
it's possible some miners are doing it to artificially increase transaction pressure without being obvious about it. Making smaller blocks would be too obvious. It'd lead to increased fees and more profit. At least until the block size increases. That'd drop profits a lot. Rather short term strategy I'd say.
Anyway, I thought it'd be good to remind you that miners don't actually stand to gain directly from increasing the block size in any way currently.

I think the point is twofold.
First, the choice between FSS-RBF and Full-RBF is an obvious one, considering that FSS-RBF is pretty much useless for anything other than increasing the fee the transaction has.
For example, if you make transactions you know will take a while to confirm, with RBF, you can actually just make one transaction and keep adding outputs to it. FSS-RBF would require adding new inputs every time and prevent removing of change outputs. RBF makes sense because the resulting transaction is actually smaller than the transaction chain there would be without it. FSS-RBF wouldn't really help enough (if at all) to be worth bothering about.
As for who would accept opt-in RBF payments, well, almost any merchant currently taking credit card payments probably wouldn't really care. No-one in their right mind will try to defraud when the risk to get caught is significant.
Two, as the block reward becomes more and more insignificant compared to tx fees, miners will be more and more likely to just go RBF anyway. Without actually telling you about it.
So, we have a choice here to make the system fail reliably and in expected ways with opt-in RBF or we can try to keep the "no rewriting of transactions" model, which will fail unreliably and unexpectedly at some point, no matter what.
activating opt-in RBF now is the path of least disturbance. Eventually the opt-in will be meaningless too, but that will likely last significantly longer than the "no rewriting of transactions" model could ever hope to last.

Except, in this case the argument wasn't about whether something was true. It was about *why* anyone would commit to a hard fork. It's actually a valid argument in this context. Almost no-one would bother trying to hard fork if it was clear only a few or no others agreed with them.

In a way, yes, but I'd much prefer exchanges holding power than miners holding power. The reason is that exchanges are much more directly reliant on users and will feel the effects of angry users much more acutely.
With miners, the only way to really kick them is to sell all your coins and even then it only works if you do it at the same time as many others and it fails entirely if enough others see it as an opportunity to buy.
With exchanges ... well, if you don't like how one exchange is using their power? Well, find one that uses their power the way you prefer and move your business there. The market will immediately punish them for stupidity. With miners, you can't really punish a single miner, you either punish all of them or none of them so stupidity has to spread quite wide before it makes sense to kick them.

The only thing that's really necessary to verify profit shares is that the coinbase transaction in the share pays an address that the pool specified. It doesn't even have to pay all of it because the value of the share can simply be scaled down if it's less than the full block reward.

Oh this analysis is a perfect example of hard fork vs soft fork. The developers had the opportunity to choose whether the situation will resolve in a hard fork manner (by encouraging 0.8 rules) or soft-fork manner (by encouraging 0.7 rules).

so, there were 7 blocks less than average during that window of time.  The average block contains around 2000 transactions and at most 3000.

Bitcoin is an open source project. Open source is very difficult to control because anyone can make their own version and publish it. Thus, the more independent developers there are, the more difficult it is for any subgroup to push for their specialized agenda.
Of course, in Bitcoin's case it's very disruptive if things progress to an open conflict where users need to excercize their power to choose which software controls the network. This tends to encourage developers to work things out without escalating them to the userbase as often happens in open source projects.

There's no "weapon" to take all the coins without the permission of the other party. There's merely the unpublished transaction that always contains the latest agreement on which participant owns how much of the funds in the channel.

This sort of thing doesn't stay unknown. It's certainly not good for Coinbase if the information spreads faster, but it'll prevent others from making the same mistake and will motivate people to channel more effort into the effort that ACTUALLY FIXES the issue. Yes, that is LN.
There's no way to make 0-conf significantly more trustworthy in regular Bitcoin transactions. Aside from a complex hard fork, that is and I'm quite sure you can predict how much support that will get considering the controversy in just increasing the maximum blocksize. The only reason it will eventually happen is that it's most likely a necessity. However, Bitcoin can thrive without transactions that confirm instantly, so a hard fork for that is likely completely out of the question.
The analogy of comparing LN to charging protection money is flawed. LN is much closer in comparison to a bulletproof window than paying for protection. Also, whatever transaction fees you'll pay when using LN will be _cheaper_ than what you'd need to pay in a normal Bitcoin transaction, otherwise it'll see little use. That makes comparing it to charging for protection even more absurd.
Moreover, LN development is going slowly because _it isn't a promising cash cow for whoever develops it_. If it was, I suspect we'd already be using it. There's money to be made by running LN nodes, yes. However, those who develop LN are unlikely to ever get their fair share of it.
Are you sure you want to keep badmouthing LN?

This is not direct voting on transactions. The point is to form a data structure that makes it possible to reliably verify which transaction came first.
Let's try a visualization. Imagine a ring of blocks in space. Every few seconds, each one of these blocks gets an extension block that's linked to the previous one with an arrow. together they look like a tube that grows longer every few seconds.
This is what it would look like if the banks all just created their own blockchain and they weren't linked in any way. However, in what I'm proposing, each time a bank makes a new block, that block doesn't merely link to their own last block, it links to last blocks from all of the banks. So, to visualize, imagine an arrow from each new block in the ring to every previous block in the ring. Quite a mess of arrows, right? :)
This forms a set of interlocking chains, which I call a braid. So, in effect, the newest block from any bank is a tip of the chain. The banks only sign their own tips. However, as a side effect, they also effectively sign the previous blocks of all other banks too.
So, how does this confirm transactions? When you submit a transaction to a bank and it gets included in their next block. This is verification from only one bank. However by the next block it'll end up having signatures from all of the banks due to the hashchain effect.
By this point, there exists a hashchain from each bank's new block to the transaction. All of these blocks are broadcast publicly as they're made.
The only way to erase the transaction from history would be to somehow erase all copies of those blocks. The banks could all collude and make a replacement braid without a particular transaction but since they have no way of erasing all copies of the previous fork, it'd be detected and trading activity most likely completely halted.
If a single bank does something similar, it'll also be detected. However, if all banks don't collude, it's possible to determine which banks and blocks to ignore.
The key here is that the banks cross link their chains. When you have two cross linked chains, you can automatically recover from just one of them trying to stage a doublespend. If both collude, you can at least detect it in real time. At least, as long as you can make sure you're not being sybil attacked by the banks (in short, being fed different data from what the rest of the world sees).
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:24:06
I forgot to mention it in the above comment, but using multiple banks the way I mentioned also improves your privacy. The onion routing built into the current LN spec means that the others you're connected with can't tell if it's your own transfer you're making or a one you're just routing.

I didn't say the security was any better than 0-conf transaction. I was saying there are incentives present for channels that are not there for 0-conf normal transactions. 
When you can reasonably trust you're not dealing with a fraudster, which is most of the time, the risk is low enough that accepting 0-conf transactions is commonplace. Of course, exceptions exist. Most notably currency exchange services, which will get ripped off if they take 0-conf.

An ideal world would teach these people the lesson required and limit the loss to the minimum amount that's enough to teach the lesson. Also, the profits from that should not go to any individual or for profit entity. That creates perverse incentives to promote the kind of thinking that these people are engaging in.
While I agree that teaching people this lesson is valuable, the way you described is a deeply unethical way to go about it. It has absolutely nothing in it to make sure that the losses are limited and keeping the profits would also be highly unethical. The vast majority of them should be donated to charity.

As for what you're missing, my guess is that you're missing the basic understanding of how LN is planned to work. But let's start with your example.
If bitcoin transaction cost was around $20 per transaction, that'd mean that no-one would open a channel with less than $20 of total value in it because there'd be no point. I suspect it'd be quite rare to see channels without at least $200 of value in them.
However, this doesn't mean you can't make transfers of less than $20 through LN. For isolated channels, that would be the case unless you expected to be making loads of transfers through the channel in both directions. LN changes this equation by making every channel such that you can expect loads of transfers in both directions through the channel.
The answer is in the payment routing. You don't make a new channel to everyone you want to pay. Most of the time you just pay through the channels you already have. Same for receiving payments.
Suppose you want to pay your friend, let's call him Bob. Bob has a payment channel with the grocery store he frequently shops at. You have a channel with your own grocery store. Neither of you has any other channels.
So, how does LN help here? The grocery stores might have a channel between themselves. Or perhaps they both have channels with the same supplier. Or perhaps there's just another customer with channels to both stores.
In any case, it's highly likely there exists a route of channels from you to Bob. So, when you decide to send Bob $10, your wallet will search for usable routes, pick the cheapest one and execute the transfer. All without anything at all being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.
So basically, Bob will actually receive $10 through his grocery store channel. Bob's grocery store in turn will receive $10 from your grocery store (if they have a direct channel) and you will send $10 to your grocery store.
Of course, some fees will most likely be involved but probably not very big ones. Internal LN competition will ensure they get low enough to be only barely worth charging.
In case Bob wants to pay you, the same just happens in reverse.

If we don't get a malleability fix (ie, Segwit), those proxy services will be needed because malleability will make it impossible to securely do a channel close immediately followed by channel open.

There's no effect on the total coins to be released. Just a guaranteed superfast inflation, that won't significantly slow down even with the halving being reached (it'll just double the number of blocks produced per minute in the mania phases).
Oh and of course, alternating periods of no blocks at all and mad floods of blocks will make bcash much less usable for transacting than Bitcoin.

There's not much sense in having multiple separate PoW chains because every chain could make use of Bitcoin's mining to secure itself. Also, there's not much sense in every single chain having it's own currency unit.
However, there is sense in having multiple chains to contain separate transaction histories for different parts of the economy. Every Bitcoin transaction could be a block for another chain.
Lightning Network, for example, could be viewed as a network of cooperating separate non-public chains in itself. Each payment channel is a chain of transactions between the participants of the channel.
There's no sensible reason to weaken the things that make Bitcoin special just to get more direct users for the Bitcoin chain. I wouldn't be surprised to see all scaling problems solved eventually without ever completely getting rid of the 1MB limit. This is because, technically speaking, *the system as a whole can be scaled enough without doing that.* You just need to extend the system by adding parts that make efficient use of the core system with the 1MB limit.

The maximum amount is dependent on the channels available to route your payment through. So, it depends on the recipient as well as the route. There's no clear upper limit, though, except the number of bitcoins in existence. However, the first versions of LN will come with a limit in the code for how big transfers it'll make to limit the financial impact in case there are bugs in the code. So, initially, you can only expect to pay for small things through it.
As for fee structure, every node sets their fee as they wish and paying nodes choose between the routes that are on offer. If you set the fee too high, you won't get many routing requests. I expect it'll mostly be a very small percentage of the paid amount. perhaps something like 0.1% or even less.
Lightning can move funds without a need to actually get a transaction confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain. You need to make one on-chain transaction to open a channel and another to close it, but there is no upper limit to the number of individual off-chain transactions through the channel while it's open.

@_date: 2017-01-31 10:12:30
all funds in lightning are there as a part of a payment channel. A payment channel is similar to a shared bitcoin wallet but with the difference that there always exists an agreement about how many of the coins belong to each owner. That agreement takes the form of a transaction that, if broadcast, will move the coins to their individual addresses.
Moving coins in the channel means redoing the agreement about how many coins each owner of the channel owns. Naturally, that means one channel can't move more coins at once than exist in the channel.
When you receive coins through lightning, you receive them through a channel. If you have no channel, someone will open one with the coins for you.
Strictly speaking, the ownership of the coins you receive through lightning is already recorded in the blockchain as coins co-owned by you and the other party in the channel. When the channel is closed, the coins get moved to be owned by each of you individually (or possibly straight to another new channel).

I see, improvements that make sense should be tossed because you don't like the people who made them. Well, good luck in life with that attitude. Many reasonable people don't like the taste of the conspiracy nut.
Edit: For what it's worth, the idea that the core developers are the cause of the congested network and rocketing fees is beyond ridiculous. It's the worst example of misplaced blame I've seen in ages. This is not caused by the core developers. It's caused by a much much wider group of people, including you.
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:39:46
the "dao hardfork disaster" proves the point that the developers don't have much power. If they could be considered to be in charge, there'd still only be one Ethereum network.
The problem is that with a hard fork, the majority is nowhere near enough to do it cleanly and with no disasters. They're afraid that if they do release a hard fork implementation and it fails to reach the safe quorum levels, the majority of miners might decide to push forward anyway.
It would be almost as irresponsible as handing a loaded gun to a person who has never seen a gun before.

You're making the mistaken assumption that every utxo is moved equally often. That's not true. the majority of transactions every day are moving the same coins over and over again. Here, have some data about this: 
Also, the realistic increase was about 70% when it was first calculated according to the past mix of transaction sizes and types. The same calculation done today gives a result of around 110% because the use of multisig P2SH has increased since then. That number is going to keep going up as multisig use increases.

When we get the malleability fix in (for example Segwit), then Lightning Network will become usable in a short order. It'll be limited to small transactions at first, but even so that's like 90% of the actual transaction volume.
That's the real scalability upgrade. Not the 2MB. The 2MB will only give us another year at most. LN can give us at least several years.
Also, you don't have to use LN yourself to benefit. The number of onchain transactions will drop as soon as it gets any meaningful traction.
@_date: 2017-01-28 13:56:08
Wait wait wait... are you saying that Segwit is being viewed as *imposing* another slightly bigger new limit and that therefore it's unacceptable because you want the *imposing* to stop?
... what a strange way of thinking. The core developers don't have the power to impose things like that. If they did, there'd be absolutely no point in pushing for something like BU because it just wouldn't work.

Technically speaking, such a channel is possible in principle and yes, that'd be the case when it closed. However, channels have the limitation that all participants have to be online for transfers within the channel to be possible.
So, the more participants, the less reliable the channel tends to become as any one participant dropping will disable the channel until connectivity is restored. Closing the channel is always possible, though.
However, bigger channels are likely to have more longevity before they need to be closed as it's less likely that all participants want to move their coins out of the channel at the same time. They're also more flexible because the coins can move between any two participants within the channel.

between your steps 4. and 5. miners will receive lots of BCH that they will want to sell. I expect most of that will be sold ASAP. Each time that happens:
1) BCH exchange rate drops.
2) BCH difficulty will drop lower the next time before it becomes more profitable
3) In the next mania phase blocks will be mined even faster and thus inflation will speed up.
4) Go back to step 1
The number of buyers will drop simply due to the downtrend, which is pretty much guaranteed from the influx of coins to the market.

Sure, degraded version could be created that works even without segwit. It, however, comes with enough warts that it'd be difficult to convince people to use. Besides which, as far as I know, there's not even an alpha release of such a version of LN out there.
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:13:35
Users do need upgraded wallets, yes, but I fail to understand why you're underlining the "move their funds" part. Why is it important that they have to make one last transaction before they're fully segwit? It's a piece of information that makes nearly no difference as far as the blocksize is concerned.
@_date: 2017-01-28 12:11:05
While there is some definitive elegance in this proposal, I don't see it happening much in practice. The network effect makes the new system useless for a long time, which slows user migration greatly. Then again, it's pretty much the same reason hard forks are difficult. It's exceedingly difficulty to get everyone to switch systems. Especially people who won't see any immediate benefits from the upgrade which, for most upgrades, tends to be the majority.
However, there's no real need for doing things the way you propose because soft-forks will get the job done. They make it possible to simultaneously have both the new and the old. Unlike hard forks, no-one gets kicked off to what will then feel like an altcoin (or broken coin in case miners completely abandon the old one). Just for failing to upgrade.
I think soft-forks are the way to go. With the right framework, they can be used to allow the market to decide whether something is worth doing or not. I mean, that's the case even with Segwit. First there's the part where miners agree to enforce the new rules if someone uses them. That in itself means very little, though, because the market might choose not to use it, making them unnecessary. That's the beauty of a soft-fork.
You could even implement a soft fork such that it will activate, then be active for a period of time, after which it's evaluated whether it got enough use or not and might deactivate if it wasn't used enough. This works, as long as miners do this in lockstep and wallet software is built to be able to tell when a feature is no longer safe to use. This could be a useful method of making sure we don't get saddled with technical baggage that's no longer useful.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:50:35
It'll take some time for the majority of users to adopt it, yes. But so what? We won't suddenly have double the number of transactions trying to go through just because Segwit activated. Growth happens slowly, so it's perfectly fine for capacity increase to happen slowly too.

There are certain aspects of the current Bitcoin protocol that are fragile rather than anti-fragile. Scaling is one of them.
I don't think Bitcoin Core team actually even wants to decide on the scaling limits themselves. However, they will because currently, there's no way to decentralize this decision that can be relied on to work.
Also, the argument is not really about whether the limits should be increased or not. It's about what risks make sense to take to increase the limit. SegWit pretty much underlines this since it'll effectively double the raw capacity. They're not against increasing capacity. The only difference in opinion is about how important and especially *how urgent* scaling the capacity is at this point.
As it is, we haven't really hit the limit yet. What this means, in practise, is that the way we use transactions today is still rather inefficient. If we just keep increasing the limit before it's hit, each time, these inefficiencies won't be fixed because there's no incentive.
What this means is that the current level of usage would be possible with a much smaller number bytes being spent. We aren't really arguing about whether we should scale or not. We're only arguing about how we should do it.
This position is a perfectly sensible one. Fix the inefficiencies first. a hard fork shouldn't be used yet since we still have other avenues for scaling left that we can make use of.

The mechanism for maximum amount is a simple check in the code. If amount &gt; X, don't send, don't route. Very easy to remove for anyone who wants to at any point. However, unless the whole route has removed it, it'll prevent the transfer for amounts bigger than X.
Routes are automatically found.
The point of lightning is to route coins through already open channels whenever possible. So, if there's a route from your channels to the cafe, that will be used and no on-chain transaction is required.

That depends on the size of the miner in question. I suspect there are large miners who could protect their overall investment in hardware by stabilizing bcash by allocating just a few percent of their hashrate to prevent the EDA algorithm from dropping bcash difficulty too much.

This is incorrect. you only need to upgrade your wallet software or import your old keys to a new wallet if there's no upgrade available to the old wallet software.
Although, if you're talking about transaction fees, then yes, any coins received at a non-segwit address will still cost the old fees to spend. However, there's no need to explicitly do anything, the wallet will handle that transparently. Whenever you send coins, the change address will then be segwit-compatible and cheaper to respend from.
In other words, if you upgrade your wallet, you won't see lower fee the first transaction you make, but there's no need to pay the old transaction fee just to activate segwit in your wallet. You can just continue using as normal and the fees will drop. Most people will start seeing the lower fees starting from the second transaction after upgrade.
(The exception is people who received the bitcoins in their wallet in many small transactions. For these people it could take a while.)

Miners aren't the customers really, they're the only thing Bitcoin has that resembles paid employees and the value of their paycheck depends on how well Bitcoin does on the markets. The real customer is everyone who makes a difference for the market value of Bitcoin.
The only reason they're not adopting Segwit at a fast pace, is that they're uncertain if that's what the market actually wants. This is most likely due to the huge amount of controversy around  the update. There's a rather loud minority making noises about Segwit being a bad idea.
Even the market is probably confused about it. The amount of misinformation out there is staggering. Most probably have no idea what to think since they lack the technical, economical and political understanding to evaluate the situation themselves in a meaningful way.
This will resolve eventually, one way or another.

If the key is created properly, then it's so extremely unlikely that you can consider it impossible in practise. If the key is chosen in a way that helps with guessing it, though, then it's more of a wonder if no-one guesses it.
The only way to be sure that the key is secure is to have it be properly randomized. Some people take this to the extreme of creating their keys by manually throwing a dice hundreds of times. Theoretically 100 throws is enough for a "perfect" random for a 256bit bitcoin private key, but that's only if the dice is perfectly balanced. (a regular 6-sided dice throw theoretically has ~2.585 bits of entropy if the dice is perfectly balanced.)
Others have spent hours shuffling a deck of cards and then eventually used the order of the cards for the key. (In this case the deck can function as a backup, if you somehow ensure the order of the cards will not be touched.)
The TL;DR is basically that any parts of the key that you choose with the aim to help you remember it will compromise the security of the key much much more than it'll help you in remembering it.

Probably also worth mentioning that core developers are in a similar position when compared to miners. They don't receive a direct influence from the market but an indirect one in that their work is useless unless the market adopts it
It's a rare person who likes to see their work abandoned, especially engineers and programmers. So, they've got a huge incentive to only work on things that they believe are likely to be eventually selected by the market. Also, for the same reason, they've got a huge incentive to avoid making an update they believe will be harmful if adopted, because that will also lead to their work being abandoned.
It's also worth noting that many of the core dev team are long time open source programmers. Which basically means that they care more about building useful programs than money. I don't think it's a stretch to say that they've got a much more personal investment in the success of Bitcoin than miners.

It's also the only other cryptocurrency that even comes close to Bitcoin in community size or value. The likelyhood of a chain split on a hard fork with any controversy increases with size of the community.


The difference is that the King of England had measures in place *that were there to keep him in power*. Cryptocurrencies don't have such measures. That's the crucial difference. The only reason they seem to have power is that people trust them to choose things for them. It might look like power, but it's merely an illusion, because it can be lost so easily and abruptly.

I think the simple answer needs some supporting explanation.
For a soft fork, requiring 95% of miners is being extremely conservative. Soft forks are reasonably safe even at lower support levels because no matter how the users choose, permanent chain splits just won't happen. 
However, for a hard fork... well, I'm not sure if 95% is enough, to be honest. Especially since **for a hard fork, it's not just the miner support that counts**. For a hard fork, user support is just as, if not more, critical and we lack a way to measure it with any accuracy.
5% of Bitcoin is bigger than ... well, any altcoin except Ethereum. Big enough that it still leaves a credible risk of a chain split. And to top it off, there's no way to measure what the real percentages are.
TL;DR For a soft fork to be safe, miner support is enough. For a hard fork, user support is just as, if not more, critical.

It's not as simple as that. You're making your analysis by trying to maximize profits on the short term. Miners are in it for the long haul.

Why would they? That'd gain them nothing and cost them a lot. The beauty of a soft-fork is that it won't change a thing for anyone who doesn't opt-in. That's why it's called soft.

In other words, pure PoS doesn't actually solve the byzantine generals problem for anyone who wasn't present when the system got started. Instead it requires a trusted source for the initial blockchain data. It requires users to solve the trust problem some other way to be able to bootstrap a node.

Any PoS mechanism essentially degrades into PoW given enough time. Initially the work is analyzing the PoS scheme to figure out what is needed subvert it.
As the analysis proceeds, the analyzer starts to understand how to gain influence more effectively than others and will find other kinds of work that will help subvert the system.
The worst case is that the analyzer finds a way to completely subvert and/or disable/destroy the system. The harder the PoS system is to analyze (as in, understand how to effectively transform it into a PoW system), the bigger risk the risk.

If someone had a way to go straight from public key to private key, it'd be front page news on every news outlet everywhere. That's how big it'd be. Bitcoin would be devastated, but the damage would be felt much wider than that.
The only viable attack in this space is to generate every weak private key you can think of and then watch their bitcoin-addresses for coins. So basically, if your private key is something someone else might come up with using the same logic, it's weak, don't use it.
Just keep in mind that the danger is not from random someones just happening to pick the same private key. There are people out there who're working full time figuring out every possible way to come up with a weak private key and automating their generation and then grabbing any coins they find. They're probably watching billions of weak addresses all the time. Although, that's probably the upper limit of what makes sense to keep watch on. It gets pretty expensive in terms of hardware to expand from there.
(just to convey the sense of scale here. The number of bitcoin private keys possible is a number with 78 digits. Billion is a number with 10 digits. )

Yes it does. It follows a simple set of rules:
a) If you can earn Y units of money by doing work worth X units of money and X&lt;=Y, it'll be worth doing the work and thus someone will do it.
b) Competition will push Y towards X, hence over the long term they will be roughly equal.
The work/resource we're talking about here isn't burning electricity.  It's something else. Exactly what it is will depend on the system, but I suspect the majority of the work spent will be mental labor.
So, instead of computers burning themselves up to secure the system, we will have humans burning themselves up to secure the system.

The only practical reasons to close a channel are when
1. You need to open a channel with someone else and only have bitcoins in open channels. You might want to do this to improve your privacy and/or to reduce the fees you pay by optimizing the routes you have available.
2. You need to pay someone Bitcoins and sending them through the channels isn't an option. In theory, you could do this by merely reducing the channel size, but the current LN specifications don't include support for negotiating such a transaction yet.
Other people have listed the other party trying to cheat as the reason to close. Well, that's correct, but it's also so magnificently dumb thing to even try that in practice you just won't see it happen unless there are major bugs in some LN implementations.

An event like this is very worrying for SPV users because during an accidental fork that lasts more than 1 block, they might see a (from their point of view) confirmed transaction get reversed and double spent by the real fork.

The main benefit of SegWit is not the block size increase. The main benefits are that it fixes malleability and builds a scaffolding that makes it super simple to make upgrades to the scripting system in the future. The block size increase is just a side benefit, tacked on to the side since there's demand for increased block size and it was no extra complexity to add.
Frankly, I'm puzzled that it became the main thing people know about segwit.

xthin blocks help remove inefficiencies in block and transaction propagation but it's not a solution. It just approximately halves the bandwidth required, which will be fast consumed by the user base doubling. Besides, which, it's slightly inferior to compact blocks proposal which was adopted by Bitcoin Core.
However, neither of those are complete solutions to the bandwidth usage problem. All transactions still have to be broadcast.  All they do is they dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred on the moment of block discovery. All data in the blocks still has to be transferred. However, with xthin and compact blocks, most of it happens before the block is found.

We could have lightning even without Segwit, but opening payment channels would be either extremely clumsy and/or require trust (or binding legal agreements) between the participants to be practical.
So, yes, we can have LN without Segwit. However, the disadvantages from not having Segwit would have an extremely centralizing effect on the system.
So, basically, a decentralized LN requires Segwit while a practically centralized LN can make do without Segwit. This is the very thing that has always amused me about people who resist Segwit because they think LN will be centralized.

This means that there's a standard protocol that different LN implementations can use to interoperate.
It's likely that we'll have experimental wallets that support LN with real bitcoins from Segwit activation day.
As for routing, well, it was never a problem for small networks in the first place. The main open question is how large of a network the currently suggested algorithms can support in practice.

The bar for effectively preventing the 2x HF is actually much lower than it was for pushing BIP148 through. Why? Simply because you only need to convince everyone to keep running what they're running right now.
Well, technically speaking, if someone wants to fork, no-one can prevent it. However, a fork without many users is meaningless, so there's no need to prevent it, really. Just make sure as few people as possible are fooled into buying into it and it won't have many users.

While they call it an agreement, it's effectively just a proposal seeking to get the community to compromise rather than split. However, this makes it a rather different beast than an actual agreement would be.
Because it's a proposal, it has no binding power. Thus, the only thing that could have held it together is if adopting it would be better in someway than abandoning it. The BCH fork and the support from the big blocks crowd it gained has decimated all reason to support the proposal anymore.


Segwit will bring, at the very least, a capacity increase of 2x. It'll also make multi-step smart contracts possible to create such that no coins move until the whole contract is signed and atomic (due to the malleability fix).
Segwit activation will also mean that development to get schnorr signature soft fork underway will begin. That will, once activated increase the effective maximum transaction rate to 3x compared to pre-segwit activation. This is due to the possibility to aggregate schnorr signatures, so less blockspace is needed for them.
Also, while you might be correct that user adoption is in reverse, the users that are leaving are those whose effect on the exchange rate and economic impact is the smallest. They're being replaced by users with much more significant economic impact and therefore more effect on the exchange rate.


You know, people might take you more seriously if you weren't spouting obvious bullshit. It won't take long after Segwit activation to see that this particular claim is total and utter bullshit.

I'm not sure why you would characterize it as kafkaesque. 
There may be 460 contributors listed on Github, but that doesn't mean all or even most of them are actively contributing code. The way open source projects work is that each volunteer works on whatever he/she feels like working on.
They might have some discussions about priorities, but there's no taskmaster. Each coder chooses something to work on that they individually want to work on, for whatever personal reasons they might have.
The uncertainty over whether segwit would activate at all also likely discouraged segwit related development work.  Developer enthusiasm also doesn't recover easily after a setback like the political schism like we've had over Segwit. I suspect it'll now slowly recover now that we have Segwit activated for real.

That's pretty likely. It'd take a concerted and active effort to keep an unexpected fork like that alive in an economical sense. At the very least it'd require a group of people who actually want to create a splitting fork, in which case, it's bound to happen anyway.
However, the problem with longer accidental forks is that they can potentially allow opportunists to make successful double spend attacks. Which makes accepting Bitcoin payments more risky than it'd be, otherwise.
I'm starting to think there's a serious need for some modification to the mining system to make SPV mining too unreliable to be profitable. It should be no a brainer for wannabe SPV miners to mine at a pool that actually does it's job rather than try fake it themselves. The systems needs to be retooled such that there's a profitable attack that can easily be performed against SPV miners but that fully validating miners will have no problem with.
@_date: 2017-01-29 12:21:22


The main problem with this model is that it guarantees that there will be losers while there's no real need for those.


I don't think this controversy will last for long enough to block Segwit from activating. Mainly because all the resistance I've seen so far is based on misconceptions and/or misunderstandings. Anyone who actually thinks for themselves will figure it out with an afternoon of research.
Then again, for this very reason it's absolutely mind boggling to see people resisting it.


Every cryptocurrency has to start more or less centralized and then slowly migrate away from that as the community grows. That policy will give the devs a little more time to get things in order before political strife around the system eventually makes it very difficult. Although, it comes with the danger that they might realize too late when it's no longer possible to hard fork safely.

It's not a company, it's an open source project. Development happens on a volunteer basis. In addition, they know that Bitcoin Core isn't that widely used as an UI wallet, so they don't assign much importance to the graphical user interface. The RPC interface is the main interface Bitcoin Core is used with and that supports Segwit transactions sufficiently well.
In other words, if you want Bitcoin Core GUI to support segwit, do it yourself or pay someone to implement it.

This analysis assumes hashrate will always keep increasing at the same exponential speed that it does today. I don't think that's a an assumption you can make. The exponential increase of market price can't continue forever and once that stops, hashrate will also stabilize.

I think you badly underestimate the pioneer spirit present in the community. Also note that, Bitcoin Core itself is still versioned at below 1.0, which means the developers don't think it's quite ready for production yet.
In any case, I'd be perfectly happy to risk something like 20mbtc to keep in a lightning wallet. Besides, the instant confirmation feature is going to be very enticing for many use cases of micropayments. We won't have a shortage of people rushing to use the alpha. Incidentally, that also means that it'll get out of alpha quite fast due to the amount of testing it'll receive.
Besides, Even if the whole network suddenly supported SegWit today, we'd still be at least a month from the activation date. Plenty of time to test the alpha before production.

You can never succeed in a fork by approaching it like a war. That approach creates enemies, which destroys all possibility of successful fork.
In an attempt to fork, the only way to success is by persuasion, not force. Successful persuasion requires understanding the opponent and their reasons for resistance. Only then can you set to work removing the reasons to resist.
As far as I can tell, Segwit has already removed all the actual reasons to resist. From my point of view, it looks like what's left is just a few still trying to clutch at the straws (or imaginary reasons to resist).
If there still are actual rational reasons to resist Segwit left, I'd be very curious to hear of them. The arguments about technical debt aren't entirely wrong, but there's no real hurry to remove that particular technical debt, as it's a problem that really won't manifest until decades later.  There's no problem organizing a proper 3+ year hard fork to deal with it.

... we really need a good, short and easily understandable explanation for how just twiddling with the blocksize limit is not a scaling solution. Even more importantly, we need to get people to stop ignoring the fact that SegWit isn't merely a blocksize increase but more importantly is an extremely important bugfix at the same time. It fixes the issue called malleability that seriously complicates the usability of smart contracts.
The blocksize increase it comes with is just something that was slapped on to the side, since it only minimally increased the total complexity of the change.

You're certainly welcome to have an opinion on the matter. Just be aware that many disagree with you and that's the reason the word "market cap" will continue to be used in the context of Bitcoin. 


Really? I suspect well over 90% of people have no idea what it means. Besides, the whole inapplicability hinges on the definition of what is a company and what is not. That is, it hinges on a rather arbitrary definition. A definition that can and will be changed where it makes sense to do so.
I and many others think it does make sense to consider the Bitcoin system and the surrounding economy as analogous to a company. The emerging politics over the system's governance definitely point that way. If it was merely a commodity, there'd be no politics to speak of.

if you want Bitcoin to be able to compete with Ethereum or other more smart contract focused altcoins, then yes, malleability fix is urgently needed. The same holds for Litecoin. Malleability is holding the scripting system back. The ability to do simple upgrades to the scripting system is similar. There are already many upgrades planned for after segwit, some of them will further improve scaling by making transactions smaller and others will add features that help with smart contracts.

If I interpret what you're saying on a technical level, what you're saying is pretty much spot on. However, nodes don't run on the  tehnical implementation only. There's a human (or a group of humans) calling the shots behind each and every node.
Many people use the term 'node' to refer to an unit comprised of both the technical node as well as it's operator(s). If you insist on interpreting 'node' to only refer to a technical node in isolation, the claims are going to sound outlandish.
You're correct, though, that measuring support from (random) nodes makes no sense. However, it's somewhat ambiguous whether or not actually needed to be told that.
(Do note, though that while measuring support from random nodes is meaningless, Support from well known nodes with high importance would be very meaningful)

Yes I do. You have it backwards. Definitions don't create meaning. Meanings create definitions and when meanings change, definitions get updated.
In this case, there already are people that consider Bitcoin as a first example of a new type of company and if you agree with that, there's no problem using the term market cap here.


I think I might have seen some people using these terms when talkign about bitcoin. However, when I was asking you for alternatives, those didn't even pop up as candidates. They don't feel like they say're saying the same thing.

No, it'd just basically be miners deciding to reduce the activation percentage. No other significant difference.
It shouldn't be done without at least 70% of the hashrate enforcing segwit though. The potential for disrupting the normal operation in Bitcoin is too big otherwise.
Still, it'll probably not be necessary. Just talking about will likely pull the laggards in given that there's enough hashrate willing to enforce segwit.

That CPU speed statistic you just calculated proves his point. 25% a year is rather damn close  to the proposed 17% increase per year. But we also need to account for storage device access speeds and network speeds. 17% is likely pretty close to the increase we can expect yearly.

What you call "KYC scam" is basically what the following process looks like from a customer's viewpoint:
1. an Exchange opens without KYC requirements. No laws require them to do so, so they decide to not require KYC. It's a pretty expensive process to do and they'll even lose customers by doing so.
2. For a while it works out well. Then the exchange starts seeing more and more cases of fraud and pressure from either the banking industry, law enforcement or regulators or all of them to make it stop.
3. The Exchange might try for a while to curb the fraud cases without implementing a full blown KYC. Perhaps even with some success.
4. But, eventually it's just not enough. They're no longer just risking their business by not requiring KYC. They're risking *personal criminal liability* for operating the service as well. Thus, when KYC is implemented, they also refuse withdrawals to those who haven't identified themselves acceptably. This is because, if they didn't, all the funds that are most risky from personal liability standpoint would flood out of the exchange right there and then and then they'd be royally screwed.
The takeaway? Pretty simple. An exchange service without KYC is a pipe dream. Decentralized exchanges have the same issues, technically speaking, but the risks are externalized on their customers instead.

a Payment Channel is basically a clever trick to that allows using 0\-conf transactions securely in a limited context. LN is a collection of protocols for using these 0\-conf transactions to move money despite their restrictions.
Also, while there's no overall ledger in LN, it's possible to consider each 0\-conf transaction (payment channel) as a ledger in itself.  However, it's also simultaneously a Bitcoin transaction and **can be used to make regular Bitcoin transactions at will**. Technically speaking, this involves closing and re\-opening the payment channel, but for all practical purposes, the channel doesn't really close since the open and close are simultaneous.
While I'm not aware of a lightning wallet that has implemented this yet, the fact that it's possible is what decimates all arguments based on something called an "LN Coin". Once Lightning Wallets are out of Beta, there'll be nearly no reason to keep any hot wallet balance outside of payment channels.

As I said, definitions can be changed and that's the point of choosing to use the term 'market cap' with bitcoin.
By the way, I note that you're completely ignoring any attempt to discuss whether or not Bitcoin could be considered a company and are merely insisting that it's obviously not while providing no basis for it whatsoever.
Bitcoin doesn't fit the current official definition of a company, that I won't argue with. But I think it will, in the future.
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:35:18
Strictly speaking, to use LN, there'll always be need to commit an amount of BTC into a channel. However, that shouldn't, generally speaking, mean losing the ability to use it otherwise. The only exception to this is if the channel partner refuses or is unable to cooperate with you.
I'd expect, though, that for the most part there won't be any real reason to keep any hot wallet balance outside of payment channels once LN is out of beta.

I find it quite funny that if Segwit had left the blocksize alone, no-one would bother talking bullshit about it. It'd just be a no-brainer bugfix upgrade like the other past soft-forks were.

That's the drawback of having a heterogeneous mining software ecosystem.
It's not necessarily updating bitcoind, that's the issue, but rather updating all the other code that the pool system has that needs to understand the block data format.
Although, some pools might also be using their own set of patches to bitcoind and as such are still stuck with 0.12 series as not all of the patches are compatible with 0.13 yet. There could be important patches that the pool is relying on that are blocking the upgrade. Since there are a lot of changes between 0.12 and 0.13 codebases, porting the patches might not be a simple matter for someone without considerable expertise about how Bitcoin Core works. It's not just the Segwit code that's potentially blocking upgrades.

If the patch author actually works for the pool, then that usually doesn't pose a problem. The problem is the patches that someone else made that the pool is just using. They either need to wait until the original author feels like making a version for 0.13 or paying someone to do it (not cheap).

I think that if Gavin hadn't gone and created a ticking clock, we'd have zero proposals by now.
Although, I must say that I'm slightly disappointed that all proposals are just tweaking maximum blocksize. It's not the size of a single block that should matter so much but the total size of blocks over a longer timespan. Granted, maximum block size does set an effective cap on the daily maximum but handles large bursts of transactions badly.

Just keep in mind that the lower the fee, the bigger the risk of a longer delay.
There's usually a limit, under which it's impossible to accurately predict how long your transaction will take to confirm. When the fee is above that, your transaction will confirm fast. However, the uncertainty comes from the difficulty in accurately estimating where that limit is at any given moment. You can only determine that limit accurately for the past and the limit sometimes moves very fast.

* It's much easier to impose stricter limits on the block size in the future than it's to further increase the limits. It's a soft-fork rather than hard-fork. Also, 8MB is not quite enough yet to make a significant difference to centralization.
* 1MB is not enough for even lightning in the long run, so an increased block size is still necessary. In fact, even 8MB might be too little in the long run.
* It is not urgent to increase the block size limit yet. However, it _is_ urgent to prepare so we can increase the limits on short notice when it does become urgent. Having an implementation that's ready for the increase is therefore a crucial thing to exist.
* I'm not sure if this is necessary or even meaningful to point out, but I don't support XT (although, I can't say I'm against it either). I support increasing the block size limit.
* I don't believe the stress tests really simulated the effects of hitting the block size limit properly. Although, since wallets are improving their support for fees, it certainly reduced the impact somewhat.

Unfortunately, ledger can't read your mind to know how important fast confirmation is for the transaction you're making. Sometimes it can save a lot to be able to take a small risk that it won't confirm fast. So, the wallet does need user input to do this reliably and cheaply.

Scaling plans and roadmaps aren't things that change the definition of what Bitcoin is. They're suggestions and proposals on how to change it.

This is not a purely economic issue either. There is a need for a system engineer perspective as well. A sosiologist would be important too.
There are very good reasons from the system engineer perspective to be very careful about changing the blocksize. A mistake in the process could be quite a disaster. Also, blocksize increase is not the only way to increase scalability. There are alternatives with much less risky failure modes, like the Lightning Network.
The economic perspective you bring up is not wrong. But there are real risks involved with significant repercussions if something goes wrong and Lightning Network actually has the properties you are calling for.
That being said, there are also risks involved with not increasing the blocksize. While these risks are more likely to actualize, their repercussions are much lighter and will at worst only delay the growth of Bitcoin usage.
For these reasons, my own position would be that we should prepare for the eventuality that the blocksize needs increasing so that we can do it on a short notice when it's necessary. Almost everyone agrees that it needs doing at some point. However, we're far from wide agreement on exactly how it should be done.
Some people want a simple one time increase to minimize the short term risk involved. Others reject this idea as "just kicking the can down the road". They want a system that can handle all the future size increases. However, most of them don't trust miners with this choice. They're afraid the bigger miners will increase the bar for participation in mining so high that only very wealthy can do it and that will eventually lead to Bitcoin becoming centrally controlled.

You're mistaken. Gavin is not stuck on a particular proposal, but he wants something to happen. Backing his proposal with an actual implementation is a way to get discussion going and progress happening for a consensus. It'll also lead to a lot more people really learning how and why bitcoin works. All necessary for a consensus to form at all.
If he (or someone else) wasn't doing this, the issue would not start getting the attention it needs until we start seeing problems from transactions never getting confirmed. By that time, it'd be way too pressing issue for anything resembling informed consensus.

I'm in awe with the level of subtle contempt this comment just leveled on the whole Bitcoin community.
At the same time, it's also amusingly correct. However, not because the core dev team has any power to dictate what Bitcoin is but because the core dev team is exceedingly unlikely to contradict the pre-existing community consensus about what Bitcoin is.
You rhetoric appears to be implying the core dev team can arbitrarily dictate what Bitcoin is. The truth is, though, that it's the community consensus that dictates what the bitcoin core dev team says Bitcoin is.

Attacking Bitcoin with transaction spam is only going to make it stronger. There are all kinds of things that could be done to make the software able to handle such an attack much more gracefully. The only thing it'd do is increase the fee people would have to use to get their transactions through.
But $2,000,000 is not enough to increase the fee to a level that would be a serious problem. If you wanted to increase the fee to $1 , you could do it for 3-4 days at most. $0.50 you could perhaps do for a week. Anything lower is not really worth considering anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:11:59
Because the spam has higher fees. I think I saw somewhere that the spam is being created with 0.0002 BTC/kb fees. Your 0.000019 is much lower than that.

@_date: 2015-08-18 16:39:06
The stress tests we had do not quite match the situation we'll have when demand really outstrips the capacity. The stress tests just simply flooded transactions with a certain amount of fee. Anyone could easily compensate by increasing their own fee and their transactions would go through.
Now, consider the situation where transactions are actually originating from actors who want them to go through and there's not enough capacity. Fees will go through the roof as everyone is trying outbid the others. The stress tests were mild compared to this.

The tools for handling this sort of cases are unfortunately rather lacking. It'll most likely take a little while for better support for fees to trickle to the users at large.
Even services might have some trouble retooling their systems to actually do something other than using static fees. It depends on the quality of the code they're using and whether or not they have anyone who is able to do anything about it.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:13:06
We had a lot of spam, yes. Yet, anyone who had a wallet with proper support for fees could still make transactions that went through reasonably fast.  The limit does mean that the blockchain won't explode in size faster than 6MB/hour, which I believe was the point. The fee system will handle the transaction prioritization.

This would be pretty simple to do. Just add a commitment to coinbase TX that can be calculated from the txids of the transactions (other than the coinbase) included in that block. 
basically, you could reuse the bitcoin merkle root calculation algorithm but use a hash of zeroes for the coinbase transaction. Anyone would then be able to verify if the coinbase's merkle root matches with the actual transactions.
Edit: Actually, you could do that by producing blocks as defined in the BIP draft you linked to. The only real difference would be that your node wouldn't reject blocks that don't do so.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:40:51
If all miners were using asicboost, there'd be no incentive to block segwit because the relative hashpower ratios would remain the same.
Only a situation where most miners aren't using asicboost gives asicboost using miners an incentive to block segwit because they'd lose their edge over the competition when segwit activates and would as a result get a smaller piece of the whole pie.
If everyone were using asicboost, it wouldn't matter much because everyone would lose an equal proportion of their hashpower. In this case everyone would still make the same amount of money.

RBF invalidates the previous version of the transaction and that, by extension, also invalidates all transactions that depend on the invalidated transaction, which is what a CPFP is, it's a continuation transaction for the 0-conf transaction.
They're mutually exclusive. A miner has to choose either the new replacement transaction from RBF or the original plus the CPFP transaction added after it.
Needless to say, it's cheaper to use RBF. It takes up less space in the block.

You know, I'm not presenting a solution here. Merely an argument that the sky won't fall if the limits get saturated. Which it seems you actually understand, you just label that as "failure".
To me that's a working system. Not perfect, but something that works and can be further improved in time. Far from useless.
That being said, this somehow seems to be morphing into a discussion about the block size limit. I probably should state what I think about that situation.
1. We need to increase the limit eventually.
2. We need to test the process of hard fork.
3. We also need information about the market reaction to the block size limit saturating. Guesses can't be perfect, we should let it happen for a while so we know.
4. To gain the information in 3, we need to wait with hard fork until it's clear we're at the limit.
5. Then we should proceed with the hard fork.
6. If we hard fork right now, we'll not gain the information from point 3. and will likely not be able to avoid some issues that we could've avoided, provided we knew the information gained from 3.

There are plenty of legal things to spend one's bitcoins on. For instance, through purse.io you can get noticeable discounts off of Amazon's products. Many *legal drug stores* offer up to 25% discount when paying with bitcoin. (Yes, they've got big enough problems with chargebacks that it makes sense to offer that much discount)
Those are significant enough savings that even taking into account the exchange fees, you'd still be left with considerable discount and thus there's reason to think many people actually make use of Bitcoin for those purposes.
Also, that's only the tip of the iceberg. if you go looking, you'll find many legal stores where using Bitcoin will give you the best deal.

The company I work for makes hundreds of bitcoin transactions per day. It's been months since I had to troubleshoot a non-confirming transaction. I made a CPFP transaction and it was confirmed the next block after that.
I hope you're not still being thickheaded about that months old transaction thing. No sensible wallet will keep a transaction for months without comparing it's fees to the current network fee level and reacting appropriately.

Miner centralization is a risk, yes, but unlike you think, they can't veto whatever they please. They have a practical veto, as long as the rest of the community is sufficiently divided about an upgrade, but can be replaced if the rest of the community is sufficiently united in the decision.
Most of the things causing mining centralization aren't so much in the core consensus protocol but rather in the non-consensus layer and many of them have been fixed as time passes.


What fucking goodwill? They have an _economic incentive_ to make sure things work. That's been a design feature of the system from the very start. Please stop spouting nonsense.


I can see how the BU developers never had any inkling of that to begin with, but many Core developers are quite aware. They're just picking the only known route that has any potential of keeping Bitcoin's desirable parameters intact. That's risky, yes, but preferable to the alternatives.


I don't suppose you would happen to have an example of what your so called "real" solution would look like?
Both things I listed are relying on the same thing Bitcoin more generally relies on, which is that miners want to money. 


The jury is still out there on whether mining is bound to become too centralized. Precisely because it's so difficult to predict how the economy will react to it. That's also why it doesn't make sense to try to conclusively prove whether the current solutions work or not. Due to the economical factors, the only practical way of finding out is to try them out in practice.
For instance, the relay problem you're so fond of, might turn out to not be a problem at all due to the _economic incentives_ anyone owning bitcoins have to keep the system working. Especially miners have a strong incentive to make sure relays work since, if the ship sinks, they'll be the ones with an especially limited access to life boats.


I didn't realize you were this unfamiliar with the tech... From the perspective of a third party, a channel open transaction looks exactly like a regular transaction with a multisig output. Mostly because that's precisely what it is. The special stuff you were speaking of happens between the parties forming the channel. The base, however, is a regular multisig output. There's no technical reason to require the sender to be part of the channel. 
Although, in the case I was envisioning, the company paying the paycheck would also function as an LN payment hub for their employees for routing their LN payments. So, in that case the sender would actually be part of the channel.


Payment Channel opening transaction is not an LN payment. It's a bitcoin on-chain transaction.
But yes, LN is, _generally speaking_, not intended for high value payments. It doesn't mean it can't do it. When there's a contractual trust relationship plus a direct channel between parties, the risk factors are significantly reduced and thus larger transactions will make sense.
Of course, before the system sees actual production use, it's not possible to tell exactly what the risk factors actually are, since that's a mixed economic and social prediction. It's entirely possible that, with production use, we'll find that even a paycheck is sufficiently small to be sent through even LN routing.


If you use Bitcoin directly, those risks are completely dependent on your own security measures. It's not especially difficult to match the level of security you get with your bank. Because the comparison won't be against bank's internal security but rather against the security level of your bank access credentials.
That being said, if you don't care about the security, the security level won't match using a bank. However, if you do care, you can even significantly exceed it.


Mt.Gox was basically a bitcoin *bank* and a rather sloppily run one at that. I don't see how it's relevant to the discussion. We're comparing Bitcoin's security to regulated banks, not to the security of an unregulated corporation that pretended to be trustworthy.

Because, I don't agree that a minority can change the rules like that. Even if they have the mining power.


The name is ultimately meaningless. What matters is which chain most people are going to trust their money with.


At that point, it no longer matters how much hashpower they have. The crucial thing, however, isn't the technical chain split but the economical chain split. As in, who is willing to trust which chain with how much money.


Sure, that's the minimum requirement for the miners to have any chance at all. That is for some exchange to agree to list their altcoin. Whether it'll be called Bitcoin or something else, though, will end up being decided by the market. As will the value. If they have the support from a big enough portion of the market, they might end up with a viable altcoin.




Blockstream clearly has influence in the development, but that's not the same thing as control. Moreover, even if they controlled the Core implementation, it still wouldn't be the same thing as controlling the protocol upgrades. They'd still have no way to force the network to adopt their changes.
I don't think you quite appreciate how difficult it is to control an open source project.

That's pretty much the point. That's the very difference between soft and hard fork.
Soft fork --&gt; upgrade if you want the improvements.
Hard Fork -&gt; Upgrade or stop using.
The only way to get all the scaling benefits immediately is for nearly everyone to upgrade at the same time. This is the requirement for a successful hard fork.
However, your criticism of SW as a capacity upgrade is based on assuming it's not possible to get everyone to upgrade fast enough for the upgrade to materialize in time.
In other words, it looks to me like you're saying we need to hard fork because we can't persuade people to upgrade fast enough. This makes no sense. You can't successfully hard fork if that's the case.
SW allows a partial capacity increase even when not everyone upgrades, whereas a hard fork size increase only ever materializes if everyone upgrades.
By the way, miners naturally have an incentive to prioritize SW transactions in the event of congestion. They make more profit that way and it's better for bitcoin exchange rate development.
the benefit from SW transactions does not fall equally for those who don't use it. There is some benefit, but the most benefit can be had by upgrading. If you upgrade, you can get both a lower fee and more priority for your transactions than with legacy transactions. Simply because the same amount of fee gets you almost double the priority. So you could, for example choose to pay 30% lower fee for 40% more priority when you move to SW. or 50% lower fee for the same priority. Or the same old fees for double priority.
You can of course get the same priority with legacy transactions if you pay more fees but ... well... wouldn't you rather upgrade if possible?

The decreasing timelock period was part of an earlier design of LN. It's now been replaced with transaction invalidation (which, itseems I didn't explain clearly enough).
However, you're correct that this requires active monitoring. The version that becomes possible to use with SegWit activation, however, supports trustless outsourcing of this monitoring if you can't do it yourself.
Also, it doesn't require 24/7 monitoring unless you use really short timelocks. If the timelock is 7 days, it's enough to get your wallet online at least once every 6 days.
I didn't pay much attention to the fee handling. However, I have a faint memory about reading that the transactions can be built so that you can actually define the fee just prior to broadcast without needing a new signature from the other party. As long as the extra fee comes from your own output.


No, the first transaction is valid immediately. The timelock period begins from the confirmation of the first transaction. The thing is, the first transaction doesn't pay Exchange B yet. It funds another 2 of 2 multisig with one key from exchange B and one from customer A. The key that Exchange B uses here is never used for anything else.
That's why sending the private key to Customer A won't give access to the funds _unless_ the first transaction in the chain is broadcast.

There's no clear cut and widely comparable way to measure economic majority. That we're in agreement about.
It's easier to come up with ways to tell if there is not a sufficient economic majority supporting UASF than to say for sure that there is sufficient majority. However, I don't think that matters, actually.
For instance, any major exchange refusing to support UASF, will pretty much veto the whole thing. Pushing through with UASF, in such a situation regardless would be a splitting fork, which the UASF code is not designed to handle and would just end badly. Hence, almost no-one will activate UASF if that's the case.
I don't particularly care what they've written about it on the UASF site. I'll explain my own understanding of the situation though.
First, a simple majority of miners is enough to activate a soft fork through the MASF process. The reason Segwit's activation threshold is set at a supermajority of 95%+ is to try to make it certain that the activation will go smoothly. Partially because it's impossible to automatically measure segwit support among full nodes in general. So the percentage is set high to minimize problems that might occur if _only miners_ were enforcing segwit.
So, if the majority of miners are willing to enforce segwit and we can determine without much doubt that at least simple economic majority is also willing to do so, we can expect to get a relatively problem free activation for Segwit without any supermajority required.
However, if the miner support is less than a majority, then activating UASF is rather dangerous without a clear economic supermajority to make sure there's no money available for miners mining the non-UASF chain.
In short, a supermajority of either miners or economic nodes alone can impose a soft forking change. However, a lesser majority can work if sufficient support exists in both groups.

After reading the whitepaper, yes, you're correct about the weapon existing. It just has nothing to do with hash pre-images. It's just simply the sharing of private keys, so that if you broadcast an old version of the settlement transaction, the other party can use the private key to take it all.
It's used in LN to assure the other party that you won't do it. Clever trick, really. Especially how it's built so that it's no danger at all unless you try to broadcast the old version.
It does mean that you _REALLY don't want to run a buggy implemention_, though.

Your scenario fall flat for a very simple reason. It assumes the people who can't fit into the bus will just continue to wait, wait wait wait... In reality people won't wait forever. They'll find some other option that isn't overcrowded. That's not a failure of the system, it'll continue to work for those who're willing to pay the price. Those who can't will find something else or do without. **AS A RESULT THE DEMAND FALLS** and **CONGESTION STOPS**.
The average wait time won't be that high, because no-one will wait that long. Some users will leave and then there's again enough capacity for the remaining users.


Yes, and hence the ones whose time limit is closest will pay what it takes to get the priority. Also, those not willing to pay enough to get included will start exiting the system before congestion is bad enough to have a chance to cause loss of money.
This can't be that difficult to grasp.

Well, at least we agree that this topic doesn't really matter too much and that the multiplier effect is the important part.
I also expect I'll try to refrain from making claims with numbers in the future when they involve the sort of guesswork estimates here require. That being said, I'm not convinced the 120 million estimate is disconnected from reality.
That being said, I don't think the scenario of 120 million people wanting to buy some bitcoin is so far off. At least, if you think 10 years to the future. Bitcoin is rather tiny today but the growth would have to very significantly stagnate to not have 120 million users in 10 years. To doubt the scenario is akin to believing we will fail to improve scalability enough during the next 10 years.


100% saturated does not equal useless. You'd have to assume the fee market just doesn't work at all to make that assumption. The way transaction fees are already increasing in response to transaction pressure proves that it works. Assuming a constant backlog of even just several days requires a mindset where you expect everyone to stubbornly refuse to increase their transaction fee. That makes no sense. Some will pay more and some will figure out some other way to pay and the pressure will stabilize.
A congestion event will slow down growth. However, with LN, the increased fees will also motivate increased efficiency in channel use, so transaction pressure from LN will also decrease as a result and allow a little more growth before the next congestion. This, of course, has diminishing returns, but it's the end game of this process that the 120 million estimate is about.

The important difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is that soft fork is, in a sense, backwards compatible while a hard fork isn't. That's the sense I mean. If miners decide to force all legacy transactions out, that's essentially the same as doing a hard fork because it decimates any useful backwards compatibility.
About the supermajority. SW only requires a supermajority of miners to be usable securely. That's a much easier target than a supermajority of all economically important nodes, that a hard fork requires.
I'm not familiar with exactly how Counterparty works. Does it require a lot of transactions? If so, it'd benefit greatly from the reduced transaction pressure due to ... well, just secure payment channels. Full LN isn't actually required to significantly reduce transaction load.
Colored coins I undestand the basics of. Normal LN routing would definitely break the color tracking. However, you can form a separate channel network for exchanging colored coins of the same color. That'd work with the exact same pricinples as LN for bitcoins. In fact, it would be better because it would be able to move both bitcoins and colored coins.
payment processors and merchants would perhaps benefit the most from LN. I'm baffled that you listed them as unable to adapt to LN.
I'm equally baffled about your claim that LN requires low fees. It certainly needs space for one multisig transaction per open channel, but as far as I can tell, the higher the blockchain fees, the more incentive there is to use LN. Or even just payment channels, since we already have an ecosystem of exchanges that are naturally payment hubs for their customers. All that's missing is a possibility for a secure payment channel and SegWit gives us that once there's a supermajority of miners.

The closure transactions that CA and BH receive will contain an output into their own address, which is their reward as well as the reason it makes sense to assume they'll do their job.
It's probably also worth noting that the closure transactions won't ever be valid unless they're actually needed, so you really only ever need to trust the CA or BH in that they want money.
This also means that it's possible to use more than just one CA or BH. They'd then be competing with each other, on getting the rewards.
Paying the CA and BH continuously makes no sense as that way there's no guarantee that they'll do their job. When the reward is contingent on them actually doing their job, this guarantee naturally arises.
Besides, the hardware required for doing the sort of monitoring required from CA/BH is dirt cheap and it can be completely automated. a Raspberry Pi is perfectly capable of doing it. Yes, even the oldest model available.
This means that the rewards required will be dirt cheap and that pretty much anyone will have the means to run such a service by themselves if need be. They'd just need a stable internet connection _somewhere_.
However, it's unlikely any regular user will really need to worry about that. a single Raspberry Pi could provide this service for thousands of users so the ones set up by tehnically minded people for their own use will grab whatever profit they can by providing it for others as well.


It's telling that your argument hinges on the no-guarantee thing. While what you say is technically true, it also applies to the counter party who's trying to cheat you. The end result is that the expected value of cheating is negative for the cheater and that will result in cheaters being an extremely rare occurrence.
In LN, the tables are set to favor the non-cheating party heavily. In 99.999% of the cases, a cheating attempt of the type you speak of will end up with all the money going to the non-cheating party. To top it off, such an attempt will also leave behind irrefutable evidence of attempted cheating.
As much as you like to throw around the (non)guarantee word, it stops mattering much when you look at the actual odds.

Without nearly unanimous support from exchanges, especially the big ones, UASF will never be even be attempted. So, this point is rather moot.


That depends on the market price for the blocks they mine. That's the main idea in UASF. To make sure that price is almost non-existent for non-segwit blocks. That's the whole reason it needs a supermajority of economically important nodes enforcing it.
Basically, if UASF happens, we're collectively telling the miners "you'll be mining segwit from now on, or you're fired."

Emotional arguments? What are you smoking? It's an economical argument. The reason Bitcoin system works at all is that the economical motivations for various actors in the system are properly balanced.
In the technical network, from technical perspective, nodes are equal. From an economical perspective they're anything but. If I fire up a node on a VPS somewhere and just leave it running until the lease on server expires, no one will notice anything when it goes. However, if the node (or nodes) of a major exchange go down, you are going to hear about it, because it inconveniences so many people.
I have no idea why you chose to bring BU to a conversation that has nothing to do with it. The topic is UASF vs current bitcoin chain, which is something quite different.
BIP148 is an enforced signaling flag day. It won't just directly activate segwit. It'll start rejecting blocks that don't signal for segwit. Very different from what the OP was about.

Fine, I'll just talk about your argument then.
I'll start with noting that not every transaction is equally important. I'm likely not too far from the truth if I just apply the 80:20 rule here. In this case that'd be that 20% of the transactions form 80% of Bitcoin network's actual value. (or 10% vs 90%, who knows)
When transactions can't all fit, it's the lowest value ones that will drop out. The fee matters very little for the higher value ones, so they'll just pay more.
All the data so far includes all the low value transactions too. However, a majority of those could be entirely missing and the value of the network wouldn't noticeably change. 
In short, I think the coming storm has been greatly exaggerated.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:33:30
The discount is what makes it possible to add more transactions to a block as a soft fork. Without this discount, the only way to increase capacity (that's known) would be to hard fork.
To nodes that don't support segwit, the new segwit transactions don't seem have a witness at all and they will thus look smaller. That's why even old nodes will accept more segwit transactions per block despite the 1MB size limit that they enforce.
Nodes that support segwit will see the witness data, but only count 1/4th of it towards the weight limit. This leads to the actual limits that will be in effect with Segwit.

... your understanding of the basic technology behind LN is appalling. You don't appear understand even the basics of how payment channels work. It's ridiculous to see you bashing it with completely mistaken information about it.
They're based on cooperatively (and automatically) recreating the closure transaction every time the balances change. Even if the balances don't change, the transactions can be recreated to fine tune the fee. Also, to assume that they'd use the same fee logic as for normal transactions is ridiculous. The closure transaction is the backup plan and you want to be able to hold it for a while, even if your counterparty goes offline. That means they'll be prepared with a higher fee than would be strictly necessary. In 99% of cases, there will be no need to actually use them.
Closing the channel, sending part of the balance elsewhere and reopening a new channel is very similar to merely updating the current channel balances. The difference is mainly that the process creates and broadcasts a transaction that closes the old channel and creates a new one in the same transaction that sends a part of the balance elsewhere.


I'm sorry to burst your bubble but all we had to do was to remove the fee configuration that we had previously set to use a static fee. Any current wallets will automatically determine the correct fees as long as you don't touch the settings yourself. The wallets are perfectly capable of doing this automatically. The only reason we had a problem is because we had previously configured it to be static when the dynamic fee calculation feature didn't yet exist.


No, the software just automatically initiates a negotiation with the other channel node to recreate the closure transactions with the appropriate fee. Nothing is broadcast, just the fee is updated. Also, while LN itself is designed mainly for smaller transactions, that doesn't mean LN wallets (channels) have to be small. They will be sized based on the expected transaction volume and direction.


The topology is an emergent property that will be shaped by the market forces. I won't pretend to know what it will be. But my guess is that  it'll be two topologies overlaid on each other. One is the centralized hub and spoke type topology and the other is a sparse decentralized mesh network between some of the nodes connected to the hub that connects to a network of other nodes not connected to any centralized hubs. The people who want cheap payments, will use the hubs and those who want privacy will avoid the hubs. Those wanting something in between will use both.
Numbers I won't even attempt to provide. They'll be even less likely to be anywhere close to correct than the above guess. We'll have to wait and see what the actual network will look like. Thankfully, we'll soon have a chance to see one on a production network since Litecoin chose to adopt Segwit and it'll be active in ~two weeks.
Anyway, I'm not surprised you're having trouble getting answers out of people. It's a rare person who has both the patience as well as the technical understanding needed to keep spoon feeding you the information. It's rather exhausting as you prioritize looking for faults over actually understanding how the system works. It also doesn't help that you seem to often forget the information you've been told a a message or two ago.

Yes, miners have the power to essentially make SW closer to a hard fork if they choose to do so in high enough numbers. Any miner imposing restrictions on the number of legacy transactions they include in blocks will contribute to this effect. If the uptake goes too slowly, it's bound to happen to some degree. I just hope they'll refrain from completely cutting service to legacy transactions.
I can't imagine a situation where a block size hard fork would materialize faster than SW can. SW, however, has the advantage that it's benefits can materialize before we have a supermajority whereas a block size hard fork cannot change anything before gaining a supermajority.
I have every reason to believe miners will do everything in their power to push the adoption of SW forward if the capacity limits star t causing serious problems. It's in their interests to keep Bitcoin working, afterall.
There is unfortunately a lot of bad argumentation from supporters of both sides. Anyway, do you have an example of a Bitcoin Business model that can't be easily adapted to work with the Lightning Network?
I didn't take LN too seriously until recently, myself. However, now that I've actually done some reading about it, I'm now convinced it can be implemented and adopted in time to help Bitcoin scale a few of orders of magnitude larger. SW will remove the last technical problems that have been blocking LN's implementation.
There's been some attempted FUD about the lack of concrete routing algorithm for LN being published. However, routing is a research field with over 30 years of research into it. The internet itself couldn't exist without working routing algorithms. The biggest task is figuring out which of the existing algorithms is the best match and adapting it for use in LN. It won't even require any kind of consensus to work, so future upgrades are simple.
It won't remove the need for larger block sizes, but it'll allow for a few more years of exponential growth before that's required. In addition to this, LN transactions also have instant confirmation and the potential for much improved privacy (this depends a lot on the routing algorithms chosen), which will make Bitcoin a much easier to sell.

Sure, miners can do whatever they want. They will also live with the consequences. It's the consequences that will limit what they will do, in reality.
A system like Bitcoin is worthless if a minority, even if they own the mining equipment, can unilaterally change the rules like that. No matter how high they increase the block reward, zero times the block reward is always zero. (notice that this doesn't assume the value of Bitcoin going to zero, it's the value of the altcoin they're mining that will be zero)
If miners go so far as to announce it in advance, they will face an united community, ready to switch to another PoW algorithm if that's what it takes to sidestep attacks from the previous miners. There's nothing that unites communities like a common enemy. Miners would be unbelievably stupid to attempt such a stunt.

Your mistake is assuming that exchanges can do that without support from their customers. If the customer support is not there, the customers will move to an exchange that does things the way they want. Hence, without customer support, exchanges won't even consider supporting UASF.

Neither of those methods result in sensible numbers of real support levels. Miners are a small minority in terms of who comprise the economic majority and node counts aren't any better than a random internet poll that allows one vote per ip.


The relay nodes are ultimately meaningless. They can at most cause a temporary disruption, after which solutions for bypassing them will gain in popularity. Yes, such solutions already exist, they're just relatively unknown due to lack of proof that they're needed.
The bigger danger are the miners themselves. They currently can't engage in economic censorship since it's difficult to tell which transactions to censor. If this were to change, that might become a problem.


They're doing incremental work on a system that's already in production use. Therefore, the criteria for whether to adopt an improvement is not whether the improvement can be proven to be secure but rather whether it can be expected to be better than the implementation before it.
The original implementation from Satoshi was basically proven insecure. So, an implementation that isn't obviously insecure is an improvement. You're correct that there are risks involved in making such fixes, but the risks in delaying the fixes until there's a solution that can be proven to be secure would be even greater. 


There's also the question of available resources. The available resources for the development of the Bitcoin system haven't been quite keeping pace with the expansion of the user base. The necessary resources for producing a proven secure system are a few orders of magnitude greater than what has been available for Bitcoin development so far.
Aside from "fee market", which was a design element from very beginning, every single thing you listed was developed in response to expressed user needs. They certainly aren't perfect. However, with the resources available, the only choices available were unproven solution or no solution. The analyzed and proven solution you're asking for is a pipe dream. At least for now.


Strictly speaking, you're correct about the incentives for individual relay nodes. But you're completely ignoring that there actually exists a large group of people with a strong incentive to make sure the system, as a whole, works reliably. Yes, the individual holders as well as the services that use the system. The more you hold, the more interested you'll be that the system actually works.
If dishonest relay nodes actually become a problem that threatens the value of the system, there'll be no shortage of people, with resources, wanting to help fix it. This is what people mean when they use the term anti-fragile.


At the same time they'd also lose pretty much any relevance they had. This is a meaningless argument. They could do it, certainly, but only once. However, it would be an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. It's telling that your examples are this far removed from the practical reality.


There's a huge difference between trusting that someone will send a message for you and actually trusting them to hold and transfer something valuable for you.
It's like you're completely unable to grasp the concept that every small thing that requires less trust is less friction and therefore makes the society work smoother.


Are you being anal-retentive about the meaning of the word guarantee? It sounds to me like you're trying to demand much better guarantees for the system than required for practical purposes.
There are ways to get even 0-fee transactions confirmed. CPFP is one option and paying a miner directly is another, should the CPFP method fail for some reason (it works very well, I've used it enough to say that).


The blockchain and LN aren't as separate as you make them out to be. Any blockchain transaction can be an opening transaction to a payment channel. Also, if the first paycheck transaction opens a channel between the company and alice and alice spends the paycheck by routing the payments through that channel, then the next paycheck can be paid through that very channel by merely rewriting the transaction so alice has more balance again.
LN only needs to be limited to small amounts when you're dealing with parties you can't trust.


It's remotely possible the average transaction fees might peak to $2-3 for a small while in the near future. But that won't be a permanent state because it'd accelerate the adoption of technologies to optimize the use of transactions, which will again drop the fees to sensible levels and enable another period of growth. Moonbeam is one example of such a technology.


I'm starting to wonder if we're actually living on the same planet. Of the things you list, customer assistance is the only one of those that _some banks_ might do a better job of than Bitcoin. (Yes, I'm talking about actual performance, not theoretical.)

Sorry for the late reply, I didn't have time to look at reddit for a few days.
Usually, when a channel is closed, it's closed in cooperation with both parties. In that case closing happens with a single transaction and both sign it. I mention this to prevent a misunderstanding many people get if I don't say this.
Then there's the rare situation when you want to close the channel and the other party is not available or is uncooperative. That's when you'll use the channel contract, which is normally a chain of 2 transactions. This is what exchange B would have to use to close  the channel without your cooperation.
The crucial point is that the second transaction in the chain is timelocked. It's not valid before a timeout period has passed from the first transaction getting confirmed. That's the transaction that would give exchange B the 1 BTC. The exchange has this transaction with signature from customer A. In addition, it also needs signature from Exchange B to be valid after the timelock has passed.
When exchange B wants to prove to customer A that they don't intend to use that transaction, all they need to do is to send the private key needed for that transaction to customer A. Customer A is then in possession of both private keys needed to spend the output and can craft a transaction to spend it without a timelock.
In other words, if exchange B broadcasts the first transaction of the chain, customer A can then broadcast an immediate transaction that grabs coins while the exchange's version of the next transaction is timelocked.

When the requirement for the reviewer is to conclude with nearly absolute certainty that a) it doesn't change anything in the consensus and b) doesn't have any bugs that affect consensus. Yes, that is the case, in practice.
Theoretically speaking, sure it can be reviewed. However, the time it'd take to review it in sufficient detail is astronomical. For this reason, most reviewers just won't bother and give out the default "unacceptable" result for it.

Right... well, you're welcome to invent a better design... in fact anyone can. If there's a better design, it doesn't take a fork to make use of it. Individual nodes can just upgrade whenever they want.
The current system may not provide rigorous guarantees that it'll work, but in practice *it does work*. If you're trying to say it's only because no-one has yet yanked the power cord out the wall... well, you're welcome to yank it. I doubt you can though.
But I do have a nitpick with your statement. The system does not depend on trusting that individual volunteers will act honestly. It only depends on trusting that enough (a minority is enough) of those volunteers will act honestly. Also, the devs do understand the problem. Otherwise, why would there be so much complexity in the networking code for the sole purpose of making sybil attacks harder? For instance, the node won't automatically connect to multiple IP addresses from the same subnet.


There's nothing that forces anyone to use the non-mining relays. Anyone can connect directly with miners if they so choose. The non-mining relay network is part of the current implementation, but it's not an essential part of it. It's the easiest part of the protocol to just replace entirely.
If it turns out that the volunteer network really isn't trustworthy enough, non volunteer services will quickly pop up and the problem will soon be history. Users can then each decide for themselves whether the non volunteer service is worth the set price.
You also appear to fail to realize that third-party BH's aren't the primary security measure but merely a fail-safe system that can be used to make things more reliable if none of your own systems are reliable. If you have a reliable system somewhere, you can run your own BH on it. If not, you need to borrow someone else's BH.
The BH's might start out as basically volunteers, but like the relay network, they're easily replaced with non volunteer services if necessary. Likewise, each user will decide for themselves if they actually need it.
That being said, the people building LN have made it quite clear that they don't think it makes sense to use for large payments, so there's that. However, Bitcoin works pretty well for large payments already, so the only niche LN really needs to fill is small payments.

I mean, if they were really evil, they'd have made it possible to change the pool address through the remote control mechanism and the mechanism itself would've been hidden much better.
Then again, there's no proof that such a mechanism doesn't also exist and this thing is just there to fool people into thinking they dealt with the danger.
So, TL;DR, this one doesn't really mean much either way... well, other than that at least one of their coders is dangerously sloppy with security.

I don't think the average user needs to actively care about it. The plan is  to incentivize third parties to do this monitoring by making the penalty txs pay those third parties a little reward in case it's needed. Hence, you can automate this through a p2p network.
If the channel balance is fully (100%) owned by the user when the penalty has to be broadcast, this approach might end up losing the user some money. However, I suspect the risk can be eliminated in practice by simply making the wallet refuse to receive more than channel balance - penalty reward through the channel.
Wallets could allow advanced users to organize this kind of thing by themselves, but the default settings can be fully automated.

I expect the freemium model would be reasonably popular. So, light users can just provide the punishment transactions with a reward while heavier users (as in more punishment transactions to keep track of) would have to pay a very small fee for each uploaded transaction.


The automatic timeout closure transactions are something I read about for the first time today. It seems they're only needed if LN is implemented without a malleability fix. The Segwit version uses Bounty Hunters while the non-Segwit version would accomplish the same thing with Closure Attorney.
Without Segwit, the channels will be absolute timeout based and the bidirectionality is achieved by making the newer closure transactions valid earlier. Miners would be natural candidates for CAs as they'd want the fees associated with the closure transaction when it closes.
The Segwit version has relative timeouts and indefinitely open channels and thus would use the Bounty Hunter model.


Reputation system and using multiple services at the same time would work pretty well.


Yes, you're correct that _in the general case_ such a number is very difficult to come up with. However, for individual channels, you can calculate the odds of failure from their setup as well as who is the counterparty.
Basically the key requirements for a worst case scenario with a channel are an unscrupulous counterparty, bad internet outage for your wallet and an unreliable or nonexistent CA/BH. If any one of these aspects is not handled badly, things will work.




That risk is not unquantifiable. Nor is it unmanageable. There are only two kinds of people who are having problems. One is those using obsolete wallets and the other is people trying to dance on the knife's edge and pay as little as possible. It's not a good idea to do the latter with LN closure transactions. The former is dealt with by the fact that no LN supporting wallets will have obsolete fee policies.
As for your "practical" example, the odds of such an event are so non-existent that I almost completely forgot you presented such an example. Are you actually trying to be taken seriously? If you actually care about your transactions confirming in reasonable times, it's not difficult to achieve.

If miners want to go bankrupt, they're welcome to do that. All their income currently comes through the economically important nodes. If they choose to ignore them, they just won't be paid anymore.
Well, if you could get a supermajority (90%+) of miners to do that for an extended period of time, it might have some chance of success. But unlike strikes in regular companies, mining is an open market. Enough new miners might still pop up and turn the tables.
To top it off, if UASF is seriously attempted *and* miners choose to resist in huge numbers, Bitcoin's price is going to take a serious nosedive. Most miners won't be willing to risk being left with piles of useless paperweights (the mining hardware) just to stop segwit.
If UASF succeeds, though, I'm expecting a huge rally as a result.

I think a very significant piece of this issue is that people are completely misunderstanding the nature of the group called Bitcoin Core. This is especially obvious from the fact that many, including Jiang Zhuoer, keep trying to demand promises from Core in exchange for supporting Segwit.
To have someone capable of making the kind of promises they ask for would mean that the group had a leader capable of coercing the group into fulfilling those promises. This is obviously impossible, but I don't remember seeing anyone pointing it out before.
The group called Bitcoin Core is way too decentralized for something like that to be possible.

Bitcoin only has explicit transaction acceptance. Rejection can only be guessed at from the lack of acceptance.

Not every country has prohibitively expensive license systems.

The trustlessness of LN makes it unnecessary to know who it is who is routing your payments.

I do understand the preference to approach things conservatively, but when it goes so far as to entirely ignore the enormous potential in the technology... just mad.




If LN ends up being the primary method of payment, that actually opens up possibilities for scaling on chain capacity that don't require block size increase hard forks. Additional two-way pegged side chains will be enough to scale the system because as long as there's no exchange rate risk between the chains, LN routing doesn't need to care which chain the channels are actually on.
In such a case, even the proposed extension block would be entirely sufficient to scale the system.
So, sidechains or extension blocks can be used to scale bitcoin once we've got a working LN network. Both of these are essentially soft forks, but of such a nature that even resistance from a majority of miners couldn't delay them from being deployed if the market really wanted them.

It makes no sense to focus on the development team as not being trusted by miners. In such a case it would be a decision by the whole community.
There are situations where "honest" miners are screwed anyway. It's kind of like nukes. It's much preferable that they're never used, but the potential that they might be used will in itself make people act with more restraint.

You do get instant confirmations and microtransactions even if you just use routing services that others provide. I expect there'll be political pressure in the U.S. to reform the regulation as we get closer to actually being able to use LN. More if it starts to get popular elsewhere.


This issue is far from clear cut. So far every company has just folded. No-one has actually tested what the U.S. will do if foreign companies blatantly break the rules.
Besides, there's no way to effectively refuse all U.S. users if you aren't doing full KYC procedures. Somehow it doesn't sound credible that the U.S. would go after civilians in other countries for routing payments for U.S. citizens in LN.
But I do agree that the regulation problem can be a big issue, though. Still, currently it's the only option that I know of that can scale Bitcoin enough.


I guess you haven't paid attention to how much some people are willing to pay for anonymity.


Ah, you think of channels as uni-directional. They're bi-directional. Any funds sent to the exchange through a channel will become exchange's coins but will stay in the channel and can be used for transfers back to the customer. The only situation that a channel is uni-directional is when one party owns all the coins in it.
Let's take an example. Let's say person A makes a 1 BTC channel with exchange B and exchange C. The channel with exchange B is left with all coins owned by person A. However, with channel to exchange C, he immediately sends all the coins to either the exchange or routes them to another customer through the exchange. This leaves the channel open with the coins owned by exchange C.
In this situation, person A is able to route up to 1 BTC payment from exchange C to exchange B. Now, let's assume he actually routes 0.4 BTC payment from exchange C to exchange B. This leaves him able to route 0.6 BTC from C to B and 0.4 BTC from B to C.
this of course, stops if either exchange decides they want to close the channel to send the coins elsewhere. However, this is likely to happen only if they see more value in moving the coins to some other channel.

Every single claim in that text is either a distortion of the truth or flat out misinformation.


According to what we know today, yes. However, we keep figuring out new ways to scale without increasing block size. Segwit also removes the barriers for more complex smart contracts, most of which are severely hampered by malleability. Who knows what kind of scaling solutions will eventually emerge from those. LN could well merely be the tip of the iceberg.


What do you mean protocol? People using LN will naturally have a scaling effect. What more protocol do you need?
Anyway, there's a project called Moonbeam out there that works without Segwit and somewhat resembles LN in how it works. It's however only semi-decentralized as it lacks the routing aspect of LN. It's basically only useful for optimizing away transactions between bigger wallet providers and merchants.
It's every bit as centralizing as the crowd has been blaming LN for being, but without Segwit, that's the only way to scale. Still, lacking Segwit, it's probably the best way to scale.

The second transaction in the chain, the timelocked one is the one that transfers the coins to the real destination address. So the channel can still be closed at will by either party alone, as long as they use the most recent channel state transaction.

It's actually more for shielding nodes while they're in the initial download. Without checkpoints, If someone managed to perform a sybil attack on a node that's in the initial download, they could easily feed that node a low difficulty forked chain with whatever transactions they want.

Technically speaking, the majority of miners can force the remaining minority of miners to validate whatever soft-fork change they want.
However, economically speaking, that only matters if users actually choose to use it.
Also, if the majority of users want to reject the change, any soft fork can be practically disabled with a UASF making any use of the new features invalid. However, if there are enough people who want the new features desperately enough, this is likely to cause the network to split into two separate networks.

You can read the technical details from the lightning network whitepaper draft. It's only a couple of pages to get the detailed answer to this question. 
I'll try to offer a simplified answer though.
Your understanding is correct that a bi-directional channel requires funding a multisig address with one key for both participants. So, it can't be opened without active interaction from both wallets. However, there's no requirement that both parties put Bitcoins in it. The channel will be effectively unidirectional as long as one party owns all the coins in it and becomes bidirectional once a part of the coins are moved in that direction. If all coins are moved, the channel is still unidirectional, but the direction is reversed.
There's an algorithm called HTLC (Hash TimeLocked Transaction) in the lightning network paper. This is the machinery that allows multiple channels to route transactions trustlessly. It's what prevents fraud. The basic principle is to structure the transfer such that there's no moment during which a channel closing would lose anyone any money.
You might also wonder what keeps someone from broadcasting an old version of the transaction used to close the channel. Simply the fact that if they do so, they stand to lose everything in the channel to the other participant. I was a bit alarmed when I first read about this, but it makes sense. You can always broadcast the newest closing transaction without this risk.
By the way, any N of N multisig transaction can be transformed into a channel between the participants. Without any new transactions hitting the blockchain. Channels with more than 2 participants come with some additional complexity, though. This is because every participant needs to have their wallet online for the channel to be functional at all.

Might you happen to have a link to data to back this claim?
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:19:06


I'm rather puzzled as to what's the point of this juggling here. It's a channel with $X owned by Bob and $Y owned by Alice. The settlement transaction will require enough fee that it confirms. As long as the total funds in channel ($X+$Y) is more than fee, it make sense for the participants to split the fee according to their shares of the total funds. So if the transaction fee required was $3, Bob had $10 and Alice had $5 in the channel, then it'd make sense for them to set aside $3 for the fee, $8 for Bob's output and $4 for Alice's output.


In this case it wouldn't exactly be a new payment but a transaction fee. There's also the option that the fee will be paid entirely by the party who closes the channel, so if that is the agreed on policy, then the one who is in more of a hurry to close the channel will end up paying the fee.


First of all, routing nodes can freely set their fees to whatever they want. So, Hank could do that with a single extra node.
All the descriptions of the user interface that I've seen display the total fee for the entire route when asking the user for confirmation. So, the user will notice if it's especially expensive and will likely complain to Hank that his routes are expensive.

I make no judgements on what is or is not valuable. Those using the system will do that.
My point is that block size limit won't limit the price of Bitcoin according to the equation you provided and that the reason is that most transactions don't have the same effect on the system's total value.
In other words, your estimates are at least an order of magnitude too small. This is what I mean with the storm being exaggerated. There's still time to work out a properly engineered solution. Plenty enough to see if LN can be that and then apply hard fork to increase blocksize if it proves to be lacking.

While Reject AnyoneCanSpend would work for the purpose, it'd be way too broad.
The UASF would ideally do the bare minimum needed to effectively disable the coupling with regular bitcoin. That could mean it makes the 2-way-peg transactions, that are used to transfer bitcoins to and from the extension chain, invalid.
Another possibility would be to simply detect presence of the extension block and reject the block as a valid bitcoin block if it's present.
Whether either of these actually makes sense, though, is another question. If miners are stubborn, it could potentially end with a game of whack a mole, which destroys any further soft forkability of the system.
Economical rejection, such as simply refusing to use the extension chain are much more likely to work. Also, the UASF could potentially be used to not entirely reject the extension chain but rather impose additional limits on it's use that transform it into an acceptable upgrade.
This is far from a black and white issue and there are likely to be creative options available that didn't occur to me while I was writing this reply.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:30:59
Temporary congestion can be lived with if the result is a capacity upgrade, such as Segwit. Orphaning only happens if there's a valid chain of blocks that's longer. No UASF node will accept the invalid one no matter how long it gets.
The drawback is that if less than 50% of miners choose to cooperate, non UASF nodes might end up facing double spend attacks that make use of the longer invalid chain to convince them.


The average user has a very small amount of say here. The ones with real influence are those who do a lot of business transactions with bitcoin. They also have a lot skin in the game.

Only channel opens and closes involve on-chain fees. When there are fees involved in LN payments, those fees go to the routing nodes, not to miners.
When the fee levels required for confirmation change on the Bitcoin network, the transactions that need updating are the channel settlement transactions, not the individual payments done through LN. The LN payments are done through manipulating the channel balances by recreating the channel's settlement transaction (and invalidating the previous one).
So the transaction you'd be recreating with the updated fee is the channel settlement transaction. Both parties will want to be able to close the channel if necessary, so I wouldn't expect non-cooperation to become an issue here. Especially if the agreed on settlement fee policy is to pay it proportional to your balance on the channel. That is, if you have 80% of the funds, your share of the fee is also 80%.
Also, since we're talking about the technical details, Alice and Bob don't really refer to the users themselves, but rather to their wallets. The wallet users wouldn't be making these decisions, themselves. They'd just configure their wallets and leave the rest to automation.

Open Source projects certainly can be insecure bug riddled pieces of dung. It seems, however, that you're completely oblivious as to how to tell apart which project is like that and which isn't.
The answer is that it depends on how many people care about the project enough to fix it. Some projects are unimportant enough that no-one care enough to fix even the easily found &amp; fixed problems.
With a project like Bitcoin, any flaw is potentially worth millions of dollars to an exploiter. It's been like that for years now. Do you seriously expect we haven't at least had a swarm of black hats go through the code very carefully?
I should also point out that while there are a lot of bitcoins stolen every day, that's not due to the bitcoin core protocol but rather user security. There's been no succesful abuse of a critical protocol flaw. (There was an attempt in the early days, but it ended up unsuccessful)

2MB blocksize estimate comes from SegWit, which is not a hard fork, but a soft fork. That around doubles the transactions per day for multisig txs, which is what the channels are. The malleability fix from SegWit is necessary for channels to be secure to open, so I see no point in calculating with 1MB.
About liquidity, lots of people have liquidity. Anyone with savings has liquidity. Only one participant in every channel needs to have enough liquidity for the channel to be stable. Your assumptions will likely be true at the start, but over time the need for new channels will drop because most people without liquidity will have found others that actually have the liquidity to keep channels open.
Anyway, if this didn't convince you, we most likely will have to agree to disagree. I somehow get the feeling you'd prefer not to discuss the liquidity topic.
Edit: Also, if transaction fees rise, channels will start to become longer lived. Your assumption about the channel open/close rates is probably correct in the beginning.

Someone with 20kBTC is sending small amounts of bitcoins to a lot of others. Nothing especially interesting. The total looks big because it counts the same coins multiple times. In this case, around 180 times. The real amount of bitcoins that were sent in the block in question is around 5000BTC.
When you send bitcoins, you have to spend one whole send all at once. In this case, the 20k had been sent to the address in one lump. when you send coins from such a lump, the bitcoin software uses the lump for input, the address you're transferring to gets what you're sending and _all the rest_ goes to an address called a change address.
A change address is just a regular address from the wallet that gets selected to hold the change.

In technical terms, you're correct. But you can't reason about the UASF process if you merely think about the technical side of things.
Bitcoin is a network on which economic activity happens. Any node that is not used for participating in that activity is meaningless as far as UASF is concerned. (Any node used to validate the blockchain to either receive or send transactions is meaningful though)
In other words, economic activity is the deciding factor for whether or not UASF succeeds. Of course, if the market disagrees with the node decisions on which fork to use, the activity itself might move to nodes that made the choice that market wants. For this reason, economic nodes will be motivated to find out which choice the market wants in advance.
PS. BIP148 is not the topic of this post. The argumentation is about flag day activation style UASF of segwit, so signaling is meaningless for the purposes of this post.

The closing transaction and the delays associated with it only come into play if the counterparty in the channel refuses to cooperate or isn't reachable. It's the backup plan. In the normal situation, the counterparty will cooperate and will sign a transaction to close the channel that includes an output to the address you wanted to send the coins to. That very same transaction can then have another output that creates a new channel between the two of you, if desired. To an outside observer, that'd look identical to a transaction that sends coins from a multisig wallet and returns the change to a new multisig address.


There are solutions, you just refuse to call them solutions. Even if they were to turn out too unreliable to trust, the worst case is that you need to avoid forming channels with people you can't sue if they cheat. It'll still be more efficient and more trustless than the legacy systems we have.


I suppose you're not aware of hardware wallets? For example ledger 
While it's a third party to trust, using one of these will minimize the amount of third parties you need to trust compared to a regular computer. These are basically hacker immune. Yes, even if it's connected to the computer while a hacker invades.


This is an example of the incentive in action I mentioned earlier. Bitcoin holders have the incentive to proactively do things that help avoid Titanic style disasters. On the surface it might look like goodwill, but the real motivation likely was the desire to prevent the exchange rate drop that a Titanic level disaster would lead to. It's also rather likely that he wasn't the only one monitoring for things like this. This is the kind of thing you will monitor for only if you think it's likely it'll happen.


Yes, thankfully Mt.Gox is no longer presenting a risk and there are plenty of exchanges available these days that are actually regulated, so people have better options available to them. However, it's worth pointing out that only those users that want to combine Bitcoin with the legacy system will bear this risk. It doesn't exist for users who avoid the legacy system entirely.

Finland, for example, doesn't require a license unless you yourself are issuing digital money and the volumes you process are under certain limits. The limit for a private person is 50000€ per month (averaged over the past 12 months) and for a company that is 3 million € per month.

He's also mistaken about Core Developers pushing a contentious change. Segwit was developed because there was practically no opposition to it. If the opposition had materialized during the development, the whole project would have been scrapped and never released.
The only reason we're in a situation where Segwit is being viewed as contentious is that some people were silent until release and *then* started through contention around.

The pressure is a combination of two things. One is because a real split of the community is an undesirable result to pretty much anyone involved. An actual split of any meaningful size will mean financial loss to everyone involved with Bitcoin.
Some people also think that capacity limits will lead to price crash when they start being reached badly enough. So, the only way they see to avoid price crash is to increase capacity, so they push for that. Very straightforward.
I'm not worried about that myself, though. I think Bitcoin is strong enough to recover from such a crash, if it ever happens. If it doesn't, market pressure will eventually force a consensus about block size raise due to fees, if it actually ends up being necessary. Due to LN, we might not need to increase the maximum size for a few years.
If it does happen, then we have empirical evidence that that's how the market will react and a fix will likely be implemented with very little controversy and a lot of "I told you so" from many people.
Some degree of split will most likely happen, though. Or rather, has already began. The people who've lost trust in Bitcoin as a result of this controversy will either exit cryptocurrencies entirely or will pick one of the already existing altcoins to support instead.
The degree of this split depends a lot on Bitcoin Core team's communication with the community. How well they manage to communicate that they're actually acting with the best interests of Bitcoin in mind and that they'll continue to do so.
I find that a hard fork without (most of) the core team supporting it is rather unlikely to happen. It's exceedingly difficult to put together another team of engineers that people would trust enough to even have a chance at convincing people to hard fork.
All this being said, I don't have a strong opinion on this. If a consensus forms for increasing the block size limit, then we do it. If not, we don't. However, in my mind there's no urgency, so I won't actively push for it.

n-factor authentication for wallets is being built. The current situation is that the Bitcoin-network has been upgraded with the necessary tools (multisig transactions). What is still missing is an easy to use implementation of that for the various purposes it enables.
The raw tool is basically as follows: You can make a transaction to a special address that requires signatures from multiple wallets to be spent. This allows for N of M (where N &lt;= M &lt;= 20) transactions.
For example, you could make a 2 of 3 address where signature from 2 of the 3 addresses specified is necessary to spend the coins. One from computer wallet, one from cellphone wallet and one from paper wallet.
The thing that's missing is software that makes creating and spending from these addresses easy enough.

The original UASF concept would merely set a date and start enforcing the new rules segwit introduces for transactions at the flag date. It'd just ignore the signaling and just switch it on at the same time for everyone who's running it.
There'd be no rejecting of blocks based on signaling. Also, old node software has no code that'd create blocks that are invalid under the new segwit rules, so to actually get their blocks rejected, miners would need actively attempt to violate the rules.
The reason BIP148 ended up being "reject blocks that don't signal segwit" is that it's trying to activate segwit by forcing the activation through the 95%+ threshold mechanism. This is because very nearly the whole network (except for BU and co) is already running nodes with segwit support.
This way, it's likely to be sufficient if just exchange companies and payment processors run it and thus force miners to support segwit if they want to continue to be paid for their mining.

You've got it backwards. It's you who doesn't understand.


The thing you're missing is right here. You don't see the difference between the current model and what you just described here. You see, if it was just a traditional mirrored database, the miners would decide everything about it. The current system gives them a lot of influence, but the key thing is that they still have to abide by the rules in the protocol.
For instance, they can't create more bitcoins at will. They have to work for them. Spend electricity to generate them.
They also have no power to touch anyone else's bitcoins. The most they can do is prevent others from transacting with their bitcoins. However, even that is difficult since it's hard to tell which transaction belong to whom. Of course, they theoretically could stop processing any transactions, but then they'd also stop making money as that'd make the exchange rate plummet.
I could list more differences, but this is long enough already. With a traditional mirrored database, they'd not have these limitations.
The key thing to note here is that it's not only miners whose opinion of the rules matters. The nodes used for making and receiving as well as verifying economic transactions are the ones that limit what miners can do. The economic nodes are the reason miners are able to make money through the system at all. They're the nodes that give the system value and collectively define it's rules.


The profound ignorance and magical thinking present in this statement leaves me... rather speechless.

No, there's no serial numbers like that. They're stored in packets called 'coins' or 'txouts' in developer speak. each packet can have any number of satoshis in it. the amount is stored as a single 64 bit integer. In addition to this, the packet defines which address has them.
when you make a bitcoin transaction, the wallet grabs a bunch of 'coins' that add up to equal or slightly more than you're transferring, proves for each of them that it owns the address. Then it defines new 'coins'/'txouts' that will have access to those bitcoins after the transaction.

Ripple's design is primarily focused on making money transfer work in such a way that the only person who can cheat you is someone you have decided to trust directly.
loans in ripple also differ in that you'd rarely give anyone a loan the way banks give it. Rather, you would simply increase their credit limit and they would then have more purchasing power, backed by you.
So, basically, it would not be anonymous between people who are in a credit relationship. In Ripple, if you give credit to people you don't know, you're just asking to be taken advantage of.
So, the answer to how you get credit in Ripple is that you need to convince someone who already has credit relationships with others in the Ripple network to grant you credit.

The only constant things about LN since people started talking about it has been that it's based on payment  channels and that those will be used to route payments. I'm not sure how many revisions the design got before anyone even tried to implement it but many of the original limitations were removed by later revisions.
You're conflating LN payments and payment channels. They're not the same. Therefore your question about Alice being obliged to re-send Bob a past payment is entirely nonsensical. No successful payments will ever need to be re-sent for any reason.
As for users being expected to remain connected to the internet 24/7, it depends on the use case. If you want to route payments for others, then it's a requirement. If you just want to make payments through LN, then there's no need for 24/7 connectivity. However, in that case you should either make sure you're never disconnected for longer than the channel close delay period or that you're using a bounty hunter server that actually does it's job. (the channel close delay period is freely selectable, as long as both parties agree on it)
In the latter case, you probably want to ensure the counterparty in the channel is online 24/7 because if they aren't online, you can't make payments. (Although, if you have multiple channels with different parties, you might not need a 24/7 counterparty)

It appears that coinbase isn't pricing the fees deducted from users by the actual transaction cost, but rather what the ideal transaction would cost. In other words, this particular transaction used ~70 inputs, but you were the cost for just one.
This makes sense, because it's not your fault they chose to use ~70 inputs in the transaction.
To explain this in a little more in depth, it's actually not correct to only consider the outgoing part of the transaction when you think about fees. The incoming part makes much more effect for the fees.
For every bitcoin transaction that you receive, you'll eventually need to pay fees for 180 bytes to spend those coins. For each output, you only need to pay for 34-35 bytes.
So, if a wallet service wants to accurately and fairly divide transaction fees among customers, they'd need to charge a fee of 180 bytes for each incoming bitcoin transaction and a fee of 35 bytes for each outgoing transfer.

The bitcoin wallet doesn't actually contain any coins. all it contains are ECDSA private keys and the corresponding public keys. An address is a hash of the public key.
When someone receives coins, it merely means that someone else sent the coins to their address. This gets recorded in the public transaction log called blockchain.
To send the coins onward, you need to create a transaction that records what coins to send and to which address. In addition to this, you need to provide the public key for the address as well as a signature made with the private key.
If the public key hashes to the address and can be used to verify the signature, the transaction is accepted. There's not spoofing possible. You either have the private key or you don't.

Not everyone needs to vote with their feet for it to have an useful effect. What's important is that they can vote with their feet. That alone will constrain what the exchanges choose to do.
With miners deciding things, there's no way to make a real effect to their bottom line. With exchanges, there is. That's all there is to it.
They're both businesses out to make more money. I can choose which exchange my activity supports and I can't choose which miners my activity supports. So I'll naturally prefer a system where I'll be able to shift the balance towards those who I think are doing things correctly.
If you actually wanted to convince me that miners are a better option for having the power, badmouthing exchanges won't cut it. You're not telling my anything I don't already know.
If you really want to make the case for why miners should have this power, you'd need to show why they're trustworthy enough to have that power without any direct way to withdraw support from them.

Hmm... if the system was changed so that you don't submit a voting key to be signed but rather a vote itself, it would open many options for combating this kind of behauviour.
Since the votes are public and unlinkable to a specific identity, it becomes impossible to verify if the person actually voted as you paid them to. You could just grab another vote that went to the party you were paid to vote for and present that as your own to the payer.
The authority could prepare a publicly known number of dummy votes for each candidate to make sure this is always possible. This would be accounted for in the final count by just deducting that number of votes from every participant.

To be exact, Bitcoin network is pseudonymous, not anonymous. All transactions between different pseudonyms (Bitcoin-addresses) are completely public information.
The owners of these pseudonyms, however, are unknown to the network itself. Thus, if you make sure your pseudonyms cannot be linked to you, you're effectively anonymous.

the wallet questions:
1. Yes
2. With the current system for generating a totally random address for each transaction, yes, it would be impractical. However, There's a deterministic wallet system being worked on that will be perfect for just this. You just need to store the seed key and the whole wallet can be regenerated from it, no matter how many addresses have been generated.
It is of course possible to only generate a few addresses and then keep using them. It's just not recommended as this destroys your privacy.
Block generation.
1. It's pretty simple really. The core is a cryptographic hash algorithm. In bitcoin's case sha-256, computed twice. This creates a 256-bit value from any data it's given. it's basically a pseudo-random number. This hashing is repeated for slightly different blocks until you find a block for which the hash value is smaller than a limit value. The difficulty is adjusted by moving this limit value up or down.
2. Every full node stores the entire blockchain. Currently it takes around 2 gigabytes. It's required for mining because you can't check transactions for validity without it.

I've only skimmed the paper so far, but it does look to me that the mathematics are correct. However, it doesn't consider how often an attacker can make an attempt to attack.
If bitcoin and litecoin had an equivalent hash rate and 6 confirmations was the number of confirmations waited for. Each attack would indeed have the same chance of success. However, it seems to me that you could do an average of 4 attacks on litecoin in the same time it took you to make one on bitcoin.
Doesn't this pretty much negate the benefit from increasing the block frequency?
EDIT: ok, found the answer. No it doesn't. Chapter 6 in the PDF examines this. ~~It seems decreasing the average block interval to one block per minute and waiting for 7 confirmations instead of 6 would give a roughly equal security to waiting for 6 blocks with average of 10-minute intervals~~.

The reason GPU is so much faster than a CPU in hashing, is that hashing is only able to effectively use a very minimal part of the CPU. That being said, even a GPU has a lot of circuits which are of no use at all in hashing. When you create a specialized ASIC chip for bitcoin-hashing, you only put in the circuits that are useful for hashing.
In short, it really is a comparable jump in hashing power. a specialized ASIC uses 100% of it's circuits usefully when hashing. For a GPU, 10% is probably close to reality. a CPU would be close to 1%.

In terms of functionality, it's possible for nodes to function and operate entirely without the full history. The unspent transaction outputs are really the only data needed even for mining.
However, completely wiping out all history removes the possibility for auditing that the network history is according to the rules. The importance of this is likely open to debate but if auditing all history is not possible, it potentially opens the door to history rewriting attacks.
That being said, not all nodes need the history. It's planned that Bitcoind and Bitcoin-qt 0.8 will support running in a mode called ultraprune which will allow full validation while just keeping a database of the unspent transaction  outputs and the block headers.

Merely attracting interest isn't enough to damage. They need to start being used and be able to keep the users afterward for any real loss for bitcoin to be realized. That's a rather high bar due to the network effect bitcoin already has.

There are no plans to make it mandatory. I'm not even sure if that'd be possible.

strictly speaking, bitcoins can not be counterfeited, no matter how much you spend on equipment or personnel. However, if you have the resources of a government, you can theoretically disable the bitcoin network with an attack called 51+% attack. At least, as it currently stands.
An attack like this would likely take at least a year, maybe more to prepare for and would cost on the order of tens of millions of dollars for the hardware. Once built, the electricity costs to keep it down would be millions per year.
However, Bitcoin is not the only network of it's kind and it's reasonably simple to setup alternative networks. It'd be a whack a mole game.
This is assuming the technology is not improved so it's better resistant to 51+% attacks. An attack like this would motivate the significant portion of the talented programmers currently involved with Bitcoin to find a solution.
So, if this happened, it'd likely only set the wide use of a Bitcoin-like global cryptocurrency back by a couple of years at most.

Let me fix some of your obvious misconceptions.
1) There's no ironclad rule that makes the difficulty keep going up. If it's profitable enough to mine, it'll go up. If it becomes unprofitable, it'll go down until it's barely profitable to mine.
2) The block reward will cease making a difference much earlier than 2140. By 2040, 99.9% of all bitcoins will have been created. By that time, the network will be supported by transactions fees.
3) If bitcoin gets even 1% of the global market, a penny per transaction as a fee would probably be oversized due to the huge number of transactions.

95% is the activation percentage for a MASF (Miner Activated Soft Fork). for an UASF, the support level is rather difficult to measure in a way that is reliable and simple to interpret.
The current UASF proposal will set a date after which any block not signaling for segwit will just be deemed invalid and rejected. If economically important nodes are enforcing this rule with sufficient consensus, any blocks that don't signal segwit will effectively just vanish. The same as happens to invalid blocks now. It's the same as if they had never existed.
Miners won't be able to sell the coins they get for mining blocks that don't signal segwit anymore. Thus, most of them will switch to signaling for segwit, which will lead to 100% of *valid* blocks signaling for segwit and that will lead to segwit activation.
Whether this will work is dependent on whether economically important nodes can come to a sufficiently wide consensus about doing this. UASF likely won't be attempted at all unless participants are certain that sufficient economic majority will be achieved.

the client from bitcoin.org is the first and, so far, the only client that functions as a full node. The network needs such nodes to function and thus that has been the main focus for most of the development.
There are other clients that have been built that sacrifice being able to fully verify all transactions by themselves for being able to get up and running quickly.
That being said, the client from bitcoin.org is being improved in this respect too. Future versions will be able to run in light mode until they have finished downloading and verifying the blockchain.
The download is not the slow thing. It's verifying that you're receiving the correct blockchain that takes time.

I think what he says makes a lot of sense. I especially liked the examples of alternative currencies he gave in the lecture.
Bitcoin definitely isn't the complete solution on it's own. But if paired with something like Ripple, I think that pair could very well be capable of supporting the economy on their own.
Bitcoin can provide a very stable base for value and easy way to transfer the value. However, achieving the previous goals means it's difficult to organize things so those who could make the best use of Bitcoins will have them. This is where Ripple comes in.
Ripple allows you to use the trust you have with your friends/acquaintances to create tokens of value. Ripple provides the tools to extend this value even to people who don't trust you directly.
Ripple however suffers from the fact that without a significant portion of the population already using it, it's nearly completely useless. This is where it could piggyback on Bitcoin.

1) This can be solved the same it's solved right now. No problem there... well, unless you count the centralization involved a problem. It does mostly work, though. Basically, some central authority sends everyone a letter with their voter id stuff on.
2) Chaum's blinded tokens work perfectly for this. If you require each voter to have a smartphone, you can include a QR-code in the letter that enables the voting software on the phone to authenticate with the central authority. The smartphone software would create an unique and private voting private key, then encrypt it and send it over to the authority for signing along with the QR-code data.
The authority would then sign it and send the signed (but still encrypted, so the authority doesn't know what they signed) version back. The user's software will then decrypt and it has a voter id, signed by the authority, without the authority knowing whose it is.
This allows the authority to make sure no-one votes twice while having no-idea who votes for whom/what. Voters could then use something like Tor to anonymously cast their votes on a public website. Anyone could then download all the votes and do their own tally and verify the signatures.
The encrypted voting tokens could also be required to be published, although I'm not sure if that would serve any useful purpose. It could perhaps be of some use in auditing the authority's actions.

You could use the javascript generator found at 
Here's the steps for perfectly secure generation:
1. Save the website (bitaddress.org) on a usb-stick
2. Completely detach a computer from the internet.
3. Start up some kind of temporary operating system with web-browser, usb-stick support and printing support (I recommend using Ubuntu live-cd)
4. Open the saved website from usb-stick.
5. Generate and print as many paper wallets as you'd like.
6. Shutdown and properly dispose (DoD5220.22-M) of the temporary operating system to make sure it won't leak the private keys in the future. If you used an Ubuntu live-cd system, it's enough to just reboot.
If you're very sure of your system's security, you could skip steps 3 and 6. However, that leaves the potential open for someone who gains access to your computer in the future to recover some or all of the private keys. There will most likely be some files left behind from the printing step.

You'll most likely be interested in this: 
It's a prototype implementation of a balanced merkle tree containing the UTXO set. (Unredeemed Tx Out set). With something like this in the blockchain and enforced by validity rules, light clients would really only need to store the root hash of this tree. The rest of the data could then be stored in untrusted storage as you could always verify it.

If you're a perfectionist who won't settle for anything less than 100%, then sure, it can't be solved. However, if you're willing to live with something like 99.9999%, then a good enough solution exists and is built into LN.

What other meaning would you attribute to outputs other than that they're bitcoins that were paid to someone?
It's a well known fact that many big exchanges batch their bitcoin sends. The basic effect is that instead of X transactions with 2 outputs each, they create 1 transaction with X+1 outputs. In that case that one transaction does the work of the X transactions it replaced.
There's also the occasional OP_RETURN output for storing a small amount of data (usually a hash of something) in the blockchain. Those would probably make sense to ignore for calculating the number of transfer made. However, it's not used enough to really make much of a difference.

There are preliminary plans for a future migration to a system that stores a merkle tree of all unspent transactions in every block. This would allow a very high degree of security even for light nodes.
Even mining would then potentially be possible without actually storing the transaction data locally at all. There's a prototype implementation of this being worked on.

No, the purpose of KYC/AML isn't to regulate dollar transactions. The purpose is to make financial transactions trackable for the authorities.
The difference between an LN node relaying transactions and a regular Bitcoin node relaying transactions is that a regular Bitcoin node relays *information* about a transaction and LN actually relays *bitcoins*, not just information about the transaction.
In technical terms, when a Bitcoin node relays a transaction, it first receives the transaction data, then validates it and then resends the same data unchanged to it's neighbors.
When an LN node relays a transaction, it modifies the private smart contracts it holds with it's channel partners, increasing it's balance on one channel and equivalently decreasing it's balance on another.
That being said, until the channels are closed, no information about the moves are visible to third parties. Even after closing, only the final balances are recorded in the blockchain.

Graftroot is a way to achieve MAST with an even better average efficiency, which doesn't really add capabilities, just makes them more efficient to use and allows the capabilities to be added retroactively to a transaction.

While I do agree with you in principle, The IRS likely can't tell the difference between someone who panic sold and then came to their senses from someone who did it with the intention to wash sell. Edit: That being said, I don't see much point in doing a wash sell in the first place. You'll end up paying the taxes anyway, you're just moving them to some future time.
In my country that wouldn't be a good move, though. The tax authority pretends that losses from selling bitcoins don't exist. They do tax all the profit, though, so it makes daytrading an act of donating all your money (and will potentially leave you owing more in taxes than you ever had) to the taxman.

The power usage problem is, to a large degree, reducable with a soft-fork that reduces the fees miners can collect and simultaneously lowers Bitcoin's inflation rate.

the long term for mining with SHA-256 is inevitably one where mining is only profitable for those with their own power generation to drive the miners.  That likely means mainly renewables and miner hardware spread around the globe in areas where renewables are easy to deploy.

When you combine 5 regular transactions into a single sendmany transaction, you get a sendmany transaction with 6 outputs (5 transfer outputs and 1 change) where as the original 5 transactions had 10 outputs (5 transfer outputs and 5 change)

Yes, it might still not make sense to include it in the same update. However, the actual implementation is much simpler in terms of code changes than MAST would be, so it has much less potential for implementation level bugs. Most of the moving parts this requires already exist or will be added with the schnorr upgrade anyway. To me, it sounds like this can be implemented with a slight variation to the P2SH validation code, to make it validate a signature rather than a script hash.
Also, it seems to me that this doesn't actually rely on any cryptographic assumptions that Bitcoin isn't already relying heavily on anyway. So, it might need surprisingly little testing on that level too.
Of course, if we were just weeks from releasing schnorr signature upgrade, it probably wouldn't make sense to even consider pushing this in with them. However, this looks solid enough to me that since the timescale is likely at least a year, this actually has real chances of making it into the same upgrade.

Internet has a general tendency to view censorship as damage and route around it. This applies to Bitcoin too. For example, there's already Tor-support, which is one way to avoid such blocks. A simple search will find you dozens of alternative ways to avoid such blocks.
Blocking things on the internet is a practical impossiblity when there are people who don't want to be blocked. There's a way around every filter that's still leaves you the ability to communicate.

All I can say is that the number of transactions is a clearly wrong metric for measuring the level of use.
Mostly because I know that
a) transaction batching is used by many exchanges whose transactions comprise a noticeable percentage of blocks when measured in bytes.
b) the transaction batching is used to replace X (where X &gt;= 2) transactions with 1 transaction that, with any practical definition, does the same job as those X transactions would have done.
c) batched transactions are bigger than an individual regular transaction would be (however, significantly (up to 80%) smaller than multiple such transactions would be in total)
d) all the above taken together leads to a situation where transaction count measures are down even though the number of people sending and receiving bitcoins are higher than ever.
Hopefully this might finally address what you were asking. I'm not sure because the question doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Some selectivity in composing a list of things to compare Bitcoin to is necessary. All of the listed things are technological improvements that are radically different from whatever they replace, just like Bitcoin. Different enough that most people just can't see how it could possibly be useful or desirable.
Something like HD DVD is not radically different from what it was meant to replace. Everyone who knew CDs or DVDs would've understood what it was and it's implications in under 5 minutes. HD-DVD would be a nice example to use to argue for why most altcoins, even if they're better, in some ways, than Bitcoin will fail _because_ of Bitcoin's network effects. But it doesn't work for discrediting the list in this post.
So, might you have an example of something that failed that is actually comparable to Bitcoin in how different and radical of a change it represents?

The fact that the increase doesn't make for much of a difference is an argument for waiting until we can make an upgrade with more permanence. I'm not personally interested in talking about where the limit should be. I'm very interested, though, in talking about methods to determine a suitable limit for any given moment and building those into the protocol.
Also, It doesn't take very many fax machines to fill a house with paper when they're in use 24/7.


I used to agree. Until I realized that Bitcoin isn't a strictly technical system. There's two layers of programming involved. One is the technical program that full nodes run and the other is the social program that humans run.
Appearances is the programming language of the human program and in Bitcoin's case it's critical because it sets the rules for how to change the rules in the technical program.
As much as I'd like to just ignore the politics and appearances, doing so risks transforming the system into something very different from what I signed up for.


Unlike some others, I don't see a reason to doubt his motives. I'd probably agree with him on most things. My position on the debate used to be one of passive acceptance, meaning that I'd agree on going forward with a blocksize hard fork, given that 95+% of the community had at least passive acceptance towards it.
The thing that changed my position was reading an article about the importance on being able to run a full node, especially as a miner, anonymously. If that is not possible, countries can start trying to control which transactions miners are allowed to include in blocks through laws.
On the technical level, it'd appear as a 51% attack aimed at only allowing a certain verified subset of transactions through. If they can get 51% or more miners to comply with their law, that's pretty much it. Financial censorship applied to Bitcoin. For instance, they could require registering addresses with certain KYC/AML services before any transactions to those addresses would ever be confirmed.


I find it funny that you start the paragraph with "Apperances don't matter" and then proceed to blast "core political bloc" and present an appearance as the argument.
Let me break it down for you. The NYA agreement was signed, no disagreement there. However, the appearance is in claiming that it was the cause for the signaling increase. Here's another appearance: The miner bloc didn't dare to risk a community split due to the UASF movement. So, they decided to play smoke&amp;mirrors to try to hide the real reason for their decision to signal Segwit and to keep up the appearances of them having more power over the system than the users.
The appearance of miners having power is dangerous because if people believe it, they actually get that power. This is the reason this fork is being resisted so vehemently. If we let this pass, our ability, as users, to say no for future changes that miners decide to push for significantly weaken. this is why even many of those who'd like to see blocksize increase hard fork happen resist the 2x fork.
(This is the change to the human program that I reject)


This line of thinking has a chance of turning my position on the blocksize limit around in the future. However, as of right now, I don't yet have a clear enough picture of all the changes to the whole picture that this would bring to know if it will. However, if it does, I'll make sure to talk about it.

If you have RPC node, you can do this from the command line using bitcoin-cli tool. "bitcoin-cli getnewaddress" and "bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress &lt;address&gt;"
However, there are a couple of caveats which you need to know about if you intend to make use of these.
1) This doesn't work seamlessly with wallet backups. For every Segwit address you've received coins with after the backup, you'll need to call addwitnessaddress again, after restoring a backup, to see the coins in the wallet. (might also need to rescan after adding the addresses)
2) The Segwit addresses created this way don't have bitcoind accounts associated with them, so if that's important for you, better not use this.

Limiting the block reward is a soft-fork. Increasing it would be hard-fork. Miners aren't required to take all the reward there is, so the blocks would be backwards compatible.

Bitcoin would have collapsed ages ago if that was possible. The security on transactions is based on verifiable signatures, not trusted middlemen.


Yes, when there's something you *don't actually need*, most will choose to go without if they don't already know how to go around.


If the censorship was that prevalent, enough technical people would be interested that someone would always package it into an easy package and then everyone could easily do it.








There's a common theme here. Every example you list, there's a third party, that *you already trust* in some way, who can in practise remove your need to trust the specific parties that you listed.

A small part of the market is likely to do as you expect. However, the majority of the market doesn't operate with such a short sighted view. A temporary short term denial of service is not serious enough to warrant a drastic action such as switching chains.

@_date: 2017-09-30 19:09:51


A temporary 30% crash is pretty far from a majority of the market. Considering the speed of the crash, at most a few percent of the market participated in it. Even that might be overestimating it.


Bitcoin miners can't make decisions based on the very short term market situation. Especially if mining power weakens significantly. A miner has to wait at least 101 blocks before they can sell the coins they got from finding a  block. In a normal situation that's 17 hours. In a weakened hashrate situation that can stretch to several days.
In other words, miners will make their mining decisions based on what they expect the exchange rate to be after 101 blocks.
So, if the price crashes, they have to ask themselves "What do I expect the price will be after 101 blocks?" as well as "how will my choice affect the price?" with regards to any bitcoins they can't or didn't sell yet.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:57:18
Remember that the only way to lose 90% hashpower permanently is if 90% of the market also goes with it. The only situation when that is a real problem is when there's a temporary loss of more hashpower than market.
However, if market doesn't move, the miners will be making a loss by mining 2x. The 2x people are betting that they can make the market move by denial of service. When that fails, they'll start returning to mining Bitcoin.

Ok, let's see. It's simpler to reply to a summary, so I made one.

* Pretending that the economic majority is demanding a blocksize increase over what Segwit already provides. Check
* Pretending that Segwit does not increase the blocksize. Check.
* Pretending that transaction fees being high is fatal for Bitcoin. Check
* Pretending that increasing the system's resource requirements don't change the system's fundamental properties. Check
* Calling a certain Core Dev a liar when he's just stating basic facts of how the system works. Check.
* Trying to paint attempts to limit the capacity as a profit motivated action. Check.
I disagree with you on every single one of these. Edit: I think I should add that I sometimes make a point of torturing myself by checking the latest bullshit at These are repeated there often enough and sometimes with links to what supposedly proves them. None of that has been convincing.


I signed up for a system that's capable of moving money around the world **trustlessly** where *I don't have to trust* that the system works as defined. *I can verify it all myself if I want to*. The system is already big enough that this property is no longer universal. In other words, it's not trustless for a significant portion of the earth's population. Even if we count only those with the means to use the system at all. Increasing the blocksize will degrade this property even more.
There is value in keeping this property. Therefore, increasing the blocksize should be the scaling option of very last resort. We already increased it with Segwit. Therefore we don't need another doubling of the blocksize yet.


Miners are not incentivized to accept any and all transactions. Eliminating miners is not possible. The incentivization ensures that. However, convincing them to reject any transactions containing certain coins is possible and can work as the first step towards stricter and stricter control.
That situation would be responded be responded to by hard forking away from the miners. However, what prevents them from subjecting the fork to the same treatment? Oh yes, the possibility for anonymous mining would do the trick. 


The facts are against you in this one. The markets are already telling us that B2X is going to be the minority chain. There are future markets for that in more than one exchange already. No UASF will be needed. The complaints are all focused on the mess the fork is going to cause to the ecosystem. Mostly to services and mostly due to the lack of proper Replay Protection.


I wasn't aware of Twitter being considered a censored forum in this context. Also, based on this claim, I can only surmise that you don't give Bitcoin's trustlessness property much value.

While that sounds possible in theory, LN has been carefully designed to make control very difficult even in the case that some parties attempt to usurp control through financial censorship.
I suspect they can't allow full fledged LN channels if they want to fulfill their KYC requirements. The no routing would mean precisely no routing at all. There's no middle ground.
They might be able to offer the service, while following the letter of the KYC laws, if they only offer LN payments from funds that they hold in custody though. However, in that case the customer can't be said to be using LN, it'd be Coinbase who sends or receives the LN payments and has full custody of the funds.
Even that is somewhat flaky, though, as it'll be possible for payment receivers to arrange for another node to look like it's the recipient, but that node is actually just part of the route and the route then gets extended from that point to the real recipient (or another fake recipient). This probably requires co-operation from the nodes that are used as fake endpoints for the payment though.

Whew, that was a lot of text. A lot of it completely unnecessary, which you'd have noticed, had you been replying to the whole instead of replying to isolated pieces of it. Anyway, I'll just ignore the parts where we never actually had a disagreement about.


And I never claimed you said that. Those paragraphs were there to explain the dynamics of the system with different blocksize rules.
What you did, however, was that you have avoided any and all discussion about what the limit should be or how it should be decided and are advocating increasing the limit.
Tell me, how is an unspecified limit different from no limit?


And yes, they don't bother with the nodes. The cost of running one is low enough that it's obvious the attempt would be futile. Practically anyone can still run a node. Even if it's starting to be somewhat painful for some.


Would you call me unfair if I interpreted this as you saying "The system will survive any attack at any blocksize"? Because that's the impression I get when you say something like this while advocating for a block size increase and don't have a clear position about the limit.
Or is that actually your position? If not, please explain the constraints more clearly.


I suppose you also don't care about achieving a non-splitting capacity upgrade either then because that requires a wide agreement and I'm far from the only one with this position.
Nevertheless, so far, you have not given me a convincing reason to consider it a fact that increasing the blocksize is a safe thing to do. Thus you also don't have my agreement.


That last sentence I kind of agree with. Although, probably in the opposite sense of what you mean with it.


This line of thinking might lead to a proposal that everyone could accept. Might you happen to have a more concrete proposal on how to do this? The crucial questions being who it is that would pay for that and how to distribute the payments to node operators. Transaction fees seem like a sensible source of those funds, but that still leaves open the question of how to determine what's enough and how will the system collect that amount.


You can't quantify something you don't know. That's the whole point for resisting blocksize increases. Since we can't be sure it's safe to increase the blocksize, we default to not doing it. Find a way to either prove it's safe or that not increasing the blocksize will be worse and we'll stop arguing against it.


The justification is "we can't be sure that it's safe to increase the throughput".

There's no such thing. Segwit already increased the limit. You're accusing them of something that they're not doing.

There was no deal. Just a bunch of guys in suits making an "agreement" in some backroom and then acting like it binds everyone. There are even many pro big blocks people who're against the 2x just because of the language in the so called "agreement".
This particular "upgrade" having problems has more to do with the sleazy and dishonest politics and language around it than the actual change it's trying to bring.


I must admit that this masternode system is intriguing. Although, at the same time, depending on how much power these masternodes have over the dash network, it also presents a potential avenue of attack for an attacker that seeks to control.
Given the amount of power these masternodes have, it's rather worryingly easy to become one. Especially for centralized entities with lots of resources available. However, it's difficult to really get a deep understanding of it from merely scratching the surface. The link you provided is a little light on details.

Depends on your definition of ready. LN network for moving real bitcoins already exists and is functional and there are even some mobile wallets available for using it. Equally, the software exists for service providers to receive payments through it.
However, it isn't widely used so far. The initial software likely has some usability issues that will be fixed as it becomes apparent what those are and how they might be fixed.
So, in short, the system exists and is usable, today. However, so far, it's not very useful in practise. What would it take that you'd call it ready? Would you even call Bitcoin itself ready?

a) There was significant resistance to increasing blocksize by hardfork
b) Bitcoin dominance index fell to ~50% as a result of no hard fork.
When we take these two facts together. It should be reasonably obvious that while there were multiple possible roads to take, the end results would've been fairly comparable.
Having a reasonably constrained block size limit is a requirement for users that value corruption resistance (or decentralization) over other concerns. This group will be happy knowing that auditing the blockchain is a cheap enough affair that most hobbyists will be able to do so, should they wish to.
These users do disagree on exactly how much is too much, but they're unlikely to vehemently disagree with each other on this point because they understand each other despite having different safety margin preferences.
These users will be willing to compromise with each other on the exact limit, but they're very unlikely to be swayed by arguments from people who clearly don't share their values. These users believe Bitcoin's value primarily comes from it's anti corruption attribute.
The other group of users are those who value cheap payments that are affordable to most people over other concerns. This group will be happy as long as transaction fees are small enough that hardly anyone would need to think twice about making a payment.
As above, they probably don't quite agree on exactly how much is too much, but they understand each other and are unlikely to vehemently disagree on the exact fee level they seek. This group of users believes Bitcoin's value primarily comes from being cheaper and simpler to use than the legacy payment systems.
So, the conflict is that both groups see the other group's goals as being directly destructive for what they themselves perceive as the primary (or true) source of Bitcoin's value. 
I don't know how large each group is, but I expect the low fees group had, to a large extent, already abandoned Bitcoin, which can be seen as a dive of Bitcoin dominance index after fee levels exploded a few months ago.
My guess is that the few who remained are now those drumming for Bcash, because they were unwilling to let go of the name 'Bitcoin'.
This is the basic fundamental divide in the community. Although, personally I think it's largely illusory because Lightning Network will take care of the too expensive transactions problem without requiring a block size increase for quite some time.
That said, I remain somewhat puzzled by the hostility in the "Bitcoin is low fees" camp towards Lightning Network. I can only theorize that the insistence on keeping a block size limit by the Core team used up their trust and now they just view LN as an elaborate attempt to fool them into giving up the larger blocks that they believe are absolutely essential.
If so, seeing LN actually work and function in practise should help to reunite the communities to some degree.

I fully expect most wallets to just start giving users Segwit addresses by default soon. There's very little reason not to do so. It means cheaper fees for the users and there are no disadvantages to speak of. Aside from slightly more complex logic for recovering such wallets from seed words. However, that's not something the user needs to worry about unless the wallet bungles it up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:42:11
Every Lightning wallet will, by necessity, also be a Bitcoin wallet and capable of sending and receiving regular Bitcoin transactions as well. It can't function as an easy to use lightning wallet without that capability.
There is also no technical reason why you couldn't make a regular Bitcoin transaction from a payment channel. So I expect Lightning Wallets will eventually be able to to do that. (Technically speaking, this means closing the channel, sending bitcoins with one output and opening a new channel with the change output)
However, this feature doesn't appear to be part of the initial protocol. I'm not sure if that's because it can be done with a combination of the elementary operations and I just missed how or if it's been left out of the protocol definition for some reason.
Anyway, It's not quite as bleak as you've been thinking.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:28:55
You're thinking through individual unidirectional payment channels. They're actually bidirectional. You can reload the channel after you've spent it all by convincing your direct partner in the channel to move the funds back rather than convert them into a bitcoin transaction on-chain. They should be more than happy to, if you pay them the full amount, as they will then save the bitcoin network fee that they'd have otherwise had to spend to move them on-chain. It also likely gives them another full channel worth of collecting routing fees from you.
Of course, the money could also be coming from someone else who is paying you. Yes, whenever someone else pays you through LN, that will reload the channel balance you have. This is basically why you're vastly overestimating the balance you'll need to have "locked" into the channel.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:09:12
What you've shown, very effectively, is that LN will, in practice, make on-chain tracking as difficult as tracking LN transactions will be. Currently you can gain a lot of information by analysing the transaction graph on the blockchain. However, the more LN gets used, the less useful that information will be.
So, the interesting question here is not whether exchanges can use LN. It's whether exchanges can continue fulfilling their KYC requirements even with normal Bitcoin transactions after LN starts getting popular.

While I can't give you an estimate, I will make a guess that you'll see the adoption speed go up significantly once Bitcoin core 0.15.1 is released with a fully Segwit supporting wallet implementation.

Don't think I won't notice you trying to subtly subvert what I'm saying.
You just made it look like I said everyone should run a full node. You even made it look like I implied that this is the case today. Neither of those is true. There are only around 100000 full nodes on the network and we have millions of users. We already have radically less full nodes than users. This situation is very much already such that only a vanishingly small fraction of users run a full node.
The total cost of operating a node is only half the equation. The other side is the number of nodes. **Both** of those increase with the number of users if we keep increasing the blocksize.
Economics dictate that the total cost of a system has to be less than the total benefit the system provides for the cost to make sense. That means that we can't keep increasing both of those factors. One of them will end up being limited by the other. Markets will make sure the total cost stays below the total benefit.
Without a blocksize limit, we will collectively end up limiting the number of nodes. The number of nodes will shrink as the cost of running a node increases. 
With a blocksize limit we can maintain the current number, perhaps even increase the number of full nodes that the economy can sustain. 
Increasing the blocksize limit every time we're hitting it is, in economic terms, the same as not having a limit. This will lead to increasing centralization of full nodes, which are the control structure of the network that enforces the rules.
The trustless nature of the system depends on the full nodes being sufficiently decentralized. Hence, I much prefer having a limit over not having a limit. I'll also admit to not being entirely sure how big of a limit we can afford to have.
Anyway. While I will not say that everyone should run a full node, I'll say that it's exceedingly important that everyone could, if they wanted to. That way, once the system comes under attack from powerful centralized parties (and trust me, that will happen) they will see that it's futile to try to attack those running the nodes and will thus have to make do with less effective strategies.
If we keep increasing the blocksize, we will, at some point make it so expensive to run the nodes that the most cost effective attack on the network is to seize control of the nodes.
If you want to increase the block size and get my agreement for doing so. You better have a damn good case that doing so will be safe according to the criteria I just explained.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:46:07
However, that's only part of the puzzle. What I described will succeed in separating the coins for different chains, but you also need to be careful with the wallet you use if you want to access the coins on the other chain too.
After you've sent the coins, the wallet will think they're spent and won't easily agree to make another transaction with the same inputs. If you made a backup of the wallet file before you received the coins that were limited to just one chain, you could perhaps load that and then create a transaction before it syncs.
If your wallet doesn't support it, it's going to be tricky to get the coins separated into different wallets.

At this point, it's probably not possible anymore to entirely cancel the 2x hard fork plan. It's mostly just a question of how many remain who are committed to trying to push it through. The smaller it is, the less damage it'll do.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:18:36
Replay protection would make sure that a transaction can only happen on one chain. Since s2x comes without a built-in replay protection, any transaction intended to happen on only one chain is very likely to also happen on the other.
A well implemented replay protection would ensure that under no circumstances would a transaction be compatible with both chains.
However, even without a proper replay protection, users who want to replay protect their own transactions can do it. Provided they're willing and able to jump through some extra hoops.
Of course, not everyone will have the chance to do so. Either because they just didn't know about the fork or some technical/social obstacles prevent them from doing so.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:06:49
There are a few jokers in the mix though.
For instance transaction fees. Users can directly shift the mining balance by the fees they include in their transactions. The lack of replay protection creates some temporary roadblocks in being able to target the transactions to a specific chain, but anyone who really wants to do it, will be able to. This will end up giving a bonus to the chain people most want to use.
Also, traders will ultimately come to the understanding that whether their chain of choice technically works at the moment is, for the most part, irrelevant for their decision on whether or not to buy, hold or sell. That is unless they're trading with the very short term in mind.
The thing that's relevant is ultimately a question of values. As in, what values does the chain of your choice collectively embrace and are those values the ones that most people would want to embrace themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:00:02
You can't really analyze this on a strictly technical level. The human social interaction around the technology is an integral part of the system and this includes the potential for humans to make technical changes to the system.
They key thing to note here is that miners are inherently replaceable. Even if all current miners were to collude and we were left with no miners at all, people from outside the colluding miner group can start becoming miners. It's a free competition zone, after all. If the current miners are on strike (as in refusing to create valid blocks) and there's money there to be taken, new miners are likely to appear, ready to cash in.
Also, then there's the case of miner majority doing a fork and at the same time doing a 51% attack with all blocks empty on the chain left with the minority (or no miners). While the rest of the community is against the fork. This looks like a clear victory for miners until you remember that a) it's possible to create new miners and b) Technical changes to the system are possible. There's nothing that unites people like having a common enemy.
Basically, miners doing this would be gambling. Either they come out of it with their immediate earnings noticeably reduced or they find themselves replaced completely with a new set of miners with new hardware. Potentially hardware that's much more generally available and less difficult for specialized manufacturers to monopolize.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:06:46


And that's exactly what increasing the blocksize too much would do in practical terms.
It wouldn't do it immediately, but it would do it. The general observation that all available space that can be used, will be used is also true for Blockchains. If transactions become cheaper, we'll again start seeing people storing files in the blockchain. The cheaper it is to make the transactions, the bigger the files they'll try to stick in there.
This is bad because miners don't have the incentive to limit the blocksize to levels that'd make sense for everyone. Miners get all the profits but they only pay a fraction of the costs. Miners will have no problem running their nodes in a datacenter and paying premium for it. They make enough to do so.


I think this is the crux of the issue. You're measuring the bandwidth for transmitting a single copy of the transaction stream. The reality is that we transmit it close to 100000 times that currently, given that we have that many full nodes running around the world.
So, no, we're not actually using the bandwidth of four or eight fax machines. We're using the bandwidth of 400000 fax machines vs 800000 fax machines. (a side note, I have no idea how you calculated that 4 or 8 fax machines and am not interested in verifying that it's correct, so I'll just assume it is, it doesn't really matter for the argument)
Also crucial to understand is that as the network grows, the multiplier, that's currently 100000, will also grow roughly linearly compared to the size of the network. So the actual requirements of the system will keep growing as we get more users despite the blocksize not increasing at all.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:51:51


A fork with the intention to split cannot be stopped by anyone. That's one of the fundamental properties of the architecture. This farce no longer has anything to do with what the core devs are actually doing. Your ilk won't be satisfied until you think you've either ousted the core devs out of the imagined position of power you have created for them or you feel like you've forced them to submit to your whims.
It's been clear for quite a while that you and your ilk don't really care about the blocksize or transaction fees. That's been obvious since you started resisting Segwit with bogus arguments. I fully expect to see you continue to complain about core no matter what. Yes, even if they prepare a hard fork for blocksize increase and release that as Bitcoin Core. You'll find a way to turn that against them.
In short, the fork is not possible to stop. Nothing can stop it. There's no way everyone is going make the same choice anymore. The only question left is how minor the minority fork will be.


The existence of segwit2x only proves that there were a group of CEOs who decided to sign a piece of paper. These CEOs *do not own* the global economic activity that flows through their companies.


That's only valid from a shorm term perspective. The negative externality from increasing blocksize is huge from long term perspective.


Bitfinex is not the only exchange offering a future market for this. Every one of the markets available has settled on around the same price.


This is what the low volume indicates. But of course, it's not saying what you want to hear, so you'll pretend it doesn't matter.


Right... Degrading the system's trustlessness property is not a significant change. Sure.
I'll grant that the immediate practical effects of that are positive. But the long term negative effect is bigger.


That business plan is in no way dependent on Bitcoin having a capacity limit. Capacity is far from the only thing that side chains could help with. For example, many enterprises want private blockchains. A public one would just simply not be an option due to the regulatory climate. They'll be called side chains when they're implemented so that they're timestamped through Bitcoin transactions.

In other words. Both systems have their strong points and the current election methodology is designed around what works with paper. A digital system will most likely have to compromise on something the paper system does very well. However, it'll also gain some things that are just simply impossible with just paper.
Also, your idea of digital is severely narrow. Why limit equipment, admins, maintainers etc to just a single organization? Much better to use hardware designed for general use with open software so anyone can check it does what's claimed. Even better if the same is done with the hardware, but the current situation unfortunately is that there is no truly open hardware.

You know, the satellite streaming service as a motive makes sense. But it doesn't work for painting blockstream as evil or self serving because it's not a service they make a profit with. The satellite streaming service is provided, free of charge to anyone at all. It's a public service sponsored by a company.
Such a streaming service is also extremely beneficial in helping Bitcoin stay independent. Although, more providers should provide it (or at least, sign the data as a statement that it's complete and unmodified. Doesn't really make sense to broadcast the same data multiple times in different streams.)
The existence of a satellite broadcast service means that no nation state can realistically deprive their citizens from having access to the blockchain without depriving them of computers and computer networks as well.

Let's see.. You listed 6 things, of which only 2 make sense to list in this context.
The two are:
- LN Users need to be online. (Checking for fraud / Receiver needs to be online)
- Complexity
The locking of funds is a non-issue. LN funds are only theoretically locked. In practise they're more mobile. The only situation when they're actually locked is if the channel's counterparty is offline, but that's already covered by the complexity argument as that's the complexity from users point of view. How to choose reliable channel partners.
Network limits is a kind of a non-argument too. Anyone with an LN payment address to offer can be expected to have channels setup as well. If they don't... Well, that's a money making opportunity for someone (perhaps you) and will soon be fixed.
The timeouts/attack claim is bogus. The transfers are designed to be atomic. Even when a one-sided channel closure happens in the middle of a transfer. The transfer either fails completely or succeeds. There's no maybe.

We're already scaling on-chain by allowing bigger blocks. Blocks over 1MB are far from rare. Although, I must say that using bytes is far from an optimal way of expressing transaction capacity.
For instance, a regular transaction is around 258 bytes. If you make 3 of them, that's 774 bytes. If you combine those three into one sendmany transaction, that's a transaction of just 326 bytes and the result is equivalent. And it's just 42% of the bytes compared to the 3 transactions individually.
If we combine 10 transactions, the difference is even starker.  564 bytes vs 2580 bytes. Just 22% of the individual transactions, yet it does the same thing. For combining 100 transactions, that's 14%.
There's a lot of scaling potential available just from the market finding ways to express transactions in a more effective manner.
TL;DR It's entirely possible for a 1MB block filled with sendmany transactions to do more than a 5MB block full of individual transactions.

I think I read somewhere that they're adding a temporary opt-in replay protection support. So, if the transaction you're making has a special OP_RETURN output (or something to that effect), the 2x chain won't accept it.
Barring that, just wait until you can get someone, whose coins are already replay protected, to send you some coins on just one of the chains. Then, if you make a transaction that includes that new transaction as input, the transaction will only be valid on one of the chains. The easiest way to make sure it's included is to send all the coins in the wallet in one transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:59:31
You want something to be decided... that much is clear. However, considering how Bitcoin was built, it was one of the primary design goals to make it as difficult as possible for individual users or even groups of users to make decisions about how to change it.
It'd therefore be deceptive to promise to make a decision about how to change Bitcoin, because no individual person or organization can do that.
The workshops are not trying to make decision simply because it'd be out of their depth. The best thing they can hope to do is to create concrete proposals and hopefully, implementations of those proposals, so the wider community can try to reach a consensus (which, in this context, is a synonym for decision).

There's no centralized list of transactions to block. Miners have figured out how to tell them apart from normal transactions. It's actually _very difficult_ to spam the network and masquerade the spam as regular transactions.
Miners know that Bitcoin's exchange rate will take a plunge if the spam seriously hampers Bitcoin's normal operation. That would drop their profits far more than they'd temporarily gain from prioritizing this spam.

You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants *less attention* (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).
Also, I'd like to point out that the human mind requires time to wind off to retain the ability to do stressful productive work. It's impossible to use 100% of your time doing stressful stuff effectively.
So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.
Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use. 
That being said, I do consider it to be criminally negligent to run an exchange without actually auditing periodically that you actually have the customer funds you're supposed to have. (So I actually agree that he was acting very irresponsibly, I just disagree with your reasoning for why)

Some of the variation in both C and T, if interpreted through the links you gave is likely due to the data measuring individual transactions rather than ignoring their sizes.
I think the expectation of the developers is that eventually there will be a permanent backlog. That is, the backlog never clears entirely. Yes, this means there will be transactions that never confirm and wallets have adapted to the situation by being able to abandon the old transactions when they don't confirm.


There's no way to predict the actual delay, yes. However, you can use the past data to calculate the probability that a transaction will confirm within a specified time, which is enough for the purposes of closing payment channels securely.
For payment channels to be secure enough for practical use, you don't need a 100% certainty that the counterparty can't steal your coins. It's enough to ensure that the expected value of attempting to steal them is clearly negative, which is also amplified by the counterparty not having the data to estimate their chances. They just simply don't know what kind of a fee the punishment transaction will have.
If you make sure the counterparty always has enough coins in the channel, they will always have something to lose. Which means that there's no reason to be stingy with the fees going into a punishment transaction. I expect it'll be a popular strategy for punishment transactions to plunge all of the counterparty's actual remaining coins into the fee and send the rest to their own wallet.

It'd also piss off millions of people, many of whom would then start working actively on ways to structure a Bitcoin-like system so it's even more resilient against attempts to censor it or prevent it from working.
A ban would slow things down, but there's no stopping this. A smart government won't ban Bitcoin, they'll only be digging their own grave by doing that. They'll also be motivated to prevent any other country from successfully subduing Bitcoin for the same reason.

Yep, even the simplistic version is enough for scaling LN quite a bit bigger in number of users than Bitcoin is now. Also, critics always ignore that not everyone has to use the same route finding algorithm. Every wallet can pick the one that best suits it's needs 
(or outsource, which of course sacrifices some privacy but is an option nevertheless. Although, it should be noted that some routing algorithms might actually build their own routing tables by querying the same API as pure outsourcing does, so the privacy loss through outsourcing is not necessarily as bad as it might seem).

A hash algorithm based on the UTXO set as well as the script system might be an interesting one. That'd mean that every miner would also be an efficient UTXO database and be able to do block validation using the same resources as required for mining.

@_date: 2017-05-01 19:20:51
Oh, thanks for that link. That's more useful for historical analysis than what I had so far.


It'll stabilize somewhere eventually. However, when use of the system is growing, the fees will keep going up, which will encourage people to make more efficient use of the transactions and the situation will normalize for a while again.
We've only very recently hit the block size limit and the first contact is bound to be a little turbulent as people are learning to deal with the situation. 
That being said, LN channels can handle even 40 hour confirmation delays given that the delay period for uncooperative close is at least 2 days. I'd expect a week to be a commonly used delay setting for channels.


It'll stop looking so chaotic as we get more data about how the backlogs act. You only need to be able to estimate the possibility that a transaction takes longer than a certain amount of time to confirm.
Also, it just occurred to me that there's no reason for the payment channel implementations to only prepare a single settlement transaction. There's no reason not to prepare several with different fee levels. this simple solution will remove pretty much all fee related uncertainty and as a bonus also allows closing channels with a more optimal fee on average.

I think it's likely that the topology will be both mesh and hub-and-spoke. Some users will want to mesh and others will want to hub. And then others will want to do both, which leads to the mesh and hub networks being pretty interconnected.

soft-fork means you change things so that something that was valid previously, becomes invalid. That means that  for old versions, everything still looks valid.
When you try to make something that was invalid into valid, that's hard fork, because old nodes won't accept it unless they're explicitly upgraded.
When the segwit soft-fork has activated, it means that an overwhelming majority of nodes has adopted the new rules. If you were then to try to make the now invalid back to valid, that'd be hard fork, not soft.

If you were talking about the payment channel settlement transaction I would understand bringing on-chain fees to the discussion but this is just an LN payment. The only fee that applies is the LN routing fee.
However, the "can't trust his wallet" situation is already present with Bitcoin wallets in certain corner cases. The corner case of having received the wallet's contents in numerous small transactions.
This particular problem comes from the fact that each received transaction output will require at least 148 bytes to use in a transaction. (so a priority fee for one is 148 bytes * 160 satoshis = 0.0002368 BTC ~= $0.32 and economy would be somewhere &lt;=$0.10)
So, if you have received the coins in your wallet in, say, 50 different transactions, sending them all will mean paying between $5-$15 in fees depending on the urgency. If the individual transactions were something like $50 each, that's not too much of a problem but if they were $1 each it's getting a little extreme.
This is actually a big part of the motivation for designing LN and the payment channels in the first place because it's good for combining multiple payments into one actual transaction output.

You can't fade away the discount while keeping the increased capacity that segwit provides. The discount is a central element in how segwit provides the increased capacity. If you remove the discount, you remove the added capacity.
The discount doesn't come from someone deciding the transactions are cheaper. It comes from the fact that you can fit more of them into the block which will cause miners to prefer lower fee segwit transactions over regular transactions because they'll make more money by including the segwit transactions.
The only way to remove the discount in segwit is to remove the capacity increase.

Segwit soft fork does not require everyone to upgrade nodes or wallets just to activate. A supermajority of miners along with a significant fraction of other nodes would be enough. That is, assuming you can trust that miners don't want to cause an economic chain split.
Soft Fork allows users to gradually upgrade with those upgrading getting the benefits as they upgrade, while hard fork requires everyone to upgrade and no-one gets the benefits until everyone has upgraded.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:21:32
The thing is, you really only need one blockchain that's backed by proof of work. Any other blockchain can get the benefits of that proof of work by timestamping their own chain through bitcoin transactions.
Digital signatures from a limited set of parties who stand to lose a lot if their system fails are enough to form a short term consensus protocol for deciding what the chain will look like before committing it into a bitcoin transaction and therefore making the transactions immutable.

It's not sufficient to coordinate among just all miners. Increasing the block size requires co-ordination among all nodes that are being used for transacting.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:05:58
If you only keep the UTXO set, you can't handle reorgs. With current transactions, you need the witness data as well if you want to verify data integrity. Without it you'd have no way to verify that the data is what it should be.
Also, the discount is the very mechanism that allows Segwit to increase the block capacity. It's not an essential part of the upgrade but if you remove it and the upgrade is applied, you lose the chance to increase capacity smoothly with a soft fork.

1) That's not what I'm saying. I'm not talking about the number of full nodes. I'm talking about the percentage of people (all people, not just those who use Bitcoin currently) who _could afford to run a full node_ if they wanted to. That's the really important measure.
That is the percentage of people who can *AUDIT* the blockchain, check that the rules are being followed and refuse to acknowledge a version of the blockchain that breaks the rules. If too few people can do this, all someone needs to do is to bribe/threaten the ones who can (and want to) into submission and Bitcoin will be centralized with the rules decided by a centralized party.
2) Yes, even with LN, as it is currently, we will still need on-chain scaling *eventually*. However, with LN, the necessary blocksize falls to levels that will be within the widely accepted safety margin in the next 10-20 years.

So far the situation in practice doesn't support this. At it's highest, the minimum fee for next block confirmation was around 220 satoshis per byte. Right now it's around 160 satoshis per byte.
However, this doesn't mean that transactions with much lower fee will never confirm. Currently, even transactions with as low as 50 satoshis per byte can be expected to confirm within 5 hours. This is based on statistical analysis. Source 
The fees have been very stable for a few weeks at the current levels. Stable enough that channel close delay of a week would most likely mean the transactions would confirm in time (that is, within a week) even if the fee was relatively low.


Why close a perfectly good channel? Well anyway, such users won't use LN for long if that's the case. The only reasons to actually close a channel, that I can see, are
a) If the counterparty is unreachable and the fees increase too much
b) if you want to switch the channel counterparty for some reason.
c) if you want to use the channel funds to make a regular bitcoin payment. 


I don't get it. Why would Alice be left with a responsibility to pay more fees later for an LN payment? There's the routing fee and that's that. There's no protocol for changing that later in LN itself.

a blockchain is a transport protocol for changes to a database, allowing multiple parties to reconstruct the database with identical data on their own servers. Also, blockchain needs some kind of an algorithm to determine which is the authentic database in case there's a fork attempt.
So basically, it's a method of coming to a consensus among many parties. A private blockchain among the banks themselves is entirely feasible and much better than what they use in transfers between themselves now. Provided, of course, that it's done right.
The main difference to what they want and Bitcoin is that they'll be the gatekeepers. It'll be a closed network you can't use without their permission. The biggest reason they want that is most likely regulatory. Whenever they handle (whether knowingly, or not) so called dirty money, there are significant costs they'll face due to it.
They don't like those costs and within their own closed network, they can effectively keep the amount of dirty money to a minimum.   With Bitcoin, they currently have almost no tools at all to avoid the dirty money, so they're very skittish about it.

What he's saying is _very different_ from refusing any blocklimit lift. He's talking about long term goals for the system. It's quite technical stuff, though, so I can see how you might interpret it that way if you have no idea what he's talking about.
It's a very sensible goal to have a base layer that's flexible enough to not require updates any longer. However, the current base layer is not flexible enough, so eventually it will need some upgrades.
Exactly what those are is still largely unclear as we're still only just beginning to really research the subject. It'd be very premature to commit to a specific way of doing it. Except for whatever we choose to do in the very short term.
Anyway, he's not saying they'll refuse to lift the limit no matter what. He's saying that it might eventually be possible to scale to any scale with just 1MB blocksize.
You see, the developers don't want to prematurely commit to a specific way of improving the system because a better way could be found before the upgrade has to be done. That's why no-one is promising to increase the blocksize. It's way too technically specific of a promise. They can't make that promise because if they see a better way, that's what they'll support. That's their job. To find the best way.

For example, it separates the witness from the rest of the transaction. That means that for segwit transactions, pruning nodes can throw away the witness portion after validating them. Without Segwit, they can't do that as the witness will be necessary for calculating transaction id and verifying that you actually have the correct transaction.
Due to the above, the witness portion can be discounted and thus segwit will improve the efficiency of the entire bitcoin network in the long run.

Well, consider a hard fork that switches the PoW algorithm. It's easiest to understand in that case. The current miners clearly won't have much influence in whether or not that particular hard fork succeeds or not. It'll all be up to the new miners and the rest of the community. (and do note that anyone will be able to become one of the new miners, even the old miners, but the old miners won't have any advantage over the new ones in this case)
The situation does not significantly change even when the PoW algo stays the same. Even if the old miners refuse to play along, new miners will pick up the ball. That's the reason miners aren't important for a hard fork.

While I can't see a problem with doing what you've described, it's dangerous to get too creative with the process. It's way too easy to actually get weaker keys as a result.
sha-256 is an algorithm designed for condensing entropy into 256 bits. You can feed it strings of data with low entropy and the result will have 256 bits of entropy if the source string had at least that much in total to begin with.
So, the simplest workable option is to roll however many rolls you feel comfortable with, make a string from them and then sha256 it and there's your private key. You'd only ever gain anything with the XOR if sha256 is not fit for it's task, in which case you'd be screwed anyway as that's the single most important algorithm bitcoin is built on.

It's not a question of the number of server farms. It's a question of the number of people who can afford to validate the blockchain themselves.
If you _have to trust someone else_ to use the system, then you're not a peer in the system and therefore using the system is not P2P for you. In such a case you're a client of a service provider with the ability to be a peer in the system.
What I was trying to convey with the more/less P2P concept there is the percentage of people with a realistic chance to choose to be a peer in the system if they want to be. That percentage is already pretty low if you measure it globally and it _is measurable_. You just need to calculate what it costs to fully validate the blockchain and then calculate how many people can afford to divert that much of their income and you have the percentage.
That percentage is the amount of people who have the ability to resist a centralized party trying to rule over Bitcoin. When that percentage falls low enough that a centralized party is able to control them all, Bitcoin will soon become effectively centralized.
The parameter that's harder to define is how high this percentage needs to be so we can still keep the benefits of decentralization. I suspect we can at best calculate a propability distribution that a given percentage is enought guarantee sufficient decentralization. Which means that every time we push that percentage lower, we increase the risk that we end up with a centralized system.
Also, the more powerful the centralized parties that might be interested in controlling Bitcoin become, the bigger the percentage needs to be to ensure decentralization. So, the crucial parameter is how powerful centralized party does the system need to be able to defend itself against. This is a guessing a game where you know that bigger percentages are safer, but there's no telling where the safety line is.
I suspect, however, that it's possible to establish a lower bound for this percentage. To prove that we're safe with any percentage higher than or equal to X%. So, if someone happens to come up with a way to determine such a lower bound that gains acceptance even in academic circles, then a scaling solution, that reliably guarantees that percentage, is likely to reach a consensus.

If you could have a P2P system AND scale on-chain, I'd probably also support that. But they're inversely related properties. If you make it more P2P, it'll have less capacity. If you increase the capacity it'll be less P2P. If you increase the capacity enough to run even a significant fraction of the world's transactions on it, it'll be essentially paypal.

The actual effect will be that both, segwit and non-segwit transactions will be cheaper than before. However, segwit transactions will be significantly cheaper.
What I wrote is just the facts. What Jihan wrote includes a judgement that it's unfair. That judgement is what provokes the hate.
Why unfair? Well, duh, because it makes it difficult for people to continue to maintain their .. umm ... political circus of showing how they will refuse to do what "core" wants.
They've created this so called "core" that's supposedly the root of all evil and are now pretending that using segwit is supporting that. They want people to not use segwit transactions so they can continue posturing and segwit transactions being cheaper means that they'll end up the most used transaction format pretty fast.
In other words, they want something with the label 'core' on it to resist, so they can keep feeling good about themselves for standing against the great evil or something. If Segwit activates, they'll have a difficult time coming to a consensus about the next thing to resist.

Personally I'd be somewhat reluctant to predict $500k in 3 years. However, if we're talking 5 years, it starts to seem likely. Afterall, 5 years ago the price was at $8 and we're at $2700 now. The price increased 337x in 5 years. Going from $2700 to $500k would only be an increase of 185x.
Past is certainly no guarantee of the future, but Bitcoin is still tiny compared to the global economy. Well below 1% of the economy. Increase of 185x is still well within the realm of possibility.
Unless something stops Bitcoin's growth before that, $500k is invevitable. Might you know of something that will stop Bitcoin's growth? If so, by all means please share.

The assumption that the trading volume will drop by $1,200,000 is false. The only thing that drops is selling pressure. Buying pressure stays the same.

Even if the dice aren't perfect, it only means a slight reduction in the entropy per dice roll. That can be easily compensated for with extra rolls, making a string with all the rolls and then taking sha256 of that.

It wouldn't surprise me if Paxos or a derivate of it ended up being the algorithm they use. Making use of Bitcoin as a timestamping service sounds equally possible. Perhaps even a combination of both.
They could even make use of Bitcoin's multisig capability to build a closed network within Bitcoin once Bitcoin's scalability issues have been dealth with. All they need to do is create addresses that require a bank's signature to be spent and never sign transactions that move the coins to non-bank controlled address again.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:05:10
The dice not being perfect is not a big issue if you use the right tools. If the dice are biased, it just reduces the entropy they generate. This is very bad if you're trying to use them for games where a single roll is often important. However, here you can compensate with more rolls. 
For example, a perfect 16 sided dice generates 4 bits of entropy each throw. With such a dice, you'd need 256/4 = 64 throws to generate 256 bits of entropy.
It takes an enormous bias to drop the amount of entropy by even one bit. For example, suppose the dice gave the side with number "5" half the time or never gave half of the sides. These dices would have 3 bits of entropy. In other words, you could generate 256 bits of entropy with 79 throws.
SHA256 is a function that compresses the entropy in it's input into 256 bits. So, if you make a string from the throws and feed it to sha256, you'll have a random number with at least 255 bits of entropy. (Cryptographers prefer to assume it wastes one bit of entropy on each run)

The difference between layer and a sidechain is that a layer will make use of bitcoin transactions and network rules directly to facilitate it's operation.
Sidechain might make minor use of bitcoin transactions to record it's own blocks (however that's only one potential way to do it), but will have it's own blockchain and it's own rules.

Some corrections. Segwit itself is incompatible with covert asicboost, not just BIP148. All BIP148 does is try to force miners to signal Segwit. Beyond that, BIP148 does nothing.
The Segwit2x plan is funny in that miners could easily unilaterally just decide to activate the normal Segwit if they wanted to. However, Segwit2x includes a hard fork, which requires the entire network to upgrade to be possible. It's unlikely that an active consensus will form for the hard fork. No such consensus is needed for Segwit though, passive majority acceptance/ignorance is enough that it'll go through without problems if there's a majority miner support.
Others also mentioned this, but Lightning Network is not a sidechain. It's a layer on top of Bitcoin. You're also mixing up criticisms of sidechains as criticism for the Lightning Network. The ones you mentioned have nothing to do with Lightning Network.
The reason Lightning Network requires Segwit is that Segwit provides a transaction type that is not malleable. Malleability makes smart contracts unreliable (there are ways to get around it for LN purposes but that in turn makes the contracts too clumsy to be practical and more error prone to use).
I just hope miners would quit trying to bully the community into accepting a hard fork in order get Segwit. It's not going to work and just wastes time and gives altcoins a boost (makes one wonder if that's the real motivation for continuing this farce, there's a lot of money to be made by manipulating the market in this way)

It's quite simple really. You'll pay extra heavy fees if you receive more bitcoin payments than you send out. How extra heavy depends on how many more payments you receive than you send out.
Basically, every bitcoin payment you receive will mean you'll eventually need to pay fees for 148 bytes of transaction. So it'd make sense to consider every incoming bitcoin payment to cost you that much in fees. At the current fee level this would be 148*350 satoshi = 51800 satoshi =~ $1.25 per incoming transaction.
(the reason it's not cheaper if you receive less transactions than you send is that unless you somehow make sure you send them in batches, every transaction will also send the change back you, so it will also count as one incoming transaction.)
Edit: Although, if you make use of the low activity time periods and are willing to wait with the confirmation, you can probably get it sent with around 150 satoshis per byte, which comes out to around $0.55 per incoming transaction.

The FUD would only work for a limited time. The pool of people that are able to see through the FUD expands steadily as the people who can do that interact with people who can't and express their counterarguments. Someone who has been unFUDed once won't convert back to being FUDed. At least not with the same FUD and is likely to ask the person who unFUDed them the first time if they encounter a new FUD.
This works because of Bitcoin's incentive structure. It literally pays (even if indirectly) to unFUD people.

There's a set of rules that are encoded into the reference implementation of Bitcoin that is still the only implementation that's actually running the network. Every computer running this implementation constantly verifies that the data it recieves from other computers abides by the rules. Any computer sending data that breaks the rules is simply ignored.
That is, basically, what limits the amount of bitcoins in existence. To change the rules, you'd have to convince a large majority of people running and using Bitcoin to go along with it. That's what keeps the number of bitcoins fixed.

That depends on whether or not this custom client is used for mining. Even if it is, unless it's percentage of miners is significant enough that they can keep the fork usable, it's going to most likely end up as a temporary inconvenience for users of that particular client being unable to see new transactions get confirmed.
Especially miners are going to react to something like this fast. Mining a chain that ends up orphaned means they're not making anything by doing that.
If close to 50% of the miners were on different sides of the fork and someone deliberately makes both sides of the fork contain conflicting transactions it is conceivable the fork is not reconciliable and will stick, effectively creating 2 different Bitcoin networks from that point on. However, this is quite unlikely situation.

I think the purpose of the delay is to reduce the chance of chain forks appearing. Chain fork happens when two or more miners both find a block close at nearly the same time. Only one of the blocks will remain valid.

Yes, the limit means the inflation will eventually drop so small it no longer matters.
Dividing currency into smaller pieces is very different from quantitative easing. When you divide currency into smaller fractions, the relative purchasing power of everyone holding that currency stays the same.
With quantitative easing, the new money is injected at certain institutions, making their owners richer. In effect it transfers purchasing power from everyone to the few who get the money first.

To clarify a little. If the odds really were 97% and the payout 1.1x. This makes it look like the expected value is 0.97*1.1 = 1.067 and is higher than what you're betting.
However, since this system does not create bitcoins out of thin air and the house certainly isn't paying everyone from their own pocket, the money for this comes from the players. Thus, it's not statistically possible for everyone to get, on average, more than the their bet.
TL;DR My point is that the calling the odds 97% and the payout 1.1x is misleading people who have a simplified understanding of statistics.

Thus far I haven't heard of any supercomputer that could come even close to actually posing a threat to the bitcoin network and that's just with GPU mining. With the move to ASIC mining, it's going to require a dedicated supercomputer built specifically for bitcoin mining to be of much use.
The current supercomputers can only use a tiny fraction of their circuitry for bitcoin mining. They're thus very inefficient at it. The electricity they use would cost more than what they manage to mine.

Electrum is currently implemented so that it uses the algorithm specified in BIP32. I checked electrum's source code and verified it works like this. 
The private key derivation is done through the cryptographic hash function HMAC-SHA512. Whatever the seed, you'll get the full range of possible private keys for single addresses from it. The OP is just plain wrong.
Also, if someone happens to get the private key for one of your addresses in a BIP32 wallet, it alone won't help in getting any of the others.

It's incorrect to think of it as inputs being unlocked.
The transaction, when translated to english (and simplified), goes somewhat like:
Access rights to bitcoins in txid A are now transfered to address B

Some bitcoin services might skip the network altogether if the transaction happens within the service. For example, Mt.Gox will not make a network transaction for transfers between Mt.Gox accounts unless the "open transaction" option is selected while making the withdraw.
Also, many services work such that they'll give you one bitcoin address to deposit to, which stays until bitcoins are sent to it. Then you're given a new one (and likely not shown the previous one anymore, anywhere.)

I think it's helpful to think about inflation by looking at it's effects and then looking at what would be needed to replicate those in Bitcoin based economy.
When more money is created, causing inflation, most people lose buying power and those people who get the newly created money gain buying power.
For anything comparable to happen in Bitcoin system, you'd have to forcibly take a portion of Bitcoins (lose buying power) everyone else has and then give it to some selected people (who'd gain buying power).
The issue isn't really inflation and deflation. It's the involuntary transfer of buying power that's the problem. That's what happens when money is created in our debt based system. Inflation is merely the result of this.
The infinite divisibility in Bitcoin doesn't cause any transfer of buying power to happen.
Now, you might now be wondering about deflation and noticing how it's increasing bitcoins' buying power. That is true, bitcoins are absorbing buying power from other assets.
The crucial difference with fiat money, like dollars or euros, is that there's no involuntary internal transfer of buying power within the bitcoin system.

Ripple has the potential to grab a lot of market share. However, I don't expect that it will replace Bitcoin. There's plenty of room for both on the market.
That being said, Ripple can do some things Bitcoin cannot. Thus, in certain sectors, Ripple is likely to supplant Bitcoin as the direct payment method. Especially since Ripple provides the framework to accept any currency, including Bitcoin.
So, there's a reasonably good chance that Bitcoin could end up as a reserve currency while Ripple is used to do the actual transactions.
Of course, Ripple's own virtual currency (XRP) also has a chance. Although I expect people will be vary of owning a lot of them due to the fact they're all pregenerated and a large portion of them are likely to be owned by the company behind Ripple for a long while.

The compromise from a single party having 51% or more is not a complete compromise in any case. Also, it's a good thing these chips are coming to the market where anyone can buy them. That's the best way to make it difficult for any single entity to get 51%.
It cannot be guaranteed no-one will do it. But it can be guaranteed no-one will try to do it because they expect to profit from it (unless they're very stupid). The idea is to make the investment required to get 51%+ so high that the potential return for misusing it is not worth it.

There's two aspects to this. First there's people with bitcoins needing dollars, euros or some other fiat currency suddenly for whatever reason. This is a random factor.
Second, there's investor psychology. In more common terms, the interaction between fear and greed.
1. When the price first starts going up, greed will amplify the increase. 2. After the price has increased for a while, fear (of crash) will start reducing the number of people buying in. Yet, greed will still be strong enough to keep most from selling at this point yet.
3. The price has reached a plateau. Greed will keep most people waiting in case it increases more, however others will start betting on a crash being imminent and sell in the hopes of buying back in cheaper after the crash. (Of course, buying back only happens if the traders believe that the price is going to continue increasing despite the crash.)
4. Crash has happened and traders are trying to guess how big the crash is going to be and to time their purchase accordingly. This will eventually stop the crash and cause a reversal as traders notice they missed the bottom and rush into buying from those who still believe (or fear that) the crash will continue.
5. Depending on the number of traders betting on different outcomes, this is where the situation becomes quite variable. Basically, the market will go where the most money bets it will.
This is of course very simplified version, but hopefully it'll help you understand the mechanics more.

For the first question, the delay is actually arbitrary. It's a design decision since the system adjusts the computational difficulty to keep the average time between blocks at 10 minutes.
For the second question. The proof of work makes it expensive to create valid blocks. The more blocks have been found after a certain block, the more expensive it is to replace. This is what actually confirms transactions. The fact that they get more expensive to cancel with each confirmation. This is what solves the double spending problem.

There is a permanent record in the blockchain, that much is correct. The real kicker is that he assumes it'll do any good in figuring out who were the ones doing the transaction.

Nothing prevents anyone from running a fractional reserve system with bitcoin denominated accounts.
The point is that with Bitcoin, the core system is always there and that core system is guaranteed to be free from any fractional reserve.
Why would anyone in their right mind trust their bitcoins to an operator of a fractional reserve system denominated in bitcoin? Of course, a bitcoin wallet service could defraud their customers and do this without telling anyone, but that's called fraud for a reason.
With Bitcoin, you can _always_ hold your coins yourself and be 100% sure it's not fractional reserve. This is what will prevent bitcoin denominated fractional reserve from becoming widespread.

There's just one transaction there. Address C is most likely a change address. This is how Bitcoin transactions work. When you transfer bitcoins, you have to transfer one or several previous received transactions completely.
So, in this instance the bitcoins being sent are a transaction that came to address A. Since outputs to addresses B and C total 50 bitcoins, address A should have received that plus the fee, that is 50.005 bitcoins.
In a Bitcoin transaction, anything that doesn't go to an address from the input, is considered a fee for the miner. So, if address C was missing, the miner would get 40.005 as a fee. For this reason, the sender almost always includes a change address of his own in the transfer.
If this was your own wallet you were sending from, address C is your own address.

The Bitcoin-network adjusts the mining difficulty automatically to keep the rate of new bitcoins in check. At worst we might see a week or two when as many are generated as before the block reward halved.
As such, there will be no flood big enough to make a significant difference. The daily exchange volume across all exchanges averages somewhere around 200kBTC. The generation rate of new bitcoins is only 3.5kBTC per day. Even doubling that won't make a big effect on the price.
Volatility is there, I agree. That's what services, such as Bitpay are here for. They take the payments in Bitcoin, the volatility risk and send the merchant dollars or euros.

TL;DR If you're patient and willing to wait a few trillion years, sure.
The ECDSA algorithm that Bitcoin uses is not based on prime numbers. The mathematical problem is a bit different. Taking this into account would change your question into form "What's the chance that someone else will generate one of my addresses?".
The addresses are 160-bit numbers. So, if we assume someone decides to go address mining. That is tries to generate addresses that already have Bitcoins on them.
There are 2^160 = 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 different possible Bitcoin-addresses.
That means, since there's 6 billion people on the planet, that there are 2^160/(6*10^12) = 243583606221817153033947472119380503 addresses available for every single person.
Now, if we assume there was someone who could create to the tune of 20 billion addresses per second (this would require many times more processing power than is currently used for Bitcoin mining). It'd take him on the average 2^160 / (6*(10^12)) / (20*(10^12)) = 12179180311090857651697 years to find an address belonging to someone else, if everyone had an address.
The number of addresses actually in use is much smaller than this, so it would actually take even more time to find an address that has bitcoins in it.

A core feature of the Bitcoin protocol is that all transactions are public. They're also not encrypted in any way. This means anyone can check if the rules are being followed. It follows from this that any hacks able to create more coins are detected immediately.
The only hacks that would be difficult to detect would be ones that steal other people's coins. This already happens to some extent due to people being lax about their personal security. So, it could easily get lost in the noise for quite a while if the hacker didn't overdo it.

The pruned merkle tree optimization has not been applied so far because the devs feel it might reduce the number of nodes with full blockchain enough to make it impossible for a new node to verify the whole history at bootstrap.
This is an important feature because by doing full verification, the node can be certain it's on the right blockchain and has not been fed a false blockchain.

If the implementation is left to people who don't care about privacy at all, it'll be worse than it has to be. This is why it makes sense that Mike's working on an implementation. He's seems to be trying to figure out how to implement it in a way that minimizes the problems it causes.
It's not something that can be prevented, so we should look into ways of doing it in a way that causes the least damage.

The wild swings will calm down as the size of the user/investor base grows.It's a bit early to say still, but just compare this price increase to the one that happened during 2011. The price increased 64x in 2 months. This time the price has only increased 7x so far and it's taken over 2 months to do it.
So, the price instability is weakening. There certainly is a correction coming in the future though. I'm curiously waiting to see how high the exchange rate goes before that.

What I'd set out to do in this kind of a case would be to extract all the private keys from the most recent wallet copy and create a new wallet with just the keys, no transaction data. Then let it sync. That should then represent how things actually are (as long as the blockchain is synced)
Unfortunately, as I've never had to do this, I can't advise on how to get it done. (Could someone else help with that?)

First, let's not confuse blocks and bitcoin creation. Bitcoin creation does happen in blocks but the blocks won't stop being generated, they'll just generate less and less bitcoins as time goes by.
The amount of bitcoins created by each block in the beginning was 50 bitcoins. Approximately every four years (210,000 blocks), this amount will halve. Currently each block is generating 25 bitcoins and the next halving is due somewhere around November 2017.
This information allows us to calculate the maximum number of bitcoins. Each 4 years will generate 210,000 times the block reward amount of bitcoins.
This can be expressed as a calculation as follows:
The sum of the infinite geometric series within the parentheses will tend towards 100 as time passes, so the calculation becomes:
210000*100 = 21000000
The blocks themselves have a purpose other than creating bitcoins though. The blocks are the public transaction log for the Bitcoin-network. To be valid, a new block must follow the rules. Otherwise it'll just be ignored. This is what prevents a block from creating more than the preset amount.

As for the creator potentially owning up to 20%, sure that certainly is a possibility. I'm not personally worried about this for a number of reasons.
1) I don't think it's likely. It would have required signficant investment even in the beginning to mine that much. I don't think even he seriously believed Bitcoin would succeed half as well as it has.
2) Even if the creator has 20% and crashes the market with them, long term it makes little difference.
3) It makes no sense to dump them on the market fast enough to crash the prices, there's significantly more money to be made by selling them slowly.
4) He has to take the risk of revealing his identity if he does want to cash them all out at once.
There is no automatic update system. That's on purpose. If there was such a system, there's a danger someone could hijack it and abuse it. So, in short, updating is up to you.
There are, however, update systems for some of the third party wallets. For example the ones for android use google play's auto update system.
The development team operates out in the open. Anyone can join. It's an open source project, like Linux is. Anyone could make and release a modified version of Bitcoin and people have. However, those only matter if the users start using them in significant numbers.
If the original team went rogue, they'd be caught and others would assume the role.

Certainly the same is possible with Bitcoins. However, the incentive structures and storage of bitcoins are quite different. Bitcoins are quite possible to store securely without needing to give control of them to someone else.
Even if you make use of other people in storing them, you can do it in a way with which no single other person can do anything to them.
So basically, my argument is that people will lack the incentive to give the goldsmith the chance to fractional reserve their coins.
Then again, fractional reserve in and of itself is not a problem either. If you can't make more of the reserve coins, it'll still give a reasonable upper bound on the number of coins in circulation. Having extremely low reserves is just not practical.

There's one possible way for this to happen even without bugs or actual random collisions. With default configuration, Bitcoin-QT creates a buffer of 100 addresses when the wallet is created.
When you request a new address, the address is taken from beginning of this buffer and a brand new address is added to end of the buffer. This makes it possible to take backups that don't need to be recreated every time you create a new address or send bitcoins.
The most likely reason this happened is thus that the wallet being used got copied at some point and one of the copies was used a year ago and the other copy is being used now.

I haven't looked at the specifics, so I can't say if the trigger was a $600k worth of a sell. However, when the price goes up from $13 to $19 in two weeks, most people start expecting a correction. So, when someone finally sold a bigger amount, it caused a domino effect that had many of those sell who'd been planning to.
In short. Market working as expected.
Edit: Oh right, about that $600k being enough to drop the price. Yes, the market isn't big enough yet to be able to handle $600k in one dump without a noticeable change in exchange rate.

I don't know if this is possible but I doubt it. Bitcoin was originally designed so you'd use a new address for each transaction. Thus, you can assign a tag for each address. What you want to do goes against the design principles.

Bitcoin's effective interest rate is an automatically adjusting system. It's only positive and high if the Bitcoin economy is growing, as it is right now.
Now, let's assume the situation you speak of happens. Spending slows, the size of the economy might even shrink for a bit. This means the effective interest rate naturally adjusts to low values or even negative if it gets bad enough. 
Smart people will notice this and start spending their bitcoins to preserve their wealth and eventually an equilibirium is reached.
Problem solved, no?
The economic theory you're using as a basis for your argument is keynesian theory. There are two major economic theories in the world Keynesian (which is the one politically adopted) and Austrian. They differ quite drastically. Bitcoin economic model is no problem at all under Austrian theories.

Ok, here's my take on the points he makes.
1. What he's saying makes sense, but it does not conflict with bitcoins being created by computers, because that is what, in practise, creates bitcoins. The only reason to handwave about this is if you believe computers are capable of acting under their own will, which is, at least for now, not possible.
   What you really want to do is to emphasize that there are real people behind bitcoin, not just computers.
2. Yes, saying "Bitcoins are sent directly to other people without someone in the middle" can be interpreted in a way that is incorrect if you look at things literally. That doesn't really matter though. It conveys the message that "you don't need to ask a third party for help to be able to send money". It is not misunderstandable in a way that would cause problems.
3. Here you're spot on. everything has prerequisites. I expect the writer of that sentence wanted to convey that you don't need a permission from a third party to use Bitcoin.
4. Bitcoins do get lost from time to time. That will slowly increase the value of remaining bitcoins even after Bitcoin has reached a stable market saturation level.
   That being said, it is unethical to advertise Bitcoin as a magic bullet to becoming rich. Anyone likely to jump on based on a claim like like this won't have the discipline required to refrain from doing stupid choices and losing their investment.

Amazingly similar shapes. I wonder if this is some kind of an echo from the past. Some people remembered the past drop, acted like it predicted the future and lo and behold, they made similar things happen.

The strength of the volatility is a function of the number of traders on the market. No currency is entirely without volatility. As Bitcoin grows, the volatility will also be reduced.
Also, with Bitcoin there appears to be this effect that it gets the interest of a lot of people with very little experience at investing. I expect these people are mostly responsible for the volatility. As the percentage of new inexperienced traders in the market increases, the chances of a new bubble increase.

Nothing unusual in a correction like this. Par for the course. Things don't just go up up up. They move in a ping pong fashion.
If you don't have a correction like this sometimes, people will stop buying because there's no tested support zone close by below. The point where the correction is reflected back upwards then becomes such a support.
Also, you're thinking about it the wrong way. The crucial number is not that it fell by $10. The crucial number is how many percent it fell. Since it fell from $75 to $62 (if you look at it now), the percentage is about 20%. Rather small of a correction, considering bitcoin has had corrections of above 50% in the past.

Really random? Of course not, it wouldn't be repeatable if it was.
That being said, SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function. That means it's been designed so that while calculating the hash is easy and fast, doing the same in reverse is so extremely expensive that it's impossible in practise.
However, even SHA256 isn't of much use if the user writes something easily guessable (at a few billion tries) as the input. Someone likely already has a rainbow table of the one billion (or more ) most likely inputs.
The output of SHA256 is thus only as good random as what you give it as input.

No, ASICs will most likely only work for bitcoin mining itself. vanity address mining requires doing ECDSA, RIPEMD-160 and SHA256. Regular bitcoin mining uses only SHA256.

Bitcoin does support transactions without any fee at all. However, the delays in getting such transactions confirmed are growing lately.
The crucial thing to understand here is that when the fees are mandatory, they're mandatory as a result of the spam policy. The aim of the spam policy is to make it expensive to fill the blockchain with garbage.
The spam policy takes effect and requires a fee in three different situations. 1) If one of the outputs of the transaction is less than 0.0005, a fee of 0.0005 is required. 2) If one of the inputs is not old enough, a fee of 0.0005 is required 3) If the transaction size (in bytes) is bigger than 1kb, the fee required is 0.0005/kb.
So, to minimize your fees, in the same order as the above policies: 1) Don't send extremely small amounts 2) Let the coins age a bit before sending. The smaller the amounts you received, the more time is needed. 3) avoid receiving lots of transfers of much smaller amounts than you're likely to send out.
Edit: Looks like I got some things wrong. See Dooglus' reply to this message for the accurate information.

Single dollar changes stopped being meaningful above $20. What really matters is the percentage. increase from $10 to $11 is 10% increase. Increase from $50 to $51 is 2%.
the current slip is about as significant as a drop from $12 to $10 would've been.

I don't think they'd be stupid enough to do what you describe. By doing what you're describing, they could actually be doing Bitcoin a favor. If they did do what you described, they'd risk generating enough actual interest in Bitcoin that their dump, when it happens, would be easily swallowed by the market.

It's a gambling game with a twist. The way it works is clearly documented on the game site itself. Basically, if no-one buys it in 24 hours after you bought it, you lose the coins you paid, otherwise, you win.

There's an upper limit for the number of bitcoin addresses that can have bitcoins simultaneously. It's 21 * 10^14. In such a case, each address would have only one satoshi in it.
This number needs 51 bits to express. Thus, for each attempt at creating a new address, there is a 1 in 2^109 chance of a succesful collision at worst.

I don't think the crux of this issue is so much respecting bitcoin but rather respecting the wishes of the users who wish to have an easy way to convert bitcoin amounts to other currencies or vice versa.

If they've got enough power to 51% attack the network, then sure, they could doublespend all they like. However, at the same time, they'd be wasting their investment on the mining devices as just doing that a few times would almost certainly make bitcoin's price drop like a stone. It'd be much more profitable for them to cooperate.
Without at least 50% of the hashing power or extraordinary circumstances like during the chain fork, doing a double spend is close to impossible unless the target is accepting 0 confirmation transfers.

Passwords are usually hashed rather than encrypted because with passwords, because an encryption that the server itself can decrypt is completely useless. Makes no real difference over saving them in plaintext.
This is because if a hacker gets into the server and can access the database, he can most likely also access the decryption functions and use those to recover the passwords.
When the passwords are hashed, the hacker has to do it the hard way, brute force. This means only weak passwords can be broken.

Naturally, that is possible. That's one of the reasons it's so critical we get healthy competition in ASIC manufacturers and lots of ASICs in the hands of regular miners.
However, even miners' ability to do things with the system is limited. They just mint new coins and decide which transactions to include. You can read some thoughts on the matter here:
