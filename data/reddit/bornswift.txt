Not when I went last night.. it was a bar called "not suspicious bar" on the second floor

Yeah, it's one thing to understand.. a whole other to explain to someone else taking into account their computer literacy level

Yeah, it's just temporary until they transfer it to their own wallet

I work at Microsoft on the Azure Blockchain team. There's a build lab on campus with a ton of neat tools (laser cutter, 3d printers, cnc machines). I'm actually leaving Microsoft in a couple weeks to continue diving into my passion for blockchain and crypto. I had to get some last minute usage in before I leave for good haha. The wood is just standard plywood that you can get at Home Depot.

Post party update: the Bitcoin was a hit in the white elephant exchange. People were fighting over it and genuinely curious about it. It was one of the first gifts to get locked up. It was a bunch of 20-something year olds and it seemed like they all were pretty familiar with the basic concepts. I helped setup the guy's wallet and transfer over the Bitcoin. Overall pretty happy with how it turned out.

I have access to an epilog laser cutter at work. Love the look of the raster.

This is the "insurance" fee solution I mention in the potential mitigations.

Can you expand on this?
