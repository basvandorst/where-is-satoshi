Bitpay is a valid company?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:20:46
I'm curious why one generates a new public address for each transaction.

You're repeating yourself.  I added to the thread because I was curious which coin you were referring to.  *I'm still learning all this shit*.  
Even in this vestal state, you know what I did do today?  I encouraged three different business owners to accept Bitcoin for goods and services and set my wife up to accept Bitcoin for her yoga practice.  My ignorance may seem annoying to you but I'm out there doing everything I can to increase adoption of Bitcoin and in the evening I'm suffering this garbage?  Don't get me wrong, I find you amusing, but really, take a deep breath, I feel like we're all in this together.  Jesus fuck.  Chill out.

No worries.  You seem very passionate, if a little light on sharing information (judging by this thread).   
For the record, I'm not a shill.  But I understand the paranoia.  Shills suck dick.

Yeah, I just got home from work.  This is the first thread I dove into.  All I know at the moment is Bitcoin lost a bit today and you're a condescending prick who probably shouldn't assume so much.  But, alas, we've already determined I'm thicker than pig shit, so, really, what do I know?

Thanks, I'm good.  I've ridden the highs and lows of stock trading and real estate.  I'm not actually a complete dumb ass.  
Cryptocurrencies are incredibly interesting and I look forward to understanding them better.  I know it's much more than just an alternative currency format and wide-spread adoption is key.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:56
I don't know which coin you're talking about..
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:30
What is the legit subreddit for Bitcoin Cash (is that what it's actually called?)
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:27:02
You know what also else is speculation?  Your mom.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:06
I'm pretty new to cryptocurrency.  So I suppose, in this context, I'm 'thicker than pig shit'.  
If I were to guess, I would suppose y'all are referencing BCash as the pump and dump?  I'm still wrapping my head around the friction between BCash and Bitcoin.  I guess I just wasn't born understanding these things like someone of your towering intellectual stature, .

So I can generate a QR code from my Greenaddress wallet and payment can go directly there? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:33:49
Awesome breakdown.  I think we can take it from there.  Thank you so much!

Anything a vendor sells who is willing to accept bitoin in payment.  These vendors are widespread and include Starbucks across Canada, a bunch of stores in Korea, some guy in Slovakia selling really good meth, a different guy in Austria selling sex slaves.  I would sell you my house for bitcoin.   
So long as people are willing to accept bitcoin as payment for goods or services it will have value. Because it becomes rarer with higher rates of adoption it will gain value over time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:41:42
 Just something I read ~a year ago.  
Looks like it's related to Starbucks accepting the 'Fold App' for payment and the Fold app accepting bitcoin to load.

Yeah, sometimes you have to sacrifice 4 seconds and read a couple more comments down the thread. I love you, too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:16:16
I haven't tried. Maybe it's their online stores? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:25:41
Maybe not useful to you, that's cool. No one is forcing you to buy Bitcoin and I'm not even asking you to. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:39:21
I think fiat currency is used to do all the same things and that's no justification to stop using USD as a currency for exchange, for example.  
Some might consider this an ethical problem.

Sure, be prepared to pay capital gains taxes on your gains or suffer the wrath of the IRS (or your country's version thereof). 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:17
So are you buying my house or what?
