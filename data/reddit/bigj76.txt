I use the Blockchain wallet, Jaxx, and Ledger Nano S. With all of these I own the private keys. For the fork, I will personally be putting everything on the Ledger Nano S. Your personal preference may vary but on a hardware wallet seems to be the leading consensus for the fork

My understanding from other threads is that you will not get the B2X coins if your BTC was in a hard wallet at the time

Just got my Ledger Nano S and will be doing the same move off of Jaxx. I like Jaxx fine enough but a hardware wallet is better
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:42:35
The only time I experimented with sweeping a paper wallet (had maybe  $1 on it) was using the wallet on the site Blockchain.info which worked then I moved that to the hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:23
1. Blockchain.info is an Android app and a web wallet where you own your private keys. Good for small amounts especially if you plan on playing with moving BTC in/out/around
2. Jaxx is an Android app and desktop wallet where you own the private keys. Good to practice more holding (pre hardware wallet) until you are comfortable but their fees are not good to do a lot of transferring out of
3. Once you're ready to graduate from either or both of those, you get a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor (I have the Ledger Nano S, love it)
Yes you can use Coinbase as a wallet but don't. You don't own the private keys

One of the most in-depth and comprehensive responses I've seen on this. This explanation adds to the (un)popular thought I have been having a lot lately of selling all my BTC just before the fork hits, focus on other coins, and come back to bitwhatever after this whole mess clears. I only got into BTC about a week or so ago so a hard reset for me wouldn't be bad. I think I might even make $50
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:59


I don't think it will be in a good way. You have to remember, the show is a comedy. What part of the Bitcoin space can lend itself to comedy or "good tv"? One of the characters is going to find an old PC or HDD with Bitcoin he can't access or it's going to be sent to the wrong address, lose it all, and queue the laugh track. My prediction: the episode puts the every day person off of Bitcoin, not brings them in

If you have to do a credit card purchase on Coinbase, attaching a credit card that has a rewards program is a very good way to do it. Let those fees at least tangentially apply to rewards from your CC company on other purchases. Some even let you cash out rewards
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:42:19
With the web wallet Blockchain.info you do own the keys. If you want to try a mobile/desktop wallet there is Jaxx. All of these I used for starting out and getting comfortable but word to the wise, don't put a lot in Jaxx that you think you might want to transfer out later, fees are a bit on the high side

Here's the conflicting thing I've heard. It needs to be sitting on an exchange like Coinbase or GDAX to get it but in the same breadth you're told it's not a good idea to have your BTC on Coinbase or GDAX because you don't own the private keys
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:13:36
This is the one question it seems nobody will/can answer. Been searching many threads and seen a lot of suggestions saying not to leave BTC on exchanges during the fork and when the follow up is asked how you're supposed to get them if they're in a private wallet, the responses go silent
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:14:34
I have been using Jaxx as my Android wallet. Been fine with it so far
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:42:20
I'm not versed enough to say why that happened only enough to say I have had a similar happen and the one time I noticed it, when I was sitting there watching, it didn't hit my price for long at all before going up again. Maybe other similar orders got filled first and wasn't at or below my price long enough

It's more that there aren't any better alternatives for new people especially if they want to do credit card purchases or ACH transfer instead of bank wire than it is a favorite site

Getting into a couple alts is a good way to round things out
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:22:48
You'll want to use:
 1. a web wallet like Blockchain.info if it's just a small amount and you want quicker access
 2. a desktop/mobile wallet like Jaxx for mid-long term storage (you don't want to send out of here a lot because their fees to transfer out are a little on the high side)
 3. a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S for the longterm cold storage (a paper wallet can also accomplish this but personally I plan to favor hardware over paper for long term storage)

You are able to access them. I use that site and the mobile app for small amounts I may want to transact with in the short term

In the same boat. Coinbase should have my ACH transfer done just in time to buy at the ATH. Spent the whole dip looking at deposit "pending"
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:34:50
I think it is pretty disturbing that they would up and close your account like that. Sad thing is, I don't think that is the first time I heard of something like that happening. Worries me about using them but don't think I have seen a lot of other options in the US besides Gemini (closed out my account during verification process) and GDAX but I wonder if Coinbase closes you out, GDAX would do the same since the two entities are connected
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:59:29
Correction would be 9.5k to maybe 9.4k or 9.3k so if you're hoping for a dip into the 8k's because you didn't buy in when you should, it's not going to happen. Right now is the dip. See you at 10k-plus

Coinbase has fees higher than other alternatives. I have started with Coinbase but will honestly be getting away from it. A fee to buy, then a fee to transfer anywhere like wallet or exchange. If you have say $20 to spend, it's $1.49 to buy and $1.49 to move anywhere and losing $3 in fees isn't horrible per se but it adds up if you buy often or if you do larger amounts
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:35:05
It's why I'm waiting until afterwards to do a larger buy. For now, smaller amounts weekly on Dollar Cost Averaging
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:21:13
Thank you so much for explaining that. Sounds like I need to practice doing limit orders. I plan on getting LTC for that because it's pretty cheap, price doesn't change a lot, it's on Coinbase, and it's not a big deal to me if I lose a little bit of LTC while practicing because I am by no means an experienced day-trader
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:37:13
Never done it yet but personally reading up on it and interacting with people directly is what has me super leery personally
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:51:22
Wire transfer may be a different story but with GDAX, still waiting on the 4 to 5 business days for the pending deposit to clear. USD wallet is $0 until that happens. Be mindful of Gemini, I saw a lot of posts about them just suddenly closing people's accounts. I created one, couldn't get my bank to connect, tried to go through the verification process and got an email that they couldn't create an account for me and closed it right out. Can't log in or nothing. I didn't transfer anything there so there's that at least
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:09:29
When I started out doing this whole thing I figured out Jaxx is not what you want to use for moving coin in and out to do transactions, due to the fees. I use Jaxx as my endpoint until I finally decide to get a Ledger Nano S. If I have BTC I intend to use on exchanges or whatever but not right then and there, I keep it with Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:29:20
The catch I have heard is the value of the forked currency would go down pretty quickly and would start low to begin with. If you have 1 BTC at $6500 and get 1 B2X, it does not mean the value of the 1 B2X is automatically the same as the 1 BTC right off the bat. I'm no authority though, it's just the impression I got from other comments/posts on this topic
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:44:44
Thanks. I use GDAX and Bittrex. Plan on using GDAX for my LTC to BTC trading and Bittrex for my BTC to altcoin trading

I use Jaxx and I am a new user. Sure there might be better, but as a new person, it has worked out fine for me
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:26:46
Thanks for the link. Looking over that, it appears that the wise thing to do would be, at least in my case, to stay with funds being in either Blockchain.info or Coinbase as a wallet and return to something like Jaxx afterwards based on if they went with the split or not
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:04:26
One thing I have been looking at myself is the thought of buying Ethereum since it's a lower price, then trading that on an Exchange for BTC. I did this a little bit and it "appears" to maybe work ok but I haven't crunched the math solidly enough to claim that's a solid way to do it for others or if it would work long term for me at least
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:06:52
When you sign up for Coinbase, you also get a GDAX account. Do all your account verifications on Coinbase first. When that is done, it makes (for me at least) the GDAX verification easier. Once you're all set, ACH transfer money from your bank account to Coinbase (takes a few business days). Once Coinbase says your fiat currency is there, log into GDAX and you can deposit your fiat from Coinbase, takes a few seconds. Once your fiat is on GDAX, do a Limit Buy of whatever amount of BTC you want. Once you have the BTC, you can move it to Coinbase or wherever else you want. That method is very low on fees. I should know, dropped about $100 in various fees figuring this all out
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:23:38
I've got 2 in my town. One is in an area I don't trust in broad daylight, the other is in a place I drive past or near at least a couple/few times a month so it'd be an easy weekly stop. I would say if a BATM is a special trip you'd have to make outside of 20/30 miles, the fees and gas don't justify it
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:35:35
I used some of Blockchain.info and some of Jaxx
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:27:15
The key is, though, you should try to do your buys or sells as the 'Limit' option to get the best rate on fees
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:23:33
Unless I am mistaken, the question the Ledger asks is difficult to answer right now because Segwit hasn't happened yet and we don't know if it would become the standard. I have BTC on Jaxx that I plan to move at least some to my Ledger Nano S when I get it and I honestly don't know what the right answer to that question will be or if you only ever have one chance to decide on your Ledger
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:10:08
Haven't tried localbitcoins yet but I did check out an ATM in my area. Been crunching some numbers and basically so far it seems like an ATM isn't bad if you wanted to do like $20 and at 12% (for the one in my area) it's not bad for what I plan to do as a weekly visit. $20 a week at a $2.40 fee direct to my wallet is lower than doing the same on like Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:34:44
At some point in this thread you will get a response that says "don't use an online wallet". That being said, if you want to have a small amount in an online wallet that may be a little more readily accessible to you there is Blockchain.info that I so far have not had any problem with. With that one, you do own the private keys
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:48:39
This is going to sound like a stupid question but basically that ATM is charging a 12% fee for buying Bitcoin? So if I put in $20 cash then the Bitcoin amount I get is equivalent to USD $20 minus the ATM 12% fee?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:54:19
I see some, sure. There's just so much going on that if I personally had $1000 to spend, I am waiting until the dust settles later in November. For now, I will chip away at it with DCA
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:31:00
This is what I do as well and it's great for keeping overall fees in this whole space low
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:17:53
Congrats on getting that. Hope it works out well
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:26:33

Seeing this question asked a lot in several threads and it seems to be the one question no one will answer. From what little bit I have seen in other threads, the BTC needs to be in Coinbase. Not sure where else it could or could not be to get it
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:04:46
I started just recently as well and in my opinion, Coinbase has worked fine for me. That was mostly on suggestion from a friend who got me into this who is doing pretty ok already so I figure if I start anywhere, I am going to copy him until I get good and comfortable with stuff before doing things on my own
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:59:21
Ok so the way to do it is buy Bitcoin on an Exchange, move it all to a personal wallet, buy more when it's low and sell when it's high. Leaving the Bitcoin to sit on an Exchange to fluctuate is not the way to go, based on what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:54:36
I just started out recently and although I picked up a bit researching, testing, and playing around, I lost most of that in Coinbase fees. Personally waiting to get verified on Gemini (2 week wait) and found a Bitcoin ATM in my area. Coinbase is going to get used very sparingly at least for me. Heavy hitters may not be too worried about Coinbase fees but if you're trying to navigate with smaller amounts like that or just starting out, their fees will claim most of your money
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:16:47

I regret never knowing of Bitcoin up to this past July/August when the price skyrocketed. Been thinking of all the other stuff I wasted money on when I see the growth chart of BTC on its path from $100 to $6000. Not going to be one of those that gave up and then in the future ask "why didn't I stay in during the path from $6000 to whatever?" so I would say keep at it

For selling, not buying
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:45:06
Thank you for the response, and I get that part. But if I'm continuously sending all bitcoin to my own wallet, they're not losing or making money. For example, I have $10 of bitcoin on an Exchange and if I leave it sit for a week, that value could be $8 or $12 who knows. If I put $10 of bitcoin in my own wallet then after a week it is the same $10 in my personal wallet, in a sense, right?

1. Do the verification with DL. I did, I trust it, that's me though
2. Do the ACH or Wire Transfer from your bank to Coinbase in the amounts your able/wanting to. Once ready, log into the GDAX account you get when you signed up with Coinbase, deposit your fiat from Coinbase to GDAX, then do a Limit Buy of BTC using your fiat on GDAX. After that, transfer your BTC to where you want it. That's what I have done which is real low on fees
