For who wondering about why xrp is skyrocketing right now : more than 50% of current xrp volume is in korean exchange. bithumb, coinone, korbit + upbit(upbit is not shown in coinmarketcap now)
Now, every korean media is literally praising xrp. Like 'xrp's time', 'forget btc! xrp is going', and so on. On the other hand, they are continuously saying that 'bitcoin is bubble' , 'Does bitcoin finally crashed? xrp's rapid progress' and blabla.

I 'invested' in bitcoin because I believe that it will be the future currency, instead of the fiat. I will never "sell" it. I'll just use bitcoin, when enough infrastructure is built.

They don't know what bitcoin is, they don't want to do any research or study about bitcoin, and they don't want to see others 'get rich' by bitcoin. Hence the only choice for them is continuously saying that "bitcoin is bubble" and so on. That's all.

No. You just need to connect it to your PC to use your hardware wallet again.

Hello guys, I'm definitely noob who bought my first bitcoin in Nov 30 this year and keep hodling since then. And I don't have any plan to sell my bitcoin. I'm doing my own research nowadays about bitcoin and some altcoins, but I can't understand why xrp is uprising now. Do you guys have any idea for this? I don't think every alts is shit, but is xrp that good? Yes, I think ETH, LTC and some alts are good, and considering to invest some money to them too, but..

Well, I'll HODL. I don't know if this dip means "Game Over" or just correction or something, but anyway. If bitcoin goes to $0, then I'll be dissapointed, but I'll much more dissapointed if I do panic selling my bitcoin and see it skyrockets next month.
