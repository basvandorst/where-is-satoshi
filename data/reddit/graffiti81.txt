The people that make up that market.

Gox is old news now. However, the next guy, and the guy after that. And the little guy gets screwed.

So what? Unless there's actionable laws, nothing will change. 
UL or whatever you want to have watching the market will do what it can to lower risk. That said, there's always somebody who is smarter and can game the system. 
Let's say your auditors say "Well, this market system is the safest out there." Great, lots of people invest. 
But then some asshat finds a way to game the system. And you know as well as I do there's always the person who does it. They crash the price of the currency while making a ton of money for themselves. Everyone else gets screwed. 
Your auditors look at the situation and go "Huh, hadn't thought of that. That guy's pretty smart." 
And then what? There's no way the person responsible can be put in jail. There's no retribution. He didn't do anything illegal since there are no laws. There's nothing to stop the next smart guy from doing the same thing.
It's great if you're the smartest guy on the block. But you're not. Neither am I, and neither is anybody here at no matter how much some might like to think they are. 
There's no deterrent to make people think twice about screwing the market if they can't go to jail or have their money taken away. What are you going to do? Sue them for being immoral? You'll get laughed out of court. 
They were just smarter than you and you lose. And you lose all the time because you aren't the smartest.
That's not the world I want to live in. At all.

And do what once insider trading is found? Most free marketeers don't want regulation at all. So what is an auditor going to do? Write a strongly worded letter disapproving of insider trading but ending with "Well, that's the free market though, carry on"?
