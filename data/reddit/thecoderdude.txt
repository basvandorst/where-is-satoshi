I think [this] hits the nail on the head.

That made my day! I originally interpreted the fee structure as 0.99% to accept the Bitcoin payment and 2.69% to transfer the funds in USD to a bank account. It's still slightly more expensive for me on US-based orders since PayPal offers a sort of volume discount on their fees, but at least now it should be on par with the fees associated with international PayPal orders where a currency conversion is involved.
Originally I asserted that PayPal would be cheaper than BitPay given the discount fee structure offered by PayPal for volume processing, but I need to correct that statement. BitPay is indeed less expensive when you take into account the additional $0.30 that PayPal charges, which I hadn't.

If it looks like too much of the pie is going towards fees then it'll definitely be prudent to explore other options as volume increases through Bitcoin.

I'll have to see how everything works out with this setup but I'm open to trying different strategies.

Surprisingly it's the opposite. When all is said in done, the processing fees associated with converting BTC to USD put it as a more expensive option than PayPal (from the merchant's point of view, not the customer).
Should note that this is specific to BitPay, the processor I went with.

It's not as cool as rolling your own solution, granted. ;)
BitPay is great at processing transactions quickly and accurately so in this instance the benefits of using a processor will be stability and customer satisfaction.
