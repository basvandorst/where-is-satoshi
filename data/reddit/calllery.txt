I'm currently in Banguwangi on Java, heading to Bali in a few days. They've banned reddit too but I don't see that stopping us ;)

Am I correct in saying that how this works is that you can create a "virtual power plant" by paying users to relinquish their control of large power appliances in the home, and dropping a great amount of demand at certain times, as per an agreement with a power supplier?

It's a very interesting business to be in, I'm studying energy systems engineering and I was told a little bit about it in one of my modules, which deals with Smart Grid technology.

If its anything, its moot rather than muffled to the point of silence. I'm sorry for the grammar nazism.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:24:15
I really like the idea of Demand Response.
I'm interested in working in that field after university. I graduate with a degree in energy systems engineering this year and hope to pursue further studies in software development because I see a future in which those two fields are heavily combined. I'm interested to know if you'd agree with me.

So its better having the big companies pushing money into the back pocket of the politicians while whispering in their ear is it? Theyre called donations. Give if you want.

What I don't get is why if the dev knows that doesn't (s)he create 101 million of a coin, premine 1 million and release the coin as being not premined? Is there a way for the users to find out?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:05:51
The coins that don't get any recognition aren't the reason. If a coin fails because of lack of adoption then it shouldn't have existed.  The person you spoke to isn't interested in educating themselves obviously.

You don't lose money. Other coins bring more users to the original cryptocurrency than they take away. Most coins start off being traded through bitcoin to begin with. The code was made open source for a reason.

I think there will be an apparently well meaning individual from central America who generates a story about Scotlands struggle for financial independence from the pound, and will create kiltcoin, mine half of it and create months of buzz around a huge distribution of the coin to every member of the country. That'll jack up the price which will then plummet either due to everyone cashing out or the developer selling them for his own gain. Poor kiltcoin

It sure will, but only when a technology replaces it like cryptos are replacing fiat. Some biometric based value transfer, like in time or something

My logic is that a planck should be 1/10 of a satoshi because you can't displace satoshi from where he is and a planck length is the smallest distance possible. I joke i joke, i know the technicalities
