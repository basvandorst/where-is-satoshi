My guess is a couple of reasons:
One, crypto has become boring within popular culture. Its interest over time (per Google search volume) has fallen sharply since mid December. Right now its back to mid-November levels. 
Second, people in the know about crypto are waiting to see what happens with Tether. Tether matters because Tether may have been fake currency used to buy millions of bitcoins. If Tether doesn't have reserves to match the number of coins it printed, the audacity of the fraud boggles the mind.

It is down from its near $20k high, sure. But I would argue that the price stability it is showing (hovering in the 10-12k range), is better than wild swings in value.

I'm not sure you have a good understanding of banking. Payment processing is a small fraction of what banks do.  
And, in your post, you mention that "blockchain will change the future". But Bitcoin isn't blockchain. It makes use of the methodology, in both beautiful and flawed ways. Bitcoin's rise and maturation is a living case study on how blockchain may work in finance. 
Bitcoin wasn't able to scale to be used as a medium for massive amounts of small transactions, as it was originally intended. The idea of it being some sort of store of value is an intriguing one, but its volatility is making this an upstream fight. LN may help bitcoin regain its status as a transactional currency. It is yet to be seen. Using it as a currency AND holding coins for the future are two use cases that are in conflict with one another.
When Bitcoin becomes stable (and boring), then more people than enthusiasts may see it as a medium of value storage. 
Whatever happens, Bitcoin is a marvel. It introduced the idea of blockchains, which is now being applied across supply chain, pharmaceuticals, etc.    
On edit: Addressing governments, the public sector is managed by individual people. Some don't understand bitcoin, some are charlatans, and some specialize in areas like public health. You are discounting the fact that some of the most talented scientists, economists and others work in the public sector. They understand bitcoin. You or I don't have some kind of hidden knowledge that is off-limits to people who work in government.

Your opinion is as valid as anyone else’s. No one really knows what the growth (or decline) trajectory will be.
My opinion is fractional ownership of bitcoin isn’t as satisfying as having a whole coin. The ability to buy 1 bitcoin is out of the reach of most. I think this will be an anchor around bitcoin’s neck over the long term. But that’s just me.

It's times like this that make clear how important it is to have diversification in assets and investment vehicles. Bitcoin should be part of an overall investment strategy.
Especially since bitcoin is a speculative investment. It's a technology demonstration of this radical new idea of a blockchain and decentralized commerce. It isn't *the* blockchain; blockchain methodology is something that can be applied to currencies, supply chains, etc.
   
Having a diverse portfolio of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto, etc. gives you a hedge against bubbles. It's not perfect, but it's the best hedge that the individual investor has.

The pool of coins is relatively small compared to most securities. That means its easier for people holding large shares of coins to manipulate the market.
Plus, bitcoin is measured against conventional currencies (the dollar, euro, etc.). Currency trading has always been a complicated and volatile activity.
And if it's a store of value, Bitcoin is more of a commodity play. Futures speculation is part and parcel of commodity trading. This only compounds the issues with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:35:46
That could be a factor. Or it could be the transaction fees rising. Or the time it takes to get authorized to buy from the major exchanges.

@_date: 2017-12-29 17:32:34
The accounting implications with LN scramble my brain. By my reading of how LN works, will there be two taxable events for funds that get put into the payout transaction balance sheet?
Or, is the transaction considered a single taxable event, because the LN network layer acts as a clearing-house mechanism that eventually gets reflected in the blockchain?  
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:19:39
There is one more question that I have:
Is spending Bitcoin (that has risen in value from the price you paid to purchase it) using LN considered a taxable event as defined by the IRS?

@_date: 2018-06-29 13:38:49
It will be good in the short term. Bitcoin needs another news boost. Mainstream media coverage played a large part in the December value increase. Facebook getting into the game will create a new spike in coverage. 
Right now most of the reporting about Bitcoin are two second blurbs on CNBC, random people writing articles on Medium, and “creators” shouting on YouTube,
People that ascribe a metaphysical dimension to Bitcoin are a breed apart from the average consumer. They believe Bitcoin is so powerful that it will sweep away entire financial systems. In reality, it’s nothing more than an argument analogous to Marx saying that people will one day awaken and realize the value of their labor. The bourgeoisie will be toppled and the proletariat (bitcoin true believers) will remove the chains from their shoulders as they welcome the new world order.

“Subtly drop Bitcoin into the conversation”? That sounds manipulative. Why not just say what you mean?

That's a false question. I don't care whether bitcoin comes up in a conversation or not. It's one of many things that I am interested in. People know I'm a geek. If they read something about bitcoin and have a question about it, I'll gladly have a conversation. If the topic naturally arises, then that's fine, too.
But preparing my remarks for a conversation beforehand is something I would do for a networking event, perhaps.
And, not everyone believes the same things as you. I don't believe bitcoin will supplant the central banking system. It will stay in its own lane while the rest of the finance world continues. Finance is so much more complex that settling payments. That's a big part, but only a piece of global finance. 
I also believe that Bitcoin is propelled by hype; there's a correlation between price and media coverage. People get bored and move on to the next thing. This is not negative. Bitcoin's exchange rate to USD tends to be more stable when people aren't talking about it constantly.

Publicity — aka hype — also correlates to increases in value. 
Even when the hype is negative. It is the volume of mainstream media articles, broadcast news coverage and conference keynotes that correlate with bitcoin price increases. 
Right now, there isn’t much hype about bitcoin outside of the enclaves of people who breathlessly follow bitcoin news. In other words, it is not in front of the average person’s face and therefore out of mind. 
The run up to $19k was the best thing that could have happened for the people who intended to cash out anyway. But for the currency itself, it is a negative part of the story. New people who would have otherwise invested in bitcoin are scared away by the multi-fold decrease in value from last year.

Good question. It depends on if people who are holding bitcoin need to cash it in for USD in order to pay for food, housing, healthcare and whatever other vital needs they have.
So, I guess the answer is, if you can afford to live your life and not cash in on your bitcoin, then why not invest in it? The worst that could happen is that you lose your money. And right now, bitcoin's value is measured in USD, which is a dirty fiat currency. 
So, if fiat goes bad, like a moldy orange, then bitcoin is kind of like an apple in the same fruit bowl: it will slowly grow mold, but at a different pace. And then you may end up with penicillin or a sore tummy. Who really knows?
Does that answer your question?

It's not just bitcoin buyers who are feeling a pinch right now. People who have 401ks invested in mutual funds are also seeing loses in their portfolios. And everyone reacts differently.
While bitcoin isn't analogous to a mutual fund, the psychology driving reaction to loses could be thought of as similar.
In the case of mutual funds in retirement accounts, the advice (for people who are many years from retiring) is to wait through downturns because the market will eventually recover.
In my household, my husband is obsessed with looking at our retirement portfolio and is stressed about the market. For me, I don't look at it that often, other than for rebalancing, because the dips don't eat away at me. 
Everyone is different. Some people aren't able to look away from the wildly fluctuating bitcoin price. It is a compulsion they can't control, even though looking makes them feel worse. While others believe that the dips are temporary and the value will rise at the end of the day. 
Since I'm not a worrier, my advice is to not look at the price so often if you sincerely believe that bitcoin is the currency of the future and that this is a temporary dip.
