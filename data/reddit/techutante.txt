You are deluding yourself. US exchanges match Chinese price gains and losses because a number of people have access to both, and if they are out of balance a profit can be made by moving coins from one to the other, fees or no.

Buy one now, if price drops 50 bucks, buy another one. Basically any time is the best time because it's a long term investment. Some people think they will be 10000 or more a coin, and they have already been 1200 a coin on Coinbase, not counting MtGox.

@_date: 2016-04-08 16:35:35
That literally only works with software and bitcoin payments though. You can't force someone to mail you a pair of socks because you have a semi-anonymous ledger contract that's says socks for .00003 Btc and is co-signed with 2 random names. You need some sort of external accountability. If it's a reputation system, then it's that enforcing the contract and not the block-chain having anything to do with it.

Coinbase is essentially backed by the IRS though. Since you have to pay taxes on bitcoins, they are finances assets, you can write the loss of them off against you tax earnings. You will also be able to sue to retrieve them in US courts, vs the monkey overseas courts for most sites. I know our court system isn't the best for personal criminal issues, you have to admit we are set up right to sue for damages.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:57:51

I agree about ads, but about 80% of the Web is derivative these days so I don't want to pay for it in any case. Why should we support 1000 pages that just copy-paste from the same news feed ticker. If one of them charges, you would just go somewhere else. Heck, the news headline in most cases tells you what you need to know. Sure, some stuff is worthy of support, Web comics are pretty unique, dating sites if you are single, people who do in depth analysis of games and hardware-that you enjoy their perspective. I tend to support sites like that directly though. I share them on my own feeds which gets them views from people who don't care about ads, and I buy books and T-shirts from them. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:25:06
I've spent considerably more than that on coinbase. They are fine if you can get verified and don't mind waiting a week for your coins. (But not amazing due to those constraints.)

It's not evolution, it's merely adaption. The already possess the genetics to do it, they just only express those genes when the opportunity arises.

That wouldn't work at all as Microsoft, and other tech companies like it, offer flex time and work from home hours, flexible daytime break hours, plus that sounds like an OrwellIan nightmare. 
Also, if you are a business you want to pay as few taxes as possible. You want money to be in your account as long as possible to collect interest. Plus have you ever tried to get a refund from the government? They would sit on it for months at the very least. Most companies don't really know how much time they will have to pay taxes on unless everyone is salaried, which is a different can of worms. (Easier for payroll though.)

This sort of thing is the inevitable result of a traceable blockchain and a disruptive currency. It is likely there's a government department in every major country gearing up a similar operation. We probably shouldn't like it, but we shouldn't be surprised either. People were doing this on the amateur level for years following various hacks and personal attacks. And with Malware that locks your PC and asks for bitcoin growing in popularity, perhaps they will actually catch some real criminals as well as average Joe's who are trying to avoid taxes or divorce attorneys or whatever.

You are a whiney entitled cry baby apparently. People who expect everyone to be nice to them for existing are in for a shock in real life. I don't feel superior to anyone, we all equally have google. If you, or anyone you feel like you are 'sticking up for' want the answer to a question that has been answered 20 thousand times, it's all right there already.

This is why day traders of bitcoin in the US should sweat a little at this news. They will ding every short term profit trade you made as capital gains. Sold and bought on the swing with a 20 dollar profit per coin? If you didnt hold them for a year, first in first out, you pay extra tax.

Banks have done it to me directly. Believe it or not, but keeping track of small amounts of funds is a tricky job. Wire transfers can get caught up similar to Ach in KYC laws, have technical glitches, etc. They haven't been responsive over the weekend yes, like most monetary institutions. Probably it would be sorted in a day or two anyway, but you wanted to come cry to jump the line here instead of just chilling. Boo Hoo.

Boohoo see previous point. Shit can take weeks to move in real financial markets. I know for a fact it can take a week to put money in your account sometimes on Coinbase.

You shouldn't be investing if you panic over 800 dollars taking an extra day or two longer to clear than you desire. Financial transactions take at least 3 to 5 business days usually, quit being a whiney bitch.

They are the largest, oldest, still standing, not yet* hacked US trading site. I've bought there for over 4 years now. They used to be pretty slow, but they seem to have thier shit together now. They do want 5 kinds of ID and a Blood sample to get any real buy limits, and they are super protective about strange transactions, changing your IP address, and out of country users. But I think that adds to the not having been hacked aspect more than it hurts the 2 people a week who come here to cry that they have to wait 3 days over a weekend to get cash in their account and so they missed the swing because they weren't ready.

Coinbase has over 14 million accounts. The ones that wash up here are usually special cases and are often out of country or doing something that causes normal financial scrutiny, or they are straight up impatient.

Much of the job could be automated or digitized,  but people aren't any more accurate or prompt digitally, and having the opportunity to fail at your job daily rather than weekly or monthly with turning in time and expenses just increases frustration on all sides. Obviously if everyone is salaried and forced to make all expenses on a specific card or RFID this is easier. Many of us know, however, being salaried isn't all its cracked up to be.

Okay, I'm an extremely long term lurker but this write up made me sign up just so could comment. Speaking as the payroll clerk of a 50-70 person "small" business, I can say that in the majority of businesses daily paychecks are impossible, and bitcoin has nothing to do with it. 
Sure, ACH takes two days,  but that's not limiting factor in being paid daily. Some places, IT companies like Microsoft, make you enter your time in a Web browser internal network application. With that setup I used to get paid weekly as a temp. But the majority of businesses use Paper time cards still. (Which most people are really bad at turning in.) So, this part could be improved In some cases, but a large% of employees are incapable of using a computer effectively, and would not turn in digital time cards on the regular either. 
In any case, assuming you have digital time cards, someone still needs to manually double-check that everyone has entered their time for the day-week-month. Then they have to process any deductions that happened the day they happened, which could be room and board or commissary items (Smokes or Food or Work Gloves-safety gear not included by the company).
Then they need to process taxes on every person, but those taxes are dependent on certain monthly income limits. You need to know when to stop taking unemployment taxes and Medicare taxes (but not social security tax unless you hit 200k a year or whatever that super high end is now). Then, and this is an important part for businesses, you have to pay those taxes + plus the employer added taxes on top of it, Immediately. 
So a recap of what daily paychecks would do to make my life a living hell- Every time card would have to be turned in promptly at the end of the day (And either be hand inputted as I have to now, or digitized and entered by the employee daily). I would nend to know every expense an employee has, down to the penny, basically immediately as it happened. I would need to queue up 50+ deposits (presumably of bitcoin, since that's the context here). And then I would have to be paying Payroll tax on those paychecks EVERY SINGLE DAY, or at least every Wed and Friday for all checks issued. 
This doesn't take into effect the cost of the physical  checks I have to print to run payrolls, or the time it would take for me to inefficiently run your wages every day when it barely takes longer to do it a week or 4 at a time. Or that the company itself only gets paid twice a month for the work IT does. (Causing the company to have to hold large sums of cash in non-interest bearing accounts daily to handle the turn-over.) 
TL/DR - Every payroll clerk would quit if you made them do payroll daily, as many of them such as myself have to wear multiple hats. I also answer phones and do phone interviews, pay the standard bills (Which for many businesses are 2-3 times the size of payroll in a month.), deal with advertising, stock company supplies, deal with (Many!) government agencies, and cope with employee problems as they come up. (Not to mention the gofor duties, mail checking, etc).

I only read the first couple paragraphs of that, but it's clear that what he means is that the whole security system we currently depend on to make us safe online is a sham, and that sufficiently intelligent and well funded hackers are poking holes everywhere.

Dude, you really have no clue what you are talking about. I don't even have a clue what you are trying to trying to say. I have no debt, which is why I have no cash. I'm considerably older than you I can tell, you are trying to give advice to teens about how to invest, and I'm talking about 26,000 dollars in bitcoin investment. And that's not even my primary investments. Have you heard of diversification? Did you know that bitcoins are not tax free? I have a broker, I have multiple bank accounts. I bought a car in cash in December. What I'm saying is that 10 dollars a month doesn't interest me anymore, even if it turns into 20 or 30. You are just as likely to lose money buying every month as you are to buy in any one month. Bitcoin could fail completely, it could drop 60% in a day, what I'm saying is that I'm at the limit of money I'm going to put into it % wise unless it goes super high and I can sell some at a high enough margin to justify paying the taxes on it.
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:37:12
I have to wonder too. Who could pass up the chance to liquidate even a little of that at 1000 a coin? Dude would have to either be already fantastically rich, a zealot of unimaginable proportions, some sort of Zen master, or dead.

I bet he was stress eating leading up to his eventual getting caught for fraud. Now it's all out of his hands, stress free, did his time, he's free as a bird with no worries and 100+ bitcoin stashed away in a rainy day fund. No doubt he was anonymously mining on the side using gox computers.

Once the money is in Coinbase you can make instant trades. The mandatory ACH period for transfer applies at the very least to all US exchanges. If you sell into your USD wallet that money is available to repurchase coins on the spot. I tried it out when the price hit 770 and I sold some off, then rebought at 730. Shouldn't have tried to catch the knife though, could have bought a lot at like 600 instead 2 days later.

That's not what the trading volume on Bitcoinwisdom.com suggests.
@_date: 2016-07-26 16:51:54
It's the same as a stock last I read. Meaning if you hold it for more than a year you owe a lower % on earnings. Bitcoin earnings are based on first in, first out. So if you buy 5 coins at different prices, say 200 300 400 500 and 600, and when you sell them the price per coin is currently 400 dollars, then you owe on 200 profit, 100 profit, owe nothing, take 100 loss, and take 200 loss, which would be a wash and you would owe no capital gains on bitcoins specifically. 
But since capital gains is a shared class of asset, you also have to figure in if you sold some stocks or other long term investment assets. If you lose 500 dollars on underselling bitcoins, but make 500 dollars off of stocks then you can wash that too.

I think they have people all over the world, and they wanted to get off the dollar as a standard. Then the streamer can take any world currency as filtered though the Bits. However, they charge a heafty transaction fee for the privilege. Not sure if it's worse or better than paypal.

@_date: 2016-05-21 17:32:58
Yeah, so what? You and like 5 million people have a better rate locally, so it's too expensive? I don't buy that. Some places charge  .50 cents to use a debit card to buy a sandwich. One of my banks that I don't have local access to where I live will charge me as much as 12 dollars to take money out of someone else's ATM. .05 cents is a lot if you are fucking around with pennies, but I don't really think Bitcoin is in its prime for buying really cheap stuff. However, 5 cents to send my friend 800 dollars to build me a computer is quite nice. How much does that cost on Paypal, like 20 bucks?
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:51:36
As the IRS has declared BTC as a capital asset, if they go bankrupt you can write them off your taxes if necessary. And if a company is based in a US jurisdiction then you can sue them and reclaim your funds from their backers.

The reminds me of when I sent 5k to UBS for a high interest saving account. They wouldn't credit my account until I told them where the money came from. That was 15 years ago, give or take.

It all depends on when you got in. If you only did at 2-300, it shot up. If you did at 600, you are seeing some profit but several stocks did better. And if you paid more, then you probably are at a paper loss and are impatiently waiting for the next bubble to cash out and get a lower cost basis.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:45:39
I think that vision is unnecessary cumbersome. Short term rental or lease is still easier than fully transferring ownership for a two week road trip, say. We already have a successful rental car market, I don't really see that changing. Seamless handout of ownership would be a nice improvement though. Right now buying a car involves several trips to the DMV for everyone to feel safe about it. We could just do away with the DMV entirely as well, that would be a universal plus I think.

No one has yet to name the perfect exchange, I've been in this sub (mostly lurking) for 4 years and people have whined about every one of them. Further, half of the suggested replacements have been hacked by now. Kraken, Circle, Gemini? All have KYC regulations tied to them, slow money transfer issues, and won't let you buy very much. 200 dollar limits are for children. Can one person in this whole 200k person sub suggest a way to move 10 grand in bitcoins into cash and back again (in seconds) without any of that?

That's really not a zinger dude, just crying on the Internet. They will resolve your issue in due time, after they resolve the other issues ahead of you in line. There's a whiney post about coinbase on here every day, and most of them are due to impatience. Not one person, to my knowledge, had ever not gotten their money back or their issue taken care of eventually. You just want to jump to the head of the line because you feel that you 100 dollars is more important than anyone else's sum of money. I see it every day in normal life. Especially since it was a holiday when you shit your pants over it. Many people take the whole week of the 4th off and they are likely short staffed. If I had to guess, I'd say I've been using message boards longer than you have been alive, so your point has as much sense as your entitlement to immediate service ahead of others.
