Wouldn’t the bank freeze funds if they deem it suspicious?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:06:09
Yup still trying to figure it out. I think a lawyer would be my best option although pricey 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:44:31
What if they were purchased with cash via LocalBitcoins and you have no records of the purchase? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:18:04
Closed mind. You have the same attitude towards proven technology that fiat only people have towards bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:56:46
Won’t the bank freeze your account if they see that large of a transaction coming in. Or convict you of structuring if withdrawn in small increments since coinbase only allows you to cash out a limited amount. Sorry but I’ve been searching for info on how to go about this and can’t seem to find an answer.

I know you’re fifteen but it’s time to learn to search for information by yourself rather than expecting it to be spoon fed to you. Self education will take you a long way

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:34
We are in still the growing phase. Hopefully in a year or so we can have users spread out over several trustworthy exchanges and not just one conglomerate that thinks it’s above its customers and can do what they please for they’re own gain. Competition is good.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:04
*A.S.S. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:20:06
Completely decentralized. There are multiple exchanges unlike in 2013 that drive competition. If Coinbase, the largest exchange, were to get hacked, highly unlikely but possible. Btc would still be able to recover but would go through a down period that would last several months until another major exchange took its place. 
Most exchanges provide live support. Support is slow right because of the recent surge but all the money will support the growth and competence of these companies. By the end of next year I expect several exchanges that will be very fast and to have amazon like support.

Seen this happen twice already. Clear manipulation. BCH will get pumped, btc drops in price, followed by BCH plummeting while BTC reaches new ATH. Rinse and repeat. Rookies are getting scared but btc vets will ride it out.

Yea but those thousands of bitcoins lost in the vaults of the internet forever can only make bitcoin that much more rare and valuable.

What coins do you see potential in? I see LTC, ETH, and monero as pretty solid investments at the moment

You’re right. I’m way too drunk and it’s way too late. Gravity is a strange thing though, makes you think we’re all just living in a bubble that could pop at any moment... kinda like bitcoin

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:36:40
True but you could cash out 36k every year to avoid that. Not sure if that would be tax evasion or tax avoidance (which is legal). Could also count as structuring. At the end of the day your best bet is to get a certified account to do all the dirty and complex work for you and lawyer to represent you in case the IRS audits you.

You’re assuming, so no, it is not inevitable to answer your question but very possible if you look at history as an indicator of the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:33:16
So how do we know when the next pump is? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:59
This ain’t even the moon bruh. 10k is the space ship still on the surface of the earth preparing to launch. 100k is just leaving the stratosphere. 200k is halfway to the moon. 400k is the moon. 
$1,000,000,000,000,000 is the edge of this universe and bitcoin will leave this dimension and become conscious of itself and commit suicide unable to cope with the fact that he is merely a product and experiment of human greed. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:52:09
I think it’ll be a mixture of both. 10k will direct a lot of attention and coverage on bitcoin possibly attracting new buyers, while others will see it as a milestone and cash out. 
However people who have been hodling for years know 10k could be just the beginning of this wild ride and keep hodling. I expect a small dip after 10k but I don’t believe it will last long before it can stay above 10k and keep climbing.

I think the two best options right now are either holding and waiting until this blows over or short the market like you did. There are several different ways you can lose in this situation; if BTC somehow rises substantially before August 1st or if it falls even more when you buy and you panic and sell everything.
Anybody can see that we are headed on a downwards trend in the coming weeks. The only question is how far will it plummet until it hits rock bottom and bounces back up again? And, how long will it take to jump back up in price? These are questions no one knows the answer to, but I believe the fluctuations in price are inevitable but the time frame is what is so unpredictable and trying to play god in this situation is no different than participating in degenerate gambling. But... degenerate gambling can be very profitable if Lady Luck is on your side. Best of luck.
