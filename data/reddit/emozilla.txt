Nitrogen is basically everything a book should be. Cannot recommend enough

Interesting statistic I saw: the computing power needed to calculate the collision is equal to about 3 seconds of the hashing power of the Bitcoin network

We know how much slower double SHA-2 is compared to SHA-1, mut tbh it doesn't matter when making order-of-magnitude estimates like this

Shrug, I hold BTC and some alts. Bitcoin isn't The One True Savior. I'm currently 75% BTC 25% alts. Realize that there are alts that aren't simply Bitcoin copies but actually have different technology and attempt to serve different purposes.

What's to stop them staging some sort of true 51% attack on the regular chain? Start denying transactions, double spending their own coins, etc. Then, BTU becomes the only "working" coin...

Look at Charles Schwab Bank. 0.1% on savings and they pay all ATM fees

I wonder about this too... the Office Space "fractions of a penny" thing, but this time they just go to no man's land. I guess gold is the same way more or less, but we still haven't depleted mining it during the development of Western civilization vs. the mine drying up in a couple years i.r.t BTC. 
Imagine if BTC were to take off as a global currency; those 8ths decimal places will be worth a lot.

FWIW I bought 1 BTC at 780 and it was 900 when delivered but Coinbase still honored the buy at 780

Venezuela's government is constantly blaming capitalists for purposefully sabotaging what would otherwise be a golly great economy

It means that someone thinks they will make a profit by locking in being able to buy BTC at $1000 3 months from now. Essentially, they are betting the price will be greater than this, and thus they will be buying at a discount.

We already have it, the problem is just at the on and off ramps ;)

Use Gemini's daily auction. No slippage and they work great with banks

I believe the ability to ignore transactions under a certain fee is a useful anti-spam tactic

This is not necessarily true. If cash doesn't work, it's unlikely that a fully unfettered internet will either. Someone's gotta pay for those undersea cables.
Remember, most large cities are only a few weeks away from running out of food, and if the global financial system has collapsed the capital needed to move food and fuel into these cities will be non-existent. I'm all for Bitcoin growing, but a true global financial crisis that causes first world nations to default on the sovereign debt is likely not the way we want to go about it.

This is a transparent bait and switch -- a real compromise would tie the two upgrades together.

I'm on board, as long as SegWit is directly tied to 2MB. Can't have one without the other (cue the muppets)

Always wondered -- is there a way to pay the highest tax rate and be done with it? If you've made tons of trades, mining, swapped between currencies on Poloniex, etc. it's going to be impossible to account for every last satoshi. Can you say to the the IRS "I have no way to account for everything, let me pay 35% and I'll be done with it"?
