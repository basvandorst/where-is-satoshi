Restrictions from our vendors which is a total drag. We had almost 3 BTC worth of orders from people outside the US the first day we offered it that we couldn't fulfill

We actually haven't carried any Bose products, and aren't likely to. 
Personally, I don't like anything with noise canceling technology because you seem to lose a lot in terms of sound quality. 
I usually go after earbuds that fit really well, the Westones or Shures are great for this since they are "in ear monitors" (IEMs), which many musicians use while their performing. 
Check out the Westone W series on our site, they have two drivers, fit very well, sound great, and get a really good seal so they block out pretty much all background noise. Link:

I agree, I've become very interested in this, particularly for people who don't live in the US

I've been using Bitcoin personally for a while, I love it and it defiantly doesn't hurt I've profited off the valuation increase. 
As you guys know, a lot of big retailers won't accept it. I'm VERY happy to report I convinced our owner to let me implement Bitcoin as a payment option for our Headphone &amp; Earphone company!
We give free shipping on everything, and if it's over $195 (0.21 BTC) we'll upgrade you to Overnight for free!

That makes sense, I'd suggest you check out some of the Sennheisers. Bose headphones are marketed really well, and they don't sound bad at all, but for the money you'd pay there are much better options out there.
Give it a look around, if you find anything you have questions on just post it here and I'll try to help!

We hold our own inventory and ship from here everyday around 4pm (eastern). Anything over .18 BTC gets upgraded to free overnight shipping, so pretty much everyone gets their items the next day.

Surprisingly very well, it's definitely a drag we can't ship internationally though

Haha as you should, cars depreciate too much it's much better to buy stuff you'll actually enjoy!
We actually own a home theater company called Cinema Elements as well and sell Bowers &amp; Wilkins speakers, those are incredible! I have a pair of CM9s at my house, only a 2 channel and it's easily the best purchase I've ever made

We sell headphones and audio gear with bitcoin, but if you live outside the US you need a cross-shipper

Oh no! We're actually working on this now to lift the international restrictions for a few of our brands, will keep you posted
