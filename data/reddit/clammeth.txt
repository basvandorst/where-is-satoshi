Yep, I guess other people aren't that good at thinking. I bought at 19.5k and have been waiting for this moment to cash in at 14-15k. Glad it's finally came.

Who are you to say what was and wasn't the cause of his suicide? He isn't "blaming it on a currency". I'm pretty sure if you had lost potentially tens of millions you'd be pretty fucking distraught regardless of anything else in his life that could have contributed to his death. I'm not saying there weren't any other factors in his life, but to say that missing out on life changing $ wasn't the cause is wrong.

To make the most gains, you will need to not only put in your life savings, but about 70-80% of every paycheck. Hold for 4-5 years, and thank me.
