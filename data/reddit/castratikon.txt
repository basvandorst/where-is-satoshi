**There's no such thing as an iPhone power user.**
You can't do much an iPhone, but I still use a 17" MBP for web development every day at work.
(Though I'm still a pcmasterrace elitist...)

It sounds like jailbreaking has come a long way.  I'd have to see that cross-app data transfer/manipulation to see how well it works before I'd go and use it, but I'm glad there is option for those that wish to stick to iOS at all costs.  
I don't think that feature has to be enabled on Android at all.  At least I don't think I've ever had to.  Under security settings you can allow all 3rd party apps to be installed, much like on OS X, it's usually the first thing I do since I test my own apps.  The data sharing thing, I don't think so though.

When GHash.IO reached levels this high before didn't they disable people from adding new workers?  Can't this be done again?

I thought putting Dorian N. on the wallets was frowned upon.  Don't you think people will wonder who this guy is when they get the wallet and could possibly further the confusion on this man being the creator of Bitcoin?

In my apartment building I'm actually covered up to a certain amount of electricity in my rent so I will continue to mine Litecoin on a GPU and Bitcoin on some ASICs.
In August I'll be moving so it will no longer be profitable to mine with the GPU and I will dial everything down, perhaps switch to Scrypt-N if the price climbs back up over 600 or retire the GPU and invest in some Scrypt ASICs.
TL;DR - Mining is too fun to stop, regardless of how far the price falls.

I'd say the concept still works unless Amazon gives a 10%+ discount to Bitcoin users.

Can anyone give a layman's explanation of this?
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:29:12
If it were me that all of this had happened to, I wouldn't want my face posted anywhere related to Bitcoin again.  Even in a lighthearted manner.
That's just my 2 cents.

I used the iPhone exclusively from the original version up until, and not including, the iPhone 4s.  If, even after jailbreaking (which I did quite frequently), you could not do the following, then I would absolutely NOT consider iOS a possibility for *real* power users.
* Using data from one app directly to another - I'm in an email or chat client and want to add/share a file directly from Dropbox, Google Drive, or my file explorer of choice.
* Setting applications as the "default" for that application type.   I want to use Chrome or Firefox EXCLUSIVELY as my browser.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but unless it is baked into the app that you can share data across certain apps, it is NOT possible on the iPhone.  I don't think it is possible to change the default browser either.
It is easily arguable that the iPhone is not power user *friendly*, like android is, but I think that that it is not even viable for power users to consider an iPhone as their main device.
[When I say power user friendly, I'm referring to Android's ability to sideload apps and sometimes offer unlocked boot loaders, all without having to modify any software.]

I've slowly been doing the same with all of my news/podcast sources lately.  Including TV shows - which are being replaced by audio books...
I just unsubscribed from Sudden Death as well.  It hasn't made me laugh in a long time.

I'd be interested in hearing more about why you stopped listening.  I've been getting more unhappy with their content and infrastructure lately.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:39:45
That seems to be the probable cause.  I noticed at least one other change after I posted this.

Not saying it is or isn't.  I definitely gambled by jumping in on FOMO without even looking at performance thinking I could possibly make a quick buck when I had previously done decent with crypto in the past.  
The difference between then and now is I had no plan now where as back when I was doing this more frequently and paying attention to the market/news I had a plan for buys/sells and it worked.
I was just commenting on what I did, why it was a mistake, what I should have (and previously have) done, and what my options are now to deal with the mistake, because it was relevant to the post subject.

I'm in the same boat.  I placed a $5k order at $13,284. 
In 2017 (and earlier) I would dollar cost average my BTC investment, because that's what I could afford to do at the time.  I ended up making about $1500 doing this.
Now that I'm at a point where I can make bigger investments I saw the rally and though "why not put in a bunch".  And then it bit me in the ass and now I'm currently down ~$1000.
This broke all of my old rules.  I would never invest a large sum at once, and I would never invest near the top of a spike, no matter the price or momentum.
The options I have now are to:
* Leave my investment in there until the price is at a point where I can break even, and then pull out my investment, or continue to wait until it breaks out to make a profit.
* Pull out early for a loss
What you do will depend on your financial needs.  If you can afford to leave the investment in, do it.  Don't pull out if you're not worried about how long it will take  to recover your initial investment.
If you invested more than you can afford to lose, then it might make sense for you to cash out early and take the loss.  If you can make it back in a few months and still have savings, maybe you hold.  If it will take you longer or you don't have emergency savings, maybe pull out.
Personally I'm going to hold no matter what.  I know that in a couple of months I will have made back my investment with my day job and I didn't blow through my savings to make the investment.
I did learn a valuable lesson through this.  Head my old rules to DCA and never in lumps larger than what I normally put in savings every month.

I would love to see a build guide for this, and links to the screen/chassis you used.
EDIT: [I should really look closer before I comment.](

I had emailed them Wednesday and got a response back saying "We're working on new withdrawal code they will be reactivated soon."
Im getting impatient that I cannot withdraw my BTC.  I mined TRC, traded for BTC, and would actually see a profit on this trade if I could get my coins out.

Android is not open source.  Just because Google releases the code does not mean it has the GNU GPL license.  Only the Linux kernel it is built off of is GNU, NOT the OS itself.

    I'd buy it.

IAE worried that Apple is this paranoid about apps in their app store and Tim Cook has occasionally met with President Obama to talk about the future of tech in the USA and security relating to it?
