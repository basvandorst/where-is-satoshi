In the case of dogecoin, the inception and the PnD are actually done by different parties who have nothing to do with each other. Doge started as a parody of bitcoin by while Wolong took care of the actual pump and dump part that followed. Not that it's any better though ...

Dogecoin actually suffers from the complete opposite 'problem', where even cheap stuff in real life looks like it costs a lot in doge. Recently I bought some dogecoin badges, and while they cost only a few pounds in gbp, they sure feel as if they cost a lot more in tens of thousands of dogecoins.

**IF** People are just upset they have their money tied up in a losing investment. **THEN** Any bad news is potentially a cause for people to sell, and for the price to drop further. **THEN** The echo chamber is understandable, even if it does keep new adopters away.

We'd love that to be true ideally, but if just one BTC were to be moved from satoshi's address, you can bet that will trigger a mass selling that crashes the price down to a single digit or lower. After that, who knows ... maybe it will recover or won't.

Definitely not half. Maybe a small fraction of people, who have been involved in bitcoin before, so they appreciate the need to be sceptical of potential scammers. The remaining 'shibes' tend to be fairly young and gullible, this might be the very first time they're scammed in their life.

You guys are kind of missing the point of dogecoin. It's not about tipping pennies, it's more about being a counter-culture to bitcoin -- in a healthy way that is not Where bitcoin is serious, dogecoin is silly, with all the meme posts and laughing at ourselves for the absurdity of putting a doge on a coin. Where bitcoiners hoard, shibes are encouraged to share through a form of pseudo-communism, charitable donations and fundraising to support the underdogs. *Tipping is a manifestation of this point, and not something done to evangelise the coin*. And lastly, where bitcoin can initially look intimidating to newcomers, especially young people who are overwhelmed by the perceived complexity of cryptocurrencies, is patient to them. It is a full-blown culture with insider names ('shibes'), acceptable codes of conduct, and lores and legends separate from bitcoin.
The bitcoin community used to be all these too years ago. I still remember the time when I first discovered this cool tech and had to acquire my coins by trading through  That was the good time before all the sharks, scammers and get-rich-quick schemers got onboard.

This is the first sensible post I see here about tipping etiquette. I've been hodling BTC for a while now (from the days of ~$30), but I've also been abroad the doge bandwagon since the beginning too -- almost a year ago. People can sense it if you're out on a crusade of tipping to promote bitcoin. It reeks of insincerity, and that colours the recipient's perception of bitcoin at large ... in a negative way. It is better not to tip at all than doing it with an ulterior motive.
The right way to tip outside the crypto subs is to simply browse Reddit as usual, *write insightful comments*, and maybe include a tip at the end. Make it clear that yes it is money but they'd have to go through some troubles of exchanging to spend it elsewhere that doesn't accept btc. Don't just write a one-liner of e.g. 'here have some 100 bits on me'. That usually just pisses people off when they find out how little it is worth.
OK I'm heading back to the happy ShibeLand. Enjoy the price rise, guys. This is gentlemen.

I urge you to learn about this really cool thing called **propositional logic**. Maybe it will help you understand how to use if-else statements, and perhaps after that you can then begin to tackle real CS problems beyond doing CRUD stuff. 
Oh wait, maybe CS and math is too hard for you. Don't strain your brain, buddy. Carry on.

You gave him money because you wanted him to promote a specific idea on your behalf ... which is okay, I guess (still better than nothing), but it's better to give selflessly. It will make you feel better too after doing that, try it.
Edit: sorry I misread your intention. I believe you have a good intention in mind in wanting transparency, but asking him to go to the media for just $10 is a bit too much, isn't it, even as a proof? It's easy to be a cynic in this world of doge-eat-doge competition, but sometimes we just have to trust people, buddy.

I think it's a lesson to all of us: a malicious agent that has found his way into a controlling position in a centralised system (inadvertently or not) can be pretty difficult to remove. Hence the need for decentralisation.
Specifically for this sub, I think the only way we can do that is by creating a new subreddit.. But network effect is difficulty to overcome.
