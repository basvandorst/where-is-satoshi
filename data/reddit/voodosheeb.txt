you were never going to make that much money to begin with, that shipped has sailed, anybody that has bought in the past few months was never going to get rich either unless they had alot of money to begin with, you have only yourself to blame

I use it and have left some alt coins and erc20 tokens on it the past few weeks and no issues but that doesn't mean its safe, they have a nice app as well, you'll find it hard to find anything without someone having something bad to say about it

depending on how much you invest getting a hard ware wallet might be a good idea, erc20 are ethereum tokens  you can store them in etherum wallets best to google for what they are/do and have

a bit of it is ok and I understand ppl are excited but it can make it hard to find decent posts, I think a discord would be better suited for it

in my opinion the time for investing in bitcoin and getting extremely rich has past unless you have a lot to begin with. Ill be happy if I get my money back, if I get enough to help buy a car or a house ill be happy, if i can trade my bitcoin to buy something I need ill be happy, cash out when you need to

if you need the money sell, if not buy more

unless you have alot of money to begin with then there's little to no chance of becoming a millionaire
