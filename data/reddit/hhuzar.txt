Of course it does not need to do it but it tends to do it. Bitcoin had no organic demand, not one really uses it, its value is just pure speculation. The strongest speculative pattern it's been following for the last 8 months is defending triangles. This cycle was supposed to top at about 7500 and we almost reached it. Down it goes now.

Which means that the coins you hold will be worth more, so you can buy more with it, without you doing anything to increase its value, like investing. From the other side, someone who needs to earn coins will now have to work more to get it. Value out of thin air.

There is no way to know how much in inaccessible apart from estimating. A guy looked at coin transactions and decided to treat all coins that did not move for 5 years or more as lost. This may not be the best way method, because it does not account for recent loses or just old stashes, but it is a sane method. It turned out that at least 18% is lost.
There is no way to get back lost coins. Deflation is inherent in Bitcoin. This is why it will never be adopted because it creates value out of thin air.

Except no new Bitcoin will be created which means that there will never be enough Bitcoin to pay any depts. To obtain enough Bitcoin to pay interest, people will have to sell more and more, driving the value of Bitcoin up, which means that whoever keeps his, will get richer over time. Currency will become an appreciating commodity. Currently money is pumped into the system in an amount that in the end makes it not worth keeping for just its value. You need to invest it or buy commodities like land or houses. This drives the economy and progress. Bitcoin promotes not spending it but lending it on one side, and avoiding borrowing it on the other.

Or not. If bitcoin is going to crash but still remain somewhat relevant \(let's say 2k\-4k range for 2\-3 years\) but you believe it will take off in the long term \(in let's say 5\+ years\) then only the miners who invested enough will survive these lean years. Margins will drop so the bigger the farm, the smaller margins you can cope with. Many mining rigs still did not pay for themselves, so you have two options; drop now and eat up your loss, knowing you will never be able to go back into the game, or continue this race in hope of breaking even. China is still hugely profitable so money flows there and rigs are expanded. Iceland and Canada mining is probably doomed unless they invest in 7nm. With 7nm miners coming soon and old farms dropping out, even 2k/btc will be profitable.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Till 2017 Bitcoin was crashing and rising again, but it was a toy for nerds and no one payed attention. There was a real use case for it, Silk Road and buying drugs or CP over the internet. In 2017 Bitcoin became a household term and a lot of non-nerd people FOMOed into it. When it crashed, all these people lost a lot of money. Some cashed out and will never go back to Bitcoin, warning other. Privacy in Bitcoin is being eroded, as analysts are getting better at tracing coins, so no one sane is going to use it to do any illegal activity. News about failing exchanges and ongoing scams are in the news. More are brewing, but are not yet public. Conditions changed. Use case is non existent, unless you think a Bitcoin kiosk in a corner of a gas station in Thailand, charging 20% fee, is an adoption. Venezuela crisis was supposed to elevate Bitcoin, but cut off electricity and the dream is gone. A paper dollar, euro, pound is the king. With all this under consideration, a new FOMO period may not happen or is going to be much, much slower.

In math this is called proof by contradiction. Let's imagine, in 150 years crypto is worth billions and, because economy is expanding but amount of Bitcoins in circulation is constantly decreasing (no new one are mined and old one are getting lost, due to loss of priv key), value of each Bitcoin is bound to be rising. This also means that people who hold coins have no incentive to spend them, as their wealth will go up regardless. In fact investing them may be a loss, if an investment is not going to outpace Bitcoin itself gaining in value. People that do nothing are getting richer while the ones that are trying to create value are getting poorer. This means that wealth is created out of thin air and this will not work. Currently top 1&amp; is rich because they created something worth a lot. Their value is denominated in currency units, but they don't have this kind of cash in hand, only in shares, estates and such. Cash is worthless and it is better to invest it to get rid of it, before inflation eats it up. Bitcoin works the other way round, don't invest it, hodl.
Another take of the hypothesis, this time cryptos are inherently worthless and their value is only driven by FOMO. In this scenario people who spent money on them only sponsored lambos for the ones that bought (or mined) them before ATH. Simple pyramid scheme. FOMO ends, value goes to zero, early adopters are rich and bagholders are poorer. No market laws are violated.
Cash cannot have value, only products that you can buy with cash should have value. Otherwise cash becomes a store of value and this kill the economy. Basically we are back in XVI century with feudal lords ant their gold reserves.

Sure inflation is not a problem when buying a packet of chips and does not impact people who have nothing, but it is on a longer timescale. Every functioning adult that had proper education and real job will come to a point in life when money starts to pool up. They have a house, cars, traveled a bit and are not starving, yet the is still money left at the end of the month. Do nothing and l just leave it for retirement and inflation will slowly start chipping away at it. Putting it into savings account will slow this process down. Government bonds are an option. Our an index fund. No matter what you do, you are investing your money, putting it back into economy. With Bitcoin, you are meant to withdraw as much as possible and wait fo deflation to make you rich.

Bitcoin is a promise of ever growing riches. Buy, hold and boom, you are rich.

Your classmate got into med school and now earns high six figures while you sit in your parent's basement? Well, one day he will be your bitch, begging for money, because you invested in Bitcoin. This is what happened in Korea. Young generation sees no clear path to getting rich, so they threw everything at Bitcoin and lost even more. A drowning man will grab a razor.

And I telling you that Bitcoin cannot be a currency because it is a store of value. The closes to Bitcoin is gold. It worked in feudal times, but you hardly would want to be alive back then. Money was only for the rich, poor newer saw a single coin. Gold stopped working during industrial revolution. Defending gold standard was what cause 5 recessions in US. This is why we know what is going to happen with Bitcoin as currency, because it already happened, but this time our friend gold is digital and called Bitcoin. You may not like it, but the truth is all you and your family have is due to fiat and inflatory money. Hard to swallow, I know. Being able to just go to a bank and get money to start your own business, instead of working all your life and save enough, was a revolution. Abundance of money started actual redistribution of wealth.
Regarding lost Bitcoins, it is difficult to know if someone owns private key to the stash so it can only be estimated based on movement. So 18,6&amp; of all Bitcoins were not moved in the last 5 years. This is assumed to be a lower bound on the estimate. Every day Bitcoins are sent to addresses that cannot have a private key, rendering them effectively lost. There are also Bitcoins lost recently, but we can't be sure until few years pass that they are most likely lost. Current estimates are that probably up to 25&amp; is already inaccessible.

Regarding changing my viewpoint, I may read it, but the thing is Bitcoin is a composition of things that already been tried and tested before and failed. It's like another take on communism but this time digital. It will definitely work this time, trust in Satoshi.
Economy is not a law. There is no equation do describe it. It is trying to figure out what rules will make the system develop.  It is more of a social engineering than mathematics, because we are not mathematical (logical) creature. We respond irrationally, we get scared and we are inherently lazy, but we can be innovative if pressured. Fiat is this gentle pressure that built this world and pulled billions of people out of poverty (China's last 25 years as an example). Bitcoin contains rules that are against human nature. It promotes laziness and destroys any need for development. It's feudalism with blockchain.

Not really. The only one that had gold were rich people. Poor folk had copper, bronze and good old bartering and could go all their life without seeing a single gold coin. Don't get fooled by movies, where people give each other gold. This did not happen. Gold was a currency of kings, lords and generals, they paid each other. Poor folk was given everything else apart from it. There was no money on the market, no investment. Rich got richer, because they actually had money and poor could be kept poor, because they had no money to change their life. This is why emergence of banks and fiat was a blessing. I know this is hard to swallow, but an idea of lending money, without prior working all your life for it was revolutionary. Suddenly the market was full of money, demand picked up and supply followed. You didn't have to wait for a noble guy to throw you a coin. And the only price is inflation, which is not your problem if you invested. It makes you invest, which is creating more demand and develops market that becomes more complex. That is why Bitcoin will never be a currency. It appreciates in value, because of limited supply, and irreversible loss of coins. It will always go up. When your money gains in value, you're going to avoid spending it. Accept yes, spend no. No money on the market will halt the market. Also borrowing Bitcoin is going to be difficult, because to give them back, you would have to buy them back on the market and we know Botcoin can only gain in value, so you may end up in a situation known from Tulip Mania. Many people who borrowed will drive its price so high that it may be impossible to pay anything back. Also, the ones who have a stack of coins will only see this stack to not only grow in value but also in size. Bitcoins will attract more Bitcoins, without any penalty for hoarding them. This is reversing all the progress we had and going back to 12th century.

We are discussing this because I think you are wrong. Bitcoin is not currency but a store of value, digital gold, and therefore can't work.
There is no way to say how many coins are lost during which period because coins have no tags attached, whether someone owns them or not. You can only try to estimate this number based on recent transactions from addresses. This is the source of lost Bitcoins:  
TL;DR is near the end and reads: " Our final estimate from looking at the UTXO age distribution is that between 3–3.8M BTC are lost."

Ok, explain than this. I need to borrow, let's say 10BTC, to buy a house. A guy has 10BTC and is willing to do it, but he requires me to pay 11BTC back in 10 years. I get Bitcoins and spend them on a house. These are not gone, just went to the owner of the house, but now I'm 11BTC in debt. 11BTC that do not exist, they are just a debt. Number of tracked Bitcoins on chain is the same but I have 11 virtual BTCs to pay back. There are 21 million Bitcoins plus 11 virtual ones. Now, if millions of people borrowed bitcoins, then virtual debt gets created, just like with fiat, no difference. This debt could be sold on some alt chain and become a new currency.
Bonus round. So now I work very hard to pay back my debt. And here is the problem, I borrowed 10BTC, but I need to give back 11. Let's split this 11BTC into two parts, initial 10BTC and 1BTC of interests. First part of 10BTC covers initial transfer from my lender, but now he gets one extra. This 1 BTC was created out of thin air, but I needed to get it of the market. No problem if I'm the only one, but if millions of people need to get extra bitcoins to pay interests, we might run out of Bitcoins.
Consider this edge case: There are three people, A has 100BTC, B needs 100BTC, C has goods worth 100BTC that B wants to buy with borrowed money. A lends B 100BTC but expects 110BTC back. B uses it to buy goods from C. Now, how is B going to earn 110BTC in 100BTC market? There is no way to pay back his debt. At the same time this market has 100 real BTC and 110 debt BTC. What did we solve?
Bitcoin would have to be interest free to have any chance of working ever. For now, it's not going to change anything.

I'm not talking about placement of prediction but where it starts. If he wanted to show a path from today, then why is Winklevoss' trend line starting somewhere else?. If he wanted to show supposed trend lines from day of prediction to day of its fulfillment, then at least McAfee is wrong.
Also these variations are bothering me. Rogoff said "more likely $100" in 10 years. He did not said anything about a bump to $20k in 2021.

This is an accurate title. Bitcoin is to blockchain tech, what email is to internet. Just an application of a concept. It boomed at the early stage of development, but now is mostly obsoleted by instant messaging.
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:30:04
It's also not consistent in X axis. Winklevoss predicted 320k in 2018. His point is placed 2/3 the way between 2018 and 2019. But if we compare ATH placement with dates, we could assume that year label means end-of-year. This means his face is above August 2019.

I think I know where this usage is coming from, first-hand experience.
I looked into spam folder of my email account and there were 14 old emails with ransom extortion. People claiming they have my browsing history and a video of me doing kinky stuff captured by my laptop's camera. They tried to add legitimacy by including a password they cracked from some stolen database (password I haven't used in years). I ignored them of course but I've checked these addresses and for some there were inputs. Lots of inputs. Each origin is an active address, so it adds up to this statistics.

This is the best, no bullshit, answer this sub can produce.  No one here has any idea what is going on. At least you did not try to make it sound clever by adding a list of obvious options, a divine prediction or an autistic screech (HODL).
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:16:02
He is right. If price in BTC is just a recalculation from USD, then BTC is not money, just a payment method. You could accept casino chips as well. Money is something that is universally accepted, USD is just monetary representation. As long as BTC needs to be converted back and forth to fiat, it is not money but a value store, like gold.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:54:36
What a surprise. Let's ask people whether they want to store money in Euro, that Koruna is effectively tied to, USD, that's been losing value over the last year, or in a magical "currency" that jumped up 10x in few months.  
Judging by support for Bitcoin investment (11%), this has been conducted among mostly young people, that have little wealth, so a prospect of getting rich fast is understandable. I don't think 11% of general population know what bitcoin is, apart from name.

This graph is bad. First of all years are in the wrong place. ATH was in December 2017, so almost 2018, and this graph shows it so that people may think it happened around late 2016. The other things are predictions. For example McAfee did his prediction before ATH, and this graph shows it around now, so a year too late. Winklevoss did his around February dip, this one shows it in the middle of a year. Also, these variations in trend are taken from where? Just your invention so it looks like it's based off a model and not pulled out of the ass?

HODL, your sacrifice is building the future of a stable, decentralized financial system. Thanks to you someone bought a piece of Lambo you were waiting for, but this is just an insignificant obstacle. Invest more, spend fiat.

Can someone explain how Bitcoin is going to solve this? There is finite amount of Bitcoins, so no new can be created, but debt will still be created. Let's say I want to borrow 10BTC. I spend this amount and now I have a debt of 10BTC. Amount of real Bitcoins is still 21M but now there are 10 "debt" BTCs. Plus of course some interest as a fee, so let's say 10,5BTC of debt is created. If the person I spent my money to, is now going to borrow it further, to another person, that person will also be in 10,5BTC debt. Now if the same 10BTC is borrowed and spent multiple times we get multiple of 10,5BTC debts. What's the difference? The only way to stop debt creation is by not borrowing but giving. Maybe this is what Satoshi really wanted, the end game we did not grasp yet: If you have Bitcoins laying around, then it means you don't need them so give them to some who does. Perfect sharing economy.

There is nothing in blockchain that says you can't fork a coin. Forking to remove some transactions creates a chain that is 100% valid. The chain is not broken, transactions are signed and can be traced to genesis block. It has not been hacked to erase transaction, they are just not there. If people are mining it, so there is a consensus, then it is a coin, worthless for everyone else, but a coin nonetheless. ETC, ETH, BTC and BTH are all valid chains. Code is law.

Till now gradual changes held but rapid jumps either way did not. This $1000 pump will result in $1000 dump. When you zoom out the graphs you will see that this is just another bounce off on its way down, and it is smaller every time.

I think you are the one that does not want it to succeed. What crypto needs is adoption, a widespread use. This is where its value would come from, from usefulness. You want everyone to own some and slowly drive its value up. Whole 2017 was a bull run that only hurt it. It attracted day traders, and bots, that increased volatility and concentrated crypto in quite small number of wallets that can shake the market. It made Bitcoin a store of value, a speculative asset, not a currency. It's like gold now, and can you pay for anything with gold directly today? It needs to drop hard, sub $1000 or even $500, and stay like that. Shake off the parasite who want it to moon in a year. Become stable.  
Regarding your last sentence, "it wasnr even a pump". How would you call a rise by 15% in 30 minutes? An organic demand? Sure you can attach events like declaring Bitcoin halal, but it does not check out.
