You're not a pioneer, you're a consumer. Let that sink in, too.

Aren't the fees 0.25%?

I also remember once the price was holding at 5666 for 5minutes long lol.

I've considered it. But i'm not sure if 20k is worth putting into real estate. Meanwhile for stocks, i honestly have no expierience nor knowledge about it.

I currently have 12k USD in Bitcoin. (started with 10k)
That's more the reason why i'm looking for other ways to invest my money.

Question: Electricity is very cheap here. (almost free)
I have 20K spare money, can i set up something like this? It was always my dream to be a part of Bitcoin/Ethereum. Any guides or links to get started?
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:17:41
Around 2-3 cents per kWh.

Well, shops all over the world are starting to accept bitcoins, as soon they get accepted worldwide they can actually be used for anything.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:29:12
It can never be really money, for first look how unstable this currency is.
You think people will be using a currency that is such unstable?
Second, bitcoin can be manipulated, by big bitcoin holders.
That will say everyone will lose their volume cap while those rich can get richer by manipulating the currency?
These things all need to get fixed first before itcan be used as an actual currency like Euro / Gbp.

Don't be a cry fag, if you don't know the dm stfu about it.
They are a community just like we are with crypto, but different.
They just do their job. They are for decriminalizing and for a safe enviroment for everyone. Kids and hiring murderers are not allowed.
And if you think these people are bad, rethink about who is actually bad, those sitting in office.
And if you can't accept that the you are the part of the problem of this whole running corrupt system.

This! It makes most sense, they will make bitcoin worthless, using the blockchain technology, to make their own currency.
Sad world we live in, I just hope no one would ditch Bitcoin, To make money out of this new central controlled goverment coin.
