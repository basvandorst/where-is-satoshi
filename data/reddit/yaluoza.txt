Fees are an issue. But transaction times are a non issue. A vendor would only need to verify that the client sent the transaction. Vendor will be 100% certain the transaction will be confirmed by the network once its sent.

Thanks for correcting me, sorry for any misinformation.

It's impossible to double spend bitcoins because of the public ledger. Also as soon as the client hits send, the bitcoin is immediately removed from their wallet and the client can not reverse it. After it leaves the client's wallet it sits in the memory pool until its confirmed. Hope that makes sense.
Edit: this is also why its very important to double check you are sending bitcoin to the right address/wallet otherwise you're out of luck.

Ok so theoretically if you and your friend try to simultaneously send the same bitcoin from the same address on two different phones to two different addresses, only one of the transactions will go through and the bitcoin balance will be updated on both phones. However, I don't know how the network would decide which transaction will go through, probably decided by milliseconds.
Within each bitcoin is encrypted a private key which is sort of like a serial number on a dollar bill which ensures that each bitcoin is unique. So no, wallet software can not be maliciously mishandled since each coin has a unique identifier.
Sorry if it's confusing. Ask away and ill try to clarify as best I can.
Edit: Regarding private keys, they are the proof of ownership as well. If someone has access to your private keys, they can steal your bitcoin so it's important to back those up and keep them safe.
