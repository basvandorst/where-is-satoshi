This is unquestionably a PUMP.

I couldn't find any definitive evidence that he has been sighted since then. There have been unverifiable claims from his lawyer and a friend. Has a timestamped picture been seen?

1 bitcoin. 2 bitscoin.

He is the newest incarnation of Bitcoin Sign Guy. He needs to put up a QR code for donations. I gave last time.

Once again we see Government persecuting small businessmen. These businessmen should have known better and transferred the wealth in bitcoin. How long will it take them to learn?

4 months progress report: No commercial transactions yet, "we accept bitcoin" sign looking a little shabby. I have listed my business on 'coin map' - the first bitcoin business in my town to do so (population 40,000 - rural NSW Australia.) I announced to my facebook friends this achievement - no one responded. I have offered to deliver a lecture to the chamber of commerce, no confirmed speaking date yet.

i quite like this one

I think the bitcoin price is in real danger of falling if Gary Johnson gets elected president. There would be decriminalisation of drugs and prostitution, legalisation of gambling and a return to the gold standard. All of this would  crash bitcoin as it tries to leave the launch pad. The world would be a better place, and other investments would work out ok, which would be fair compensation.
@_date: 2016-06-07 08:41:05
why the fuck can't they confirm fucking transactions then
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:06:56
It's also slightly higher. Might be a useful attribute.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:41:57
It would be nice if they showed the value of transactions in bitcoin on the right side y axis.

A few enquiries. When someone asks the staff what bitcoin is they are instructed to say "magic internet money". No payments still.

Week Three. "We accept bitcoin" has been printed out via printer as I am too lazy to order high quality stickers. It is attached to the front door and reception desk. The secretaries have a photocopied copy of my wallet QR code, with instructions to accept bitcoin for dollars. They are supposed to check on the persons mobile phone that it looks like the bitcoin has been transferred. We have everyones name and address if there is a problem. Still awaiting the first customer.

Week 4. No transactions yet.

The prophecy is real. The prophecy is true. No one will sell who believes in the prophecy. Do not doubt and hold firm to this truth. You will not sell and the prophet will rise. Believe and receive salvation.

The prophecy is real. All must believe the prophecy and it will be. Never doubt.

Progress in my shop is not as good as is promised in Japan at the moment. Still no transactions. I continue to pester my favourite restauranteur to accept bitcoin with no luck. Staff have been promised the first bitcoin transaction will be shared among themselves in bitcoin.

Put my address on coinmap.org.  First listing in my town. Only bitcoin accepting business within 100km (according to coinmap).

We've just passed the second doubling of the pixel time. The early adopters have quadrupled the value of their pixels, this can only go up with the next doubling. If you don't spend all you're time pixelling now, you will regret it at the time of the next doubling. By tomorrow you could all be pixel billionaires.

Can confirm that "teller" is the incorrect term to search with.
"Point of sale" is more helpful.
Seems unlikely that I will place an order today.
@_date: 2016-10-22 03:25:48
End of week 1. Didn't buy a bitcoin point of sale machine. Instead, I created a new wallet in Xapo, have named it "business wallet." 
Next week goals:
Print out the QR code to the wallet, and give it to secretarial staff. 
Install a "we accept bitcoin sticker".
Wait for the first customer.

Seems like there's an opportunity there that bitcoin could be taking. How can we market more effectively to this group?
@_date: 2016-05-14 03:13:23
Is there any good reason to believe that the 'tulip trust' is real? It looks like it was dreamt up by Craig Wright as part of his delusional system.

Thanks for your responses. They correspond with my understanding.

There would be lots of expensive cars with bitcoin themed licence plates
