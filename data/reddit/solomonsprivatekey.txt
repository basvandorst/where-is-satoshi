Well, the potential good news is that the bottom (so far) of the drop from the previous high was around 10,300. We rose from there, and then dropped again, but the bottom so far was slightly higher, so for now anyway, the trend is increasing lows. Although, we broke the downwards trend line a few hours ago, so well see what happens this morning.

The nice thing about crypto is, there’s a very low entry barrier. If you want to trade, stick $100 on an exchange, and see what you can build from it. There’s no need to add more.
I’d just look at the return rate though, and ask yourself if any trader, in any asset class has 50,000% returns over the ask ten years.
We’re up over 200% over the past 6 months. Do you really think you can beat that? If so, define your strategy, and plug it into a backtester to see what you come up with.

Sorry guys, it was me.
A friend paid me back with cash app a while back, and I used it to buy bitcoin. Every now and then I screenshot the price and text it to them after a big swing. The last time I did it, was right at the 9k peak before the crash. I just did it again about 30 seconds before the crash.

The problem with that is, micro crashes are frequent. Whales create price dumps to pick up stop loss orders all the way down. Then the price jumps back up before you know what happened, and you’re stuck buying back in at a 10% premium.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:07:53
I know, it’s complicated, and I’m not doing it justice. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing. It was necessary to prevent ddos attacks. It’s important though that we eventually get to a point where transaction costs are low and fast for all transactions, not just big ones and we have to do it without sacrificing security. We’ll get there.

In terms of limit orders, it's looking likely, at least in the short term. Buy orders massively outweigh sell orders in the order book right now. Although it looks like they're increasing.
edit: I mean the other way around. Sellers outweigh buyers.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:21:15
Yep that’s it.
Set up a new gmail account, and change it. The set the gmail account to forward any messages to your real email, and make sure your exchange account is set to require 2FA for all transactions, and set it to confirm by email before any transactions can be processed.
That way if someone gets your access to your account somehow, you’ll know it, because you’ll receive an email, and even if someone gets access to your email, they won’t be able to access your account.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:41:49
Nothing grows logarithmically like that forever. At some point it would need to be essentially vertical on a standard chart, in order to maintain that progression.
Edit: you also have to keep in mind that, the higher we go, the more money it takes to push the price proportionately. It doesn’t take much to move 10% when the price is $10, but you need a lot of people and a lot if money at 20k.

If you’re interested in providing a daily or weekly prediction, I have a little project where I’m comparing daily price action predictions based on a few different analysts, a basic RSI strategy, tradingview scanners, a coin flip, a 4 coin flip to match the scanners, and 1 form of divination.
So far, divination is ahead by far, and the analysts in using don’t beat a simple coin flip. It’s a shallow dataset though, so we’ll see how that plays out.
I don’t do any actual trading based on this, I’m just interested in the results, and I’m working on a theory that the process of divination allows for better analysis of apparently chaotic patterns, by removing the conscious discriminatory mind, and letting the subconscious guide interpretation.

Your wallet doesn't actually contain any bitcoin, it's just a way of holding the keys. Think of it like a keychain. You can have a copy of your key on multiple keychains. 
I don't know about exodus, but some wallets have fees default set to the next block, which is always going to be the highest rate. If you don't need it confirmed in the next block though, there's no reason to pay that rate. When I checked yesterday, the rate to have the transaction confirmed within a day was around $0.50
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:27:55
No fees, just the spread. Sometimes it's more expensive than an exchange, sometimes it's less. DCA and dont worry about it.

Just think of them all as currency from different countries. The it doesn’t matter how many peso you get for a pound if you’re converting to dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:15:48
Fees aren't the issue, the need for quick confirmation is. Replace by fee created an issue where we need to wait for confirmation of a transaction, to avoid having the transaction reversed by a replacement transaction with a higher fee. If we didn't need to worry about a transaction being reversed, there'd be no rush to have a transaction confirmed in the next block, which is where we get high fees. Last I checked, it's only like $.50 to have a transaction confirmed within a day, which is very reasonable. It's not fast enough to use as a currency though.

Does anyone know of an online platform where you can log a series of hypothetical trades, and show the performance stats? 
I have a little project I'm working on contrasting a bunch of different methods, along with the trading suggestions from a few "analysts", against the performance of random trades and trades driven by divination. Currently I'm logging all of the data in a sheet, and I'm thinking about building it out in python, but I assume there's probably something like that out there already. I guess I could use Delta, but I've never found the stats to be very reliable.

What I mean is, some people use all of them, and some only use 1. So if someone wants to tip you, but they only have ETH or BTC, and you only accept BCH, it’s unlikely that they’ll convert to BCH just to tip you.
The top 5 right now are BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH and LTC.

I also have a model I built based on rates of change that does really well, but it only beats the market in an uptrend when it’s set up for high frequency trading, which leads to a super low sharp ratio and too much risk.
