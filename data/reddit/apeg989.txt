There are plenty of cases out there where two factor auth account has been emptied. 
when is Kraken to blame? Foreign IP, changed email and an account being emptied in 1h.

i disagree, voluntary 2FA aside Kraken could not be doing less to prevent this.
It took over 24 hours to even get anything from Kraken beyond generic responses... and that's after i went to twitter.
$43 thousand dollars and twitter is my only support avenue

Thanks for the advice, my local police don't seem too interested. i didn't think i could just open a case with the FBI, illl give it a try.
Thanks for the security tips too.

I consider myself a technical guy, but clearly not technical enough... but i'm miles ahead of the masses. 
Every industry has hackers, crypto seems to be one of the few that puts that burden on the end users. It demotivates exchanges to actually do anything as we can see via Kraken and will always leave the lowest secured users paying the price. 
That price leads nowhere, if Kraken was out $43k you can bet your ass withdraw flows only used by hackers would be shut down. applying the costs to me does nothing, there is nothing i can do.
Investing in crypto commits you to a life of keeping up with the latest security trends... easy at first, but give it 3,4,5 years.
This situation removed my crypto blinders and i now see the real flaws behind it all.

It enough for me to never step back into crypos.
a simple account freeze, even 6 hours would have done the job. I reported it 3 hours after it occurred, my ticket was then ignored for 24 hours until i started hounding Kraken on twitter. 
Its pathetic, Kraken's hands are not squeaky clean on this.

Thanks for the tips, But $43k was enough to clean me out and god knows even if i were to get back in one day it would not be via Kraken after seeing how this has all played out.

That's exactly what i would do?
if i had more doors i would lock them, but it only take one door for a criminal to break through.

Last year it was hash marks and symbols in your password, today its 2FA, tomorrow when that's hacked Kraken will blame you for not using 3FA. 
This game between exchanges and hackers will continue forever, its doesn't make sense the price of that battle is to be paid by the end users.
I didn't have time to keep up with the latest security tech blog, i didn't know yahoo accounts were comprised, nor should, i just wanted to invest in crypto.

The amount is independent to my point. 
43k or 4.3k security needs to be the job of the exchange.
Users cant effect large scale change, this situation will effect me and perhaps a dozen others who beef up things on their end (only because of this post). But if Kraken was on the hook for the $43k the withdraw flow would be shut down right away. But they didnt, and they wont, and we will see another persons hacked soon enough.

It has no longevity if that's the case. 
there cant be a resting risk you can lose ever cent in a moment because of a small mistake. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:00:19
The reverse of your logic means if it was actually stolen from me... fuck me right?
I'm not here to get Reddit karma bucks, and there is about a zero chance in hell Kraken is going to pay me back a cent. 
But this situation is insane and has me out of crypto for good, the cat and mouse game hackers will forever play falls 100% on us, the end user. Few years ago it was capitals and symbols, now its 2 factor auth... the bar will always move leaving people who cant devote the time to keep up with latest securities vulnerable to lose everything in under and hour.
This burden should not fall on the users, and the level of risk should not change based on the exchange you use.
There is zero reason Kraken should have let a foreign IP login, followed by an email address change, and finished off with an entire account being emptied in 1 hour. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:26:48
a week? 6, 12 hours would have solved this. 
i reported it only a few hours after it happened, Kraken took 24 hours to even respond, and that's after i used twitter.
The flow of users who are changing emails from foreign IP's and immediately doing a mass withdraw for legitimate reasons vs. Hackers must be 1 : 1000.
I acknowledge i made a number of errors not being up to date on the latest security. But i don't feel Kraken should just get to wash their hands of it. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:04:31
I acknowledged my error and accept the costs. But i'm having difficulty understanding why the costs are 100% for myself to absorb. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:30:34
the costs of the cat and mouse security battle exchanges will forever have with hackers can not be put on the end user. 
Google around and you will see cases where 2FA accounts were hacked on Kraken, their stance there... users fault

That's what i'm hoping
