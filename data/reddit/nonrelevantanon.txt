That is the main reason why I do not see bitcoin ever being used by the masses, there is no way to reverse a transaction so if some one steals your phone wallet or private keys you lose everything. Now if some guy puts a gun to my head and forces me to wire him money next day I can get it reversed. If I buy something with my cc and never get it I can get it reversed. With btc i cannot. These are safety features that is very hard to do in crypto unless tou have some kind of central authority controlling the transaction like a escrow which there have been some research into but its still a manual process so you cannot apply it tona large scale.
Where I see btc going is most probabaly used for all the large and important transactions and then a bunch of smaller side chains or even centrally owned chains being the one used by the every day person.

It all depends on your rank with them. If you use them once in a blue moon then yeah you will get lower service but if you are at the top end credit cards you get the premium service. Worth paying for it. Paid 100$ a year fee and currently sitting at 600$ cash back.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:49:15
You do know your credit card fee covers you for things like this. Get defrauded with bitcoin and you will never see that mone again. I dont want to use a escrow for every transaction. Biggest reason why I use my credit card still over bitcoin for purchases. If i dont get my good i can reverse the transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:47:36

Even if they took 100$ from me I would fight them. Also you should have talked to a real lawyer because the you can seek reimbursement of costs and legal fees if the government's position was not substantially justified. My friend is a lawyer and i talked to him about this and he said that most people get their money back. Only if the police force really think there is some connection to crime will they try hard to prevent the money from going back. But most of the time they just immediately give it back.

Well no for bitcoin to support a decent amount of transactions block size will need to change.even with lightning network you still need to record opening and closing of channels with billions of people the current blockchain will never be able to  keep up. Even with unlimited size block chain you would run on to scaling issues like size and ram. So as it stand all the solutions to scale btc is useless.

Sure because Moore law applies transistors per square inch and not to computstional power or new forms of computational systems. Go learn electrical fundamentals before coming with nonsense statements you heard in cs101. I am talking about quantum computing and other forms that are highly experimental.

No because it cannot be regulated other then by not allowing it at all. There is a reason why I still have more then 95% of my wealth off crypto. The fact that it cannot be regulated is the reason why it will never succeed. You have whales like bitfinex printing tethers like they are the fed. Crypto markets are a joke.

@_date: 2018-05-20 02:05:41
Not American actually from a poor 3rd world country. Here is my original thought: You are dumb.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:39:57
And you don't own your land, you don't own anything technically if you have that kind of mind set, the government set up rules and regulation say it will step in if some one takes what is yours. If some one comes to take your land they will defend it for you. If it was not for them any one that is "stronger" then you could take your possessions. And that is the problem with crypto currencies. I would be super scared if I had constant access to all my money I had available. I could see the amount of people being forced at gun point to send money to some btc address that then gets mixed or converted into xmr and then its gone. I have been held at gun point several times in my life and I am very happy all they could take was the cash and my maximum ATM withdrawal limit. 
Also it is not accessible to everyone, only people connected to the same network, world war 3 could start and we could see separation of country specific networks no longer connected out of fear of internet attacks then what there goes the "global" payment network. Or lets say they attack the major INX of a country you can say good bye to internet.
Having come from a 3rd world country crypto currencies would be the worst thing in the world to give them. They can barely handle money and now you want to teach them how to use a phone, how the internet works and how blockchain works? I grew up in Africa, I regularly helped teaching underprivileged kids at a community computer center there is no way crypto currencies can help them. They have no money so how would having a bank account even help them? In third world countries there are constant power and internet outages which you would also have to deal with. So its actually a step backwards at least with a credit card they can still take down my numbers and bill me at a later stage.

Um blockchain was made popular by bitcoin it actually came about in the early 90s if you have ever done proper research or a thesis abput blockchain you would know what I am talking about.

It is not needed with a pos or some other way. Proof of work is just a temporary step. There are much better ways to do this. And better ways will come. Problem with proof of work is that all it takes is someone to hord enough mining equipment and then do a 51 percent attack. So In my opinion it's the weakest.

Ofcourse this has implications on bitcoin. Most of the biggest crypto exchanges use tether. This allows the owners of tether to print as much money as they want, buying btc pushing up the price of btc up and then slowly selling their btc for fiat currencies turning nothing into money. Biggest reason I dont invest in any crypto. As soon as tether is out I will gladly put money in. But untill then glad i sold at 17k. And i would advise anyone else to do research and see how tether had manipulated the market. I dont believe tether in has 1 percent of what they claim to have.
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:30:33
Nope, papers about computer baesed payment schemes started coming out in the 90s proof of work which btc referenced also comes from back then. Satoshi did not come around with an amazing idea from nothing. The cryptographic academic scene is very old and has allot of papers that work on secure payments like bitcoin. But none of them was as good or complete as bitcoins paper. Looking for more Google hashcash.

1 that's your opinion. 2 it's not feasible for the world to use bitcoin its too slow and the transaction limit even with lightning network won't scale and 3 no there are some worthy alts but yes allot are money grabs. 
Just because bitcoin was first does not mean it is the best. There is so much better work being done in some ot the alt coins. My favorite being xlm and  ethereum. Though as of right now no coin can ever become a world currency due to the extensive limitations they have we have.

If bitcoin becomes the main currency we will have a even bigger gap between the poor and rich. Bitcoin can die it is banned by all the governments. If there is no money being invested into it and blocked on all network pops  it will die. I personally dont see governments giving up the ability to print money.

It won't change that much because each time a lightning network node opens up a channel it has to do a transaction on the main network. So even though lightning network has a insanely high throughout it will still be limited by the btc limit in the bigger picture. 
In order for LN to scale to world level BTC would need to be able to handle at least 2600 transactions per second, if everyone had to settle there channels once a month. Do the math with 7 billion people settling once a month. This does not even include settling inter-node channels and business channels.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:53:11
let us say everyone settles on block chain once a month, which is highly improbably would be more like once a week to once a day, and this excludes business accounts and client accounts that means at 7 billion people you would have 2613 transactions per second. Which is impossible. 
This alone means that lightning network cannot scale up to where the world can use it. Even lets say 1 billion people use it ever day and settle once a month, that is still 370 transactions per second. 
Additionally to the above that does not include node to node settlements and balancing. This is just end users settling there channels once a month. Lightning network will work in smaller systems but not to the scale we need bitcoin to scale to. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:38:34
