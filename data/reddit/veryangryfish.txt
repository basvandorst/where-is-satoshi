To be honest, I tried purchasing a flip phone a month or two ago. I think they're still cool as shit, especially when you answer or hang up the phone. Just need to implement today's tech and all that.

When was the first you heard about it and how? Like, just on the news one day and thought it'd be fun to try it out and buy some? 
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:41:43
That's a fun story. Though you'd think that multi millionaires wouldn't be so egotistic and arrogant to wave off a potential investment opportunity without even taking the time to research it.

Priorities ey
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:42:30
Aww, thank you.
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:30:39
Do they ever bother you when Bitcoin shows up on the news? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:07:51
I completely agree with you. I think the holding their hand during the initial steps and the basics and general knowledge is much more vital. 
And is what will ultimately help us towards mass adoption.

He forgot to end it with motherf*cker

That's a great way to prepare yourself, even without full understanding. I did write an article on how to detect scams and other warning signs in the crypto world. You can find that here: 
If you want, just let me know and I can find a bunch of links that I personally found useful to answer some of your questions. And of course attempt to answer some myself :) 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:28:34
That's pretty much how I got into it. I was looking for something to do with my money, rather than just have it sit in the bank. Once I began researching, it's been going non-stop from there!

Unfortunately a lot of the people don't have taste and think a Lambo is the best exotic car money can buy.  
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:03:15
Anytime! 
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:59:15
I tweeted them. Lets see if we get any answers.

This is a true story for me. Investing a tiniest amount every time I get my paycheck. I'm talking about miniscule amounts at first like, 1 meals worth every time. And it's helped SAVE so much and get me into the habit of saving and investing into the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:25:20
I'm sorry :( 
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:03:10
Ah yes, right before they scream Bitcoin is a scam. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:13:27

I know right. It's even like; How!?

Are you trying to make be blush? Do you like the angry kind?

Oh wow, how far back was that?

Thank you for everyone who has replied and kept attention to the thread. Our main issue is not the fact we did not get our withdrawals, I am sure we will receive them at some point, our issue is with the fact that they charge clients 1%, promise to send out a wire within 24 hrs (meaning I will get it within 3 business days usually) and don't warn customers about the issues they are experiencing on the back end. The first withdrawal was processing for a week before being "sent out", the second one was processing for two days, we have contacted support and asked them to stop it and refund it, a few hours after that the status changed to "Sent out" and they told us they could not reverse it.   
A few clarifications:
1. We have been a Bitfinex corporate client for 1.5 years and we have been doing withdrawals from the exchange to our bank account in both USD and EUR and everything was fine until this month.
2. We have just passed a compliance review by Bitfinex, provided them with our audited annual report as well as all the other documents they have requested.
3. The support was replying, but with generic replies, ignoring our actual questions
4. We understand that expecting the withdrawal in 24 hrs in unrealistic, but in our minds, if they charge us for express - that means that the wire will be sent out within 24 hours from their bank. Meaning they can product a copy of MT103 SWIFT message to us showing that the wire has been sent out.
5. While these issues with USD withdrawals were happening, we received the EUR withdrawals just fine, within 2 business days.
After we started posting on social media Bitfinex sent in an email today saying they could not process our withdrawals because of concerns in "my account activity" and they will refund them. This sounds like BS to us because they processed our EUR withdrawals just fine, no concerns in our account activity there. We are eager to see how long it takes them to credit the funds back. We just hope it's not going to be another month :)

That's a fair point. Maybe in time it can be an international value of trade, as well as a good store of value. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:45:26
These are some very nice pointers, thank you. 
I didn't think about it at the time regarding how the definition "currency" is government issued and amount of un-tangible currency the world already has circulating. 
I have more to think about, thanks!

If it's not up yet, check again in 6 months. 
The good ole; I'm running a little late, be there in 15min. If I'm not there yet, read this message again.

Oooh! I'll share that. That's great, keep the ideas coming.

Oh shiet, these are awesome. Weird I haven't stumbled upon them before! Welp, I shall share these for you on my social networks.

Terrific idea! My uncle of mine did kind of the same thing, where he would put the same amount of money as a pack of ciggerettes into a savings jar and then after so many years he had quite smoking and used that money to buy a rolex, which is now passed down onto his son.

Sorry for your loss Benben. PSA for all the rest of us out there to always be careful. Only we can keep our bitcoin safe.

If you have any suggestions or critiques on how I could do this better, such as formatting or something. Please let me know! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:11:17


Do you have any information/links more on that? That's one of the things that's confusing me. I originally had though Bitcoin gold was what Segwit2x would be called. Thanks in advanced!

@_date: 2017-10-05 04:08:07


Nope. I didn't spend anything, and I recently just bumped it up to 0.01355. 
That's why I'm confused on the +0.03977. I did not acquire that much bitcoin. My total amount is correct, nothing is missing. Just curious as to why it says: +0.03977
