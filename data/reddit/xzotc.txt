He deleted all of his past comments due to your post. Should've taken some screenshots (for future reference, seeing how this action alone proves you're right).
Anyways, done and done.
EDIT: [better late than never](
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:36:07
Yeah I read that part too (I read all of that page, not that there was much to read), but I wasn't sure if it was due to that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:15:59


What are you referring to? I checked his Wikipedia page and found this:


But it doesn't explain or say much...

Just wanted to say thanks!!

I've never had a blockchain.info, but maybe you failing to access your wallet has prompted a recovery thing where you have to input your 12 word phrase. It's the 12 words you were first given when creating the account, for restoration purposes.
I'm kinda worried (for you) seeing how it didn't cross your mind, so perhaps it means you never did [save it]? ... Hopefully not.

So how long ago have you made this gif, OP? 2 months in advance? Longer?

Thank you! However, I don't have a leather jacket and I don't smoke, but you're right about the sitting bit, even though it's an easy one...
I am giving more than one "care" though, tbh. I couldn't buy more BTC while it was @ $5600 and now it's climbed back a bit. However, Bithumb is back, so here's to hoping BCH will increase in price again and I'll be ready to get some more BTC!
Rather than being passive aggressive about it, educate yourself and realize that there really wasn't and *isn't* any reason to be 'stressful' about it. You don't need a leather jacket for that.
Have a nice day!

You misread it. The episode was aired in 1997. The YouTube video, however, was uploaded in 2006.

But I do use the Ledger Manager. I can't that page though because it says that the firmware needs to be updated. I removed the apps from Chrome, though... I know it isn't the same (or at least think so), but I had no other choice.
**EDIT:** Or maybe it is the same, because [here is what is shown]( in my case.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:51:49
I already mentioned I did this. I've done this over 10 times now and it still displays the same screens after a couple of seconds.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:41:46
Lucky you :(
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:53:03
I can't. As I mentioned, all I see on my Ledger's display is the word "Update." It never goes away.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:54:35
I went ahead and looked for another mini-USB cable, following your edit, but nope - it doesn't seem to affect anything... 
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:41:28
It definitely is the latest version, seeing how I re-installed the app multiple times just today. :(
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:39:35
Couldn't see how it would be related. Still disabled. Didn't do the trick.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:14:09
I'm sorry but this is just bad advice. Some poor dude would have gone out of his way to find an OS that is not Windows, counting on your advice, just because you hate windows...? The fact that your brother had no difficulties upgrading with Linux has nothing to do with my issue... Many Windows users have had no issues either.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:15:30
So in order to fix this issue I have to do it through a MAC or Linux? Are you just assuming because you hate Windows, or because you're familiar with this issue and this is how it was solved?
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:40:14
Just tried to do that; went to my sister's PC. Same exact thing. Even tried 2 USB ports and opened her Device Manager just in case - no different than mine.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:46:37
I know. That's what I did. Sorry for misleading though. I did get the whole "restarting MCU blabla" with the bootload screen...

I’m confused. While the emails are fake, I know for a fact PayPal actually forbids crypto deals on their platform...
A guy who trusted me used to help me convert my PayPal funds to BTC last August. He would buy on his local exchange site and I would pay him via PayPal, cover all the fees he had to pay and tip I’m as well. 
One time I wanted to get this over with quickly and not in smaller increments, so I drafted a nice little piece of declaration that said that said transaction is meant for BTC, how much BTC I’ll be buying and even provided a blockchain link, and mentioned that if that link has exactly x BTC in it, I will not be able to pursue a refund (charge back claim). 
Showed it to my guy and he was pleased and agreed to send the higher sum, all at once. I attached the note to my payment, and within a few hours his PayPal balance was locked. 
We called and he was told that it’s because they do not allow crypto payments (fear of fraud and stuff). He had to refund all of the payments to me and I sent it to his friend’s account. They realized it was crypto because of my note, obviously.
So yeah, PayPal truly doesn’t allow crypto. Unless it’s changed since, which I doubt. What am I missing here?

As in..? Not Windows? Or am I misunderstanding you?

Awesome read! 
So glad to hear you managed to get it! I was sucked into your story, I felt like.
Also - I am about to go for Ledger. Obviously a Trezor exploit was beneficial to you, but putting that story a side, if you needed a new hardware wallet nowadays, would you still go with Trezor? While the latter is open source, the former can hold more alt-coins (although it isn't relevant to me, at least not nowadays), looks better, according to most people, at least (I don't hate the way Trezor looks, though) and also a bit more secured (hardware pin).
Curious to hear your input, and again - a fascinating read, and the video at the end was a nice touch! Was kind of hoping you'd attach it, seeing how you mentioned in the story you asked to have it recorded.

Youre referring to the Bitcoin Gold, right? Could I still get it if my coins were in a Copay wallet (once there is a replay protection)
Also, IIRC, the issue with Copay is with the B2X fork, so that's when I really have to make sure my coins are gone from Copay, right?
@_date: 2016-10-18 22:40:59
Thank you! I now see what you guys meant. I downloaded the copay client (no email), went to settings and completed the backup procedure.
Before looking up Bitcoin I was under the impression that it's simple, but after looking it up I began to think that I might have gotten the wrong idea. I now see that it was simple after all.
Thanks again :D
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:15:25
Ummm... So if I would like to be able to use it on all of my devices (be it my PC [windows], (future) iPhone &amp; Macbook), I should be using Copay?
Also, what do you mean by 'backup procedures'? As in general ones (that I should probably know, and don't, before making an account), or specific ones for a specific wallet (in our example, Copay)? Where do I find those instructions (whether you were referring to the latter or the former)?
Also, what about my question regarding the mail?
Sorry for all these noobish questions and thanks a lot for the reply!
