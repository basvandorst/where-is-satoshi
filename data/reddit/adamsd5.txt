This. So if there were an exchange that allowed withdrawal of BTC though LN,  the exchange would open a new channel to the new buyer.  Still one on chain transaction, but the buyer doesn't make it.

At 15k price, your initial $1500 investment is worth $2250.  If you take out $1500, you realize $500 gains.  The other $750 is still in BTC, and represents $250 more of unrealized gains. So if you sell the rest, your total taxable gain would be $750.  Make sense?
Whenever you buy property and then sell it, you subtract the purchase price (the basis) from the sale price. That is your taxable capital gains.  In this case, the BTC is the property. In my example, the basis is $10k per BTC. 
But again, confirm with a tax professional.

Miners provide immutability to the block chain through expensive proof of work, the hash solutions.  They "lock in" transactions by including them in blocks. The work gets rewarded with the fees and block reward.  Those motivate continued proof of work, reinforcing immutability. 
Non mining nodes verify all transactions and blocks are valid and forward them around the peer to peer network. This is relatively cheap work, but critical to Bitcoin.  Running a full node allows you to verify all balances without trusting anyone else.  This is the motivation for running full non mining nodes. (it is also fun!).

I put just the public key in electrum to create the sweep transaction, then I put the private key on an offline computer to sign the transaction and my phone to take a picture of the qr code that contains the signed transaction.

Almost right.  Transactions have inputs and outputs.  Segwit reduces the size of inputs that are segwit addresses.  So the overall transaction size gets smaller if you are spending from a segwit address, regardless of the target.

I think people are treating you harshly.   If the only value you see in crypto is tax evasion, then you are correct... That value is decreasing and will get near zero.  Many people see many more valued uses than tax evasion.  Personally, I thank you for sharing your opinions.  It helps me understand some of those who are certain BTC will go to zero.  At least some of them don't see the honest, legitimate use cases which give crypto value.
You mentioned anonymity too.  BTC is adding features that increase anonymity.  Other crypto coins already have solid anonymity.  So, I don't see that value as decreasing.  I see it as tiny right now (not much anonymity in BTC), but growing over the next few years.

The low transaction fees are great to see.  I'm curious if I'm reading two pages right.  First, the Jochen page:
This seems to indicate that transactions with 2 satoshi/byte fees are getting included in blocks.  Is that correct?  If so, that's sort of amazing... That would be something like 10 cents for a typical transaction?  Can someone check my math?
The second page is the bitcoinfees21 page:
Am I reading this right that people are still paying 390/byte or more?  Yikes.

@_date: 2018-01-30 07:23:33
Depends on the wallet gui.  The protocol just has absolute fee amount, but since miners likely pick the highest fee per byte transactions, that is how wallets present it.  If you build your own transaction, you could put 1 satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:50:12

Or maybe a fork that would allow scnorr on 1x addresses.

@_date: 2018-01-09 15:19:56
I think you could top up your channel with only off chain transactions.  If an exchange has the option to deposit and withdraw via LN, you buy BTC with fiat like today, and if there have been enough LN deposits, the exchange can send the LN payment instead of an on chain transaction. This would help close the loop.  Merchants deposit LN BTC, I buy and withdraw LN BTC, then I spend LN BTC.  Which exchange will be first?

Mining would happen even if no fees are in the blocks due to the reward, but will be less with lower fees.   As the BTC price goes up, more mining will happen.  As the cost of mining goes up, less mining will happen.  BTC price is market driven.  Assuming it doesn't plummet, higher cost of mining in the form of higher price of electricity or taxes would curb mining some.  Long term, the reward cuts in half every four years.  That helps too.  
But I agree on alternative sources.  I like the idea of mining to help subsidize solar build out.  Then when the mining is not profitable, sell the solar to the grid, reducing global dependence on coal. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:30:51
That would be a fork that discards any BTC held in segwit addresses.  Also all transactions that involved segwit addresses and any that follow those.  That would undo a lot of valid economic activity.   Do you think such a fork is likely to get support?

Ask a tax professional, but I think you need to pay gains on the quantity you sel.   If you bought 0.15 for $1500 when the price was 10k and sold 0.1 for $1500 when the price was 15k, you probably owe capital gains tax on $500.  Short term gains in this example. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:50:29
Segwit reduces the cost of spending a transaction that was sent to a segwit address. (The witness is your signature, and it is segregated if you use a segwit address).  Because your signature for each input is not included in the transaction (segregated), your transaction is smaller (fewer bytes). So for the same sat/byte fee, your total fee is less.  Note that the output address is the same size for segwit and non segwit addresses, so the type of output address doesn't affect the size/cost of your transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:05:57
"'number of transactions per unit time' doesn't fully capture what's going on" - That seems correct.  None of these graphs fully capture what's going on.

My understanding is that gifts of property carry the tax basis with it.  So if you bought 1 BTC at $10k, and gave it to someone today, the gift amount is still $10k, and the tax basis stays at $10k.  If that person sells for $15k, they owe capital gains tax (at their tax rate) on the $5k profit.
Check with a tax guy if it is a lot.  Giving large gifts can have tax consequences for giver or receiver. Small gifts don't.   The border is somewhere around $14k per person per year.  Note that this is all my understanding of US tax rules and I am not a tax professional.

Maybe this analogy will help... Consider domain names.  You can buy and sell them.  Buying a bunch of simple names in 1995 would have been a great investment in the protocol of the internet (dns actually, but it is an analogy).  People did this.  These purchases helped DNS companies grow and the internet grow.  However, there are infinitely many names allowed by DNS.  Common names are expensive, but unused ones are cheap.  The Bitcoin protocol (read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos... Free online) has a fixed number of BTC embedded in it.  In contrast to dns names, BTC are fungible. 
The BTC coins exist because of the Bitcoin protocol.  Any value in BTC helps support the growth of the peer to peer network and mining networks.  Those in turn add value to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:59:12
Have any thoughts on what would be better? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:41:06
That's the site I used to learn all of this. Check that out.  I will address your questions... Feel free to ask more if I didn't clear it up. 
"sweep" usually means sending coins to a new address.  You don't sweep a public key.  You sweep coins.
You can't put a private key on a Trezor (Trezor doesn't support that), but that is the right idea.  You can put the private key on an offline computer.
Here are the pieces to sending BTC:
1. Create a transaction.  To do this, you need you public key, the target address, and access to the blockchain.  This transaction is not yet valid.  I could create a transaction to spend all of your BTC because I can see the public keys.  But nobody will accept the transaction until it is signed.  So step one is create a transaction with your public key in an online computer that has access to the blockchain.  I used Electrum in the lightweight mode where I use someone else's downloaded blockchain.  I import just the public key.  That lets me observe my balance and create unsigned transactions.  If you want to be more secure, run a full node for this.  The point is, you only need your public key to create a transaction. 
2. Copy the unsigned transaction to an offline computer that has your private key.  With Electrum on that computer, import the private key.  You don't need the blockchain for this computer. Don't panic when you cannot see your balance.  You need the blockchain to see your balance.  Load the unsigned transaction, verify it looks right, and sign it (there is a button for that).  Then you can display a qr code with the signed transaction.  This is now something the Bitcoin network will accept.  It cannot be modified to steal your BTC.  Changes make the signature invalid.  However, until you share it with the world, nobody knows about it yet.  You could print it, mail it to me and I could publish it over the network.  But don't do that. 
3. On your phone, scan the qr code of the signed transaction and broadcast it.  This phone app doesn't need any keys.  It is merely a way to send out transactions.  I think I used the blockchain app, pressed send, and scan qr code. Because the transaction is already signed, no key is needed.  Confirm the details once more and send it. 
Do all of this with a small amount first if you have a large amount.   Even $1.  Yes, you waste a transaction fee that might be $20 or more, but if you are sending a lot, it is worth the money to practice and make sure you have it right. 
The most vulnerable point is you making a mistake with the target address.  Next is someone presenting a target address that is theirs.  For example, if you are sending to an exchange, and the exchange gets hacked, and all BTC deposit addresses are changed to the hacker's address. Next is corrupt Electrum software that changes the target address when you do step 1.  That's why you should double check the accuracy of the target adddess in steps 2 and 3.  Finally, there are bizarre attacks on the offline computer.  Consider a traffic camera that can see in your house and take a picture of your paper wallet private key.  Or someone sells you a computer that says the wifi is off, but isn't.  These are unlikely, but technically possible.  Be as paranoid as you see fit. 
One final note for now... The offline computer in step 2 is basically a hardware wallet.  An expensive, clunky, less secure hardware wallet.  If you need something more convenient than paper, I recommend sweeping your BTC to a Trezor.

The question is good.  It has two facets... Are blocks compressed when sending them from peer to peer, and are blocks compressed when saving them to disk?  I believe, but am not certain that the peer to peer Bitcoin protocol allows compressed transmission (or maybe I just read that in a proposal - - my point is that transmission is dictated by the protocol) .  Disk storage format is up to the implementation of the node software.  Nothing in the Bitcoin protocol dictates storage implementation, so any of them could compress the blocks on disk.

You can make jewelry and electronics from copper and other metals that are not as valuable as gold.  So those are not the primary reasons gold is useful as a store of value.  It is:
1. Trusted by most people to hold value over long periods of time. 
2. Scarcity, which helps support 
3. Noncorrrosive, again supporting 
4. Hard to mine.  Again, 
5. A long history of trust/value, again supporting  
So really, it is the worldwide trust that people in the future will continue to give up useful things (good, shelter, etc) for gold that keeps gold's value.  This is also true for fiat, baseball cards, etc.  However, items 2-4 above make gold better than fiat/collectibles as they stabilize the supply.  Bitcoin also has those properties.  It will take a long time before trust is established globally, but that is the idea.  
We all trust some unit of account to hold value.  For most, that is fiat, which is as trustworthy as the government that backs it (which varies wildly across the world).  Bitcoin is a good alternative.  Many of the properties that make gold hold value.  Some properties that gold doesn't have (e.g. Nobody can take it from you, digitally transferable, zero weight, doesn't exist in a single place).

But taking money out requires a signature by the owner.  Transferring to a bank account number is possible without the owners signature.   Your private key is what you use to sign transactions to spend Bitcoin.  It is truly a digital version of the checking system. However, trustless and signatures are unforgeable.

Except that the Calibra guy explicitly said they would enforce aml/kyc controls in all Libra clients.  Once you have Bitcoin, you can use it in clients without any of that.  Also it is possible to get BTC without any of that.  Also, Bitcoin devs have privacy goals.  Not entirely clear if Libra devs want to build in privacy.

The problem in the housing crisis wasn't the people flipping houses.  They usually ended up being the victims.  It was the big banks and credit rating agencies that were reporting false values to keep the loan money flowing.  I can't blame a person for accepting a loan offer with great terms, even if that is a high risk person.  I blame the banks for offering those loans, losing on them, then taking bailouts.

Buying a future means agreeing that you will buy BTC at the named price at a specific date in the future (hence the name). You agree to pay cash in the future.  You don't actually pay for the BTC.  That is a bet that the price will go above the named price.  The further BTC goes up, the more you make. If BTC goes down, you are still obligated to buy at the named price, so you lose money on that bet. With the CBOE futures, you never actually buy the BTC.  Instead, the CBOE will compute your gains and losses and add or remove from your account.  Whoever took the other side of your bet loses or gains whatever you won or lost, respectively.  The price of the future is a market, like a betting line. If I say I will bet you that BTC is above $1 in a month, you probably won't bet against me. If I say $1 million, you probably would take the bet.  Somewhere between, those who trade make a market price where there are people willing to take each side. That is the price of the future.
If you want to participate, you need a brokerage account that will trade this futures contract. Check with your bank, or maybe one of the places you would buy stocks online.  I highly recommend you learn more before investing a lot with futures.  A small amount to learn with is sane.  Assume you will lose it.

I am a Bitcoin fan, and I think the cost the world pays for the Bitcoin blockchain is worth it, but I am also perhaps a rarity in that I also appreciate your thoughts.  Ignore the down votes. 
The problem I see with these ideas is that they have been tried.  Such things exist, and they have failed.  Consider the housing credit crisis.  Many cooperative parties were responsible for keeping the system in check, with a lot to lose long term if it failed.  However, they all took short term gains as more important than the long term risks.   Credit agencies were incentivized to give better than appropriate ratings.  Banks to give too risky loans.  Hedge funds to buy products that gave high returns without really questioning the risks which were advertised to be low. 
The fundamental problem is the people are incentivized to be dishonest.  They get rewarded for it.  Honest people are honest for morality sake.  They lose money by being honest.  At least in the short term.  So corruption will always happen.  Politicians will say there is a conspiracy to alter video or recorded testimony.  Corporations will doctor books.  Consumers will wink, nod, and operate under the table. 
An immutable history is something this world had never seen until Bitcoin.  I don't know how much that will benefit the world, but as one of the honest people, I welcome it. Even at great expense.

Coinbase is pretty good.  They are one of the few that try to play by the regulation rules and have some level of insurance.  Gemini is also good, but I don't think they have much volume.  They are the one that is setting the price for the futures contracts recently trading.  So, they will always have a high level of regulatory scrutiny, which is good for the users.

Similar, yes.  Derivative contacts were part of the problem.  I think the difference is that banks were loaning people money that those people could not reasonably pay back.  The homes were collateral and the loans were buying the homes.   This is a form of margin buying.  My first house I put down less than 1%.  That's more than 100x buying I was allowed to do with my tiny bit of money!  Most of the country was doing it, and people trusted to calculate the risk on those loans were very, very wrong (possibly fraudulently so).  Loaning at those rates with that much risk is very dangerous.  I was fortunate enough to be able to pay mine back, but if I had lost my job that year, it would have been another foreclosure.  Right now, nobody is allowing massive margin buying on Bitcoin.  You must have the cash in the bank to cover the bet, or you can't make the bet.  If banks ever start allowing Bitcoin as collateral for loans, and people start using those loans to buy more Bitcoin, and a large portion of the US started doing that with mortgage sized loans, then we would start to have the same kind of problem.  If anyone ever convinces people it is smart to pay $1 for one whole Bitcoin, borrowing the rest because the Bitcoin price will always go up, then you have the same thing going on.

This is starting to feel like a circle, but I will go around again, if you are truly trying to help me understand, and not just mince words.  I think that because segwit has not been widely adopted, the benefits are currently small (and I still think they are excellent).  I think the benefits are not enough because it is not widely adopted and because they give a max 4x gain in throughput of it were 100% adopted, assuming I understand it well enough.  My opinion is that is still not enough throughput to keep up with today's demands.  Does it make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:35:00
Is that the typical transaction? That's how he presented it.  Again, the truth speaks loudly enough.  You can't even do the simplest payment for under $5 at the best times.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:03:18
I would have to say the sensible thing is to keep your money behind something you believe in.  I personally believe in both right now.  As soon as BTC can scale up to even current demand, I ribbon BCH will die, but BTC isn't there yet.  Certainly I think the OP was right to sell his BCH if he doesn't believe in BCH.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:46
Some good sense in a currently bonkers market.  I can only speak for me.  I believe the 10 year picture for Bitcoin development looks great. That puts the long term value higher than it is today.  I don't know if today's price is higher than the long term value. I think of it as positive expected value play.  There is a chance the global powers act to crush it.  But not 100%.  So if the 10% chance that crypto does take over means a 20x value, that is positive expected value.   Of course everyone has a different opinion on success percentages and future value.  But, that's why I hold, but not more than I could live with losing.  One day I hope to be able to spend it as crypto rather than selling for dollars. 
Personally, I see finance and governments embracing crypto, not fighting it.  That could change tomorrow, but look at CME, CBOE, Russia and Ethereum,  Venezuela, New York licensing, IRS rulings on how to tax gains, SEC interest, etc.  Public voices have been changing from derogatory to slightly open minded.  Only China seems to be fighting it a bit, and that's probably good.  Most of the world does not want to be seen as following China on monetary policy issues. Those are my thoughts, today anyhow.

Maybe instead of trying to wager and bankrupt the young man, he should have shared some wisdom.
Keep in mind too that the marginal value of money decreases as you get more.  Losing $100 if that is all you have is far worse than losing $100 if you have $10,000.

The same reason BTC die hard fans don't like that BCH is called "Bitcoin Cash" or that bitcoin.com is a BCH site.  It is a branding battle.  I expect ETH vs ETC had this same battle.  I personally think that BTC and BCH are both Bitcoin.  So is BTG and any other fork containing the Satoshi genesis block.  The question of the "real Bitcoin" is dumb. There is no trademark.  Nobody can rightfully claim they own the name.   All crypto coins are real if there is mining power to support them.  This is not highlander.  There can be more than one. The market will dictate which ones have value.  Cboe didn't make a futures contract on "Bitcoin".  They made a futures contract on the thing traded at the Gemini exchange under BTC.  That's why I always try to use ticker symbols.  It is the only thing that is well defined.  Soon, I expect BCH and BTC will be fighting the same battles with regulation, banks, etc.  Perhaps then we can realize we agree on 98% things.

It is not a zero sum game if the long term value is higher.  I hope those who bought at 19k did so with that in mind.  If so, this dip should not be a big deal.  If they were gambling that the price would fly up continuously and at the same rate, then they might get rekt.

Great answer.  Still looking for a plan somewhere that scales.   I am skeptical with LN.  I would welcome an alternative.  Bigger blocks doesn't get us all the way, but it is a start and would probably get us another six months down the road.  I don't know what BCH does if it takes over and gets full as well.  I have asked maybe a dozen times.   Iota? Some good ideas, but I am skeptical of that too.

Some are. That is true. And yes they are likely to panic sell. However, any particular price such as 1M or 10k are meaningless numbers. I personally think there will be enough that buy based on value, or potential future value (value, not price) that the speculation will cause noise, but not dominate the price.  Just my opinion.  Perhaps stated a bit more clearly today since I was a bit drunk last post! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:49:59

I definitely agree with you that if segwit were fully adopted today, we might have enough throughput for today.  My thought is that if eventually we will need bigger blocks, maybe we should do it now because segwit is not fully adopted.

Since being under 18, you are not an adult, assuming you live in the USA.  Contracts with minors are not always enforcible, which is part of why you can't do many financial things like take a car loan by yourself. Even your bank account has to be consigned, I believe.  Get a parent/guardian to help.  The worst case is that you buy a coin, the price goes way up, and they decide not to honor your purchases.  You would have to fight if that happened and might lose.  This is similar to minors playing slot machines.  There are stories of 17 year olds hitting the jackpot, but the casino didn't have to pay them (in fact was legally required not to pay them) since it was not legal for them to gamble.

First, the total amount of Bitcoin that will every exist is fixed, at 21 million.  The protocol guarantees that.  The amount mined is 12.5 every 10 minutes.  Roughly every 4 years, that number, the mining reward, is cut in half.  It started at 50 in 2009.
Second, nobody knows.  However, the most common guess is that the volatility would have to die down in order to make it a widely used currency.

I can't say I agree with you on "Bcash", but I fully expect to be downvoted here for stating my disagreement on that point.  It seems a deliberate attempt to make people angry, which is something I oppose.  People who don't know are quick to say "oh, I didn't know that" and change what they say.  Those who defend that "Bcash" is the right name to use are being deliberately provocative.  I don't use racial slurs, I don't call people by a nickname if they don't want it, and I won't do that with Bitcoin Cash.  Not because of Roger, but because the intelligent part of the BCH community (yes, they are there... hard to find, but they are there) asked me not to use it.  Also, keep in mind that Bip44 has a list of names for about 150 alt coins (maybe more by now).  Bip44 is adopted by the Core implementation, and that list has "Bitcoin Cash", not "Bcash".  So "Bcash" is also not the technically adopted name for that coin.  Of course, this wouldn't even be an argument if people just didn't get all fussy about it in the first place.  Roger invites people to egg him on every time he lets people under his skin.
Roger's past bothers more more than his present.  He's paid for his crimes, and I'm okay with that.  However, I don't feel like he has demonstrated better judgement than he did in his explosives business.  He probably has goals of reaching the world with digital currency... I don't doubt that.  I doubt even less that he has goals of massive wealth and being the biggest crypto personality in the world.  Frankly, he's got a ways to go before he's anywhere near John McAfee!  That's a special kind of crazy.

Father buys in for $3500.  The price drops 30% or so.  If the fathers sells, he gets $2400 or so.  5% to 10% gain in a year gets him to $2700 (less actually).  No where near the $3500 the son promised.   Assuming the father trusts the son to come through, he makes a great deal in the future sale compared to selling now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:20:38

"I believe it is too small" is a factual statement about my beliefs.  It is a fact. I can prove that it is true since I am the only authority on what I believe.

First, kudos for making intelligent arguments.  Reddit needs more people like you.
Both BTC and BCH are forks from what was launched in 2009.   Neither is the same code base either.   Both are downstream in github from the original release. Debian and Ubuntu are both Linux.  Both are registered trademarks, I believe.  I don't believe anyone registered the Bitcoin trademark.  And if nobody is enforcing it, that is likely an abandonment of the trademark to public domain.  But, I am a technologists, not a lawyer... You seem to be as well... so let's focus on technology.
If anyone is trying to learn what Bitcoin is, whatever they learn about BCH applies to BTC with one small exception, the block size.  By the time they get that far, they will understand forks and then will understand there are two things. If the name "Bitcoin cash" is designed to confuse people, why did core adopt it as the official name for that fork?  When someone looks up the bip44 path for "bcash", they won't find it.  That is confusing.  But honestly, the confusion argument is very weak.  I don't think anyone gets confused between York and New York, or Spain and Espange (sp?).  Many names are used for the same thing and similar names for different things all the time.  Humans can handle it.  
Ticker is unambiguous within a specific exchange. If you want to be really clear, state the exchange too, but my experience is that is not needed.  People just don't seem to get confused about this.  Maybe because no exchange uses BTC for "Bitcoin cash" nor BCH for "Bitcoin".  I am sure there is more than 1 person who got confused, at first. And then they learned more.  I am not sure that person would have been less confused if Bitcoin core adopted the name "bcash" rather than "Bitcoin cash". To be honest, I like the name bcash better.  But it is not the right name, so I won't use it. 
With the price of BTC 10x that of BCH,  the market has made it very clear which is the dominant Bitcoin. I don't let the little guys get under my skin.  Roger's crusade to slander Bitcoin core is the problem, not the name of the coin.  If Andreas Antonopoulos is right that the world cannot sustain two full scale pow systems, I am confident BTC wins that title.

I am not a tax expert, and will check with my tax preparation guy, but I am not confident he knows crypto yet.  I thought I only needed to report income, such as gains when selling.  (I have nothing in foreign accounts, but should I ever do that, I will definitely declare those holdings.)
@_date: 2018-09-01 03:29:54
The problem is not crypto, but reddit.  I will answer as I see things.  You commented on the respectability of someone the BTC community sees as a villain.  Perhaps you are unaware of that.  You might want to read up on the history of those people and judge for yourself.  Many people here feel victimized, so will respond angrily to anyone who supports those people, or the projects they work on. 
As for critiques of the BTC development efforts, I think this sub is generally welcoming of such criticism, so long as it doesn't seem like a BCH vs BTC argument.  I have seen rational big block discussions here.  Also criticisms of segwit that have been discussed rationally.  Also some of the folks developing Bitcoin Core.  Just make rational objective arguments and you won't get as many angry replies.   If you do get nonresponsive answers, I encourage you to ignore those and wait for other answers.

It sort of makes me want to antagonize him as well, playing as dirty as he does.  I choose not to.  I also admit part of me is glad others are willing to fight that fight.  Mostly, I hold, confident BTC dominates.  Only Roger keeps BCH floating, I suspect.   Anyhow, thanks for the fun and educational discussion on this. Definitely refreshing.
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:28:28
This.  
To add a bit... All currency has value because someone trusts that someone else will accept it in the future in exchange for something that matters (food, etc.).  "backing" helps encourage trust, but is not needed for trust.  Lack of inflation helps with trust, but does not guarantee it. 
I think for now, trust in USD or BTC is sane.  Both have huge organizations that stand to lose a lot if the trust is lost.  I personally believe it is harder to break the (decentralized) trust with BTC.  Time will tell.

I am thinking of opening a BTC only store, where I will fix prices in BTC.  No floating price based on the USD price of BTC.  This is real.  In this store, I will not sell for USD. I will lose sales that way, yes.  But, how does this fit into the conversation?  Yes, for the right amount of USD, I would be willing to sell any product that I also sell for BTC, but my store will only accept BTC.  I am in the US.  Am I still using USD as my scale? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:05:11
BTC is also priced in eur, gbp, ltc, eth, number of hours I would work, ounces of gold, etc.  Does that make all of those things exact scales?  Maybe.  All are units of measure.  If that is your point, I agree.  But the measure of one in terms of the other will change based on the relative supply and demand of each asset.  USD is perhaps the most stable scale to use, and has also become a standard, but it still had its own supply and demand, which impacts all rates of exchange with USD.  Double the supply of USD, and all prices would go up, would you agree? (I don't mean the supply of paper bills.)
Consider this scenario... I have a favorite pen.  I will never sell it for USD.  I would sell it for 1BTC.  I don't care what the BTC/USD exchange rate is.   I will never give you a price in terms of USD... I will not sell it for USD.  Only BTC.  That might seem irrational to you, which I can respect.  However, go with it.  Can you say I price my pen in USD? USD is just one way we price things.  Just as Celsius is just one way we measure temperature.

If you entered a contract to exchange BTC for cash, you are obligated to make the BTC transaction until it is "good".  That, or return the cash.  Doesn't matter who did the attack.  But really that's what a court would decide in the law suit process.

It is applying existing tax code to BTC, not new code nor "arbitrary", unless you consider the original tax code arbitrary, I guess.   I also believe they are talking about a $600 tax and reporting exemption.  Not sure what that means though.  Total of 600 for a year? For each transaction?

100% agree.  I think it will take a groundswell of people taking the risks of pricing things in BTC for it to go to the next level.  US is probably not the place.  Places where hyperinflation is happening or feared to happen will be the first places, I think.  Their risk with the government money is as high or higher than their risk with BTC.

Celsius is a scientific scale, provable and unchanging.  USD as a scale is not.  You can use number of cars, gallons of oil, etc. as a measure of value as well, but all change.  That is where your analogy breaks down.  There is an exchange rate with USD, which we call "price".  That rate can change by either side of the exchange gaining or losing value.  When the prices of all goods go up at the same time, it is more accurate to say the value of the dollar fell.  The same way you would think your thermometer needed calibration if it kept measuring the boiling point of water at 110.  You would think the scale had changed, not the boiling point of water.
I am not sure where I stand on inflation being a good thing.  You make good points. I also think the world would benefit from a bit more saving/holding and a bit less spending.

 BTC 10 minute time is not a huge concern,  especially for small purchases.  The vendor can see that you submitted a transaction within seconds.  Confirmations prevent double spend attacks.  Those are hard to do.  Most vendors can risk a 10 minute float.  If you do cheat them, don't expect to remain a customer.  VPN or similar service can shut you off.  Merchants of physical products don't ship for a while anyhow.  So at shipping time they can check the confirmations.  A coffee shop might lose, but usually only a single coffee.  Restaurants already risk giving you food and drink without asking for payment first.  There are still other issues with taking BTC payments, but the 10 minutes is not a huge issue.

Getting segwit from the battlefield this time last year to 38% adoption in under a year is pretty amazing. So many called it vaporware.  And also LN.

I think in theory, 0 transactions on chain is possible if you buy LN coins from someone else, like an exchange. I don't fully understand how, but I think there are solutions in the works.  The chain becomes an enforcement layer at that point.

Right. I see.  I think you are asking a general grouo of reddit people for an explanation of decisions made by Bitcoin developers.  But I am not sure.  My understanding (no real hard evidence here) is that the Bitcoin core team mostly thinks larger blocks will be needed eventually, but other technology should come first.  In not sure I agree, and I definitely won't pretend I know their minds.
Developing new software takes time.  Especially globally networked and distributed software.  If the world gave up on a technology because it didn't work perfectly within a year, where would we be?  Watch for improvements, progress, and new ideas.  If those stop flowing, that would be bad news indeed.  As long as they are, I am confident in the long game.
Also, re Satoshi, I think the current devs have a lot more information, experimental results, and just plain thinking time behind their current approach than Satoshi had.  This does not diminish his world changing work.  He is the giant, and current devs are standing on his shoulders.  I think we should be careful to treat the original white paper as infallible.

The government still can (and should) enforce laws and protect people from crimes, including helping get restitution.  This is similar to someone robbing me of my cash, or conning me out of it.  It will be hard to get back, but there are laws and agencies the government put in place to help with that, at least in well governed countries.  Indeed, it is much harder to collect restitution because you cannot simply force a bank to reverse the transaction. 
I think this is a case of the general rule that with increased freedom comes increased risk.  People have the freedom to drive.  Some will crash and die.  Some will kill others.  Are we better with or without this freedom?  Same question for Bitcoin.   Reasonable people can disagree on both.
I think most people in the world are more at risk of corruption in government taking their money/value than those committing financial crimes. I suppose people in Venezuela would agree, but maybe Madoff investors would not?

If you download the Bitcoin software that will download the entire blockchain and become part of the network that makes Bitcoin work.  Each computer doing this is a "node".  Your computer would then help keep the network alive, strong, and most importantly, secure.  Your computer helps verify that no transactions are double spends or people trying to spend other people's money.  If you have the hard drive space, I highly recommend you try it.  It is free software, and you don't need to own BTC to run a node.

It sounds like you are arguing an opinion rather than asking questions to educate yourself about Bitcoin, but that's fine.  I'll share mine too.  I personally don't see why it matters what Satoshi would prefer other than he is likely a strong technical engineer and would probably have good advice.  There are many good engineers out there and they have one thing in common.  They respect the views of others and listen to technical arguments, then form an objective opinion.  That's what I think Satoshi would have done.   And if that opinion was to change the protocol, or blocksize , or anything else, he would have considered it on its merits, not enslaving his mind to his original paper.
Would he want 1GB blocks today?  Or would he want LN?  I don't know.  I cannot pretend to guess.  Since he is not peaking out, I will weigh modern (technical) opinions based on lessons learned in the past 10 years higher than those written a decade ago.  What I think is great is that Lal the ideas can be tried, and the best ones will survive.

I do think there is a meaningful difference between them being able to take your things without any action from you.  Yes, they have to find the gold, but the government is pretty good at finding things. 
That said, I agree 100% that people need to obey their laws.  You (a general "you" here) don't like that your laws say you have to pay tax X?  Try to change the laws.  Every time someone dodges paying taxes, that is stealing from everyone else.  (And yes, I think the government is wasteful and grabs cash wherever they can.  But that doesn't give me the right to steal from you.)

This all makes sense.  Especially:


I can't say I understand how it is different with or without a common currency.  I guess with independent currencies you can hide the government controlled movement of money from rich to poor.  Is that right?  That is, if Greece could borrow in their own currency, then just inflate the currency to reduce the value of the debt, that does move value from rich to poor.  I suppose I think it should be explicit.  Redistributing wealth from rich to poor does seem like a good role of a central government.

I personally don't think so.  Freedom to dispose of your money the way you see fit, without having to get permission from banks and governments does not imply that it is okay to con people.  Market manipulation is the idea that you make people think things are worth more or less than they actually are, so that you can profit by taking the other side.  This is a confidence game, and (usually) a crime.  I do not think that Bitcoin success makes it okay to commit crimes.

Agreed that scammers are bad.  FUD is bad if untrue and good if true.  Stealing is bad.   I read Reddit every day,  and nothing the BCH folks have posted have affected my opinions of BTC at all.   Maybe I am unusual in that.   Would you prefer the communities be one again so that those you blame have more credibility than they have now?  Think of BCH and r/btc as a new playground to contain those thieves,  scammers, FUDers and liers.  It should be easier to teach people (like me?) when there are two clear camps.
Confusing addresses are indeed a problem.   I hadn't thought about that much.    Good point.  Is that the same as a replay attack?  Inform me... I honestly don't know.  Why didn't the hard fork use a new address format?  That does seem like an obvious thing to do.
I thought replay protection had to do with me spending on one chain and someone distant changing my transaction a bit to apply the same transaction on the other chain without me knowing.   Does the BCH fork prevent that?  The articles I have read said out does, but I want to be sure.  Based on your comments, I Fear using either chain.  I have Uncertainty and Doubt that what I have read is correct.  You have given me FUD.  Is it good FUD (i.e. true)?

Best not to equate the marginal cost of mining to the "cost to generate" a BTC.  Think of all 21M coins having been generated day 1, by definition of the protocol.   These are issued slowly.  
Mining cost is a lower bound measure of how the miners value a BTC, which is a good measure as it reflects a human willing to exchange something valuable for BTC.   A better one is a free market, where people express personal valuation based on their bids.  That's what gives BTC value, people willing to exchange something for it.  Something that itself has value, such as electricity or USD or food or gold. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:54:37
Not sure what you mean about me being "wrong about most".  I was listing things that gave BTC higher value for me.  I am not wrong about those.  (I might be wrong to think those should make BTC more vuluable, but that is indeed my opinion) maybe I am alone, but I don't think so.

Well, the futures will settle in actual BTC.  So if the futures are cheap, buy them and wait... They turn into BTC.  I mean actual BTC... They will ask for your public key for tranferring the BTC.

Not smiling on someone is a big leap from convicting them.  A civil court is likely to help.  Be careful, that's the point.  If I double pay someone, and then come after them to pay me back in court, even if I win, they might have spent the money before I even filed a suit, at which point it is gone, and if they are broke, there is nothing to collect.  It is a good lesson to be careful with the tools and learn about Bitcoin before using it heavily.  Gladly, this one worked out well.

Honestly, I think the world more and more is moving toward people thinking "spend most of what I have saved before I die".  Sure, it is nice to leave something to the kids, but just having a huge balance does little to increase life quality. You have to spend it on something to get that value. That is, people will spend.  Also, after the value goes up, people are more willing to spend a bit.  If you need more encouragement, the "death tax" can give it. Again, this will encourage spending of fortunes.  That might be tricky/impossible to enforce with BTC, but maybe. 
I personally think the known future supply of BTC is more important than and risks associated with deflation.

With silk road, the private keys were saved on the computer.   Even if the government knows you have BTC, they cannot take it from you.  They can, of course, order you to give it to them, and imprison you (or worse) if you don't.  Crypto doesn't stop abuse of power, it merely makes it harder.

To add a bit to this excellent answer, only the public key is need to see the balance.  In the case of most wallets, there is a master public key.  From this, all other public keys can be determined.  The wallet software usually does search up many public keys.  In some cases, it doesn't find all of your coin and you must tell it to look harder.  This search effort when done with someone else's node can expose a lot of information about you, possibly connecting your public keys together in a log file somewhere.  This is another argument to run your own node.  If you download all blocks, your own computer can do that search and no other computers know the search was done.

Multi-gigabyte blocks might be possible one day, but the technology is definitely not there yet.  Try downloading 1GB on your computer and see how long it takes.   Even with good internet, that takes a long time.  Hard drives have trouble keeping up with that write speed.  Yes, one day we will have such hardware, but it is years away, and get to g it distributed around the world to allow everyone to verify in a trustless manner would take longer.  That said, if nothing better is proposed, that would be a possible solution.  I could see being there maybe 20 years from now.
As for Satoshi's vision, two thoughts.  First, it irritates me a bit when people treat him as a religious figure.  If he were speaking out today, I think he would be quite happy to make improvements to his original ideas.  That's the way innovation works.  Nobody gets it perfect day 1 and the good innovators constantly improve.  Now, perhaps Satoshi's genius would add brilliant ideas that nobody else would consider. Sadly, he is not sharing ideas (that we know of!)  so we must build on his genius and improve where we can.  Again, that might just be huge blocks, but i sure hope we get things that go further.
I would like to see true anonymity.  I'd like to see obfuscated transaction amounts.  I'd like scalability far beyond billions of tx per day... I'd like to be able to pay for electricity by the watt-second in real-time. And water by the drop.  I'd like my paycheck minute by minute.  Expenses and income could be a constant flow rather than the slow process we have today.  This would mean trillions or even quadrillion of tx per day at scale.  And there is little value to keeping all of them.  They could be summarized and grouped in cryptographically secure ways.  I don't know if these are all good ideas, but they are ideas that modify the original design, and I think Satoshi would approve.  I think he would disapprove if such ideas were not being considered.

Some of the other in-dev ideas might help, but don't get all the way there.  All of these are my opinions, of course.  I do believe the crypto communities are trying lots of things and those that are most effective at solving the big problems will be the ones to get adoption at the billions level.

You don't need to sync.  You can look at your public key and search the web based block explorers to see the balance there.  That will give you comfort.  You can also get to your private key without syncing.  If I were you, I would learn to do that.  Then you can import it into wallet software that does not need to sync.  Some can talk to nodes that have synced and piggy back off those.  This will let you make transactions.  I would recommend buying a Trezor and then sending your BTC to that wallet.  Above all, practice with the tools and learn to use them before sending real coin.  Try the test network.
As for the small size of the wallet.dat file, that is normal.  The only thing in there are the public /private keys.  That's not where the blocks go.
Good luck! Ask specific questions here and you will get answers.  NEVER POST YOUR PRIVATE KEY. If you do, the BTC will be gone in seconds.

Definitely safe.  Keep the backup words safe and even if the device gets destroyed you will still have access to the btc.  But the device itself should be fine under normal conditions.  
As for forks, you can always deal with them after the fact. They don't alter anything.  They just give you rights/coin on another chain that you can access with the same private key.  If you had untouched BTC since 2010, you would also have access to bhc and btg with the same key. 
As for protocol updates, they will also not alter the fundamental ability to send your BTC with your key.  At worst, you'd need to upgrade your Trezor in five years (again, keep those words safe!)

First, if (and I emphasize "if") LN (lightning network) goes mainstream, it will likely be highly decentralized.  Certainly more so than mining.  You and I can make our own channels that nobody else knows about.  The LN relies on the Bitcoin blockchain  for security.  Channels don't need to be closed.  That would be a rare event, only done in the case of fraud, etc.  If LN is mainstream, there would be places to buy and sell directly LN channel Bitcoin.  You might buy, use, sell all without an on chain transaction.
Second, it could also require more improvements to in chain transaction throughout at billions of users, which would happen over time, as needed.
These things must happen for adoption to grow to billions of daily users.  So the scenario you describes only happens if the problems have been solved. Hmm... That sounds a bit anthropic... Let me try another way.... You should not feel confident Bitcoin will ever have that level of use unless you feel confident those problems will be solved.  Act based on your beliefs of the future solutions.

Yes, things could change.  Your question is about why Bitcoin.  So far, things haven't changed.   Market cap is meaningless.  Libra?  I suppose you don't really read up on these things.  What in the world makes you think libra has taken over anything?  It hasn't even launched and might never launch.  I personally think it is a sane idea, but it is not decentralized, so does not have immutability.   Will it get there? Who knows?  Would you prefer bet on the horse in front running the fastest, or one that hasn't even showed up at the gate?
Hash power will move when trust moves? Sort of.  Hash power will move when price increases. For POW coins, anyhow.   Yes, it could happen.  You could flip heads 50 times in a row, it is possible. Just unlikely.

1)   With BTC, the supply increases at a known rate.  With USD, you never know how much debt will be added each year.  I think deflationary is less important than "known supply".  That said, inflation penalizes me for saving cash.  I am penalized for not taking risks with my money.  That indeed might be better for the economy as a whole, but might not be what I want to do.  Shouldn't there be better ways to encourage investments than decreasing the value of my savings? 
2) BTC has the largest network effect.  I don't argue that any crypto will take over fiat, but if one does, and most coins are very similar in other properties, it is most convenient to use the one that is most popular now.  It would take something quite compelling for the world to retool and focus on a different one.  It has been close at times. There have been battles.  But BTC is at the top, showing evidence that it is the most trusted.  And the primary value any currency has is the probability that someone will accept it as valuable.  The longer this lasts, the more that trust grows.  At this point, I think it has been long enough that others cannot catch up. 
You lost me in your comment about fed coin... I'll skip that.
For blockchain, immutability is protected by the amount of global hash power put into mining.  This is the world's first immutable record.  Bitcoin has enough hash power that the entire planet cannot produce enough energy to alter the history.  The existing Miners could, but then they would destroy their value and power by doing so.  No other coin can claim nearly that level of immutability.
So why Bitcoin?  What is unique about it? It is the biggest with the most hash power and highest level of trust.  Also the biggest network.  I believe it also has the largest number of developers.

All of the time is for the first confirmation.  That's the one where a miner included your transaction in a block.  Each block mined after that is an additional "confirmation".  So once you see the first one, you are really goldeb, just wait about 20 minutes.

The fee in a transaction is simply unspent inputs.  It is not computed in sat/byte.  It is computed in sat.  It is the Miners that use sat/byte to optimize their income, selecting the most fees they can fit in a block.  Because of that, the wallet apps all use sat/byte.  It makes sense.  
However, if you can build your own transaction, the fee can be as small as 1 sat total.  Be careful if doing this.  Transaction errors are a good way to lose BTC.  If you really want to try, it suggest creating an unsigned zero fee transaction as usual, then look at it and manually adjust the change output to the amount you want.  (that is, reduce it by the fee amount).  Then sign the new transaction and publish it.   Just be aware Miners might consider it a zero fee transaction for selection purposes.
If little of this makes sense, check out Andreas Antonopoulos's Mastering Bitcoin book.  It is free on github, and it explains the transaction structure in detail.

Keep good records (learn where to download them if you use an exchange). Price, time, qty is enough.  Then when thinking of selling or trading them for something else, talk to a tax professional.
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:58:34
Correct.  In the world of futures contracts, there are "cash settled", meaning you pay or collect the price difference in cash, or "physical settled", meaning the actual commodity is delivered to you.  If you buy a physically settled future on coffee, for instance, someone will ask you where you want the coffee beans delivered.  This makes sense for factories.  The finance world usually sells the contract on the last day to someone who needs coffee, but someone ultimately will pick up that delivery.  For "physical Bitcoin" it likely means you will provide a Bitcoin address to receive the Bitcoin at the settlement date.   The other person must send a coin to that address.  Probably Bakkt tries to make all of this easy.
Edit: more info
The details say :
"Final settlement for both contracts will be at the Bakkt Warehouse."
This is also a throwback to real products.  Some products (I think corn is one?) have a central warehouse that holds the product.  Making or taking delivery is done by sending trucks there.  For Bitcoin, the"Bakkt warehouse" is probably their wallet.  You make delivery by sending 1BTC to their wallet, and accept delivery by providing an address for Bakkt to send you 1BTC from their wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:42:15
That sounds right.  A future contract is where you agree on a price and quantity now, for a trade in the future.  "on July 1st I will buy 1btc from you for $x".  For the daily it is "at midnight, I will buy 1btc from you for $x".  (I don't know that midnight is the time... Read the fine print.)
A good example is a miner.  He might want to lock in today's price for coins mined over the rest of the month, so he would sell futures contracts, and make the trade later (when he has the coins).  You might think the price will shoot up between now and then, so you buy the contracts.  Same idea on a daily scale.  
The daily idea is a good one for merchants.  If I sell you my car for 1BTC, maybe I sell a futures contract as well, locking in my USD price.  Your transaction is confirmed maybe an hour later, but the price has fallen.  I'm not sad, because I locked in the price.

So a technical mean reversion model.  It works well until it doesn't. The challenge is you don't know if it will come back in line because the price moves or because the VWAP catches up.  Bet yes, there is still validity to mean reversion.

Ledger might not show the balance until 6 blocks are mined on top of your transaction.  (if you don't know what that means, read up on how Bitcoin works.  Probably best to understand what you own.)
I concur that it is safe to post the transaction ID.  People here can help you lookup the status.  Of course, you can do that yourself in one of the block explorers.  They will usually show pending transactions and also how deep yours is.
Also, for all who read this that are learning or not totally comfortable, practice first with small amounts, such as $5.  I expect this transaction will show up, but always better to practice with the same tools and coin you will send for the full amount.
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:05:16
Agreed.  Just trying to fill in details for others.  My opinion is that the blockchain is one piece of Bitcoin.  Perhaps one of 6 or 7.  Using blockchain without the rest is nearly useless.  But also, aren't Merkle trees kept within each block?  The blockchain is a linked list of nodes, each with a Merkle tree of transactions, right?

A key thing to remember with LN is you can only lose if you accept payments (and also have a bad actor and you don't have something watching).  So for most people, there is no risk of losing LN money.  Merchants will have to be careful.  Also before we use it for something like Venmo, we'll want a bit more system maturity I think.

Often futures sellers already have the BTC, or have a likely source, such as mining.   Some of the rest will simply buy a futures contract near expiration date.  But yes, some are likely to need to buy BTC to deliver.  And some who get delivery may sell after delivery.  It is all a bit complex.

If you owned bitcoin on coinbase when the BCH fork happened,  coinbase owes you the same amount in BCH that you had in BTC at that moment.   The last I read,  they committed to getting everyone their BCH by January 1st.  You won't be able to tell on block chair because you don't have the actual address or transaction to look up.    You have a reference number or account number that coinbase uses to keep track of your balance.   Keeping a balance on exchanges (all the ones I know about) is like trusting a bank with your cash.   Probably they will do the right thing and not lose your money.  Probably they will give it back when you ask for it.   Probably.   But not a guarantee.   With bitcoin it is more complex.   You also trust them to give you any forked coin balances.   They could decide nobody gets to have their BCH... "After all,  you bought BCH"  Fortunately,  coinbase didn't say that.   But it is taking them a while to issue the BCH.  Note that because they hold the actual keys,  they do have the BCH to give.  They just have a fair bit of work to do.  Be patient and it will come.   
For now,  if you currently have a balance on coinbase,  the s2x fork is coming.   Keeping your balance there gives them trust again.   Coinbase seems more prepared for this one.   They said you should not have to wait for your S2X coin.  If you don't want to trust them,  withdraw your coins to a wallet you control (keys you control).  If you control the keys,  toy are trusting yourself not to lose the seed/key and paraphrase.

All legit US exchanges will require it.  It is for the fiat side of things.  Companies that do financial business in USD are required to know the identity of their customers.

Tl;dr: No
You only need it plugged in to see/copy a public address to send to.  After that, you don't need it in.  You "own" any coin sent to that  address because you also have the private key, which is safe on your ledger.   The private key is what lets you forward the transaction on to someone else's public address.  The transactions never actually go to the ledger nano device.   The exchange publishes the transaction to the peer to peer network, miners confirm it by including it in a mined block, and the transaction is forever in the public block chain.  The ledger nano software shows your balance by looking up your public addresses in a copy of the block chain.  Trezor works the same way.

Ask yourself why you bought the BTC in the first place.  Something convinced you to trade $10,000 for 1btc.  You valued 1btc at $10000 or more at the time.  Does that reason still exist?  Do you still see that value in 1btc?  Better, do you see the value of 1btc as more or less than the market price?  If more, keep the BTC.  If less, trade for USD.  Nobody here will know how you do, or should, value 1 btc. Either action is rational/correct depending on your views.  What doesn't matter much (tax tricks aside - ask a tax professional about those), is the original price you paid.

If you had 1btc that you bought a year ago, there is an "unspent transaction" that only you can spend,  by using your private key.   You can spend it on every fork by using the appropriate software for each fork.   You can import your keys, create transactions,  and send them to the network.   This is hard for mortals, but gives you full control.    So,  the wallet developers,  such as Trezor and coinbase,  try to make it easier.   Each one does it in a different way.  I would carefully read whatever faq they write on the topics.  Coinbase keeps your key,  so they have control, and could even choose not to let you spend on the forked coin!  Or,  as with BCH, they might take months to add a feature for you to spend.
Hope that much helps for now.   Ask more.  Bottom line is that until you plan to sell or spend,  there is nothing you need to do, provided you have your own keys.  Do you plan to sell or spend soon?

Ask him again.   Offer to pay him back over time if it goes badly.   Make a budget.   Offer to do extra chores to cover the cost.   Learn enough to explain the math and network behind it.   Walk him through the tutorials and show him a running network.   Your thoroughness and maturity might win through and convince him to buy some for you.   If bitcoin continues to go,  you should still be very happy by the time you are 18.  If bitcoin tanks, you won't miss the money you had to pay off over time, and you will have leaned a lot that will help your career and life.  I don't know a father who could say no to that kind of dedication.

Trezor or ledger

Search for your addresses there.   NOT your private key.
The BCH fork happened over the summer,  
The coins you own are represented by one or more "unspent transactions" (UTXO -- unspent transaction output), which you control with your private keys.  Those transactions are yours.   You can spend them by creating a new transaction on the chain.   Yours becomes "spent", and whomever you sent the payment to owns the new transaction. 
Forks start at a specific block number.  Every transaction is in a block.   If your unspent transactions are in blocks that are before the fork block number,  you can spend the transaction on both chains because the chains don't recognize transactions from the other chain.  You therefore own both coins.
So,  find your transactions.   Check the block number against the fork block number.   The blockchair.com site helps.  You don't need to do anything if toy have the keys.  10 years from now you can create spending transactions on both chains, and and forks that happened along the way.   
Note that there was a recent fork for "bitcoin gold" that has market value (For now at least).

Imagine you invested $100 in BTC because that is what you are comfortable risking.  Your exposure is $100.  If the value goes up to $500, you are now risking $500 on your BTC investment.  The extra &amp; 400 is gains, but it is your money and you are rising it on BTC.  Are you suddenly comfortable with a $500 risk?  
I ask myself... If I sold all of my BTC, and that money was in the bank , how much would I want to reinvest?  If it is the full amount, I don't sell.  If not, I should sell some.
It is smart to ask these questions in pure dollar figures, as in the example, and also as a percentage of your wealth.  In the example, if you started with $600 in the bank and invested the $100, that was about 17% of your money.  Then the BTC became $500, your total value is $1000, and now 50% of your money is in BTC.  Make sure you are comfortable with that.

 This user is pointing out that to spend the forked coin,  you need to use software that supports the forked coin.   That depends on the development schedule of the ledger developers, which might not be quick, or might not happen at all.   However,  since you have the key (aka. your seed), you could go download any software that supports spending the forked coin and import your key,  then spend away.   Even if ledger goes out of business and your nano burns up, you can get to your coins with the key.  If coinbase were to go out of business (unlikely,  but always possible), you would likely lose some or all of your coin.   So, the decision is between security and convenience.   If you want to sell S2X quickly,  having your BTC at coinbase at the fork time might be the easiest way to go, and requires you trust them.   If you plan to hold both long term,  keeping the BTC on the nano (keys you control) is more secure, and requires no trust.

Crypto is taxed.  At least in the US, if you earn anything of value,  you owe taxes.  At the right level,  taxes are a good thing.   As is redistribution of wealth.   Society will make these things happen, regardless of the currency.   There will also always be the haves vs have-nots issues.   Crypto gives the holder of the wealth more control.   I personally think that is a good thing.  I believe it encourages governments to grant freedoms.  I believe that is good.

In this scenario, if I offered the camera for trade for some amount of BTC and someone accepted the trade, then yes, I would honor my agreement, even if the BTC price in USD dropped a lot.  Maybe not everyone would, but I would.  I honor my agreements.  I actually think most people do. 
But this scenario is contrived.  If I want $300 for the camera, then I would price it as $300, not in BTC. If I wanted 0.1 (or whatever) BTC, I would price it that way and I wouldn't care about the USD value.  I would not price in BTC if what I want to be paid in USD.
Of course none of this changes the fact that if we enter into a trade agreement, then it is fair.  Consider another scenario.  If you buy the camera for $300,and love it.  Then a month later the store has a sale, selling the same thing for $200, was your purchase for $300 somehow unfair?   If so, why?

Long term, equilibrium will be where the cost of mining is equal to the mining rewards.  So:
Energy spent * energy price = (constant) * BTC price * (block reward + typical fee)
As the reward shrinks (halvenings) mining energy will go down by half.  But as the BTC price goes up x%, mining energy will go up by x%.  And if energy prices go up by y%, mining energy will go down by y%. This all assumes hardware is available.  If not, it takes time to establish equilibrium. 
There are also values Miners see in mining at a loss at times, such as anticipated future prices or political gains.  But in theory those will die out over time.

It is reasonable, but not fail proof.  All strategies like this have a scenario where they fail.  This one fails when the market doesn't reverse, such as in a steady climb up or down, or a drop/climb that stays low/high for a long time.   You end up buying near the top or selling near the bottom.  His results also might have some survivorship bias.  He sold in the 6k range, and bought back in the 3k range... Why didn't he buy back in the 5k range as the price "spiked" down from 6k to 3k?  Did he guess correctly that 3k would be a new bottom rather than 5k or 4k?
None of this "debunks" the strategy. It just debunks the "you can't lose" tone of the message.   Before using this, research other strategies and find how they fail. Pick one where you think the chance of failing is low. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:09:42

By selling for BTC you make a bet on bitcoin.   So do I, and I am comfortable with it.   Some legitimate bitcoin users are not as comfortable.

Just to be clear,  the BIP44 table of coins,  which is adopted by the BTC standard implementation, refers to BCH as "Bitcoin Cash".   Note that this is BTC's standard, not BCH's.   So when you explain weakness of "bcash", new users won't all realize you are taking about BCH.  I didn't.  I think BCH is an alt coin, but maybe call it BCH to avoid confusion?  Of course if the goal is not to avoid confusion,  but is to wage war,  I can understand that too.   It does make r/btc angry. 
I also find it odd that this post is about an alt coin,  but allowed to stay in this sub. When I asked a question about what we call BCH, my post was redirected by moderators,  appropriately,  to a different sub.  Maybe I wasn't angry enough?

Well said.   It is a good reminder that speaking about flaws in crypto isn't always spreading FUD.  Btc doesn't work for you right now.   It will get better.   It is improving.   The flame wars are mostly people differing on opinions of how to make it better.   Most alt coins exist because of different opinions on that.   Kudos for sticking to your opinions and speaking up.   Kudos to the community for giving you the benefit of the doubt.
Keep in mind that venmo and other bank based systems are not available everywhere in the world.   Other alt coins are also cheaper to send right now,  in part because they have less adoption.  I am a believer that having many crypto options is a good thing.   Pick the ones that work for you.

Electrum is the BTC client.   You should have your own keys in that case.   (That 12 or 24 word phrase is equivalent to your key. )  so no work required.  After the B2X fork,  look for a B2X version of electrum.   (For example, BCH has "electron cash").  Import your private key into that client and you should see the balance.  Spend with that client and you are sending B2X.  The electrum balance should not change.

Think about what you mean by "fair".  That means different things to everyone.  If I have an extra chicken and you have some extra wool, we might trade them and both be happier at the end of the trade.  Same goes for selling services or goods for BTC.  If I am happy selling my services for BTC at a price you are happy to pay, then we make a trade that we are both happy to make.  Further, we both *agree* to make that trade.  
What makes it "fair"? Simply that we both agreed to make the trade.  Really, it is better than fair.  It is mutually beneficial.   Volatility of the price of BTC in USD has nothing to do with it.

Stock market highs have made the news for decades.  It is a good sign if our excitement over them decreases.  That might mean the price reflects value rather than excitement.

I've seen this argument before.  I don't know that I totally understand it.  I'd love a dialog on this to learn something.  Consider a stock IPO for a company that claims a value of $500M.  The company sells maybe 10% of ownership, say 1M shares and the market pays $100M.  That will put a market value at $1B and stock price of $100.  It didn't take $500M of cash to give it a $1B valuation or $100 share price.  It only took $100M and the belief that the company is worth that.  The preexisting shareholders all have more wealth, but didn't put in more money.  This seems comparable to Bitcoin.  You don't need the full market cap increase to be paid in cash.  You just need today's buyers and sellers to believe it is worth more and the wealth is created (on paper). What do you think?

I'm not sure.  Maybe? It can be hard to spend a sliver of gold though.  If you have, say a tenth of an Oz, and want to spend $10 worth on food or rent.  That is not easy. Also, cavity searches happen.  And if someone knows you have gold, they might try to steal it when you are not looking.  Of course the wrench threat exists for both. 
But really, I just mean unbanked  people using it for normal life things.  This is where I think the most utility exists.  It's a long time before we see that at high levels.

I also used to think of inflation that way.  I think a better argument is that there is no centralized control over inflation with BTC. No government to decide to print and spend faster to cause inflation. 
I personally believe that printing more money at the right rate is an important role of the government.  "At the right rate" is key.  As population (demand for money) grows, it is a good thing to have more of it.  But all governments abuse it. The decentralized governance of Bitcoin is a good thing.

Want an answer or just wanting to rant?  For me, it is not about price.  Bitcoin is different due to the POW behind it.  It does make a difference.  Also the dev team and community.  Other coins have some of the key elements, but very few.  And none the strength of BTC. I won't comment on price, and note that this is my opinion and why I still think BTC is the strongest.

The missing idea is that a busy network would have funds flowing in all directions.  When the exchanges play, a merchant to whom payments flow could sell lnd funds on the exchange.  Customers would buy them on the exchange.   This would send the lnd funds the other direction.  Or, one day the merchant could pay employees and suppliers in lnd, flowing funds back the other way.

I suppose even gold and silver can be used to defraud the population.  I've heard the Roman empire fell in large part due to devaluation of the money by people cutting off small parts and passing the rest of the coin on.

Maybe I can help.  Yes $1 is $1.  Same argument.  The point is that a lot of people (not all people) value Bitcoin for its own merits, not based on what the open market is currently willing to pay.  Same can be said for $1.  If you find merit in the USD system (most people do), then you don't have to think about how many gbp or eur someone else will pay for that $1.
I personally try to look at all angles.  The 1 BTC = 1 BTC argument is simply (to me at least) that we should not focus as much on market price.

Did you mean to refer to all ages between "infant" and late stage elderly as a "sliver of the population"?  I don't think the Franklin quote prevents us from helping those who need help.  The idea is we don't need the government to require that people take the help.   For example, requiring we use a bank to hold our money might make the money safer, but it restricts liberty.  Having banks as a protected option is useful in many cases.   I think innovation will find the right balance.

1btc = 1btc is not a "store of value" argument, at least not for what most people mean when they say  store of value" (i.e. store of buying power).  That's perhaps why people call it a "stupid" argument.  Those people are arguing a different point.

Honesty,  I don't want banks investing in crypto.   Let the masses do it.   Most people will buy and hold,  or buy and use.   Banks could have too much impact right now if they piled in.  If banks have a place in crypto,  i think it would be to hire some good crypto guys and offer a convenient and secure way for mom and pop to invest, without having to learn about private keys.   I am not sure that is possible,  but if it is,  banks doing it would make my mom and pop more comfortable.

I argue decentralized, trustlessis currency is the _only_ application for blockchain.  It ties together pow with value (reward) to produce an immutable history.  That's all it can do, and it is enough!  I really doubt there is any other valid use for blockchain, which is fine. 
Otoh, crypto, smart contracts, and p2p networking might be useful for traditional banks.  Imagine if you could anonymously deposit USD in an atm and get back a private key for spending.   That might be useful. Or, consider a crypto smart contract (in usd) for a mortgage or employment agreement.  Make a sale? Taxes come out automatically... no paperwork, no IRS audits.  There is a place in the world for trust systems and banks, and I think they need better tech... Just not blockchain.

Regardless of causes or blame,  the crisis has caused a lot of interest in crypto.   For one reason,  risk profiles have changed.   I owned Citibank shares that went from $52 to perhaps $3.  Banks were supposed to be the low risk item in my portfolio.  The financial advisors were saying "hold".  This experience left me much more willing to invest in crypto,  and keep money there, even in light of the volatility and risk.  I am not the only one.  I don't see the crisis as, "we can't trust banks."  I see it as,  "all investments can fail."

It feels like a pump and dump.  People have no faith in the unbacked paper money, so create a new fiat, saying that it is backed by oil, use new words and technology like cryptocurrency, and people will trust it for a while. Government can still print as much as they want ("we have lots more oil than we thought!") and play the inflation game again.  It is fiat money printing in sheep's clothing.

I argue decentralized, trustlessis currency is the _only_ application for blockchain.  It ties together pow with value (reward) to produce an immutable history.  That's all it can do, and it is enough!  I really doubt there is any other valid use for blockchain, which is fine. 
Otoh, crypto, smart contracts, and p2p networking might be useful for traditional banks.  Imagine if you could anonymously deposit USD in an atm and get back a private key for spending.   That might be useful. Or, consider a crypto smart contract (in usd) for a mortgage or employment agreement.  Make a sale? Taxes come out automatically... no paperwork, no IRS audits.  There is a place in the world for trust systems and banks, and I think they need better tech... Just not blockchain.

Uh.  No.  There is a limit to how far they can push without buying back to settle.   With huge positions,  even the swings we see lately will cause margin calls.

With repos, the payback the next day is in the contract.  It isn't a claim, it is the way these work.  If I give you a one day loan of $1 and on day two you return it and I loan it to you again for another day, and you return it the next, did I pump $2 your way? Not quite.  I think QE is bad.  Repos are just a way of fiddling the books. 
That said, there is a warning sign here.  The fact that this was needed was because firms held too many treasuries and not enough cash.  This might be interpreted as a strange kind of a bank run.

I the US, you could be considered a business at that point, and as a business doing it, there are serious regulations, laws, and consequences.  I wouldn't do it.  But, note there is not much of a distinction between that and just selling your coin for cash.  Where it gets sketchy is if you buy many times on an exchange and are selling many times for cash, especially in short time frames.

I find it interesting that the game ends quickly if played strictly by the rules, demonstrating a potential problem with capitalism.  However, people tend to add in rules like :

Extra $200 if you land on go
Taxes go under free parking and you get them if you land on it.
Then the game goes on forever.   I wonder what that demonstrates.   Capitalism with the right amount of socialism can work long term?  (maybe not the right forum for this question, but it is one I've wondered about.)

Yes,  that is what I was saying.   Also, crypto doesn't have a civil court system built in yet.   You need that to reverse transactions.   Maybe smart contracts week come up with something that bridges that gap.
Example: eBay 
Transactions are not atomic.  Payment and delivery are distinct actions.   Either side could get cheated.   Ebay protects both sides,  in part with fees (ebay takes the loss as a cost of doing business).   This allows both sides to trust the transaction will complete or revert.   If needed,  eBay can sue an individual.
With crypto, there is no way (yet) to get that protection.  None that I know of.  Payments are trustless, but delivery is not.

I answer the "scam" accusation in two ways:
1. Someone is scammed when they are tricked into paying for something and they don't get what they think they paid for.   Have him read enough so he can explain how Bitcoin works, and help them understand what he wants to buy.  
2. A scam requires someone to do to scamming.   Who is performing the scam? The question cannot be answered with a decentralized coin. 
Frankly, I think every investor should do    An unfortunately small percentage of investors know what they are buying. These are the ones who get scammed by people who present "the next Bitcoin" as better than Bitcoin.  (for example, bitconnect). 
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:31:10
Futures are also quite useful for the producer of such goods, to lock in a price before they do the production work.  In this case, think Miners.   Say the price spikes up.  A miner might want to lock in some sales before purchasing mor hardware.  (This will tend to soften that spike, stabilizing prices.). Then, even if the price falls, the miner is not losing on his investment of hardware.
You can also consider a world where people get paid in BTC.  The employer may want to lock in the cost of the salary by buying futures.  On payday, the employer is delivered BTC and can pay employees with it.   The employer has some time to come up with the cash, and is also protected from market uo moves. Again, a valid use case (someday) , even with crypto.

Okay, how about this... Those exchanges had little experience managing large amounts of money, didn't have well developed software or IT standards, didn't have good monitoring to detect a hack, and didn't mitigate risks with a vetted hot/cold storage plan.

I have a favorite piece of paper with crayon markings on it.  It has holes in it and is pretty tattered.  Nobody would pay me anything for it.  But if I lost it, I would pay roughly $1000 as a reward.  Is it worthless?  Would you throw it away if you knew I would pay the reward? I suppose it depends on how you define worth.  I see it as worth $2000 to me and $0 to you.  So we should definitely trade.  I offer $1000 and we are both $1000 happier than we were before.
Same with your altcoin.  What if you lose the paper wallet and I find it.  If it really is worth $1,000,000 to you, you should be willing to buy it from me.  If you are willing to buy it from me, I definitely want it if I see it on the ground.  Of course, that assumes you have the cash to pay.  If not, it is an illiquid market.  We are willing to trade, but cannot.

Some of the narrative has changed over time.  I've noticed Andreas starting to say "decentralized trust".  I think this is more accurate.  With open source code, you trust the community to review and bash it if it is bad.  This is likely how you know some wallets had vulnerabilities.   If I write a closed source wallet, you trust just me.  If I open source it, you spread your trust over many people who do have the technical skills and time to evaluate it.  Believe me, some of us (um, er... I mean "some of them"... yes, them) really love reading through open source code to point out problems.

Is that a routing problem?  Seems like a different issue with LN.  More like banks where you cannot cash a check unless you have an account there.

If I recall, Gemini added the end of day auction to satisfy a previous concern that the market price did not have an official daily mark like most other securities.   It was strategic to do it that way since that is pretty much industry standard in finance these days.   I belive a previous ruling accepted that solution (I could be wrong on that.) I wonder if they can change parts that have been approved already, or if it is harder to do so.  Hopefully they can change it to use the same price rules as the futures markets.  That should be better for everyone.  In any case, they have been working on this since at least 2013... I have no doubt they will address the concerns and try again.

The effort to use them is not the issue for many.  Kyc and aml are fine with me.  Also, I have found support to be slow, but good.   The problem I have is the BCH debacle.  From the start last summer when they announced users would not get the BCH for their BTC.  Then in the fall when they didn't announce the launch, leaving only insiders prepared to trade.  Can't blame that on banks.

It is not the interest that creates money.  It is the fractional reserve. Interest is a fee... Just moving money.  With fractional reserve, money in circulation increases with each loan made (even if made at zero interest rate).

Do you live in the USA? Suing people for not dumbing things down to a low level is common.  Ever see the moisture absorbent packages that say "do not eat"?  The question will be whether the action actually caused damages and whether 75% of the jury thinks the damaged people should be compensated.  Personally I think selling "Bitcoin core" and "Bitcoin Cash" is fine, but calling BCH "Bitcoin" is definitely confusing to new people.  The price should tip them off, but remember that new people might not know the price of each and the price history.  They might think "I guess it dropped... It does that" or think they are buying half a coin.  It just takes one person to be hoestly confused into buying the coin he didn't mean to buy.  It goes the other way too.  Say I believe "Bitcoin" is a bubble and "the other Bitcoin" is going to win, but I cannot remember "BCH".   I could buy BTC confused, thinking "Bitcoin core" is the "other Bitcoin".  It's just better to use standardized terms.  In fact, both protocol have documented names.  (Neither "bcash" nor "Bitcoin core" is on the list of official names.)  I, as others, am not opposed to Ver pushing what he thinks is best.  Take pride in the official name.  Make it the better brand if he can.  Causing confusion on purpose is not okay.

21,000,000 is somewhat arbitrary.  Currently, a miner earns a block of 12.5 BTC roughly every 10 minutes.  Not each miner... One in the world.  There are 1440 minutes in the day, so 144*12.5=1800 BTC per day are issued.   Also, roughly every four years, this rate is cut in half, so sometime in 2020, the rate will go to 900/day then in 2024, 450/day, etc.  It is for hopes to earn this reward that people run mining nodes.  A key part of Bitcoin working is that validation of the system is rewarded like this.  The mining work is what gives Bitcoin many of its properties. 
Keep in mind, 1 BTC can be broken into 100 million parts, as a dollar breaks into 100 pennies.  You can transfer amounts of value much smaller than the price of 1 BTC.

The network effect of Bitcoin is huge, which gives a big advantage over alt coins.  I haven't looked at those you presented.  They have not been tested at Bitcoin scale.  They might be great, and might have dominated if they came first.  But they didn't and now are mostly lost in a sea of alt coins.
For me, I don't want to mess with dozens of coin types.  So each time Bitcoin gets more useful, pulling in new ideas that solve problems, I am happy.  Happier than when I see a new coin invented, even if that new coin solves all the same problems.

Whenever the protocol rules become less restrictive, that is a hard fork.  In this case, allowing blocks up to 2mb it's less restrictive, hence "hard fork".  It is not a problem unless a large community wants to stick with the older, more restrictive protocol.  Bip91 agreement means everyone will honor the 2Mb branch, and the 1mb branch will die instantly.  No need to worry.  This is a good thing.

Best write up I've seen:
To summarize, the scenario here looks like this:
2017 July 19 02:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch begins
2017 July 21 10:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch closes with &gt;80% signaling and BIP91 locks-in
2017 July 23 18:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch finishes, BIP91 is activated
2017 July 23 18:00 GMT onward — Every block signals BIP141 (Segwit)
2017 July 27 or thereabouts — New Difficulty Adjustment Period Begins (2016 blocks). Every block will be signaling for Segwit.
2017 August 1 00:00 GMT — BIP148 starts, but does nothing since every block is signaling BIP141 due to BIP91.
2017 August 10 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes with &gt;95% signaling and BIP141 locks-in.
2017 August 23 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes and BIP141 (Segwit) is active.
2017 November 18 or thereabouts — 2x Hard Fork (scheduled)
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:53:48
The bigger point is that a new player started signaling.  That implies a few of the remaining blocks this period will also signal.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:41:02
Right.  Probably not everyone agrees 100% it is a good thing, but it does represent a compromise.  BIP91 locked in segwit and a block size increased, both "sides"of the long standing argument for something they wanted.  That is my understanding anyhow.  I personally think having both is a good thing.

This post shows why there are fewer people talking about the value of Bitcoin on its own.  Say anything like 1btc =1btc and you are insulted.  So they don't post anymore.
I still value BTC for its own value.  The small slice of value provided by the large network and all the goes with it.   I also value it for what I *might* buy with it one day.  Different people value it (or don't) for different reasons.  
But here on reddit, most people just insult those that disagree with them.  And the minority opinions stop posting.

I think your conclusion has a flaw.  Bitcoin is the first time I have sole ownership of an asset.  That's a big reason I believe in the tech.

It will not stop taxation.  Most people will still pay willingly because it is the law.  Those that don't, probably already don't.  So the question is whether BTC use would cause more people to want to evade taxes.  Probably some.  But remember, the government still has the most guns (police, army, etc.) with a moral backing to use them to enforce the laws.  Most people will pay taxes if threatened with jail.  The teeth are still there. 
This changes with oppressive governments (think Venezuela).  They abuse the power they have at the expense of the people.  In a scenario like that, the "anarchist" becomes the "revolutionary".  Most people here on reddit live in countries with mostly honest governments (yet mistakes still happen). Bitcoin is less important in those places.

Mac is also pretty vulnerable.  Especially when you consider that many attacks come through the browser, which is mostly the same on all operating systems.  There are ways to have a secure wallet on a computer, but it is pretty hard.  
I recommend people spend effort on security in proportion to their coin amount.  0.001btc? Maybe don't worry much. It is a good amount for learning on the computer.   1btc? Probably worth the time and price to use a hardware wallet.  More? Maybe think really hard about the backup of the keywords.  Things like that.  But main point... If you are not risking that much, just try things out to learn.

The currency value is the reward for those who keep the blockchain decentralized.  A centralized blockchain is an inefficient database. It is the decentralization that makes blockchain powerful.   No centralized authority can corrupt it.  If Miners have no incentive to mine, the blockchain will likely become corruptible.  So why Bitcoin? Mostly because it is the largest and most decentralized. Almost any coin would "work", so why not choose the one with maximal decentralization?

A loan is an agreement.  If someone loans you enough BTC to buy your house, you have agreed to pay them a certain amount each month.  They pay the original owner the full amount in BTC and you are in debt to them. Every month you pay them in BTC that presumably your employer pays you.  If you miss payments, expect the guy who loaned you the BTC to be unhappy.  Too much and he will take your house and sell it to someone else to get his money back.  
So, all just like with USD, at least in principle.  Maybe less government controls to protect the lender, but who knows?  Maybe something with smart contracts will do even better to protect the lender.  Credit cards would be similar.  They would continue to charge (probably the vendor) a few percent to cover the risks of you not paying off the card.  If you don't pay, your credit report will get hit and people won't trust you as much. Same as today. Again, maybe better executed with smart contracts.

Nice post.  Have you read the "Mastering Bitcoin" book?  As a CS student, you can probably understand it.  It isn't that hard.  Also, it is free online.  You can also subscribe to the dev mailing list and see discussions among the open source devs about new features.  This is where ideas go before they become BIPs, and then features.
Education is important.  You are right there.  Rather than talk about price with people, I try to talk about the values, and for the tech folks, the implementation.   But most people won't need to know much about it at all.  Very few people understand how banks or credit cards work, yet they still use them.  I think the keys are scalability, usability, and privacy (maybe in that order?).  Fixing those things requires a lot of dev work, and writing code takes a long time.  I remain bullish as long as I see continued improvements on those things.

That is a reasonable point. Some will mine at a loss.  I guess the model for each miner is closer to: (reward BTC quantity * the value that miner places on BTC).  I have to think that over a bit.  It does change things.  Also, I suppose there is some value a miner may see in mining beyond the BTC reward.  I'm not sure if that can be quantified, but would tend to push the hashrate up.

On Binance theft.... The hackers will have to take time before selling.  I understand the coins sit in seven addresses now.  They will be tracked forever, as long as that is possible.  So they will have a hard time selling them, and maybe they don't even want to sell them all.  
On the other hand, Binance must make their customers whole.  Binance could choose to:
1. eat the BTC loss, reducing their own stake (assuming they have 7000 BTC holdings that are not allocated to customers) 
2. act like a fractional reserve system, assuming they will always have custody of 7000 BTC (so they don't actually need to hold them)
3. buy 7000 BTC in the market (to reestablish the BTC balances they intended to have)
Possibly they will do a combination of the above (though I hope  doesn't happen).  That means more market demand for BTC.
Does it make sense?
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:18:49
Maybe.  But they definitely realize this as an issue.  If they overwhelm the mempool , they will not be happy either.  I think this is part of why there isn't adoption from big retailers yet.  The ones who are interested are likely helping development of second layer tech.  That seems good.

I think a merchant can feel confident within a minute after the transaction has been broadcast to the network.  Maybe less.  And with LN (if/when they use that), no waiting is needed.

The point of 1btc =1btc is that they are not comparing with fiat or physical goods and services.  They are saying they are valuing the global product itself, and 1btc is a sliver (1/21000000) of that value. But it is not a value you can easily quantify. 
Market price in USD, on the other hand reflects the global interest to purchase Bitcoin at the moment.  That's easy to quantify and fairly objective, but might very hard to compare to the value of Bitcoin as a product (network, protocol, source code, etc.).  This value is highly subjective. Some people think it is of negative value (pollution) and others think it is worth their lives. 
Analogy that I hope doesn't fall flat: How much is a glass of water worth?  To a typical citizen of a developed country, not much, close to zero. To someone dying of thirst, maybe quite a lot.  It is worth one glass of water. 
I think the issue is confusion over price and value.  Price is measured in something.  Value doesn't have to be.
Also, at the risk of just making you angry, most people can't choose how they feel.  They choose how they behave. And with insults, you encourage them not to followup with useful information.  Maybe try asking what they think they mean by 1btc = 1btc.  You might have a good impact on them. You seem to have reasoned opinions. Your opinion definitely has value to me, but I can't guess what price I would put in it!

Hmmm.  Take the fifth? I must indeed be blind!  My apologies.  I was focused on the last sentence, which made sense to me.  What's protocol on reddit when someone admits to a mistake? (I don't think I've ever seen it happen.). Delete my comment?  Down vote myself?

There will be a seed phase.  Write it down.  Store safely and consider fire, flood, etc.  Some people say to use pencil since it doesn't run like pen.   I don't know... Just keep it safe from water.  If a large amount, maybe keep copies in two places.  Practice the recovery process once or twice.   This much effort is plenty good for me.  I also have a hardware wallet because I wanted to see how it works.  It is easy to use and very secure.  It all depends on how much you have to protect.

Thanks! Some of these were new to me.  Real, dangerous attacks, for sure (except maybe the LBC thing... That seems super scammy.).  Here's my take for anyone concerned but no time to read it all... 
None seems alive if:
1. Keep your firmware up to date... Existing discovered flaws have fixes. 
2. Use modern keys and a trusted way to make them (harware wallets do this)
3. Realize physical access matters... Don't flaunt your device. 
4. Use passphrase on the device.  (mitigates physical access)
5.Watch out for social engineering... Phishing, etc.  This is the biggest way you will be hacked.  Clever people conning you into sharing your key.
6. When your browser says the site is not trusted, believe it!  Https works.
I still think hardware wallets are the safest choice.  The companies are highly incentivized to detect and protect against vulnerabilities.  They have more to lose than you.

Nobody saw it as stable when it was running up either. Stabilization is needed, and will take time.  
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:04:58
It's a good point.  Memory needs time to fade.  Also, the growth and maturation of exchanges helped people say "Mt gox was before real companies were doing it right.". This is mostly true.  So it will take time for Bitcoin to mature past the problems being discussed today.  If there is another run, it will likely be accompanied by statements like, "it crashed in 2018 because the transaction rate was so low, and privacy was bad, and no merchants accepted it, and it was hard to use, etc."  Those problems are being addressed day to day.

I think the article makes good points, but I too question the numbers. That table says it got numbers from the EIA.  Any idea what that 100% for Oregon means?
I see a lot of good things there, but still plenty of fossil fuels used in Oregon for energy, including electricity.
Your thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:01:49
Great question. For me (maybe not everyone) there is a huge difference between "the guy with the gun can take my money" and "the guy with the gun can force me to give him my money".  In the former case, he can shoot me and just carry away the cash.  In the latter, he can still shoot me, but if he does so, he gets nothing.  
This is less important for the mugger than for the oppressive governments.  A mugger is pretty much always face to face, one on one.  Corrupt governments can confiscate any property (but not Bitcoin) , from many people at once.  This matters because a government can steal in mass, without getting face to face with anyone.  It is much harder for a government to capture and kill lots of people than to force a bank to turn over all accounts.
It is not just corruption either. It is mistakes too. Banks serve a great purpose (again, many don't agree), but they make mistakes. As do taxing authorities. Imagine your government makes a mistake and thinks you owe 200 fiat in taxes.  They will force a bank to take it out of your account, probably with a large bank fee.  Now you have to prove you already paid that tax, and you will probably get the 200 back, but maybe not the fee.  If instead they had to prove you didn't pay, they would probably catch their mistake.  If not, you would during the process.
This is a bit rambly now, so I'll end with... Any questions? Happy to have a healthy debate.

Hashrate follows price * reward.   Raise the price, more people will mine.  Cut the reward, fewer people will mine.   I don't see how it follows that a lower reward will raise the price a lot.  Only if you think the downward movement is mostly caused by the daily supply.  It could be true, but I am a skeptic.  Better to focus on the improving tech, I think.  Still many years of work there. Then... Then we might have some interesting markets.

Simple answer to your first qustion... The only reason to buy is if you value the BTC more than the price of the BTC. Some people do, and they buy.  Others value the fiat more, so they sell BTC.  It really is that simple.  Of course the hard part is deciding how much you personally value BTC.  Many people here value it highly, which is part of why they hang in this sub.  Doesn't mean you have to value it.  Where you might learn something interesting is if you ask why people value it.  
Your Second question... I don't speculate or care if a pump and dump happens.  I will buy or sell based on my answer to your first question. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:52:08
Just not true.  Trolls spreading fud get down voted because they are trolls and spreading fud.  I've seen many argue reasonably that BTC will go lower, and I respect them for it.  Trolls and fud are just as bad as shills and hype.

I was just interpreting.  Didn't say I agreed or disagreed.  I like your comment.  Sometimes rational discussion is hard, and mockery is easier.  I'd prefer know someone's opinions, even in mocking form, than not to know because they were afraid they would be shamed for speaking out.

I would prefer food too. And I would work hard to earn money to pay for food.  But what would I trust as money? Not fiat of a collapsed government. Gold coins that I cannot test for authenticity because I don't have a chemistry lab?  Maybe crypto since open source software and the peer to peer network will validate it for me. It is all highly hypothetical of course, but crypto is proving useful in a collapsing government right now, even amid the high BTC volatility.  See Venezuela.

I'm pretty sure we are saying the same thing, except you said my way of stating it was bullshit.  Let me explain.  You said Miners will have to demand more for their efforts.  I agree.  I also agree price is market driven.  So, if I am a miner and I need 2x the price to be profitable due to the reward drop, I will stop mining so the hash rate goes down.  Similarly, if market price goes up, more Miners will turn on, and hash rate will go up.  It's not the protocol, but market forces that cause it.  I agree that a decrease in supply will decrease a downward price pressure.  Also I 100% agree nobody knows where the price will go.
What do you see as bullshit?  I'm happy to be corrected. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:11:14

First, you didn't quote me.  Second, yes please. Please explain what you think is obvious.  There are plenty of reasons not to like exchanges, so it is not obvious what you are arguing. I am happy to listen to your point, maybe even be swayed, but you need to actuality state your point. 
My point is sole ownership.  If you keep money in a bank, it is shared ownership. I also agree that is mostly fine, at least in non corrupt countries.  But, note that the bank and government can dispose of the money without your permission.  Sometimes the government makes mistakes. It can take a very long time to fix the mistakes.  That is not possible with Bitcoin. Nobody can spend your BTC except you.  This is the value.  
Don't mistake my argument that Bitcoin has value for an argument that banks don't have value.  I think banks are still off great value.  I also think Bitcoin has value.

Hot Wallet, yes.  But that would not make them go bankrupt anyhow.  It is probably a small percentage of holdings.  The cold wallet is the big risk.  Also probably protected better. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:49:25
"Our policy insures against the theft of Digital Assets from our Hot Wallet that results from a security breach or hack, a fraudulent transfer, or employee theft.
Our policy does not cover any losses resulting from any unauthorized access to your User Account."
So their cold wallet is not likely insured.  It would be too expensive to insure.  That said, I'd be comfortable keeping a balance there, if not too large and/or not very long. If I didn't understand security, I might keep coin there until I learned more.  They are likely more safe than people who don't know how keys work.  But still... Learn more and do it right, imo.

"even if someone put a gun to my head when I woke up in the morning they wouldn't be able to get it"
One... This is hard to know until it happens.  Two... Would you even want to risk it?  Three... People murder for less than 40k.  Four... 40k in the Bank means you are more likely to have expensive jewelry or electronics in your home, making you a bigger target for burglers. Five... If they convince you to withdraw the cash and give it to them, the bank won't give it back to you.

This is why the bit license in NY was such good news when it happened.  It is stifling now, but it was perhaps the earliest government official approval of crypto.
