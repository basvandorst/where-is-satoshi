It’s still a bit higher on Venezuela with the current exchange but by 10-15% not 2000x

Mining was really popular as electric service is free, that is why skyrocketed. A lot of people lost a shit ton of money with the 20k to 3700 so they prefer to have money saved in usd.
 Bitcoins now are used for anonymity, people that work on the internet and only get paid on bitcoin, and to gain money trading with it against the usd and bolivar, kinda like forex

People don’t really care about things that don’t happen in their country or directly affect them. May be sad, but it’s true to you, it’s true to me, it’s true to everyone.
 Everyone want to always look like they care the problems in the Mid East, or Africa, or Venezuela but have you donated to some ONG? to kids in Africa? Most likely not, and that is not sad, it’s just how it is. 
It’s like in the bojack episode where when something happen they say “oh how sad thoughts and prayers” and then move on

I’m Venezuelan. It’s higher but because there is not a unique exchange for US to Bolívares. So for example the Bitcoin it’s at $4000(just to put a number) but the people selling it in localbitcoin calculate the usd in 3700 bolívares while the “street price” is at 3400. So you would end it paying $4352 for that bitcoin if you sold your usd at 3400 bolivares per dollar to buy bitcoins.
 The opposite have also happened, that you can buy them cheaper because the street exchange is higher than in localbitcoin. 
 The “street price” of the USD to BOlivares it’s highly influenced by where you live and your networking. If you live in a poor rural town they may buy it at 2900 or lower while if you live in a big city and know the direct person who needs the dollars without intermediaries you may get a price closer to the localbitcoin price
