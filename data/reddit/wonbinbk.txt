They're dumb to copy and paste blindly but I think they don't deserve what's coming. They might accidentally erase their bitcoin wallet, their love one's photos, their important information, etc...
Just to think about that, I don't think it's a good idea. 
Maybe I was just to serious but hey, everyone was a noob once.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:46:57
I have a ledger so I can not talk for trezor.
- btc, eth, xrp: checked.
- iota: not sure.
Backup: using a 24 word seed written on a piece of paper. Your coins are as safe as that paper (or papers if you have many copies).
I don't think any hardware wallet company will keep a backup for you. That's the whole point of a hardware wallet: you control your own coins and the key never leave the wallet.

@_date: 2018-01-20 04:21:40
Hardcoded? no. It's a config in Bitcoin Core. I didn't check but someone said the default value is 2 weeks.
That is unless someone decide to rebroadcast that transaction. In that case, it could stuck in mempool until the end of time itself.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:34:34
You're welcome :))

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:30:48
Yeah, and make your transaction stuck in the mempool for weeks.
Eventually it will be kicked out and then have to make another transaction. (was using ledger wallet with their own chrome app so there is no replace by fee option)

@_date: 2018-01-01 17:33:32
They are your parents and they did raise you, no matter what they say will change this fact.
So just be patient, explain to them your point of view, listen to their side of the story and prepare for a counter view. What if they're not all wrong? What if they said it just because the way you explained to them is not very clear? 
You decided to give your parents 10btc as a thank you. That was beautiful. Now it becomes a dick move, to your own parents. 
If you could not explain bitcoin to your parents and your family then why bother going around explaining that to others?

Never mind.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:19:33
No it's not.
Bitcoin client serves as a node to bitcoin network while a wallet is just like you said, a bunch of private key in some order.
Bitcoin core is both a wallet and a client.
Electrum is a SPV wallet that will connect to some servers served as nodes.
Ledger or Trezor wallet connect to their own servers / nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:16:15
You can use this site to determine the optimized fees for your situation: 
In the last graph, put your mouse to the right side of the graph, a legends will pop up showing a list of sats per byte level and transactions' size accordingly. You will want the MINIMUM sats per byte that have a size smaller than 1MB to fit in the next block.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:43:16
Yeah I was struggling for electrum to work with ledger for a while. Finally I found a solution. There is indeed a file that you need to patch. 
You can look at my old thread. I posted here asking for help and then found a solution myself from github, posted it back here for other noobs like myself. :))
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:17:50
The other day I and my friends utilized this opportunity to consolidate our wallet (already segwit as we all uses ledger nano s). We were paying around 10 sat/byte and to me it's very cheap. I was happy.
I know you guys are all happy because of this low fee. But seriously, let's not over acted. There is only a small increment in  segwit adoption. Lightning network is on the main net now but people still don't know or really use it. 
So this low fee is just a result of the downfall of bitcoin price, fewer transactions are happening. 
In short, we still have a scaling problem.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:41:42
Yes but it will then only serve one purpose: to help you verify the transactions and blocks. It will not help strengthen the network. 
Am I correct?
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:15:11
Ah I see.
Then why don't we zip some more for it to reach the size of 1 byte,then one final zip to make it 1 bit.

Roger Ver talks a lot and say nothing.
All his talks was all about the same thing. Why don't people just show it to his face that we want to build a decentralized, censorship resistant currency, not another paypal or visa. That's the whole point.
If he and his shills want another visa, just let them do it. But leave us along. We don't need banks and visa-like payment method.

@_date: 2018-01-27 13:37:37
I would say a bit of both. Obviously segwit adoption rate has increased lately but also recently block's transaction count has decreased too ( from over 2000 transaction per block down to 1000 or even ~500).
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:11:33
Indeed segwit is good.
I'm using segwit and this morning I've consolidated all my addresses and it cost me $0.5 for that transaction which was confirmed in the earliest block.
But let's not forget the reason why fee is so low now: fewer transactions in any one block. As soon as bitcoin price increase and money come pouring in the market again, the fee will be high again. 
We need Schnorr signature, we need LN adoption soon.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:59:13

I wouldn't believe then that a Vietnamese woman living in Australia lost $21M in bitcoin due to a lack of security in blockchain.info wallet. But it's true.
This guy lost $40k because he didn't do his own research on Electrum. The woman above lost $ 21M due to stupidity. And you would think they need some brain to earn $ 21M?

Segwit is not a blocksize increment. Segwit is a blocksize utilization. Blocksize stays the same but transactions become smaller in size, hence more transactions can get into a block.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:11:47
1. If you use electrum with nano s, the private keys never leave the wallet. You will be safe provided you confirm the receiving address and amount sending.
2. If ledger go broke and you want to recover your wallet, you can use an open source BIP39 address generator offline, and put in your 24 word seed to get lists of receiving addresses and change addresses.
3. There's a list of compatible hardware and software wallet you can use in case you don't want to or no longer be able to use a ledger wallet. Search on ledgerwallet.com
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:02

After confirming the money is there I can then safely remove the software.
Will that work? Any risk?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:59:12
I agree.
I hate bcash and Roger Ver but I do agree with them on one point: bitcoin has a network digestion problem and fee has become too high for bitcoin to be called p2p cash system.
Why not just increase the size to 2MB, and then, wait for LN network or other solutions?
In short term, increas blocksize to 2MB would fix the problem while we'll be working on other solutions for long term. That would be my vote too.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:23:40
Exactly, if bitcoin want to be cash
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:10:26
In 2 days.
You can check here: fork.lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:49:55
In theory, a block is solved every 10 minutes. In real life, not really. Depends on hash rate of the bitcoin network and the current difficulty. Difficulty is adjusted every 2 weeks in order to maintain this block time of 10 minutes. Why 10 minutes? I don't know :))
Yes, bitcoin is having a scaling issue. In order to solve this issue, the community had been debating on and on that lead to the fork of b_cash. Until then, don't send with too low a fee.
When a transaction is unconfirmed, those coins, or Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are still attached to your private key, officially still yours to use. So when the coins is "stuck" in limbo and a fork happens, you still own both your bitcoin and your shitcoin (sorry, your other forked coin).

Maximum 14 days.
Could be longer if someone running a bitcoin node keep broadcasting that transaction to the network. If that is the case, those coins are locked until not broadcasting.

Yes, Vietnam will legalize bitcoin and crypto for taxing purpose. That means more regulation. That does not mean Vietnam will see bitcoin as a legal tender, as the way Japan is doing.
There will be no way Vietnam's goverment would accept anything to be a legal tender that they can not print more. We can't legally buy stuffs with gold, USD or foreign currencies.

best wallets in my opinion:
* Hardware wallets: trezor or ledger nano S (love and own Ledger Nano S).
* Software wallets: bitcoin official wallet (need to run a node though), armory (also need to run node). Or software wallets that doesn't need to run node but need to connect and trust some SPV servers: Electrum (I used this but eventually moved to Ledger Nano S).
* Paper wallet: cheapest and most secure but so inconvenient to spend. If you go this road you should learn more about change address or you end up paying a lot of fees.
* Mobile wallet: coinomi... I don't use them.
* Online wallets: blockchain.info.... fuck them, I'll never use them and will not recommend.

Being on segwit addresses will only help you lower your transaction's weight. Other than that you will have to take a look on the real fee in satoshi per byte.
Anyway, the transaction probably has been confirmed many times since then. There's nothing you can do now except bite the bullet and learn from this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:30
Step 1: buy a hardware wallet or create a paper wallet.
Step 2: transfer your btc into those wallet.
Step 3: put the whole thing in the freezer. Because otherwise it's not cold enough.
Ok the last step is not necessary to be honest. But it'll be fun.

If you care about fee and transaction speed that much why don't you just use something else? Like xrp or iota for free transaction and even faster than 10 seconds?
The whole point of bitcoin in the first place is decentralization, is censorship resistance, is freedom, is people power against bad and evil governments.

Although I understand and agree with Mr Graham, his "market" is the stock market where a company can be valued based on its properties and financial success. Bitcoin is quite different, no one can tell me its value. In fact, bitcoin's value is based on people expectation.
But I agree, whatever that value is, bitcoin will reach there in the long term. These up and down is just noise that an investor need to look away.

Depend on yours hash rate.
Assume total hash rate of the network is X, your hash rate is x, your chance to mine a block is x/X.
With a normal laptop nowadays, you can let it mine for a few million years and may mine one block, or not. But the chance you have to pay for electricity and electronic device decay are 100%.
So it actually is better to mine in a pool where your frequently get a small amount of income, in constrast with solo mining where you rarely get paid a big amount of income.

What I meant was that one should learn about fees system and how to put a custom fees in a transaction.
Usually you can't do anything if you are using an exchange because they fix the fee. But if you are using a decent wallet you can adjust fee in sat/byte

Your transaction had 21 outputs. Assume that 1 of them is the change address for the exchange. Assume they also charged 0.02btc for every output. The real fee paid to miner is 0.065239 btc.
They have earned 0.02 * 20 - 0.065239 = 0.334761 btc in transaction fee alone. What a crook!
Suggestion: Find another exchange. 
Suggestion 2: Exchanges I was on that I know their btc withdrawal fee:
- Bitfinex 0.0005btc
- Wex.nz 0.0001btc
- Poloniex 0.0001btc

Where did you send your bitcoin from?
Unless it is an exchange or a very bad software wallet, any other wallets will have a custom fees mode where you can specifically put how much fee you want to pay in sat/byte
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:38:35
by Coinbase you meant the exchange?
Trezor and Ledger create segwit addresses start with '3', not literally a segwit address but a P2SH address which is supported by any exchange.
What you meant is the real segwit address that start with 'bc1'. Until now, as fas as I'm aware, only Electrum wallet generate those addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:02:43
If you set the option to alternate the fee when you made that transaction, you can Increase fee. But I guess it is not an option for you now.
If you own one of the output (for example, a change address) , you can use Child Pays For Parents. Google that with Electrum.

Can you really trust a lawyer that much?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:12:29
Yes. 2 weeks is the default time to keep transaction in mem pool.
If someone really hate you and want to keep your coin in limbo, they can keep broadcasting that transaction until the end of time. The only way for you to solve this is to double spend your coin (replace by fee) or use another transaction to attract miners (Child pays for parents).
Just wait max 2 weeks. I think it will drop out of mempool. Nobody can hate you that much!
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:30
Exactly a impossible to escape loop.
But I think to break this loop, the decentralized exchange need to take some steps forward first: either lower the trading fee or withdrawal fee. Basically, they need to bring honey to attract the bees.

I own a ledger nano s because I can afford that price. And I think it is the best option buck-wise.
Anyway, if you don't want to or can't buy a heard wallet, you can use Electrum. It is quite a good software wallet.
To be more secure: you can use offline signing to sign you transaction in a computer that was never online since OS installation (to lower the risk of virus etc), then copy that signed transaction to an online computer to broadcast it. This way the private keys would never have a chance to leave your computer.

$1 is cheap?
Yeah nice!
I just made a transaction with 8.8 sat/byte in total of $0.16 in fee. It got 1st confirmation after 24 minutes.
But a week ago, I had to spend 0.001btc in fee (don't remember how much in $) and it still need 2 hours to transact.
The scalability of bitcoin is really a problem need to be addressed seriously, but not comically like wants it to be. Like Andreas said, bitcoin has been failing to scale amazingly and I hope it will keep doing so for the next 20 years. Because bitcoin need to adapt, improvise if it wants to be the peer-to-peer cash system.
All that said, in the coming attack of bitcoin-cash sometimes next week, expect the fee to sky rocket again.

Please show your transaction id here so we can have a look at it on blockchain.

I love my ledger nano s but I have to say there are something about it that I don't like:
- can't see details of a transaction, how many bytes it is.
- can't pay-to-many, even if using with Electrum.
I don't know if Trezor have pay-to-many. If so, go for it because pay-to-many will help lower transaction size and fee.

Like said, you should be fine because "The device checks for tampering every time it starts up and will not work if it is tampered with".
But of course do what you wish. If you really lose your sleep over it, I'd say just send it back and get a brand new one from Ledger. After all, a hardware wallet is supposed to make you sleep well at night.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:25:26
Your mobile wallet use its own algorithm to "guess" the optimized prize. Unfortunately it is not always correct.
You better take control of the fee by using a different wallet, one that allow you to put a custom fee in satoshi/byte.
I don't use iOS device so I can't give advice there. Hope someone will help you with that info.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:07:10
How could you assume that I never send any bitcoin? or that I'm just exaggerating about it?
I'm a bitcoin hodler and I rarely send bitcoin, except when I sent bitcoin from an exchange to my wallet. I checked the address every time, thoroughly. I don't think anyone would have a problem with me checking my personal stuffs?
If you don't check it that thoroughly, that's fine. If you do, that's fine too. Because I don't care.

Hi I guess you're using Electrum.
You can right click on the transaction that is stuck in Electrum, click "Child pays for parents" then follow the instruction.
Basically, child pays for parents means you will make another transaction that will transfer btc from one of your previous output address to another address or itself, minus some fee. This fee need to be large enough to get miner's attention (I guess around 30 sat/byte right now should be ok,check the mempool to be sure). Miner need to confirm your currently stuck transaction and then the CPFP transaction to eat both fees.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:20:28

With Nano S, I can:

If you're talking about your bitcoins on an exchange, then yes, by all means do your security home works. A VPN will help encrypt information in and out of your computer so basically you can hide your login information.
If you're talking about the Bitcoin network protocol et all, then don't worry about a VPN but better have a good antivirus or use a hardware wallet. Because information that sending out to and receiving from the Bitcoin network is just your signed transactions, which is perfectly safe from a hacker perspective.

"Core gave segwit to everyone, and users were like yay! but miners were like fuckno we want 2mb HF and so users said FU, we gonna UASF, then miners were like oh shit, then Barry was like ok ok we do both, sign here, and miners were like signing and users were like whatever, just do segwit, and users got segwit and now miners (and Barry) are like hardfork now? and users are still like FU no hardfork", I do now.

Sound good, doesn't work every time.
Since you don't know what will be the trend of btc, you may sell btc at your interest point. But then btc may keep increasing, you will have to wait for it to drop below your expected dip. Maybe it never will.
So, that's one more thing to consider.

Fuck me right :(
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:43:14
I understand that feeling.
I was just 2 weeks into reading about bitcoin and 7 days into investing in bitcoin. But I already check the price everyday, read blog, watch youtube video about bitcoin, talk to my friends about bitcoin, try to get them into bitcoin.
The idea of bitcoin, the currency without border, without middle men, without control, without any corruption from the goverment give me freedom. Since I know about Open Source Initiative, then bittorrent, then Tor network, I was amazed by the awesomeness of peer-to-peer network. The world has never been so wide to me.
Bitcoin, Tor, Open Source softwares have brought the power back to you, the people.
God damn it, I sound like Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. But you get what I meant.

Instead of mining yourself you should go ahead and buy lottery. Because you would have more chance of winning lottery than mining some precious bitcoin with you rig.

@_date: 2017-09-28 07:30:59
Will the segwit2x affect the price of bitcoin anyone?
As normal users, can we choose not to use segwit2x because of the lack of replay protection or whatever that is?
As I understand segwit2x is a corporate move where only business suits and miners get together and approve this shit. This NYA goes against the principle of bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:06:40
To prepare for the fork, you should store all your bitcoins in your offline wallet. Do not store it online in any exchanges where you don't have its private key in the first place.
About the part "Seems to good to be true that you just receive an equal amount of the new coin, is this really the case?", I was not in the whole thing when the first fork happened but according to someone who was, yes, that same amount of other coin (in this case bitcoin cash) was 'air-dropped' in to your address.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:07:44
Hope they make segwit default, not an option hidden somewhere.
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:34:06
Don't know about your situation. Depends on the exchange you're in I guess.
In the exchange I'm on, buying and selling prices always have some considerable amount apart

20 coins * 5700$ = 114,000$
Yeah now you can buy bitcoin from an exchange and if you want (actually you should) transfer those coins to your own wallet offline.

- Don't go to a world beard-growing championship.

@_date: 2017-10-01 18:03:17
I was talking about privacy and security here. If you wipe your hdd, there will be nothing left to detect or break. If you just encrypt your hdd, there still a chance no matter how small it is that it can be decrypted, or someone force you to do it.
And one wipe is enough if you use it properly, ie. overwrite 0 or 1 in every bits.
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:04:58
The level of difficulty depends on the total hashpower of the whole system.
say in the future some considerable part of miners switch to mine for ether or any other altcoins, total hashpower is down and difficulty level decrease.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:05:45
Thank you all for your answer. I was lucky this transaction was postponed though. Because last night btc was at 55xx. Right now it is 57xx. 
So sometimes sooner is not better huh :))
I will just leave the fee as that and see how long it get confirmed.

As far as I know, btcgold has not deployed replay protection yet. In fact, they are hiring developers to code that for them lol.
Without replay protection, when you sell your btcgold, your original beloved die-hard bitcoin will also be sold, with zero cost.

You understand the source codes of bitcoin is opened right?
There're a lot of people are currently working on those codes.
People tend to argue with each other. This is actually healthy. Not to mention the dirty hands of governments who is afraid of cryptocurrency and trying to corrupt it.
Bitcoin is the original bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is not, bitcoin gold or bitcoin shit are not. But they will compete with each other. And because everything is out on the open, people will choose their preferences. This is healthy.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:11:24
I'm sorry I was not clear up there. I just need to confirm that information because I watched a video on youtube explained a different way to split coins: send a small amount of bitcoin (from an exchange or anything) to existing wallet. Then send total amount of that wallet to a new wallet.
Anyway, thanks for your answer. No need to be mad man.
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:36:11

How do we split coins?
By transfer the bitcoin from existing wallet to a new one?
Then the old wallet will contain bitcoin gold, and the new one bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-10-02 01:10:43
Someone already asked this question. So I'm gonna say this quick: No one can be sure.
Back when bitcoin cash forked, everyone thought btc would dip but it actually rised.
This segwit2x seems more severe than the bch fork. But who know? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:58:44
That, I really don't know. I can only guess that since Satoshi was the man behind the whole idea, his sense of security had always been up high that he wouldn't have it all in one address.
That's only a guess. Only Satoshi knows the real answer. :))

Fuck, I would have seen a wizard if that's necessary.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:57:03
I want to add one small point: replay protection. Do not spend B2X immediately after the fork if you don't want to lose your bitcoin. Wait it out, see how the pros do it, follow their instructions. Profit!
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:37:11
Yeah that seem dangerous. How can we prepare for that kind of attack? I use a linux machine. I don't have any antivirus or firewall installed though, I thought that was not very necessary.

God damn it I see less dick eater on Porn Hub than in this subreddit alone.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:52:09
I think yes.
But don't take my advice for your life decision though.
From what I see, btc price bloomed too fast 2 last days not only because people dumping their alt coins for bitcoin but also because companies are pouring money on the market.
So after the forks, some of them will dumb bitcoin for alt coin again. But not all of them or not the companies. So the price will go down hill a little bit, a wild guess of 700-1000 usd maybe.
I will hold my coin though.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:03:05
Yeah but the end of the movie is not necessarily analogue to our situation.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:58:09
Gonna need to wait for confirmation from someone who owns one. From what I see though, the ledger nano s only need chrome browser and their Chrome's add-on to work. Nothing is saved on computer, I think.
So you should be good to go with a Mac and a PC.

I live in a third world country (if you will) and I agree to this.
If war happens, I'm sure gold, USD and of course bitcoin will increase in value because they are a much better media to store wealth.
Our national currency will worth shit. People will need to find way to get out of the country, etc... All costs money. That's when bitcoin, gold, USD come into play.

Sorry OP for stealing your thread. My question is kind of relevant to yours. I've been looking for opinions on cold wallet ideas.
*How do you guys feel about the security of:*
* A hardware wallet, e.g. The Ledger Nano S. Cost 58e.
* Electrum wallet offline on a TAILS OS air-gapped computer. Another watch-only wallet on a Internet connected PC just to do receiving. Offline signing of transaction when sending bitcoin (using a USB stick or a smartphone with QR code scanner to somehow copy the transaction "id" from the offline to the online PC). Cost is nothing provided we have 2 PCs and some knowledge on Linux.
**TL;DR:** Does the cost of 58e plus shipping justified the reason to buy a Ledger Nano S over offline signing?

Exactly what I thought of bitcoin, as a super currency. But because its value keep increasing by the minute, almost no one want to spend it to buy something that will devalue over time. What a black hole!
I think as of now, I have to believe bitcoin is not a currency system that can stand by itself.

I think the most important part of bitcoin for retailers is no charge back possibility.
Also, it would be cooler to accept bitcoin :))

As technology advances each year, I think the price per GB of storage media will decrease significantly.
420 GB per year is not that big, in my opinion.

I know I probably feel stupid asking you this. According to what you said, you dont know how to spend btc. Do you know about change address? Do you know people lost money due to the lack of knowledge of this "feature" of bitcoin? If the answer is yes, I feel stupid. If not, I'm happy you will be aware of those thing.

We have to wait until they implement replay protection on bitcoin gold, don't we? 
If so, how can anyone buy or sell bitcoin gold on an exchange? Sorry if my question is stupid but I am really confused now.

Where do you see BGold price? I googled it but all returned was bitcoin vs gold price.

So you could not buy some btc back while it's at 3000? 
Just HODL bro.

Wow wow wow hold your horses!!!
Bitcoin has just climb back up a little tiny microbits and here you are talking about Mars!!!
Judge by the sentiment here I could only think that the whole crypto market will have a few dumps until you all out of hope. And only then it could go up.

Ah, I got it:


GUI startup crash issue
After upgrade to 0.15.0, some clients would crash at startup because a custom fee setting was configured that no longer exists in the GUI. This is a minimal patch to avoid this issue from occuring.

Can some one explain what is this $1MM bounty?

Just kidding but BitCoin with the capital C just gave me cancer :))

I am not a US citizen and currently living in a third world fucking corrupted communist country. But I feel the same way you do  Doing so make me a man, stand up right and sleep tight at night.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:48:40
Ah thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:26:55
Why not? Make some quick bucks and transfer those into BTC.

I was just checking their website an hour ago.
What happened? They must have pee on the server again.
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:08:09
Man, that's just sick!

If you're using Electrum just to receive coins, you can use a watch-only wallet and will be perfectly safe I guess since your private key is not exposed under normal circumstances.
When you want to send bitcoin, use an offline clean computer to sign the transaction, then use the internet connected computer to broadcast it. This way it will be as safe as a ledger.
That's my experience. Maybe I am wrong, but not to a big extent.

I read somewhere that we had more than 600 cryptocurrencies.
600 my ass! I just checked that website. Right now it more than 1100 cryptocurrencies.
Jesus fuck!

Question is: did you have your laugh? Yes? Good! Get the fuck out!

I haven't seen the documentary either but from the interview video on YouTube I can say those girls were voluntary and were compensated. So there's nothing illegal in it.
But ... oh my god! 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:06:22
and what is the name of the documentary?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:45:10
Thank you. 
I learned something new today.
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:59:53
Not sure about that. I transferred small amount of btc 2 days ago with fee about 4.4 sat/byte (dirt cheap I know). And the transaction is still stuck in limbo.
