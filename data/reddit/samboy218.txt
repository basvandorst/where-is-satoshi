CVE is "common vulnerabilities and exposures". It's really just a way to uniquely identify all know software vulnerabilities with a coding scheme. POC is "proof of concept", which is just some code that demonstrates something, in this case the POC proves that this specific CVE is exploitable (CVE-2018-17144)

You are correct, but a lot of mining is done through pools. Lots of people get together and say "I'll likely never get a block by myself, so lets all try to get a block and split the reward". So when people talk about mining small portions of BTC its because they were in a mining pool.

That's not really accurate. BTC isn't worth what it might be worth later, it is worth the exact amount that it was at the time of the transaction. What you're saying is equivalent to saying "using fiat is like not spending money because of deflation!". What happens to the value after the transaction is irrelevant

This is what I always do and I like it. Price goes up? "Boy I'm glad I bought when it was cheap". it goes down? "Good thing I saved money for the dip!". No matter what you can come out feeling okay about your decision

Is there some place with a list of all of these companies? Maybe there should be a sticky with involved parties so newcomers can avoid them
