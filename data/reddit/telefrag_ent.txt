Hearing that people eat at "THE BIG 3" makes me sad. It's like watching people pick through a garbage can and smiling when they pull out a rotten banana. Sure, if you're sifting through trash a rotten banana isn't a bad find. But I feel like other places must have a guy somewhere that can make a damn pizza better than that fast food crap. The big 3 around here are Pepes, Sallies, and Modern, all of which will blow your mind if you've only eaten chain pizza.

Keep the battery charged just enough to last a few hours. BAM!

I like to update this every $1000USD ATH, but we're hitting them so frequently now it's hard to keep up! As always, if you have any ideas for improvements let me know.

Here's an updated version, a little bit more exciting: 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:36:11
I'm still working on my State Of Bitcoin updates, just a little update for every $1000 benchmark. If you have any suggestions for it please let me know.

It's made in Unity, which is a game engine, but one I'm familiar with enough to make something like this. It would be cool to have a web site like you've described, I'll have to look into that. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:00:08
Good point about the lines, I'll try that and zooming in more. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:03:19
Just happened to find this in a waiting room, not sure if it's been shown already, or if anyone cares hah.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:26:31
Good idea!
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:59:35
Hah thanks, I'll keep working on it for the 6k ATH, hopefully soon!
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:32:49
Here's an updated version, what do you think? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:06:53
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:36:56
Thanks! I could definitely make it brighter, I'll toy with the lighting abit. I'll probably just post a gif whenever the ATH goes up by $1000 I'm thinking.

Yea guess I just wanted to feel that Christmas morning excitement early, when I'd wake up and see the 0.01 BTC in my wallet hah. Tho I'm quite sure I wouldn't enter a totally different wallet ID into my auto deposit address... 
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:22:04
Will that be of any use? I don't want to bother this person in any way, as I don't have any proof that he did anything wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:24:35
Damn, well that would have been my very first BTC so I have no more to send hah. Guess I can try buying a few USD worth just to try this route. Thanks for the tip tho.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:26:11
Thanks, suggested the same thing (ouch, how pertinent a user name huh?) Unfortunately that would have been my first BTC so I don't have any more to send. Might just spend the ~$9 USD to buy some coin I guess...
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:48:48
A few stencils I threw together, I'll add to the folder after breakfast :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:14:26
Correct, over night my BitMinter total hit 0.01BTC so it autosent the coins to the wallet ID that was in the auro send box. But I was shocked to see this morning that my address was not the one there, and thus not the one that received the deposit. I'll try asking bitminter, thank you
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:12:41
I did say that I'm using BitMinter. My question was simply is there a way to contact someone via their wallet ID?
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:35:08
Wow you're awesome, thank you! I have to decline it tho, I was able to work something out with the BitMinter people. Thank you anyway kind sir.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:43:20
haha that's the goal
