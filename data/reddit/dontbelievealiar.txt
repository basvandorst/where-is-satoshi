The problem is decentralized fiat tokens don't exist.   So decentralized exchanges are extremely slow.    A lightning decentralized exchange that allows users to retain keys and cannot be fractional combined with decentralized fiat tokens of some kind is a tall order.

So, you're telling me those people didn't agree to the software as written, but instead have a tacit agreement to use it according to their own rules?   No, it's not fraud... it's an overdraft due to an incorrect settlement.   And while you would be liable for the amount, there's simply no way it could be proven that you ... the person withdrawing the funds are responsible for the missettlement.   Of course the exchange could have required a longer settlement period (greater number of confirmations) and could also be held liable for errors.    Unless the amount is crushingly large, most exchanges would rather stay out of court on this issue.
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:23:49
But there's simply a) no way to prove that the person who had the "failed settlement" *caused* the failed settlement - or that b) there were other tacit rules regarding settlement that are not resolved by the underlying blockchain - unless they were agreed upon in advance.   I do thing you would be liable for the amount as an overdraft... but there are so many effectively anonymous exchanges out there, it's pointless to imagine someone getting caught.

If any OG holders haven't split and dumped they are tacitly supporting and promoting bcash.   If miners aren't actively 51% attacking bcash they, too, are effectively promoting it by failing to act in their own economic self interests.
More than 80% of the forked coins haven't moved in the BCash fork.   This is not a neutral move, IMO.... by failing to move the coins, you're a "holder" for BCash, providing strong support by reducing supply.

Some nodes do this, but not all, and you can simply connect to two nodes that are far from each other.  Send one to one node close to the merchant (Coinbase node).... and double-spent to another far node near a miner (Bitmain node)... and make sure the double-spend has a higher fee.   It will usually win out.  You can also stuff the first TX with things that cause rejections from some nodes:   large OP_RETURN values, multisig, etc.
Works very will with nearly any coin, too.

This is very, very uncommon.   I worked at a processor for many years.  In the case of online transactions, where no receipt is available, it basically never happens.   In the case of in-store transactions, you can charge back 60 days later... and most stores will never find your receipt.

Nope.   Lightning is clever, because it only reduces fees on small value tx without changing fees on large value tx.
This has been Bitcoin's fee problem from the beginning.   
How do you charge less and have a lesser security guarantee for cheaper transactions.... when the amount of the transaction is unknown?
Lightning addresses this issue directly by creating a lesser security guarantee and limiting the size of the transactions that can use it.
It is *completely absurd* to secure a $5 transaction at the same level of $5 million... but that's what Bitcoin does all day long....
Until lightning.  
Now transactions can rest nicely at $10, and people transferring $10,000 won't care.   Most estimates are that more than 75% of Bitcoin tx are over $10,000 today anyway.    But now you can take the small transactions that *weren't financially possible before and therefore rarely occurred* and aggregate them.
I suspect within the next couple years lightning tx will be the *majority* of the tx in Bitcoin.... beating out those $10,000 transactions with aggregates at a much higher level.

Some stats for you: 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:20:54
You need to have a node online at least a few minutes every few days.   And you'll need to upgrade it regularly, and have it running on a dedicated box.   LND, because it's written in go, is probably going to have fewer vulnerabilities than c-lightning, so that's the one I'd choose if I were starting a long-running channel today.
Your point is taken though, maybe lightning only gets us to 5-10 million active users not 50.   Which is about 10-20x more than we have today.   Not too bad.
Mimblewimble + lightning can still get us to a billion though.   But that's many years away.
Let's hope adoption continues for high-value tx primarily and lightning remains a niche payment system for the next couple years until schnorr, and layer 3 solutions are ready.
I bet that *wont* happen and we'll see fee spikes and channel open/close issues in the coming years.... just as layer 3 solutions are ready..... (seems to be the pattern).

I feel like these long term cycles just take longer and longer the larger an asset is.   19K was too fast, so people will be very wary the other way around.   If it hits 10K again, all the people who "wished they sold at 10k" will take their chance.   Right now the people who "wished they sold at 7k" are selling like crazy, preventing the price from crossing 7k for long.   It will be a while before 20k is reached again.

Especially if you remove premined and foundation held coins.   Which you should.  No reason to value something at a billion dollar cap when there's a billion premined coins and they sold $100k worth for a dollar each.   No reason to count "lost" coins as part of the cap. Real total crypto market cap is probably only 180 billion or so.

I had a sell order posted at $8200 because of all the panic.  I figured with the volatility, it would get executed eventually.   And yeah, it probably would.  
But what's the bad news exactly?   
- You can't buy Bitcoin with a credit card?   Whatever, the price certainly hasn't been propped up with billions in UK credit card purchases.  That's an absurd notion.  Cash is and has always been the best way to buy with your anonymity intact, and investment accounts are best for institutions.   Credit cards have never been a big factor.
- China bans bitcoin again?   This meme sums that up: 
- ICO crackdown?   Well good, they were all B.S. anyway.   Less ICO action can only be good for Bitcoin.   Please ban them, shut down the ads and end that crap.
- There has been no major security breach, like with Mt. Gox, unless you count the weekly ERC20 hacks, which have nothing to do with Bitcoin.
- Lightning works, routing works, and even lightning ATM's work: 
- Robinhood going live in a month, Line going live in a month.   Millions of new users with exposure going live.
So, in summary:
*Bitcoin is price down on news that Bitcoin's price is down.*

I'm guessing $6k is the bottom, because of the timing, and the fact that there really isn't any bad news to justify the massive devaluation.   
Except maybe the tether thing.   Maybe.   But then again, maybe not.   Bitfinex *could* be creating tethers in response to sales of Bitcoin for tether and deposits of tether.   And if they are ... then we *should* expect the supply of tether to massively increase in response to the sells on Bitfinex.
This isn't Bitfinex "rescuing slumps".  It's the normal way tethers are produced.

@_date: 2018-02-16 20:53:35
Lol!    
If most people use lightning, and most people keep the channels open for years, why would fees be so high?   
You can keep millions of channels open ... millions of hot fast wallets.... using only 0.2% of Bitcoin's current block capacity.   And with schnorr sigs, you can get multichannel opens in one transaction.   
For cheap tx... Bitcoin will work fine with a single lightning layer ... up to about 20-50 million users.   For big money moves, you'll want the security of on-chain.   But I'm betting fees won't spike higher than $50 unless Bitcoin is under attack.
After that you'll need a layer 3 to keep costs down.   Some sort of mimblewimble or drive-chain layer... would be the next level.   That get Bitcoin safely to 1 billion users.   But I think that's year off.   There's probably less than 100k real users today.... scaling with lightning to millions is fine for now.   Once we do hit layer 3, I could see on-chain TX going to $500 or more.   But that's OK, because the average TX will be in the 500K range.

Bitcoin needs new buyers to justify its inflation rate.   But the problem is that it's been losing buyers.   Both to dilution from alt coins and from negative press.   Mostly, Bitcoin's price is "down" because people are responding to news that Bitcoin's price is down.
Remember, it only took less than a month to get from $6k to $20k.   So it's not surprising it can go down from $20k to $6k in a month and a half.
Why would that surprise anyone actually?   It took longer to decline than it did to rise.   So that's something.
I'll bet the next cycle to $20k will take a *lot* longer.   Maybe a year or more.

@_date: 2018-02-05 22:02:11
And, sadly, more stable.   It's a lot harder to move the price of something that is used regularly in commerce.   Even if it's only international oil export commerce (which is a good use case for Bitcoin), that volume has a stabilizing effect.   Especially since people who use Bitcoin to complete contracts will buy futures to hedge volatility risks incurred.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:33:04
Bitfinex could be creating tethers in response *either* to sales of Bitcoin for tether *or* deposits of tether. 
And if they are ... then we should expect the supply of tether to either massively increase in response to *sells*, as much as deposits.
IE: Tether's cap should increase a lot in response to the recent slump.   And it has.  On Jan 27, after weeks of massive BTC declines, it looks like they had to print a lot more Tether in response.   There has been *no* bump in price as a result.

BOFA's trustless custody account is probably a real thing.  It's very similar to a pair payment channels... where the bank is the sole intermediary.  Not sure if it's patentable because the payment channel tech was public domain before the filing.  
But the idea is that you hold keys to the bitcoin in your account, but when you want to move to fiat, you sign a TX for the bank.   Bank doesn't need to broadcast the TX... instead they can simply clear the fiat instantly.     Same with moving back to Bitcoin... bank hands you a TX, you don't have to broadcast it.
In this way they can provide exchange and money transfer services without the liability and risk of custody.
It's a solid idea... but maybe they only own the patent to try and screw over people who want to do it.
