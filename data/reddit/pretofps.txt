I see great things for crypto in general and also for Bitcoin, i hope that with the adoption in general, we also get a proporcional adoption for Segwit, Lightning etc!

My opinion when it comes to Coincheck Hack now, and mt gox in 2014, not being present during mt gox hack. Kind of a "new guy" on crypto i would say in that area.

I know there are already some around, like etherdelta and idex, but this one really got me. First because vitalik is one of the advisors, and because it is so user friendly!

FiCoin had a "lending platform" background even tho, their main project is a FIBO trading bot, so when that shit with Bitconnect and lendings in general happened, it affected FiCoin a bit, so they got listed on Token.store as their first exchange, and i see it as a medium to an end, to get to other exchanges.
Also never heard about Token.store and when i checked it out... I found it was really, really bad, so yes im disappointed with the exchange but, still looking forward to the future.
First they will start with a different staking system, where you stake FiCoin and get paid in Ethereum, but they will then launch the ability to use the Trading Bot how you want, and configure it how you want.
What you think about it?
