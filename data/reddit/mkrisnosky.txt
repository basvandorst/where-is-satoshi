Being in bitcoin when it’s going down can be painful, but NOT being in it while it’s going up is more painful.

Just a bitcoin atm at a very large local gas station chain.  I like the Ron Paul meme so it seemed like an appropriate title.

Baby steps dude.  Can’t stop cold turkey.

You’re doing the lords work and for that I hope no one ever wrench tests you for your keys.

I personally believe it will appreciate and that governments will not regulate it, at least in our lifetimes.  
These are just the beliefs of a random internet stranger.  Definitely research prior to investing.

You’ll know I’ve made it there when I don’t have a rusted wobbly fire pit

There are mosquitos.  I have a few bug zappers around.    They help. I’d rather see a red bullseye than a red candle

I think the story behind that one is that “hockey night in Canada” had a contest and fan vote to pick their new theme music.  Not sure of the community but someone made that abomination and it was winning for awhile until someone DQed  it

Not very often.  I’m just a nobody who is addicted to watching gdax and wanted to make a meme

Update your coinbase app.  That looks 2017.

I think it sounds like this

It’s been outside in rain snow and sun for five years.  I’ve found it to be quite awesome.  My dad leaned some boards against it once and it wrinkled it to hell but I was able to iron them out.
Amazon search “visual apex projector screen”
Not sure about earthquakes but tie it down good!  Mines survived microbursts of wind for sure

Daylight is a no go.  It kills the image.  Dusk is ok like what you see, and nighttime is amazing.  I’ll have to check the lumens a bit later

The website still works but *coinbase pro

Partially cash out and hold the rest

We get wet.  Thankfully the projector has been durable and even if it goes it was a “broken” one I purchased and fixed with a new bulb for $50 total.
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:01:29
Not too often.  We’ve done movies and tv in years past and it wasn’t too bad of a problem.  Nothing tiki torches bugzappers and bug spray can’t fix.

Wish I could tell you there is no risk of losing, but there is.  Only invest what you’re willing to lose, or at least what you’re willing to forget about for a few years.
A scary thought is that if you put that money in a bank you’re guaranteed to lose as you won’t be able to purchase as much in the future.

Roll with me.  The screen is 200.  The projector which I purchased and repaired for 50 would be worth 350 new.  The speakers were 100 for the pair.  Add a cheap receiver and you can do an outdoor setup for under 1000.  When I dreamed this up a few years ago it was cheaper than a big screen.  (Though not today...)
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:15:49
In case anyone was wondering that candle sucked on the big screen and the person who was doing shots on red candles died of alcohol poisoning

So who else was sure we were going to retest the 6000 levels?  Every instinct I have is wrong with this lol.

It hit 6500 on gdax for a second.  Just throwing that out there.

I’d love to forget the bear market but I’ll have to show you on the doll where it touched me.  Vietnam flashbacks yo.  But I’m in the game.

An mba is a safer bet than bitcoin.  Not a bigger bet but safer
