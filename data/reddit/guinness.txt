Yes. CME is the largest exchange out there by market cap. We have a few billion on ICE which owns NYSE etc. 
This is pretty huge news. But not surprising if anyone has been following CME. They've been talking about bitcoin products for awhile now....
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:27:01
Yeah, thats why I thought they were talking about investing in hardware. Most threads talk about investments in terms of video cards etc. Ah well, it all helps and I welcome all to BitCoin!
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:39:20
You know you can exchange bitcoins for actual currency right?
@_date: 2011-05-24 05:53:21
Do you have to do this for ALL multi-gpu systems? Even if you're going headless for a server in Linux? Or is this just a Windows thing? Thanks!
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:56:59
I considered that, but if/when this bitcoin thing crashes this is going to become my gaming rig. So I went for the 6990 because gaming wise it was the smarter choice.
@_date: 2011-05-16 20:57:29
Damn, thats not bad at all! Thanks! Now just to resist the fact that for some reason I don't get a power bill in my apartment....
I just might if I fire up one or two of these bad boys :)
Edit: Bitcoin prices usually go up the higher the difficulty yes? A year or two ago bitcoin prices were sub dollar? And at one point they were less than 10 cents? Maybe it would make more sense trading than mining. Hmmm. Are there multiple bitcoin exchanges? Maybe I can fire up an arbitrage trade.
@_date: 2011-05-21 19:19:00
So thats why everyone is trying to dissuade me from adding a 3 gigahash system to the network.
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:18:35
Electricity in my apartment is rather cheap. Free is probably what you want to call it. :)
So all these people saying "Enjoy your difficulty increases" can suck my nuts. Because even with the coming 1.7x increase I'll still be making $300-$400 every 3-4 days.
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:14:41
Oh, hmmm, rereading the statement does sound more like they're looking to get into currency trading of bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:58:29
That is my guess as well. The cost of business is always passed on to the consumer, not the producer.
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:15:38
No no no no no no no and no. As someone familiar with FPGA it is NOT for massive calculations. FPGA is for "small" jobs. Low latency and embedded systems. The only thing FPGA has on Radeon video cards is power efficiency. And even at that, you're looking at a MASSIVELY higher up front cost and time sink for FPGA than you are with video cards. Licensing costs for many kits are outrageously high. Some of the larger boards that you would need to even DENT calculations are thousands and thousands of dollars.
Even the trading industry is barely starting to get into FPGA, and thats with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on the line. In fact, I _hope_ someone out there is dumb enough to sink 25 grand into an FPGA board that won't compete with a 69xx card. Because that is less money spent on increasing the overall difficulty of the network.
Sorry, I didn't mean to jump down your throat. Its just that everyone is screaming about FPGA because someone else screamed about FPGA and they have no idea the facts behind it.

Yeah, I noticed the cheapest price for 6990's was about $710, thanks! I was looking at Z68 motherboards and they're fairly new, so the max number of cards I can get in there is 3 at the moment, despite there being a board with 4 slots....they don't have enough physical room for the dual slot design of the video card. So I was looking at a dual processor LGA 1366 (First version of the i7):
Or this one:
Add in $540 for two of the cheapest lga 1366 processors available, about $150 for a power supply, and we're looking at about $1200 in additional costs. I think I might try this out.....if anything I'll end up with one badass quad Crossfire gaming rig.
@_date: 2011-05-27 07:16:38
Oh no, whatever will I do, my rig that isnt put together yet will only make two grand a month. Excuse me while I go regret bitcoin and become a snarky asshole to every newb on Also, notice that bitcoins jumped roughly 15% with the new difficulty. I expect them to keep climbing. 
@_date: 2011-05-28 00:14:04
543k now.
@_date: 2011-05-25 18:43:12
What kind of CPU are you running on? Is this per core? If I have 8 cores this might be worth it.
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:43:01
Never liked Debian/Ubuntu. Personal choice.
@_date: 2011-05-16 23:42:58
So in your opinion then, why have bitcoin prices gone up?
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:33:20
I shoved mine into a closet and put a box fan above it. That way its out of sight, out of hearing distance. Also, I have 4x 6990's. Awwww yeah!
@_date: 2011-06-02 01:00:05
My best advice to you is to do the research yourself, look at the hardware mining comparison chart and then the bitcoin estimation calculator and see if it is worth it. Most everyone here will try and dissuade you from mining so they can keep more to themselves.
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:29:27
Interesting, although this says 50MH/chip. And yes, the trading industry is into FPGA.
@_date: 2011-05-24 06:03:31
Same here, all I need to do is recoup the machine costs. Even if it takes me 6 months, that is still good enough for me. Not only that, but I suspect that as difficulty increases it will level off. If the barrier to entry becomes too high, it will taper off. Eventually.
@_date: 2011-07-02 18:14:00
I hope not, I think we're close to either leveling off difficulty or even seeing a decrease. It would be nice to see difficulty halved for a few months and then it explode again.
@_date: 2011-05-25 17:16:26
Fine by me, this is going to be my new gaming rig when it stops making money.
@_date: 2011-07-27 16:55:00
Hello, fellow Chicagoan. Have you been over to (not necessarily for bitcoin, just whoring a good place out)
@_date: 2011-05-24 22:56:06
I have a desktop with a 6970 already in it, so I'm going to probably set that up with dual boot so at night it can mine as well.
@_date: 2011-05-24 22:55:15
Exactly. I always say that its just a matter of personal preference. Sort of like all the different flavors of Christian churches. A lot are similar, and some can differ greatly. But they're all based on the same spec.
@_date: 2011-05-25 18:42:33
The one thing I have noticed about this subreddit is that it proves the greater internet fuckwad theory. There are a lot of assholes here that see everyone coming to bitcoin as their profits being stolen. The more people who start, the greater the mining difficulty, the less their profit. So fuck them. Have an upvote.
