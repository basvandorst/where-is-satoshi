Good guy bitcoin.
Knows alot of people missed the boat
Lowers price by half.

I agree. I'm a noob and use coinbase because alot of the other places just look kinda sketchy or are confusing to use. I have no idea what segwit is, I see alot of people talking about it here and it seems like a security protocol but I have no reason to request it from coinbase.

you have a recommendation for an exchange?
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:15:34
Yup, can you imagine getting paid in bitcoin for you to lose 10% of your payment in one day.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:27:40
Well yea, nobody loses anything,

I bought it at 18000, just waiting for them glory days
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:38:11
Thats the point.

Great now r/bitcoin is looking at zerohedge for positive news. Things are looking bleak.

Maybe I don't understand the exact definition of bear market but the drop from 20k to 3k seemed pretty bearish.

I decided to convert it all. Btc has more chance to double up I feel, ltc growth is alot slower. But I will keep my ETH in play.

I feel bad for my friend. I always let him know about when Bitcoin is doing good and he always has cold feet right before the dip. He bought 5k at 18k and luckily I convinced him to hodl. He called me yesterday curious about Bitcoin and pulled the trigger on another 5k. Literally as I'm on the phone I see a huge red candle! I go " uh oh-" he is like "what?" 
"Annnnnnnnnnddddd ITS GONE!"
poor guy feels like he has bad Bitcoin juju.

How do you guys feel about mycelium wallet? I have had some of my crypto there and was thinking of transferring the rest to it. Do you like it? Is it secure enough?
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:40:23
Well done, that was exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:51:56
No I guess I have to find it. Hopefully it didn't get scrubbed
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:07:38
So I was able to get into my old phone after trying to figure out it's broken startup. And transferred from the old account into a new one. The hodling continues!
Thanks for the help guys!

What the fuck. Mycellium made that as confusing as possible and called the code that came after it the master seed. Is that code good for anything then?
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:35:55
Is there nothing I can do? What is the point of the master seed? Why did mycellium make the whole backup process so confusing?
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:38:35
No the code it gave me after the 12 words. I thought the 12 words were just a test to get me to the master seed, and now that I have got a new phone I can't access my account anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:51:12
So what the fuck is the code they give you after the 12 words. They made that seem like that was the code I needed?
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:54:19
Yup. Bought a couple g's worth at 4k and 5k
