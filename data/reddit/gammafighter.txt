A few days ago, I had a sell order for ETH at 319.60. it only got up to 319.40 and now it's in the low 280s. Sad.

Normie is not a derogatory term, it's sell-deprecating, which is literally the opposite. It means someone who is normal and mainstream as opposed to us weirdoes who use BTC.

Knowing what I do about the Philippines, that store has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

You pay capital gains tax based your current tax rate. IIRC, if one were to stop working for the year and live off of cashing out BTC, one would pay 0% on capital gains tax.

Your comment is valid except the part where they ran the chyron saying that the family of the victim was calling for peace when the woman was actually saying to burn down white people's homes. That's lying. They were lying.

I set it at 319.60 because I thought it would go that high or higher. Maybe I don't understand the question...

Thanks coinbase!

  That explains the 1,642,600% BTC price increase under Obama!

I wanted to go all in, but my wife was hesitant. My only regret is listening to her.

Price trackers are not pulling data from coinbase. Time to fire up the old finex account to buy the dip...

As someone who bought in 2015 at $300 and had to sell shortly thereafter due to an emergency, I wouldn't mind if it went to $300 again.

This is my plan too. Wife and I often look at real estate websites for houses that we could afford on our budget + 20%ish, (expecting our income to rise in a few years). Those places aren't exactly what we want. So if we can get a good down payment with Bitcoin+saving more, we're hoping to get a better place. The .05% return in a savings account just isn't cutting it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:45:01
Not if you use the debt to fund projects and investments that have a higher rate of return than the cost of capital.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:43:07
1) Pretty surre margin trading is borrowing from a broker, and has nothing to do with sticking to your predetermined payment plan on your totally unrelated loans.  
2) Using debt which as a rate of x% to fund a project which as x+y% expected return is literally how most businesses work. It's called cost of capital, and it is not a horrible idea, it is how the world works.
3) I like how in your imagination if bitcoin loses value, you apparently lose your job and can't pay your student loans anymore. That's like saying that if bitcoin loses value, you can't go grocery shopping anymore. Why? It makes no sense.

If they were smart, they would invest the money in Bitcoin.

Congratulations, you're a libertarian ��

If Bitcoin keeps rising, it's actually better to use your student loans to finance your investment.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:03:12
Bitcoin is still only being used by early adopters- and even then, not in every country. There are still billions of people who could realistically become interested in Bitcoin in the next few years.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:34:01
If you lower your income to the 10% and 15% brackets, you don't pay long term capital gains tax, if I recall correctly. You may want to quit your job partway through the year to stay under that bracket and avoid paying 20%+

Ah yes, I forgot, the Reddit community: smugly correcting others and acting self-righteous when being proven wrong, preferably together.

I'm dollar cost averaging and this is the one week I forget to deposit Fiat into my account. Guess I have to instant buy when we find the floor.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:03:42
Honestly now is probably the only time not to buy. Because anything can happen before/after August 1, it's much more of a gamble now than an investment. That being said, I have several hundred dollars to save every month and I still put a portion in BTC because I believe in it.
If this is money you would just piss away on junk food, beer, and videogames, put it in BTC instead.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:13:59
Dollar Cost Average bought a couple days ago at 2720. Kinda sad I missed the discount coins, but if it had gone to 3500 instead, I would have been sadder.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:37:44
Really makes me wish I'd had a cheap buy order
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:57:00
Buy whatever is most volatile and closest to what you perceive as the bottom. I like to track my predictions and see how much I would make/lose over time. It seems like LTC has been volatile lately, so I made predictions for both BTC and LTC, but if I were really buying, I would have only done LTC. I picked 32.79 to buy and 35.95 to sell. Fortunately, my buy was near the bottom, but my sell was too low and it keeps climbing. I'm not confident about making a buy guess today, so I am just watching the charts occasionally.
An important thing to remember is to wait until you are confident about the low before you buy. If you make 5-10% each trade, you really only need one or two trades a month like that to make ridiculous return. If you get jumpy, you could lose a lot. Also, I wouldn't trade with all of it at once. That way, if you make a bad prediction and the price drops for a while, you can keep taking with the money you held back and just hodl the loss until it rises again.

I never realized how long a week was until I tried to deposit Fiat into my coinbase account in mid May.

Yeah, CNN is much worse. Literally caught staging a fake protest news story this week and then defended it, claiming it is normal practice. Awesome job CNN.

Coinbase's exchange, GDAX has no fees if you place a position that gets filled, only if you buy or sell from the market. I'm opening accounts on Gemini and Poloniex, but I haven't had a problem with GDAX.

AMD is down about 10% over 5 days and Nvidia is down about 7%. If AMD's drop were about Nvidia's news, wouldn't you expect Nvidia's stock to go up?
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:04:46
I actually don't have much invested yet, so I would love for the price to go down.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:32:57
That's why the advice is to buy now- it may never get this low again.

He would either go where long term capital gains tax is 0 or, if he lives in a country like USA where ltcg tax rate is based on income, he would not work for a year so he would be taxed at 0% that year.
