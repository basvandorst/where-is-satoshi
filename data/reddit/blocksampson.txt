i've run into this but in my experience it seems to have more to do with them trying to upsell you additional bank products and services like business lines of credit, MRAs, and the like. This is the banking version of random retailer X constantly pushing their shitty credit card on you at the checkout counter

Fun-fact about western union. They still do most of their business via telephone kiosks in grocery stores, convenience stores and check cashing places. In that sense bitcoin wont be an overwhelming threat to their main customer base until it becomes just as accessible to everyone and in just as many common physical locations.

Yup, we've almost made it. We'll know we've arrived when nerds finally start getting crammed into lockers by jocks for their Bitcoins

Ok, I'll be the one to say it. I still think this is a terrible idea. I understand the intent but unless illegal wares are somehow kept explicitly out of the system I think its a little naive to think that most governments are just going to let you run a P2P-silk road from your house. I doubt that they'll care whether you're a buyer, seller, or any other roll. It wont matter as much to them IMO as the fact that you're a part of a literal large criminal enterprise network.
To me this is tantamount to running a DDoS tool from your home computer. Its all well and good until they start booting down doors of folks who ran the software. I'm really not trying to troll here. I genuinely think its irresponsible to introduce uneducated users to this ecosystem unless its kept 100% above board. I also think its a mistake to assume this P2P tool will get the same mild treatment as illegal file sharing.

I received one of these as well after a cashout from cryptsy.com to a coinbase.com account. There were 986 other people who were spammed in the same transaction I was:

Try using the decrypt or deposit features via the same website you generated the paper wallet on. I had a friend run into a similar problem where the paper wallet they generated could only be decoded on the site it was generated on

That is true, but if you create a new wallet and always use TOR what does it matter if an attacker can see transactions to a specific address on the blockchain? No one will be able to figure out who actually owns and controls the coins. IMO since we can't ever stop someone from seeing transactions in the public block chain (by design) the next best thing is to not have any real attributable identity information tied to that address in any way (IPs, logins to vendor sites or exchanges, etc)

What type of saving throw is it to resist a goxing? Thats the real question

Wow. Against all odds this thread somehow turned into a pro-bitcoin anti-nerd rage-fest.

The code does indeed work as I just used it. Cost me 0.804505 BTC out the door which included free 3-day shipping in my case for being a newegg premier member.

I still dont get why Darkcoin gets any special attention. The vanilla Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets have had socks5 proxy support for ages. Using the socks5 proxy setting it is trivial to setup a new "dark bitcoin wallet" that can transact securely over TOR in a non-attributable fashion. Even with all its faults I would trust TOR about a million times more than I would trust the closed Darkcoin source.

This layout feels like they're hiding all the bitcoin companies to me. Like these companies are renting pornos out of the adult section of the video storee, hidden behind a curtain. I guess in fairness to CES there's probably an equal number of awkward neckbeards skulking out of there on a regular basis with shame in their eyes. Even so, I would have liked to see the main players in the space displayed a little more prominantly
