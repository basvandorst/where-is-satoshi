What currency did you use to buy it with?

decentralization can come from node location and (lack of) control. Consumer buying pools that fulfill minimum order quantities + Node-staking delivery outlets that offer localized distribution points are both examples of how blockchains will change retail supply chains.

Summary: "Everyone saw it coming. It didn’t *have* to be Toys ‘R’ Us, but when it was, no one was surprised. Toys ‘R’ Us is one of the dozens of big-name retailers to announce store closures within the span of 1 year."

The project highlighted in the story does deliver the physical good. And all of the informations about Toys R Us was sourced from WSJ. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 22:51:56
Your point was fair but stern. Hoping this summary suffices: “The final goodbye from Toys ‘R’ Us is the latest in a series of store closings that illustrate why retail needs blockchain right now more than ever.”

There was A LOT going on last week that could have made the stock dip a little.

I think it’s partially due to the impact of Alternative Trading Systems. TZero was just the start but more ICOs are going to follow suite. This elucidates my point a little bit  of the effect 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:23:33
Does it use an ATS as a funding platform? ICOs that are doing that rn are changing the world man

No doubt, lots of new tech coming out. But new projects need to find totally new forums for advertising/ communication. Twitter, FB, and Google were huge mediums for publicity.

I just devised a template to make it fast and easy. I also had a template for the standard response I recieved, which was usually "what is your rate?"
I saw a 3 stage messaging theme for most of my successful deals. First Message: Raise interest with credibility and sample offers, sign off with "Let me know if you'd like to hear more about my packages" \[steak dangling for those who needed the services\]. Second message: Give packages and pricing. Third message: close deal. 
I offered 100&amp; money back guarantee, which I said in the second message. (Fortunately I haven't had to return a payment yet). 
Also, I also asked for 100&amp; of payments upfront, or at least 50&amp; I have always gotten paid, but I had to break ties with 1 client for ineptness to hold to terms of payments. I use PayPal for probably 70&amp; of my payments and cryptocurrency for the rest. Lots of people have offered to pay me in their token, but I don't generally do that. 
Also, speed hack: When I just copy + pasted my message on LinkedIn from the phone, I was getting up to like 8 messages sent per minute. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:38:46
Overall, about 20&amp; responded, but I received actual business from 2-5&amp;

Got ya.. I’m definitely one of the crazy ones. I’m more so into Blockchain than crypto. I should have specified. I also didn’t quit my program until i had my first 20k plus month, all via PayPal.

Next wave is all family offices + institutional investors so you are definitely spot on. Do family offices and institutional investors have influencers that resonate well with that crowd? If so, who would those people be?

You know you're a fraud when people are renting out billboards to call your bluff.

I was boot strapping every step of the way tbh. I went back and looked at what I did, but at the time, I didn't have much of a plan. My goal was to get 3 articles a week while I was in school so I can get some beer and food money. That was my plan. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:44:02
I still don't know if I'm crazy for doing it. I haven't had my first tax season. I don't have any long term contracts set up. But I'm on pace for well over 6 figures this year just by selling writing services. Eventually I made it to white papers and that's where the real money is. At this point, I don't care about failing.

How did you go into crypto.. Investor? Marketing? Advising? Please elaborate. I told myself that I wanted to sell shovels instead of find gold.

So it’s incorrect to say there is a positive correlation between the number of Google hits and the price of bitcoin, whereas the higher the number of google hits positively correlates with a higher BTC price?

I see the bitcoin/ Elvis price predictor (which is freaking hilarious btw) but not the Google trends and Bitcoin price correlation. Screen shot please?
