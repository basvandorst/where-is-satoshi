Maybe read the article? Vaults do not attract more hackers. It scares them away.
Agree this should be considered. Very good idea.

If more than 50% of the miners decide to enforce the 1MB limit it won't matter much. They would orphan any block larger than 1MB, and everyone would follow the longest chain. You would need to checkpoint a bigger block or change pow to successfully fork in that case.

Ouch... that is a bad name for a company. Those that don't see coin in the name will see co-insecure.

Anywhere I can make a bet on when the soft forks will activate?

Looks like you were wrong mate.
Why bother answering when you don't know the answer? Was it just wishful thinking?

 is a streaming service where you pay per minute via payment channels.

I didn't know blockchain worked on LN. Where can I read more about it?

You mean they should think like you, otherwise they're wrong? You are pathetic.

Yeah, they don't really have a lot of support... they are just loud.

Use pool-hopping to mitigate it :P

Is someone working on a HF version of segwit?

I wonder if Peter Todd or Greg Maxwell would have exposed Craig if they were asked to come. Something tells me they would consider every possibility CSW could take to fool them.
Would you have gone if you were asked? @_date: 2016-10-27 19:40:53


Man, what world are we living in where a minor release is more exciting than a major one? Only in Bitcoin folks!
Thanks for the great job on segwit. Schnorr up next? Or maybe MASTs?

How is it not ok for them to publish a softfork that requires 95%, while you find it OK to publish a hardfork that only requires 75%?
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:12:13
That would explain it :)
@_date: 2015-11-15 17:24:27
I looked at some of your posts, and saw an abundance of the word "cultist". lol

Get a sense of humour ffs!

Right, you can't prove a negative. This is the best we get.

Mainly with trolls who are too loud for it to be productive.

What do you mean 'killing off SPV'? Are you talking about the option to disable serving SPV clients? Why should it be mandatory? Let the people who want to serve SPV clients do it and those who don't disable it. Why does someone need permission to disable that service, and who should they ask?

Alright, its over. He was a fake. Lets move on.

Slush's latest [medium post]( indicated he currently supports core, so doesn't seem likely he would sabotage this soft fork. Would be interesting to know when he plans to actually signal support for CSV. @_date: 2016-05-05 20:59:49
It is unimportant who Satoshi is. But I assume that people from Classic see it as their only chance to grab some power - by appealing to the authority that is Satoshi.
