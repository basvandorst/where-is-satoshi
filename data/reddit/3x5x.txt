Yes, but to get 51%, you need to either add slightly over 102% of the current network hashrate or purchase/hijack 51% of the current network. So if the government is building new facilities, then they need over 100% of the network to succeed.

Remember that the government needs 100% of the network to conduct a 51% attack. It's a bit counterintuitive, but despite that attacking network by hijacking miners only requires hijacking 50%+, attacking the network by adding more miners requires duplicating 100% of the current hashrate.

The idea behind legal tender is so that I can't try to repay the bank with chickens, pay Wal-Mart with buttons, or settle a lawsuit with a truck full of rubber ducks.
It's not practical to eliminate legal tender entirely, but some parts of it can be abolished. For example, the medium of repayment can be specified in the loan contract or a store's conditions instead of forced by the government.
So long as we maintain the court system, however, we need a form of legal tender.

That's not actually true. Shorter block sizes do increase orphaning, but withholding attacks are not one of the causes—the chance of a withholding attack succeeding is independent of the block time. It's very likely that 10 minutes is an overestimate of the ideal block time, but this is a change that would be too controversial to ever pass.
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:00:01
I am starting to think that the block reward halving is the biggest mistake in Bitcoin. Why?
It's well known that Bitcoin is only secure when the combined network strength is greater than that any malicious entity could economically muster. These malicious entities can include governments. We must either trust the network to be strong enough to defeat government attempts to 51% the currency, or trust governments not to do so. Most will agree that the former is better.
The second thing that is well-known is that the cost of mining is very closely correlated with the returns of mining, due to fundamental principles of free markets. This means that what we are trusting now, is that the combined revenues of Bitcoin miners should be higher than what a rogue government could feasibly spend to attack the network.
After a very long time, all miner revenue must come from transaction fees.
So what we are trusting is that, in the distant future, the combined transactions fees paid by the entire network must exceed what governments are willing to pay to attack the network.
The chance of that happening is slim at best. Visa's revenue is just over $10 billion annually. Even if Bitcoin grows to 10 times Visa's size, with comparable fees, the amount of money it will take to attack the network is one fifth of the US deficit alone.
There's no way to fix this. If block size is expanded too much, then free market forces will bring down the fees. If block size isn't expanded, then transactions will move off-chain, causing even more damage to miner income. The block size limit must be set to maximize fees per transaction and number of on-chain transactions; the classic business problem of deciding what price to sell at. I suspect even the optimal such price is insufficient.
What's the solution? Well, given how Bitcoin is a currency, one solution is to use the currency itself to sponsor network defence. Satoshi came up with an excellent solution: the block reward. The block reward is effectively an inflation tax on Bitcoin holders to support miners. In fact, over a longer period of time, the block reward will result in 0% inflation, since a sufficiently large money supply will result in approximately equal coin destruction and creation.
This is not a post criticizing Bitcoin. The block reward will be sufficient for the foreseeable future. But the halving of the block reward could prove Bitcoin's Achilles Heel in 50 years. Hopefully that's enough time to rethink that decision.

It's a security problem though. There's a market cap to how high the transaction fees will go, no matter how reduced the supply. As the block subsidy declines, miners will need to be compensated by transaction fees. (The network is at risk if miners are not paid enough.) The ideal size is such that blocks are full enough to be competitive, but not so small that the network is at risk. That's why an automatically-scaling block size limit is so important.

You are correct. Most governments are more than capable enough to 51% the network today. However, the network is getting stronger and will continue increasing in strength until the next block subsidy halving.
The robustness index measures the cost of 51%ing the network:
Edit: Note that buying 25 buildings may be cheaper than the method the RIX assumes malevolent actors will use (buying miners and facilities currently in use), since mining is still a profitable industry. But producing the miners for the buildings is risky and takes time, during which the network continues to expand.

There's nothing more valid about either anarcho-capitalism or anarcho-communism. They're both based on the premise that there is no law, but in each case societal customs are distinct.
In anarcho-capitalism, despite no law, society by consensus recognizes private property. You are "allowed" to earn money, but if your neighbour tries to use it, society will allow you to use violence (this term used broadly, since it includes arrest) to defend it, because it sees your neighbour as the aggressor.
In anarcho-communism, despite no law, society by consensus does not recognize private property. You are "allowed" to earn money, just as your neighbour is "allowed" to use it. But if you try to use violence to defend it, then society will in turn restrain you, because it will see you as the aggressor.
They are simply different consensuses. If our society develops into anarchism, then it will likely be anarcho-capitalism because the idea of private property is ingrained in our minds. But there are people who believe (perhaps unrealistically) that an anarchist revolution will also wipe that idea from our minds.

Collisions are more likely than counting due to the birthday paradox. A collision occurring is closer to counting to 2^(80) in terms of difficulty.
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:26:16
The chance of this occurring is far higher than a lot of the people on this sub assume.
1) RIPEMD is not a random oracle, despite that many estimates try to model it as one. It may not be as strong as believed. It may not be surjective in the first place; there's no reason to assume that all 2^(160) "possible" addresses are actually generated with a private key. In fact, since Bitcoin uses multiple cryptographic functions to make addresses (first making the public key), the surjectivity depends on the weakest link. So there is a non-zero chance that it may take much less than 2^(80) generated addresses for a 50% chance of collision.
2) Computing power continues to grow and is showing no sign of stopping. If exponential growth continues, then 2^(80) will become a number of no significance. Although large, 2^(80) is well below physical limits. For comparison, the number of Silicon atoms on Earth is closer to 2^(160).
With these in mind, I would personally ascribe a 90% chance of collision occurring in the next millenium, which is far higher than the chance of the Earth being destroyed in the next 5 seconds.

I think one problem with Bitcoin's design that might be too late to fix is how blocks are limited by size instead of by number of outputs. Size is inconsequential in the long run, since blocks can be pruned. Unspent outputs cannot be pruned.
If blocks were limited by number of outputs, then the transaction fee would be based solely on the number of outputs (and not the number of inputs). This makes the fee for any normal transaction practically constant. Merchant-prescribed transaction fees make more sense in that context.
It would still be impossible to spam the blockchain, since inputs are entirely consumed in any transaction, and a potential attacker would need to pay to create new inputs.
