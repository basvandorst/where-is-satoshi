There are many predictions saying a million in 2020, I think those are a bit delusional.
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:47:41
The Bitcoin addiction. 
But I think you're kind of right. 
I was always thinking about the amount of money you can make from it $$$. 
Not knowing that Bitcoin is actually a big F you to the current corrupt banking system, which is way more important to me.
@_date: 2019-11-10 11:29:20
Short term prediction. 
We gonna break through 9k and finally even hit just above 10k and drop back to the low 8k or even high 7k.
Disclaimer: this prediction is based on nothing. I am not a doctor, don't take medical advise from me, bye bye.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:19:27
Hmm it's bedtime here, if I wake up tomorrow  and it's under 8k, I'm surely gonna get me some Satoshi's on sale.  
But it might rocket to 16-18k....
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:48:27
Nice one. 
I predict 1k comments if btc goes down to 3k.
And 10k comments if btc hits 6 digits.

Banning might actually make Bitcoin go up. 
Making things illegal draws more interest. 
Look at alcohol when it got banned in the US, or when there is talk about changing gun laws, sales go through the roof. 
And if there would be an actual ban, exchanges will have to close, but more opportunities will rise for decentralised p2p "exchanges".

From 1000 Satoshi's to 2000 Satoshi's, impressive bro. Hodl for life!
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:32:18
Would you eat your own dick if it doesn't? 
My guess, it doesn't go lower than 7.4k
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:35:47
Thanks for your long answer, I learned a bit more today.
@_date: 2019-11-09 05:40:08
Anyone here using the blockstream green wallet on android? 
I can't login, it keeps saying I'm not connected to the Internet, while I'm definitely connected.
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:30:56
I guess we're doomed. 
And I was so excited about this driving lambos on the moon thing. :(
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:00:26
When I buy, it dips, I buy some more, it dips some more.
@_date: 2019-11-08 02:50:03
Happy to announce that I'm finally officially part of the Bitcoin club! 
Although it's still in the 0.0xxx I'm getting there. 
See you all in the citadel on the moon.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:17:26
Lowest price before the real Bull starts. 
But I won't eat my dick on it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:49:07
Nothing wrong with healthy sceptics, I just responded to the electricity argument. I'm not an expert on coding and the technology of blockchain, so I can not debate on that.
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:30:24
I generate 1 or more receiving adresses, I save the adresses, but don't use them. 
Will these adresses ever expire? And will they always be linked to my private key?
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:24:28
I'll just use my credit card, oh wait...
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:28:07
As long as we stay above 7.3k the halving cycle goes as every other.
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:32:11
You sure it's a friend? Not someone who promises you something in return.
Anyway an easy to set up and use on android/ios wallet is blockstream green.
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:05:31
Because they don't use bip39. 
But you can still import a bip39 wallet, just not create one.
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:36:17
It will, but not as fast as everybody thinks and wants unfortunately. 
I think will have to hodl till 2022 Q1/Q2.
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:24:08
After I had a couple 100 dollar worth in Bitcoin, I created a second wallet totally offline and secure, made sure that I had my seed phrase right, stored them securely in 2 different ways and 2 different locations.
And then there is this guy, 10.000 dollars worth on your iPhone no clue what seeds are and just wipe it all....
@_date: 2019-11-28 04:23:52
Yeah I bought some too, dip coming soon.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:43:21
Well I guess you are right. While the majority uses something like Internet and email, some people actually still write letters and send them by post to arrive 2 days later, maybe it has sentimental value.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:08:48
I was wondering about that lately. 
If that time ever comes that a Bitcoin is worth millions, it makes sense to switch over to Satoshi's.
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:37:47
Lol it doesn't work without electricity and Internet! This day and age nothing works without electricity and Internet. 
It will be chaos, Bitcoin will have no value, but so will the dollar/euro and if people are starving they will prefer 1kg rice over your 1kg gold.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:19:00
Would be great, buy some more.
@_date: 2019-11-09 01:43:14
If I could use Bitcoin everywhere from now on. I would convert all my fiat into Bitcoin, no use for fiat anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-19 04:33:18
I have 2 wallets, A(used) and B(unused). 
I've used A to get btc from an exchange where ID verification was required. 
In terms of anonyminity does it matter if I send my btc direct to B:
Exchange &gt; A &gt; B
Exchange &gt; B
(I always use a different address)
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:31:55
Setting up a wallet was the easiest thing to do.
Next is to find a reliable seller that doesn't have a complicated kyc/id verification process. I think that's the biggest turn off, people don't want to share all there details/passport information etc. just to try out what this bitcoin thing is.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:53:01
Welcome to the future. 
I've always been a fan of using cash, but fact is we're moving towards a electronically payment dominant system. 10 years from now cash probably won't be accepted in 99% of the shops in first world countries.
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:25:49
2 pizzas
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:23:49
I wake up and it's neither. 
Ah well, than I just buy a little bit.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:14:02
Usually there are like 20 comments in the daily, now 420.
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:11:04
Buy now or wait for the weekend?
Anyway I have good hopes for 2020.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:55:20
Power outage means atms and most cash registers won't work bro. 
It's gonna be problematic, unless you live in Asia for example where cash is still nr. 1
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:06:14
I think the lowest it will go would be around 7.5k.
Personally I don't mind actually as I want to buy some the next couple weeks. 
Think we gonna get real bullish end of December.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:19:16
Blockstream green
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:13:49
I just think your argument that without Internet/electricity Bitcoin doesn't work, is a very bad one. As our whole societies won't work and will need to be rebuild. But yes you're right, gold might keep value and can function as money, if it doesn't get stolen from you. And in case you actually have Internet, Bitcoin is so much more convenient and easier than gold. Do you cut up your gold in grams and send it with the mail to the other side of the world to pay someone?
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:24:15
Some random gibberish ಠᴗಠ.
And yes always buy the dip and if it dips more, you buy some more.
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:27:12
With the upcoming halving it's probably not worth the investment.
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:41:32
Who actually controls the switch from Bitcoin to Satoshi on the stockmarket? 
People would rather buy 100,000 Satoshi for 10 dollar than 0.001 Bitcoin, we're still humans after all.
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:28:35
random gibberish ಠᴗಠ

I came for the money, I stayed for the peaceful revolution that Bitcoin will bring.
Sometimes I think about the creator, what a genius he/she/they must been and how humble and beautiful it is to bring bitcoin in existence without the proud of claiming it, but to simply give it to humanity for the better.
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:06:52
I can finally afford a whole bitcoin then. :D
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:14:00
I would love to see the McAfee and other predictions come true and see millions next year. But personally I expect it's gonna take at least another 2 years before we set the new ath and it will be 6 digits not 7.
Hodling means having patience, lot of patience.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:41:57
"Ideal" that's very hard to guess.
I think btc price is pretty low at the moment, but it's a crazy ride and you never know, it can always dip more.
Anyway, I think chances are pretty high that in 6 months the price is way higher, but again you are never sure.
With your 500 dollar, I would either:
1) Invest it all right now in the low 7k
2) Invest 50 dollar per week for a period of 10 weeks, trying to catch the dips.
@_date: 2019-12-02 07:16:22
Like always I bought just before the dip, but also before the moon!
@_date: 2019-12-11 02:19:51
Also interested in this, I get that coins are traceable and a mixer is the only way to avoid this.
But on the other hand there is no ID linked to any of it.
Even if I buy on an exchange with my known ID, maybe I just buy them for someone else who offered me a product or service and wanted to be paid in btc.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:40:09
Just get a motorcycle, more speed and adrenaline for your satoshis

A diamond is the hardest mineral and it's being used in the industrial industry.
And some find it aesthetically pleasing apparently.
