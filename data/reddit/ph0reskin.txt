That insight would have really shocked Physiocracists in the 18th century.
Damn, why is bitcoin such a basin for people with a very poor understanding of economics? It's a good long term investment choice and an interesting stepping stone from a historical perspective, that's it.

Without people thinking they are smarter than bots/algorhythms and professional traders, the champagne industry would suffer badly

Your Bank account will get frozen if this amount is unusual and you will have to answer where it came from

A blockchain that publicly lists every transaction is quite the opposite of being a privacy tool. LEA have shown that blockchain-analysis consistently demasks attempts of on-chain-mixing. Centralized mixing services have proven to have no benefit for the user at all and coinjoin still has to proove itself.
Besides that, its just politics. Here in germany, the state home secretaries just condemd 5g's end-to-end encryption feature, demanding to implement means for eavesdropping... its scary, but on the other hand, thats their role in the political system

And if everyone does just that, our economy and wealth will blow away next. crypto is great as a niche asset, but as long  as almost all cryptocurrencies have a build-in deflationary design and people HODL instead spend, its mainstream adoption would be the worst thing that could happen to an economy.

While you are at it, consider giving an open source system a try. A lot of good Linux Distributions are pretty much plug-and-play, meaning you don't need any special knowledge to use them. And if you do need some windows applications, you can always dual boot, having windows installed as well.

If only there were a summery by Deutsche Bank 15 years ago, that foretold that the Bank would loose 90% of its capital

The german source is actually very critical of the new legislation. Yes, it is no longer needed to seperate between banks and exchanges, but the amount of crypto you can buy without being checked was significantly decreased. Both regulations are part of the german anti-money-laundring effort. It's aim is to link people to their assets. Not a good thing for any decentralized currency.

The fees are quite high though

If the general consensus would be that the prices are too low, they would rise.
I don't know what you expect. If you're in it to make a profit and trade on a regular basis, you *will* lose money to bots and professionals.
Prices may rise and they may fall, no one knows except the people with the capital to move the market themselves

Thats just one possibility. Trading casually will most likely loose you money. Especially in a market as volantile as btc/fiat, bots and professional traders feed on the people that for some reason think it's a good idea to daytrade.

Good luck with the deflation afterwards...

How familiar are you with linux? If you're new, try using ubuntu and install Bitcoin Knots from the official ppa.

Because the odds are stacked against you. You are competing with bots, professional traders and probably people with enough capital to manipulate the market.
If it's working for you, fine. If you enjoy it and don't wager too much, keep doing it.

How would you say your method of buying low and selling high is superior to a bot? He's faster and more disciplined then you. His strategy can be backtested. 
It's like going to a casino, you can win, the odds arn't too bad that you stay profitable over quite some time. But on average, you loose. Its fine if you get enjoyment out of it though
