There's a lot of comparison going on in this thread. What exactly makes a digital current superior or inferior to another one? If you remove how a digital coin owner stores and spends their coin, what is the difference?

I see what you did there, and its a cute little diversion, but we all know Tucker's whole shtick is to find people that behave differently than him and tell them why they're way of living is wrong. I don't understand why some people get off on telling others they're wrong.

He looks at the people that he interviews as if they had dicks coming out of their head. He's so unnecessarily dramatic lol, all the guy does is argue

Is that the real reason? Or is it because you're incapable of explaining why i'm wrong? I highly doubt that you actually do mind violating my echo chamber, so please, educate me. I would love to hear about why you think Tucker Carlson doesn't find easy targets to promote his ideology. This whole "I don't want to have a real conversation about [insert_politically_charged_topic] so i'll just call this person a snowflake or write them off as an idiot" idea is dangerous. Not only is it dangerous, its getting old. Instead of telling me you could explain why i'm wrong, why don't you just tell me?
