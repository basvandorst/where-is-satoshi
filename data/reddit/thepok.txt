The Changetip account connects him self to your reddit account. Only you can do that becouse, only you have the password to your Redditaccount ( i hope). Its save the way it is, but yeah, if you get tipped a lot in the future you should withdraw some bitcoins to a more save place :)

Pls see my idea for poolspecific fees.
If user choose wich pools can get Transactionfees, 50% Pools can be fight by The Bitcoinusers :)
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:18:44
Oh yea thank you for the big fix :) Lot of cash for me to tip others now :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:43:25
I had a idea how to help smaller Pools, pls review it here: 
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:48:39
i thing you get it wrong! Sidechains help to save Bitcoin from the Altcoinarmy! Sidechains are additional legs and Arms to the Bitcoinblockchain. So it get stronger!
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:42:01
Thats a realy good idea, some others should track there BTC too, and look if they are in a cold storage
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:12:52
did you pay fees?
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:37:28
People send lots of free Bitcoins, but its sad, that so much goes to ghash, while many user sure would like to supoort smaler pools, even if they have to wait a little longer
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:09:23
Its not in the "Special"-Section, but its hole new own category :D
So it seems to stay :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:41:03
Nearly, i would only add one Pooladress, and just doublespand it a lot and every pool can pick the transaction that suits him most :)
Yes Transactions get a little bit bigger. There are now 2 changeadresses, one is my own and one is the adress of the pool for the fee. No need to change anything at the bitcoinnetwork. The Buildin Feesystem just isnt used, but replaced with predetermined Feereciveradress. I hope you understand me better now?

Iam at MtGox from since the price was at 4 dollar! And they had ups and downs, but they never lost my Coins! They are in my eyes the most trusworthy exchange. I am pretty sure they will be there in the forseeable future, they have tons of cash and Bitcoin, so no risk of bankrupt.   They mad 10 thousnds of Bitcoins they still hold, from fees , since they belive in Bitcoin too. There may be better exchanges, but they did earn my trust with years of save experince
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:12:48
They answerd questions they got on Twitter and sais its secruty related....and come one...blockchain.info has no 700k coins

mergemining = mining Bitcoin and sidechain at the same time. PoS in its current form is inherently less secrue than PoW. If the Chain Splits, in PoW you have to choose, but in PoS you can mine on both new chains, thats bad, that helps doublespends
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:58:24
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:07:03
not possible, they would need huge amounts of cash or bitcoins and would loose lot of money!

what fees? i dont think there is a fee! Who should get it in a decentrlized system?

iam sorry for your condition, but there is a no bagging rule!
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:17:46
Hello, i did think about a way to choose the pool that gets my transactionfee. Its Simple, You Build a transaction, that sends your Bitcoin that you really wanne send to your choosen Adress, and a little fee to an public anounced Adress from the Pool you like. The Transaction wouldnt have a real Fee, so GHASH could Includ it, but the Fee would still go to your suported pool.
You Could do this with all the Pools you like, and what ever Pool finds first a Block gets your Fee. The other Transactions would become invalid. Only Downside is that you have to send [Number of pools you like] manny Transactions.
With my system, we, the Bitcoinusers had more direct influence on the miners, and i think, thats important!
What do you guys think???? Pls someone whos more fluent in Englisch rewrite my Idea :) And give Credit ;D

yeah bits were a good step!
funny 1  bit = 1 doge
25 bits
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:28:02
You are wrong sir!
I do not break Bitcoin! I just would make a Multisend Transaction, One Transaction is my Transaction, and one is the Feetransaction. I can broadcast it freely, only difference is, that the Fee doesnt go to the one that solves a Block, but to a from me Choosen Adress. So GHash may not include my Transaction, but the pool that would get the Fee would. So i choose who gets the Fee and thats a good way to fight to big pools :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:51:32
You should try this in a non Bitcoin sub!
But for now iam happy with a tip too ;D
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:13:19
just sligltly more than one satoshi per diff 1 share! lol
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:28:47
Yes, of course. I hope some day that happens, maybe to the  1 minit of Dogecoin, or at least 2,5 of lightcoin :)
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:52:52
its a less secrure addonblockchain for small transactions that syncronises from time to time with original blockchain. Its a good idea for small all day transactions. And its not a altcoinscam, you are transfering real Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:49:40

Imagine: With every new Block, new scientific progress is made. I believe this is possible with technology available yet and some not to hard work. Since the beginning of Bitcoin there was the Quest for an Proof of Work system not only useful to Bitcoins security, but other realms too. I propose to use research in Mathematics as replacement or addition for the currently very limited Proof of Work Systems in Cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:46:13
You arre right, its not as perfect as normal POW, ill add this to the problemsection. It is like Proof of Stake....one could "mine" on two forks at the same time! I dont think thats a unsolveable problem :)
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:40:06


Thats not true...they need to much energy
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:09:08
That test doesnt work!
Its to easy to just test all the adresses in the Blockchain, no need to break BC.i secrurity
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:25:56
brute forcing 4 billion adresses is more efficent than breaking shared send.
Your intention is noble, but the execution bad. Someone gone crap that 0.1 soon. but he wont have touched sharesend...

Payout to all customers of an amount derived from the ratio of 72% (after legitimization of claims and verification of identity). The remaining amounts will be payed out once the seizure of the Polish account         is lifted.

Contact the lawyers of Bitcoin24! The Bitcoinwithdraws are not automatic. You can be prety sure to get your Bitcoins! Maybe a two week timeframe has to be espected.
@_date: 2013-06-23 13:41:17

Make proper research. One Colored coin is one share is one satoshi is 0.00000001 Bitcoin! Clients dont have to be modified.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:18:32

@_date: 2013-05-13 16:38:01

He is waiting for the police to act....the account is frozen, he cant run away with the Monney, thats fiat not Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:00:46
Just take 20% Of made Profits after Fees or so!
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:39:53
keep guessing :/
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:48:09
iam soo sorry, realy ;D
@_date: 2013-04-30 07:33:22
no if you buy and sell in the same Moment you pay 1 dollar :) so 100btc x 1Dollar x 5 = 500 dollar fee. still high, but not much in Bitcoinworld :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 17:06:01
Now you do ;D
@_date: 2013-07-29 20:45:41
i got mine too :)
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:51:41
they show the weakpoints too, thats nice :) I think the moderator dont likes the premining too ;D
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:37:12
there are ways to make Bitcointransaction anonym without Scamcoins :)
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:09:55
i think 1 Dollar per Trade per Bitcoin and 0.05% per day you hold it
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:45:39
to much talk about scamcoins for my taste
@_date: 2013-09-09 09:32:00
Dont Panic, this is no Fork, and it would fix it self in 36 houres :) But of course a real Patch is on the Way. For now, just dont shut down your Bitcoin-Qt
@_date: 2013-06-28 09:49:11
 sells Amazon coupons for Bitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:29:59
seems complicated and slow :/
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:47:37
