Have you guys thought of buying DGX? 1 DGX represents 1 gram of gold stored in a vault

Bitcoin just hit a triple top. So if you want wait for it to drop and when it drop, dont hesitate

Yea you are right, it's just my guess. Btc is a market driven by whales and insiders and big boys not us.

Nobody knows who he is till date. What do u mean born satoshi? That doesn't even make any sense.

It's not a strong crossover yet, wait for pull back to retest support then I would be convinced
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:10:00
True :)

Nobody looks at 90/180. Look at 50/200 instead

He is not even satoshi

Very simple. When bitcoin rises, alts sell off to buy BTC, when BTC stabilised, funds flow out from BTC into alts. Alts rally will come after btc rally ends, then btc drops and alts rise
