Can't imagine being so free I'm afraid to leave the house - or even go to school growing up, and these "laws" stand for shit when your country is in the process of extraditing a journalist for exposing war crimes.
I enjoy the freedom of leaving my house unarmed without feeling in existential danger, the assurance that if anything does happen - malicious or accidental - that medical bills won't wreck my life. Or that an authority employed to protect the innocent won't shoot me in the face.

Initially I thought your comment was referring only to government bonds (which have had negative yields on larger bonds), which I've been told by several 'rich' folk I know, are a hard pass. Clarified my comment though.
Clearly some still buy government bonds.

The issue isn't that they could refuse renewal. I mean, maybe they can, that's not the issue.
It's that `.org` currently serves many organisations that literally make no profit, and the lack of a price cap means that the renewal cost can skyrocket. For example, `.hoteles` domains cost $65,000 a year to register and $71,000 to renew. `.org` could now become one of these "exclusive" top-level domains. And the people setting the price and selling them? They're a for-profit private equity firm.

Initially I thought they were talking about government bonds. The "we promise (maybe) to reduce the impact of inflation on your cash a bit but not even close to fully" kind of bond. Corporate bonds are sometimes attractive though.
I only know a handful of 'rich' people but aside from one who uses their tax free ISA allowance, none use savings accounts. By contrast all of them have gold, and some corporate bonds.

It does happen though. I lost 12 BTC because some "knowhow experts" at PC World swapped my encrypted SSD for a factory standard HDD when I needed a new PSU because it "wouldn't boot" (no shit it clearly needed a password). Annoyed because at the time that was still around 3 grand. Expensive PSU :(
I don't believe this potato though, but at least he has the decency to come up with a lie explaining why he can't move the coins instead of just demanding blind trust with 0 verification.

I did a small freelance PHP job. Can't remember but I think it was early 2013, person asked if they could pay by Bitcoin after I'd already done the work. I didn't do anything with them.
I didn't even care that I'd lost them until a few years ago (maybe 2016? when BTC broke $1k), but I worked out that at the time it was lost they were worth £3k. I was mainly pissed at the time because they'd replaced an expensive SSD with a cheap HDD, and I'd lost 2 projects that I was working on and hadn't backed up either.

It's much the same with me telling my family to buy ethereum and bitcoin. They're all convinced every time it sees a dip it's the end, so they never do. But I'm always right. If they'd invested in ethereum when I said and sold at 1k they'd have made almost a 3000% return.

Open source shouldn't necessarily mean that it's completely community driven, and it'd be completely reasonable for a genuine Satoshi to try to move Bitcoin in the path that they had envisioned.

The difference would be that presently, creditors can lend more money than they have - as is allowed by regulation. Bitcoin regulation states otherwise and so subject to this new restriction they could only lend money that they had - effectively putting the risk on the creditors instead of the people who hold their money with them as it is currently.
Also, Bitcoin is perfectly compatible with governmental systems, just they would have to change a bit - they can no longer prop up or bailout industries by just printing extra money. Taxes, social security systems, etc are all compatible, the only difference being it's a bit harder to track tax evaders.
What's not so easily compatible is global trade tariffs, import taxes... Something that needs to go anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:11:34
It's always baffled me why somebody would use something so centralized to store a decentralized currency! These exchanges are often significantly less secure than banks and hacking them can be much more catastrophic than a bank being hacked - a hacked bank will often only lead to customer data being stolen; a hacked exchange will often lead to customer funds being stolen.
If you think it's *your* bitcoin when you don't hold the keys, you don't understand bitcoin at all. It's like a safety deposit box where the bank holds the only keys to it.

KYC isn't saying "your cryptocurrencies belong to everyone". KYC isn't saying "you can't buy/own cryptocurrencies". It's not communism.
And again, it's still not anything to do with the free market - a term I suggest you read into the definition of since you've clearly no clue what it means.  Hell, the price of milk as I mentioned is a solid example of government crimes against the free market, if you'd care to look into that.
KYC is a problem of governance, not a problem of communism.

You're conflating ideas here. Centralized banking is neither communist nor capitalist. It's a convenience that's allowed the idea of a free market to flourish: everyone using the same tokens of value to buy goods.
Equally decentralized currency is a threat to both ideologies, whilst still having *nothing to do with a free market, other than enabling it.* In the same ways centralized currency did.
All you're doing is trying to disguise outright anarchism with hatred towards a political ideology, in a place where that ideology barely exists, isn't in power, and hasn't been even close for a long time (if the US, then never has been). KYC isn't communism, it's governance, and if you have a problem with governance then just don't lie about what your problem is.

The issue is that somewhere in the supply chain there's going to be a conversion between BTC&lt;-&gt;Fiat.
There needs to be an effort to move entire supply chains over to BTC thus giving it a physical value independent of it's fiat exchange rate.  Fiat currencies are no more real than bitcoin; the only difference is that they fuel the transactions for the whole supply chain.

This graph, assuming it's correct, is always correct for the number of possible combinations. 2048 raised to n, where n = number of words. Looks to be about right.
But the implied security with that is only as valid as the PRNG is random.
If the PRNG is deterministic and has a 32 bit seed for example, there are only 4 billion combinations even if the phrase is 24 words, and that 4 billion can be iterated quite easily.
