It's almost as if interest follows price. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:08:44
Well, you could have bought at $1000 and sold a few whiles later for &lt; $200 and been even madder.

Mind giving a quick description of how to use scikit-images to reverse engineer this to find the qr codes?

This link goes to a 404 error page, and has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

Yeah. This the the correct way to announce the price.

You do know the first rule of Bitcoin, don't you?

Your health and sanity is worth more than money. Just remember that, and you'll figure out what to do. I'd suggest divesting some bitcoin into other financial instruments until you feel some peace.

We'll be ok unless they start putting guns to heads for not using it.

It's great to see journalists engaged in the conversation now. The whole tone has changed over the years from outright dismissal to rapt interest.

Mining is a competition. The only people actually making a profit are mining with massive warehouses of miners. You will lose money compared to just buying directly unless you put serious hashing power into your effort. Here is what you are up against:

Classic chicken and egg problem. Many of these crypto ventures would have never been grown if they didn't have some assurances that they wouldn't be shut down.

Slowly. Like a stable entity should.

The biggest problem is that the entrepreneurs who want to launch startups need capital. The venture capitalists who fund startups for the most part don't give 2 shits about whether a startup is standing up to the state or not - they want returns on their money. If they see big risks of losing that money to gov't intervention, they will steer clear. Notice all the capital that began flooding in after the FinCEN hearings in November of 2013.
CryptoVentures^tm that don't want to play by the rules of the US will have to operate outside of the US. We've seen some successes there, but we've also seen some spectacular hundreds-of-millions-of-dollar failures. So there is room for operations who want to stand up to the state - but they will have a substantially harder time securing funding. That will in turn cripple their rate of growth - but any truly great ideas will be hard to stop n the long run.

Maybe at the location there can be something the user needs to take a picture of from a set of possible things. Someone at the location can change the thing every day so that no one should know what it is unless they are there on that day?
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:44:24
That's awesome.

The point of Bitcoin is that you don't need a money guy. If you are fortunate enough to have a money guy you can trust with your life, then congratulations.

Can you tell us which cache it is? Might be in that area in the spring looking for a hike. That would be incentive to try and find it.

A nice way to make it easy for HackerRank to send awards when traditional channels aren't available.

I would make a new wallet where you _do_ write the seed down, and send your funds to that.

What is to stop employees of the company from taking the bitcoin for themselves? Is there a way to know who claimed the bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:15:53
It's like the "Let's Make A Deal" TV show with the 3 doors. What's behind door number 1? Door number 2? That was the [Big Deal]( game. Opening a door was risky as hell. Keeping what you had meant you at least went home with something.
If a hard-fork is done and it turns out to be a bad choice, it could be disastrous. The status quo at least is a functioning Bitcoin. Hence, no one is willing to kill the golden goose to open a door that might have a [sad ending](
It's really hard to say what will happen.

When was the last time you used digital currency and were asked to pay in bits and you didn't know what that meant? And then the next time? This debate was already settled a few years ago.

We should be starting from the timeframe of modern rocket science which began around the 1920s. So that actually took a long time before mooning.

Because the "this is good for Bitcoin" phrase works in any situation. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:29:34
You could honestly go back in time all the way to the beginning of it, and you will find hotly debated topics. The internet and Bitcoin are not special in this regard. You don't need to look far when money gets involved in something. People are going to fight about it.

The SSL error is suspect, and shouldn't the URLs be using HTTPS?

Hmmm... Well the [Videotape format wars]( are maybe similar. They were all part of the same industry, but had differing products. That's like the big block / small block debate today a bit. Ultimately one side one, and that was that.
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:14:42
What's stopping you now? People go out in the woods all the time and commonly have valuables on them.

Well any alt coin can do something non-draggy, but it won't likely be stable. Place your bets.

There are some geocachers who prefer urban geocaching. You can hide them in very small containers right in public.

A current day battle right now over the internet itself is [net neutrality.]( I think there are many parallels to Bitcoin.

But I'm wondering what is to stop an employee from making a fake account and then claiming the bitcoin. When the bar/restaurant owner gets notified, how do they know it's a real customer vs a fake one made by employees?

Look at the all time log chart, hodl, and give no fucks about day to day swings. Or sell everything and also give no fucks. Either way, this is normal Bitcoin.

That's the beauty of Bitcoin. Anyone can do whatever with it, whether you own your own private island or not.  And Mr. Branson isn't a millionaire with a private island. He's got thousands and thousands of millions, so billionaire.

I recommend new users start by sending small amounts back and forth a few times before sending larger amounts like .5 BTC to get used to the process, but glad it seems to have worked out for you.

Maybe or maybe not. Place your bets. The price will either go up or down or stay the same. (/smartassmode)

That would be horrible. I would hate that.

Maybe find someone willing to pay you in local currency who is also willing to accept the bitcoins because they want to hold them? Then figure out how to structure the job so that you're working as a subcontractor of the local guy? No one needs to know he received bitcoins. A hassle, but a possibility. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 11:03:05
There are so many alt coins that someone probably already made it. If not, you could try it out and report back to us how well it works out.

This is better than the ones who go ahead and try and use bitcoin even though they haven't bothered to learn how to use it first. Then they lose it. You're ahead of the curve in that regard.
