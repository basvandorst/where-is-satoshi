Potcoin would make sense.
@_date: 2013-07-25 21:17:24
How about working with livejasmin.com?
@_date: 2013-06-02 01:07:42
I've been using them for a while.  No problems so far.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:28:01
I just started there since I mine LTC and Vircurex seemed shady after this last weekend.  My bad for not knowing better.  I hope I can save someone else from the pain.
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:12:42
I moved some BTC over to mcxnow.  I'm pretty happy so far.
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:27:55
She's kinda foxy.
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:16:29
This site is legit.  It is one of the best exchanges out there.  
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:45:49
YESSSSSSSSS.  Do It!
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:00:22
I try to accumulate more than I trade.  Success varies.  How is it working out for you?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:22:47
Happened to me and I have been a user for over a month.  No one is safe there.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:03:16
I'm in.  I wish I could post on the forums, but I'm still a newbie.  Felt like a lonely man stranded on BTC island living in Boone.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:39:22
Up and down, but mostly up.  We spent the whole parabolic rise complaining about how we missed out on BTC at the prices we have seen in the last few days.  Not such a bad thing to get a second shot to invest close to the floor.
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:47:40
Nearly mirrors?  Be specific.  In what regards?  
@_date: 2013-09-04 21:38:35
Oh wow.  My Jally is going to be so stale when it gets here.  At least it can chat with my obsolete block erupters.  I have the Golden Girls of asics going on. 
I want it anyway.  Come on BFL, you are so close to February 20th.  Every day you delay is literally costing me mBTC a day.   
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:30:55
I want to hate that joke so bad, but it is just too good.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:01:12
Yeah, Dwolla is the cooolest thing about Iowa since the Baconfest.
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:46:05
So when do we start seeing a drop in network hash rate due to people saying "fuck this shit" and pulling their equipment offline?  I'll run mine for a while longer, but my 10 Ghps is only worth 0.02 BTC a day right now.   
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:05:25
Sorry if this has been asked and answered.  I tried looking before I asked, but I don't have much free time.  I noticed that BFL isn't shipping any Jallys this last week.  Is there a reason?  Did they decide to focus on catching the rest of the orders up?
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:17:24
No.  Can't confirm it.  :/
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:55:15
I think it is the people.  I've met so many cool people through BTC.  As a community we are pretty amazing.  The will to change the world for the better is evident.
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:14:04
I totally agree with you on all fronts, but I'm still curious what the company line of BS is on this particular issue. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:24:09
I have no idea how it could have happened.  I don't click anything in the troll box.  It bothers me a lot that they allow multiple logins at the same time on one account.  I wouldn't doubt BTC-e did it themselves.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:10:29
25% of the trading fees are distributed to all balance holders.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:11:44
I've been using Mcxnow forever.  It isn't a scam.  Just go check it out yourself.  Don't deposit any coins until you feel comfortable.
@_date: 2013-09-27 22:21:50
@_date: 2013-07-09 01:16:37
Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this order. BFL must be making these silver rounds.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:58:46
Nice.  I'm in Boone.  Almost the same scenario.  Might be a good time to think about bitcoin in our own backyard.  Ames has huge potential for brick and mortar adoption.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 04:39:09
+1 for down vote and report.
Make sure you comment something about its scammy nature too.
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:20:25
I'll keep checking to see what you have.  I've made one prior purchase from you using USD, and was very satisfied with everything.  I'll do all of my PM buying with BTC through your store now.  Occasionally I will purchase a little palladium and platinum.  Would love to see options for that in the future too.  When my current order arrives I'll leave some nice reviews on your site.  
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:50:06
I grabbed some more.  I've seen them go much higher, and I like the exchange.  I think these are going to be pretty valuable a year from now.  I'm so glad I left BTC-e.
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:20:15
I love the ding.  
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:11:35
You're awesome. 
I hope the asshole dies a slow painful death.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:10:15
I'm glad I waited to buy one of these.  I know the ROI might not be worth it, but I have just wanted one so bad.  Under $ 100 is cheap enough for me to jump on board.  I'll get this ASIC before my BFL for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:03:49
If you drove through Nebraska on the way here you'd think Iowa was an amazing state.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:02:12
We're probably inbred relation.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:13:27
Strong. 13 characters mixed case, numbers and special characters.  I generate a new pass for all accounts.  This one has never been used besides btc-e.  It seems like an inside job.
@_date: 2013-07-25 23:11:26
I have never used any of them, how do they compare?
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:40:38
At least the price is moving up a bit.  So depressing to see my mining withering away to nothing.  My new jally plus four sticks is generating what the sticks did on their own a month ago :/
@_date: 2013-09-27 23:26:12
I'll look into bitsumo.  I'm not familiar with it.
I hope you guys have a great life together.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:26:23
It happened to me while I was logged in.  Someone made off with over 3000 usd of my coins.  support had nothing at all to say in response.  
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:17:00
I take it very seriously.  This is the right direction.  We had a few minor bumps, but the big picture is still all rosy.  
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:50:42
annnnd its up again.
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:25:23
I didn't notice there was a delay when I was ordering them, but I don't mind.
I would like to see more bars.  I really like some of the poured bars I've received from other places.  I like the divisible combi bars too.    
My girlfriend wants you to put rings on the site.  Size 8.5  
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:41:26
I wish I could disagree with you.  This seems too clean.  They could have made this guy vanish.  It's either already spun or set to go that way.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:05:03
Most do pay out, but you only get a tiny amount of BTC.  I would suggest doing whatever you do for money anyway and finding a way to accept BTC for doing it.  If you're looking for easy money get in the big line of lemmings over there.  
This environment is ripe for people with good ideas and a willingness to work a bit.  There is a massive vacuum where services should be.  Be one of the people doing something about it, or find those people and support them.  
There are a lot of vultures out there too.  If you want to get rich quick you have to do business with the vultures.  The vultures have been doing this a long time.  They are better at it than you are.
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:36:14
I haven't received it yet.  I just ordered.  All silver rounds.  John Galt, Slave Queen, Freedom Girl.  I threw some other little gram bars in too.  I wish they had more variety in stock.  I'll keep checking.
