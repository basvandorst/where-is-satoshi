He’s good but not that good. He needs to upgrade his Bitcoins to level up to the M4.

I mean M3 and M4 are same cars, just one is a sedan other is a coupe.

Thanks for the info, definitely inspired to take it to my school.

No one will explain that to them. They won’t feel so good when they retire and Bitcoin is worth 500K.

Kinda feels good to be an early adopter as to what will be the biggest and most used form of currency in a decade or two.

Funnily enough, a few of my teachers have some Bitcoin. Some are “scared” to get Bitcoin though. Supposedly to them it’s “Only for criminals who want to hide their transactions.” Not sure what they’re on about.

I hope so! Bitcoin is very interesting to me.

I know who actually owns those cars, he has less difficulty taking out the cars than picking one to drive.

Yeah! Two friends of mine, and of course me, are very interested in Bitcoin and we all understand how it works. So it’ll be a good idea to do something like that.

Wish I could buy some, don’t have any money as I don’t have a job.

My high school does and more.

About 47.8K per Bitcoin. The car picture costs around 480K ish, depending on the options.

Oh trust me, as soon as my “friends” try and “cure” my “addiction” I’ll cure them off of my friends list. My friends know I am a Bitcoin supporter, most of them get what it is AND truly understand its value. Yet they refuse to do anything with that. It’s just....I don’t understand.
“Oh wow! Bitcoin is safe, a great investment with a lot of potential value, AND will be the future of currency? Let me not invest my time into it.” -99% of my friends.
A few though have been converted and truthfully are interested. So kudos to them.

Interests are different with people. I’m a car enthusiast. I rather have a nice 500K car and a 50K home than a 50K car and 500K house. That’s just me though. You like what you like. The day Bitcoin hits 100K I’m buying myself a Pagani.

This dealer doesn’t really wanna deal with holding Bitcoin, they just wanna allow Bitcoin holders to pay for a car, but they obviously just want another way to make cash.

Lambo of NB has been accepting Bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:22:11
That’s pretty amusing. Def. bookmarking that one.

Oh! Haha, did not look at that. Thank you very much!

I’m a bit confused. Sorry, I’m decently new to this Bitcoin thing.
Mining is creating Bitcoins using your computer right? You say this is a no-go and should only be done for fun?
But, can I simply just buy a Bitcoin in exchange for my real money and hope the value increases? If so, where would I be able to do that?

You have a lack of brain cells it seems
