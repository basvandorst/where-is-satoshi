I think it's kind of badass to have a guy who doesn't give a fuck on the Supreme Court. Even if he did it, I want him on the court. Women are always portrayed as "strong" in modern mainstream media.

Three things to keep in mind:
1. There's no way to know what the "fair" value of a Bitcoin is at any given moment. It could be $3000 now for all we know.
2. Bad and good news aren't what move the market. It's supply and demand. Bitcoin went through periods where the news was great over and over...but the price kept declining. This was back in 2014. You know what happened since then.
3. Manipulation gets harder to do as the market cap gets higher. So on a percentage basis, and in terms of length of time, banks will have a difficult fight ahead of them to hold the price down. They can knock it down a few thousand dollars for a few months. But it'll float right back up. You just have to keep stacking. You won't get depressed if you think in terms of 5 year intervals rather than 6 month intervals.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:41:04
Typically network growth can be modeled fairly accurately. Timing the bubbles and busts is impossible, but it's pretty safe to say the trend of exponential growth will continue at longer intervals.
@_date: 2018-09-15 22:58:37
I think scaling will eventually be reliably solved, but until that time I don't see a reason to worry about Bitcoin warehouses cheating their customers. There are several major differences between these kinds of businesses and regular fiat banks. While cheating is certainly possible, the incentive to do it is much smaller and the potential for discovery is much higher.

This is great to alleviate pressure from the blockchain. I wonder how frequent their audits will be, how the auditors will be incentivized to remain honest (free of bribes), etc.
There should be many competing Bitcoin warehouses like this, and they should have extremely reliable, redundant, and trustworthy systems in place that ensure cheating is borderline impossible.
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:16:30
Right, but that's a small-brained understanding of things. In order for money to be trusted, it must be inherently trustworthy. That's what he's missing.
First come the monetary properties, then comes the trust.

It has to do with IQ. People with low IQ create more work for themselves, so they're like hamsters running on a wheel. This is the case at the societal level, also. Living in an area with a low average IQ means they'll vote to grab whatever savings the higher IQ people manage to build up.

It's true it doesn't need to be fast and cheap to reach parity with gold. But it *would be better* if it were fast and cheap. Let's not delude ourselves.
Ideally the lightning network, or some future clever workaround, will help Bitcoin become the super fast and super cheap currency for day to day transactions. We have plenty of time to figure out how to make that happen. In the meantime, the exchange rate will continue to rise exponentially due to bitcoin's superior store of value properties.

4 and 5 are definitely NOT the case. Remember that in 2014 Microsoft, Overstock, and NewEgg all started accepting Bitcoin. The price still crashed harder and was in the tank for a full year and a half after.
The most bullish thing on your list is the Goldman Sachs custody thing. Normies won't buy and hold large amounts of Bitcoin. Millionaires, billionaires, and professionally managed funds will.
Long term I'm very bullish but just be sure you temper your expectations for the short and medium term.

I'm downvoting you because you're trying to turn this into a one-size-fits all moral issue. Some people will want to hold their Bitcoin.  Others will want to spend it as it rises.  Others will want to sell it as it falls.  Others will NEED to spend their Bitcoin due to medical emergencies or some other problems in their life.
The process will be natural.  There's no need to lecture people about the evils of hoarding or the stupidity of spending.  It will happen whether you do that or not.

@_date: 2018-05-25 20:33:35
You're halfway right, but you don't understand how markets are made. Bitcoin doesn't have value because people are "throwing money into the pile" (this metaphor assumes value comes from dollars or government currency). Bitcoin's value is independent of the value of other things. It's sort of like a Van Gogh painting that people initially thought was pretty bland but over time more and more people realized they like it and it becomes worth more money.

If nonwhites want to have their own schools, nations, neighborhoods, communities, etc then I have no problem with that. That's discriminating against me, but I don't care, because it's not imperative for me to participate in their societies.
Nonwhites don't afford whites this same basic respect. They attack us as evil Nazis if we want our own things.

Hate to break it to you, but it's very likely Bitcoin was invented by an evil White guy.

I actually offered you an example of genetics making Africans superior to Europeans in at least one regard. I also left the door open to you linking me to genetic diseases that are more common among Europeans than other races.

This is the kind of argument someone would make to attack homosexuality. Gay people feel attraction to their own sex, and it's natural and normal. You can't just force women on them and say it's for their own good.
Further, what do nonwhites offer whites to make this discomfort worthwhile? I don't see a fair tradeoff. I just see shrieks of racism, shaming, and genocide. There are lots of studies showing ethnic diversity harms health, increases stress, increases crime, reduces income, reduces social trust, reduces cohesion, reduces spending on public goods, and hurts the preservation of European culture. 
That's just not a trade I'm willing to make. Sorry.

This gets into price formation and how markets are made, it's complex.
Don't think of Bitcoin as a monolith. Think of it like this: 99% of Bitcoin are sitting still, in vaults. Only 1% are out moving around, being traded back and forth by people. That tiny 1% sets the price for the other 99% that's not moving. This is the case for all traded assets. The 1% are what's called "liquid", meaning they are available at any given moment.
So when you go to buy or sell BTC, you're adding your BTC you the liquid supply on the market, and someone else is waiting ready to buy them at a certain price. If you tell your broker "don't sell my BTC until you can find someone willing to pay $10,000 per Bitcoin", you're actively participating in price formation. But most people don't do this. Most people just buy and sell at whatever price happens to be clearing at that moment.
Also notice: this means "market cap" doesn't mean "the amount of dollars shoveled into Bitcoin". It doesn't take $150 billion of investment to make all bitcoins be worth $150 billion. It just takes a few million bucks and a lot of greedy holders who refuse to sell at very high prices.
@_date: 2018-05-15 04:18:53

Being surrounded by an ocean doesn't matter. The southern border is porous, and legal immigration is massive.

And of course, the antiwhite, anti male culture will reach a fever pitch.

It depends on your time horizon. If you need/want money right away, then you won't reap the same rewards long term investors will. But that's true for any investment, not just Bitcoin.
Also there's no need to create a closed loop Bitcoin economy. That's a myth. The price will stabilize around a reasonable market value irrespective of whether people cash out for purchases. Price is formed by hoarders, not by day-to-day users.

This kind of stability has happened in the past. I recall a period where it was very stable in the 700s for a long time. It's usually followed by a rapid rise in the price.
The stability could be due to any number of things, but it creates confidence in the market, which leads to more buying.

If the exchange makes its own trades using your deposit, it must obfuscate this by generating placeholder tokens so you aren't aware that your BTC/dollars have been moved. In a normal bank, these tokens are *actual money* that is available to withdraw and move to other banks. If a bank goes bust, depositors are made whole by the FDIC. This can't happen with Bitcoin.

Well with exchanges you don't actually own the Bitcoin, they keep them for you and give you tokens that represent Bitcoin. But every time an exchange inflates those tokens, they eventually go bust (and it happens rather quickly). With fiat, banks can do this with no fear of consequences.

I think it's safe to say paper is a superior money technology to silver, particularly before decent printing presses were easy to come by. That's the real reason metal money was abandoned. Digital money was such a huge advance that it put the final nail in the coffin of metal money, and is in the process of killing off paper.
Bitcoin is the first and best solution to the double spend problem. Software developers have had decades to solve it, and nearly a decade since to improve on what Satoshi gave us. They haven't. It appears to be a mouse trap - something that is so simple, yet so elegant that it is impossible to improve upon.

@_date: 2018-11-21 06:34:47
Setting aside bitcoins for investment removes them from the market. When you remove BTC from the market, they become unavailable for purchase, which has the effect of driving up the value of the other BTC. So you want lots of hoarders. They're the people who make a large Bitcoin economy possible. It doesn't mean you have to be a hoarder yourself. You can spend your BTC if you choose.
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:37:06

@_date: 2018-11-17 19:21:00
It has to do with electricity prices. The "easy mining" is already mostly filled out. So miners are having to set up shop in areas where electricity is slightly more expensive. Now that the price is falling, a greater percentage of hash power must be shut down in order to remain profitable. In the past miners didn't need to shut down as much of their hash power because their electricity was mostly bordering on free anyway.

I'm gonna blow your mind with something here:
The vast, vast majority of people in the world have almost no savings. Even most middle class people barely have two nickels to rub together. These people live paycheck to paycheck and they blow all of their excess cash on Amazon Prime and Netflix. They don't have the ability to drive Bitcoin to the moon. They don't matter, as far as that is concerned.
Millionaires, billionaires, institutions, and governments. Those are the people that matter. And they have the brainpower to buy and store Bitcoin for the long term. So ease of use is WAY down the list of important things. Jets are extremely difficult to fly. Gulfstreams are still worth $70 million apiece.

Nobody uses gold for transactions, and the global supply of gold bullion is around $7 trillion. Bitcoin has value because it is a good store of value. Its stock to flow ratio is insanely low, and it is far easier to store and transfer than any physical commodity with similar scarcity.

There's always going to be a desire to own real estate and other commodities. Think of it this way: prior to Bitcoin existing, gold was the "hardest money". Yet people still owned tons of government currencies and real estate. Even after the huge crash in 2008.

As someone who's a long-time investor in Bitcoin (2012), I do actually worry about this myself. Two reasons:
First: I am concerned China, India, and other countries that have lax pollution standards will end up burning oil to mine BTC. I worry about this despite being ambivalent about the prospect of "global warming" - CO2 isn't the only thing dirty energy puts in the atmosphere.
Second: I worry that first world governments will ban Bitcoin on the basis it's bad for the environment. That would cause the price to plummet, and the banks would happily push the ban. It doesn't matter what the facts are - emotion rules in democracy.

The number of skilled professions relative to the supply of skilled labor (and labor generally) is only going to shrink, particularly as AI and robotics take a bigger share of the pie.
Women have wombs. That means they can do something men can't do: have children. So it's generally not a good idea to steer young women of childbearing age into going to advanced classes and working at time-consuming jobs. The opportunity cost to society is too high.  Particularly when you take into account the fact IQ is heritable, and very intelligent women who choose to not have children will be a net drain on society over the long run.

Each halving causes the drum to get tighter. But that actually has much less to do with the price of Bitcoin than the spread of information - every day a dozen (or a few hundred?) more people learn about Bitcoin's unsurpassed monetary properties. Some of those people are very wealthy. And they are wealthy because they took risks, read obscure things, had patience, and recognized patterns/cycles.
So every day that Bitcoin exists, it adds people like this. Quality holders. People who stack. If you understand this dynamic, you don't worry about the crash so much. You know it'll recover and there will be another period of FOMO that takes us even higher than before. Each bubble is a kind of "proof of concept" where people are able to see that it's *possible* for Bitcoin to function just fine at these high levels. The market has tasted $20,000 Bitcoin and that's like sharks tasting blood. They're coming for more, soon.

Sustaining civilization requires borders and firm, but fair leadership. If there's a free for all situation, where everyone can move to majority-white countries and vote in our elections, that will spell the end of Western civilization and the extinction of the White, European race.
That's a far worse outcome than simple deportation and border enforcement. 
Further, even if we ignore IQ, it's not fair or ethical to force future generations of white children to give away their homelands and live as hated minorities in the nations their ancestors founded. Robert Putnam has done good studies on the negative consequences of diversity on communities, crime, etc. Definitely check him out. I also recommend this article:
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:36:37
I would recommend you look at data before you make assertions.
Only about 4% of whites marry outside their race, and even fewer have mixed children. This is \*even with\* all the powerful race-mixing propaganda occurring in the media. So whites will suffer for centuries under the rule of other races before they are finally wiped out.  This is unethical to the max.  All human races deserve to be allowed to exist and have their own homelands.
Food choices are not a valid reason to destroy a race and invade their territory.  I'm sorry.
You cite the Japanese as an example.  The Japanese have \*extremely\* strict immigration policy.  They have an ethnostate.  Nobody accuses them of being KKK/Hitler/DylanRoof/AltRight/etc because of this.  Only Whites are attacked for wanting their own nations.
Human biodiversity, cultural diversity, and \*political diversity\* is contingent on there being strict borders and ethnostates.  Without these things, there will be mass racial extinctions, a huge reduction in global IQ, massive increases in poverty, horrors visited upon young whites (after all, they "deserve it" because of "slavery" and "colonialism"), and ultimately interracial warfare.
The best way to avoid this disaster is deportation and peaceful segregation.  Until that happens, Europeans will continue to be hated, spat upon, heavily taxed, laughed at, and politically marginalized.

Why, exactly, is it "rich coming from a gay guy"? I don't advocate gay men sleep around, either. In fact I'm a supporter of gay marriage for many of the same reasons I'm an advocate of heterosexual marriage. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:22:41
Because women are biologically distinct from men. Men are expendable, from an evolutionary standpoint. You can't have civilization with female promiscuity - the whole point of marriage (and avoiding sex prior to marriage) is to facilitate pair bonding, and to give beta males (high IQ, but less sexually desirable) the ability to marry and have families. Without that incentive, you have a situation where women avoid marriage and children, and the ones who do decide to marry typically choose lower IQ alpha males to reproduce with.

I'd say it's worth at least as much as gold. So $7 trillion, which would mean each Bitcoin is worth something like $700,000.

Just say "Internet gold. It's impossible for governments to seize it or print more of it."

Jordan Peterson is a globalist-leftist. He doesn't actually rock the boat. If you want to donate to someone who's *actually* an intellectual renegade, I recommend either Vox Day or Greg Johnson.

Don't fool with alt coins. You want to own Bitcoin only, because that is the currency with the biggest network of acceptance.

Those are nice ideas, but they won't stand up against the option to hold a non-inflationary money. Given the choice, people will move into the stronger currency over time.

It's so we can see how it relates to the price. He overlayed the charts.

The Great Depression occurred after a central bank was introduced. Deflationary money causes people to consume less, and that's better for the economy and the environment. What's the difference between having a deflationary currency and a stock market that rises an average of 9% per year? Nothing. Millions of people save for retirement by putting their money into stocks rather than spending it. That's deflationary activity.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:59:27
Not as a percentage of the total population.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:53:19
The easiest way to explain why inflation is bad is to point out it doesn't differ from counterfeiting, morally speaking.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:58:45
Actually that view is not in line with evolutionary evidence. Mammals like humans are tribal by nature, and natural selection doesn't work at the individual level. It works at the group level (species and subspecies). Individuals are only one instance of a complete superorganism. I recommend Howard Bloom's book "The Lucifer Principle" to learn more about this. You might find it interesting.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:06:42
You couldn't ask for better news.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:24:33
Furthermore, what's wrong with identity politics? Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's not "real". Humans are animals. They are biological. So it stands to reason that different subspecies and sexes will have different preferences in how society is managed. You'll never convince black women to be majority libertarian. That political position doesn't benefit them.

Monero is the best privacy-focused alt coin.
But it's possible to make Bitcoin just as private by using the Lightning network. You can send BTC in one side of the network and there's no way for an observer to determine which other side it's coming out from. The ability to mix BTC over Lightning will get easier over time, and it'll be transformative for fungibility.

Women only sleep with the top 20% of men (by perceived sexual attractiveness). So most men aren't responsible, no.

Rome fell because of mass immigration and the spread of Christian ideas about morality. Today the exact same thing is happening in the West - if European-descended peoples complain about being replaced, the Left will cite Christian ethics to shut them up. "Jesus was a refugee!", etc.

I'm a gay guy. But look at the data: women in western nations have below-replacement fertility rates. They also sleep around before marriage, which is known to cause divorce rates to be much higher. And divorce &amp; single motherhood wreaks havoc on children and their life outcomes.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:58:51
LOL, well then.

Don't worry too much about rushing, we will probably re-test the lows at some point. In the meantime see if you can find an older friend or family member who's willing to set up an account and buy them for you. Say you want them to do it as a Christmas gift or something. Or use LocalBitcoins. But if you go that route, be careful. Meet the person in a public place with cameras.

The Alt Right brand is whatever people want it to be. I don't really consider myself alt right either. I'm an ethnonationalist with monarchist leanings.

Funny thing: I've been buying loads of Bitcoin since it was $13 based on these exact "random buzzwords". 
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:01:27
Deflation is only bad for debt-based currencies like fiat money, because it causes cascading defaults that reduce the money supply. Bitcoin is a commodity based money, so it's not susceptible to this problem.

I've actually got quite a bit more knowledge than you do, at least on these subjects. Jordan Peterson is a fraud. He's a joke. Vox Day explains why in great detail.

The Left are dysgenic and parasitic by nature, so they need to have an easy way to seize the assets (or commons) of the productive class. Bitcoin makes it harder to do that by inflation or the freezing of bank accounts.

Of course! Heck, the whole point of fixing society is to make it easier for more people to "have their shit together". The people who don't are the *most* qualified to criticize society.

I donate to sperm banks and plan on having my own children via a surrogate. But homosexuals generally aren't necessary for procreation, at least not to the same degree as heterosexual women are. Go figure!

Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro aren't particularly talented, they're just promoted by globalist organizations because they are useful as controlled opposition. Their messages are all very safe: fight for Israel, clean your room, stop complaining about big corporations having too much power, focus on improving yourself rather than demanding better behavior from women, etc.
