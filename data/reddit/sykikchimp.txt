Are there not diminishing returns on the value of expanding decentralization past a certain point?  And who would you suppose gets to choose the value of decentralization at various levels?

If you want an example of this kind of volatility in a currency, look at the US Real GDP percent change YoY prior to and post abolishment of the gold standard (1971).
Long story short, limited supply commodity based currencies appear to fuel speculation and drive more volatile boom/bust cycles.

Can you name any groups mining to consume excess Data center capacity as you imply?  Not doubting, I would like to do some more research on this.

The implication I hear is bch will continue expanding blocksizes forever, and that core will not increase blocksize.  Is that correct?

This is a slippery slope fallacy.

You only need enough nodes to be concurrently maintainable through any outage and provide minimum required  propagation performance.  It's like DNS servers on the internet.

Any specific reason you didn't use typical economic terms like "Supply Shock" rather than "Economic Change Event"?  There is well tested economic science behind supply shocks and their impact on a market that could and should be used to model the FFM and TFM outcomes.  By using non-standard language it seems an attempt to steer the conversation away from specific economic analysis.

Yea, I could do that.  Just message me a link.

"OB1 will aid decentralized commerce by offering services such as dispute resolution, store hosting, and more."  I'd guess this is how?

Could you elaborate on what you are using for back end?  I saw Magento and woocommerce, was there anything else?
Also, maybe your thoughts after using them on how you like them or if you think something else would have been better?

What do you think the banks did/are doing with it?  Primarily, I would guess they use it to loan to other people who then use it to fund all the various things people do with loans.  They can't do that without appropriate liquidity.
I'm not saying its right (I don't think it is), or that this is the best way to handle it, but it at least seems that is the idea.  
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:16:39
Well, they are at least able to cover variable costs.

It has.  It’s called Bitcoin.

There are still many valid scenarios where bitcoin goes to 0.

This would require regulation, which it seems a lot in this community don't want.

Weird how we have so much debt, but still maintain a AAA credit rating.. almost like this graph is incomplete and biased to tell the narrative you want to push.  Weird.

So, I am not a developer and I don't know the intricate details on Bitcoin smart contract technical ins/outs.  Whether or not coins written on the current core chain could be redeemable after a HF for the "winning" HF's coin, I do not know.  My thought was yes as the contract would still be part of the longest active chain..  again.  No real knowledge of the technical capability.  And on second thought, if that was possible, this would also create a pretty negative incentive to sabotage Core for the individuals named in such a contract which would clearly not be in cores or the greater Bitcoin userbase's interests.
What I was really getting at is that this "Deal" that came from this roundtable does not take appropriate consideration for risk that all stakeholders are facing (both financial and presumably legal).  Nevermind the fact that such financial risk should be appropriately time discounted.  Without a pricing mechanism that takes this risk into account it is much more likely that such an agreement will fall apart than execute as planned.
Unless these Chinese miners are just terrible businessmen, or terribly naive, my default assumption is they are using this public "deal" as a hedge and will break away from the deal the moment it becomes financially beneficial to do so.  The same sentiment goes for Blockstream.

For a tool intended to be "trustless", it sure does seem that a lot of trust is being required here.  Why not put out a smart contract and put their money where their mouth is.  Structure it such that if they don't deliver the code as promised then payment is made to the miners who suffer injury from not getting larger blocks.  Reputations should not matter in Bitcoin.  Code should.

Unless they invented bitcoin...

A lot of people might sell btc to buy bcc or other alts.  Demand may be higher for bitcoin now because of the "free coin" payout than it will be after.  Many people will take profit after the split.

B.S. in Economic here...  
What he appears to be referencing is "Quantity Theory of Money" 
I hear this route of reasoning referenced frequently for Bitcoin, and it is partially true.  However what I think this line of reasoning often misses is the other side of this equation with the "Volume of Transactions" variable.  
If you artificially limit velocity you also have a direct negative impact on Volume of Transactions  as people move to competing forms of money.  This ultimately serves to offset the deflationary effect of limiting velocity.  Overall what an artificial limit on velocity really does is create dead weight loss in the market similar to a tax.  
Since this "tax" is applied only to Bitcoin this puts it at a relative disadvantage in the marketplace of monetary alternatives from this perspective.  This is obviously not to say Bitcoin doesn't have a few other tricks up is sleeve that offset this penalty enough for it to still have a significant value proposition.
I think this issue seems to be at least intuitively understood by most devs as well.  Limiting on-chain velocity seems to be a safety mechanism imparted due to limitations of the technology/protocol.  Thus they are looking for other ways to increase velocity that don't risk that safety/security such as Segwit, lightning, etc.
