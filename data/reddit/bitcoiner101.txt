Speculation is that he or they profited from shorting on bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:33:57
Bitstamp is also using BitGo. Any publicly known flaws in this case?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:42:55
Electrum is also a real wallet. I suggest you also put it on the list :)
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:40:30
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:21:17
Yes, you're right. And it is ironic.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:44:00

On Bitfinex Status page we can see that webserver, trading engine and backend workers are still operational. Why? Shouldn't all be stopped?

This ain't over. Far from it. If the price goes below $850 we enter bear market with pretty good fundamentals and than all bets are off.

IMO price will go lower until this scaling debacle is solved but than again I could be wrong.

Price must fall so the miners are forcefully put back in line.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:57:35
That's why the price needs to fall. Price keeps miners in check. If segWit is adopted price will rise.

It's not a cool event but eventually the whole rigged financial system will fall apart. Euribor, libor, gold/silver paper market, central banks printing currency and buying stocks.

Or maybe you don't work and you live off welfare.

Rogy wants to coerce the free market. Anyone who wants to coerce the free market views free market as unfair and views his own solution as "more" fair. We all know Rogy's bullshit is just that, bullshit.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:23:06
No he doesn't. He looks cool.

Bravo! I'm running two nodes which are not yet BIP148 but will soon be.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:36:21
Big big drop.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:38:55
My 2 nodes are supporting BIP148. One node runs on RPi2.

The concept of "for the common good" is rooted in violence. Taxes are evil because you are forced to pay them. If you don't you go to jail.

I'm running AVG AntiVirus (free edition) and found no malware. I also checked with Windows Defender and it didn't find anything. Maybe you got this malware somewhere else?

@_date: 2017-06-13 13:19:30
I feel the same way. I've been in cryptos since 2013 and I concur, it is fucking stressful. I remember when I was having a dream/nightmare about bitcoin price falling to $10 from $1200 and I didn't have stop-sell set at the exchange. In the land of hodlor, you hodl!
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:24:27

According to Peter Schiff FED won't raise rates. FED has a perfect excuse - brexit. They might actually lower rates and restart the "printing press". QE to infinity, hyper inflation and finally moon.
