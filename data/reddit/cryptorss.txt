Trading coin for coin always was a taxable event (at least since 2014). People were just waving their hands and saying “like kind,” but that doesn’t make it so. 
Buying ETH with fiat and swapping it for altcoins is fine. You can FIFO, LIFO, or pick individual tax lots as you choose. In that case you aren’t really rotating your cryptos because you are putting new fiat into crypto.

Other than that nice write up.

Sure, you can file without paying. You'll just be charged penalties (potentially) and interest (definitely). If the number is big enough you'll start getting nasty letters, garnishments, tax liens on whatever property they can find, etc.

Banks created central banks for a reason: the double spend problem. 
Crypto is explicitly built to not double spend so banks would have to rethink their business model. 
What I imagine happening is the segregation of deposit banking and loans/underwriting.
