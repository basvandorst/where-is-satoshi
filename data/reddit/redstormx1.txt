Bitcoin mining from home computer or even rigs is dead . mine litecoins . good luck . I have a 7ghz butterfly box which is outdated now got it two days ago. It would take 2,000 worth of graphics cards to match .. These figures are just made up but you get the point .

A scam thats been around for 3 years. Hundreds of people use it around the world. 
Wait until it goes up to 1,500 and say see i would have made 500 bucks if you let me put 1000 on it .

If i make an awsome artwork out of mud and i sell it . i still have to pay taxes on it .  its what we have to do to live on there land . 
Bitcoins shouldnt be taxed unless you cash them out for dollars.

It will be 1000 again one day for sure. but it might be a few months down the track . If you dont need your money ride the downward wave it will go back up . 
Why is the china thing effecting it so much . The big Chinese banks are supporting it or something ?

A gimmick that will attract more customers . I traveled 2 hours to buy a beer with bitcoins . 
You could say
Its faster easier and cheaper but that would not all be true .
Is there other ferries people could catch instead of your company or do you have the monopoly on the ferrys there ?

Ha yeah i guess its not . Ok stolen meme copy and pasted in middle of a graph :P . 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:07:51
So i see you wont be investing then . Your saying in a year from now nothing will change ?  OR everyone will freak out everytime it gets near 900 and sell :O 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:41:30
Yes agree with you . Will be about the same 600 to 900 until new years . then once it passes 900 it will go up n up . not with out big drops :P

Buy more ... What will do you when its above $1000 and i keeps going . I heard about bitcoins when it was 60 each . i bought at 400 :|    .. price drops and rises fast . its normall . but in the long run goes up . 
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:05:31
I wouldnt the difficulty is going up to fast .
I bought a 600 dollar b labs 7ghz havent got it yet but any day . when the price of bitcoins was just under 100 each or even lower . 
I would have 6000 grand now . Its going to take me 50 weeks to even get close to breaking even . 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:06:41
