Some people need to hate anyone not part of their chosen tribe. It's a sign of insecurity.

You can't have an advantage without a corresponding disadvantage. There are advantages to centralized control, even for the lower classes. To disagree with such a simple axiom is being ignorant.
Decentralization has advantages, but if things aren't done right, the consequences can be catastrophic.

It has almost nothing to do with the amount of servers or strength of server. It's not as if they can't afford the number of servers necessary to support all 50 states.
It has more to do with gathering metrics and info on a small scale so they can better determine where problems may crop up as scale increases in the future.
It also has to do with inconveniencing the smallest number of users possible initially so that the entire market doesn't get a first impression of, "This product doesn't work."

It doesn't.
And if anyone believes for a second that individuals/corporations rich with Bitcoin will be any more ethical than the individuals/corporations presently in power, they're being naive.
An open currency changes very little. It may make corruption sightly more difficult, but it doesn't even come close to solving the hard problems.

You're absolutely right. It was Roger's prerogative to end the interview once he was tired of the abuse. But he didn't just end the interview. He resorted to extremely immature behavior. Which makes me think, at his core, he really is immature himself.
Someone truly secure with their accomplishments, net worth, etc, would have simply said, "This is not a productive use of my time. Good day."

If you resort to ad hominem attacks, in my eyes you've lost the argument. Ver seems like an immature tool at his core.

These are not fair comparisons at all.
Hashcash was not a cryptocurrency. Nor was it a blockchain. It was just a proof-of-work mechanism to reduce email spam. It did not compete with Bitcoin in any way.
Bitgold was a proposal. An idea. Never came to fruition. Never actually competed with Bitcoin.


No. You can't. You're comparing apples and oranges.

The only people who care, are people who don't understand the technology well enough to discuss it. Instead, they discuss what they do understand: drama.

And somehow *he's* the dumbass? Seems more like you couldn't come up with a response to his statement, so you decided to call him stupid instead.

To be fair, Charlie Lee created Litecoin. Even if he sold off his LTC holdings, Litecoin is still a very large part of Charlie's image and ongoing reputation. Thus, the idea that he's somehow now less biased toward Litecoin is a bit absurd.

He isn't intelligent. When people like Vitalik Buterin were warning others that BitConnect was a scam, Trevon responded by simply stating, "They're just mad/jealous."
Yeah, no. Trevon is an idiot in every way possible.

Saying Bitcoin isn't scarce because you can have as many forks/alts as you want, is like saying anyone with a crayon and a piece of paper can create their own USD.
More realistically, if I have a PC and printer, can I create something that resembles USD? Sure. Is anyone going to accept it as genuine? No. Then, my creation has no effect on the total supply (and thus, the scarcity) of USD.
As for Peter Schiff's debate with Ivan on Tech, he didn't state his argument very well. The essence of his point was essentially that 100 years from now, Bitcoin may not exist. But gold will. So, if you're looking for an asset in which you can invest and not think about for decades, then gold is your best bet. He's not wrong in saying that. However, if you're looking for an asset which can bring you far superior short-term returns than gold, so long as you're willing to stay diligent and do your research, then Bitcoin is the way to go.

Most crypto articles are written by noobs or bots. They're nonsense.

Block rewards and transaction fees are separate, and both are paid to the pool which creates the block. When all coins have been mined, only transaction fees will remain.

Just gonna leave this here for anyone who hasn't read it already. No one should be listening to anything McAfee says.

Probably can't withdraw until you have a sufficient number of confirmations. Basically, you gotta wait until more BTC blocks get mined.

Giving a platform to him is a form of glorification.
Posting his rantings to reddit is part of the problem.
Upvoting such posts is part of the problem.


Most people are able to recognize Trump is incompetent. But you give him a nice platform, and he'll still be able to reach a significant number of people who *can't* tell that he is.
Why else do you think McAfee was able to charge 6-figure sums to pump coins? Because there's a significant number of people who don't know he's an idiot. Or, they know he's an idiot, but they buy his coin (thereby promoting his ability) simply because they know other people will.
Societies need to stop giving air time to idiots who have no ethical barometer.
