Fear Factory made a great song about this. "Fear Campaign". 
The start of the official video explains it well:
"It was not necessary to camouflage the insanity of the world of today within a science fiction setting.
The world today has become the world that writers predicted long ago.
The controlling authorities are constantly, and successfully, utilizing the fear tactic to control the masses, through misinformation and distraction.
Fear is bondage. Fear is slavery. Fear is Hell. Fear is control."
Hate, war and terror, murder, disaster
Rape, drugs and violence, lost in our failure
Fear is suffering, intimidate to obey
Fear is control, suffering is hell
Police enforce obedient behavior
Manufactured weapon of conformity
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
It is the most strategic tool used to manipulate
Intimidation to make me weak in order to obey
Strategy to manipulate, paralyze, intimidate
Righteous greed suffocates, a powerful fear campaign
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path
Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Savior, failure
What do you fear?
Fear is your god

Bitcoin Wednesday held in Amsterdam on 1 April 2015 was a historic moment. At the specific request of the Dutch government we had a public conversation with the Bitcoin guru Andreas M. Antonopoulos in which Mr. Antonopoulos was asked a series of questions about the digital currency revolution in The Netherlands. The questions were prepared by the government and were intended to increase their awareness and understanding of this important technology.
For the first 30 minutes Mr. Antonopoulos delivers a keynote, followed by 90 minutes of questions. After the official questions, the audience also asks some of its own, including several related to the Bitcoin technology, to Mr. Antonopoulos’ startup Third Key Solutions, and more specifically to the regulatory climate in The Netherlands

What phrases or sentences would you think would be good triggers to take a shot?
Unregulated. Magic Internet Money. To the moon! Mt Gox.

Like an immune system reacts to a virus. It forms antibodies and raises the body temperature to fight off the intruder. Bitcoin protocol and network can be adapted to this.

That would mean drinking 24/7. every 10 minutes a shot!

He gets a bit emotional because he believes in the possibilities and promises of bitcoin to ultimately do good for mankind
