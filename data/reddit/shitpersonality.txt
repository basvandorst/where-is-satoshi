Segwit and lightning networks arent solving the underlying issue, either. Other couns are scaling better than bitcoin and people are beginning to notice how much faster and cheaper they are because bitcoin fees and transaction times are disgusting.

Not really a woosh. If you need the coin transferred fast, pay the fee. If you dont need a fast transfer, lower the fee.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:49:33
Segwit isnt a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:52:14
Fees will go up because there is no reason for them to go down. Segwit isnt a long term on chain scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:16:24
Most likely, when bitcoin is no longer the largest market cap crypto. It seems the devs are not trying to create any type of on chain scaling solution, currently.

Segwit is a malleability fix that enables the off chain lightning network. The light increase in available space on the block is nothing more than a temporary bandage.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:20:38
With the added bonus of payment channels providing near instant payments. But yeah, it doesn't directly address on chain scaling.

There was enormous contention in the community over which method to kick the can down the road a few feet more. Now we have both solutions in place, a split chain, and it's time to prepare for disappointment in both of the development teams.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:41:16
Bitcoin development is rather stagnant, relative to other blockchains.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:55:38
Your entire premise of instant confirmations on the bitcoin blockchain is factually wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:55:54

With just 51% hash rate, they could prevent transactions of their choosing from gaining any confirmations, thus making them invalid, potentially preventing people from sending Bitcoins between addresses. They could also reverse transactions they send during the time they are in control (allowing double spend transactions), and they could potentially prevent other miners from finding any blocks for a short period of time.

Market capitalization refers the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares. Commonly referred to as "market cap," it is calculated by multiplying a company's shares outstanding by the current market price of one share. The investment community uses this figure to determine a company's size, as opposed to using sales or total asset figures.
How about you show me the correct math, then?
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:33:29
There is a large insecurity about other implementations of blockchain tech in this community. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:06:45
The price isnt always going to go up and it is possible to anonymously obtain the bitcoin. If you control enough bitcoin, you can manipulate the market to get the rest for cheaper.

It is possible to block one without the other.
== Overt attack ==
The non-covert form can be trivially blocked by requiring that
the header version match the coinbase transaction version.
This proposal does not include this block because this method
may become generally available without restriction in the future,
does not generally interfere with improvements in the protocol,
and because it is so easily detected that it could be blocked if
it becomes an issue in the future.

Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.
Groupthink requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking. The dysfunctional group dynamics of the "ingroup" produces an "illusion of invulnerability" (an inflated certainty that the right decision has been made). Thus the "ingroup" significantly overrates its own abilities in decision-making and significantly underrates the abilities of its opponents (the "outgroup"). Furthermore, groupthink can produce dehumanizing actions against the "outgroup".
Antecedent factors such as group cohesiveness, faulty group structure, and situational context (e.g., community panic) play into the likelihood of whether or not groupthink will impact the decision-making process.
