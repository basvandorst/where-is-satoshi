Close enough to confuse them all.

It works somewhat if you're logic is in check.

It's cool to know that both genders get involved in tech companies.

Who issues the paper money and who issues bitcoins? Think about that first. The government can't control a p2p service. Look at how hard they try with torrents. Hail hydra!

Oh, lol. Valuta sounds so much like an English word, thanks for notifying me!
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:10:31


That's the sad reality. I still have it better than half the population I guess. We just get by.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:08:20
Exactly, education is the only thing I don't mind paying for. Stuff I don't use like public transport is questionable.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:49:54
I don't think that Satoshi made Bitcoin so he just could solve the double-spending problem and be done with it. The double-spending problem was a problem that made decentralized p2p coins impossible. The purpose has always been to provide a decentralized coin.

Bigger blocks isn’t new tech. Lightning network, segwit and atomic swap are.

How can you take someone seriously who calls himself an entrepreneur. That word is so pretentious.

Self made scammer.

Bitcoin can’t be regulated. Exchanges and other companies providing service with Bitcoin can and should be regulated. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:57:28
Localbitcoins or decentralized exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:53:58
Journalism is extinct in the Benelux. They just ask for the opinions of bankers about Bitcoin. What are they going to say about a coin that defies their values and they don't understand the tech? Exactly!
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:57:00
Fair enough, but it's like you said enforcement makes the regulation existant, but it won't work.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:03:16
While I agree taxation is too heavy, how are you going to keep education equal and accessible to every child?
Maybe a tax system like this could work. You have a car? Pay tax for the roads. Your kid goes to school? Pay tax for education. That would be fair, but I don't know how that would be sustainable.
Edit: However, we have technology for education now. It could be offered through internet and/or volunteers at schools. Or maybe have a system where the poor kids can go free to any school.

I was about to buy BTC with 50 euro's somewhere between 2009-2011. But localbitcoins was the only option in my country and it seemed very fishy to me at that time that I could only buy through bank transfers. Jesus Christ. I'm not too sad about it, I have other shots in my life. I know I have the potential in me. But damn, my father went bankrupt in 2013 and my parents divorced(for other reasons). But we have no own home now, we(my mother) rent a social home, and we can barely pay for our car and my education.
But whatever, everything will be ok. My studies are going ham. I will end up with a nice job and a nice salary and the skills to be potentially rich. It's not the lambo's I care about, but about having a nice house for my mother and a nice car and life for myself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:08:45


That's why I think too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:57
Wait, why don't we fork Bitcoin Cash and call it Bitcoin Cash Cash. Bitcoin Cash Cash will be the real Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:34:10
More money doesn't solve efficiency though. The most things kids learn at schools are useless. Education should refocus on basic knowledge, critical thinking, scientific methods, creativity etc.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:27:32
Show of authority.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:08
No sauce?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:47:19
Lol the double-spend problem was a problem that existed in digital coins before Bitcoin. Bitcoin is made to decentralize the currency, to keep it out of the bank and governments’ hands. Also to stop problems like inflation, making it a currency like gold. 
Edit; See below, mixed up Dutch with English.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:57
I only saw reports of BCH withdrawals...
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:28:54


Only in the US. Western Europe enjoys high quality education, thanks to heavy taxation.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:03:12
Indeed, BCH is a good chain on itself, but it are people like Roger Ver who started the shady "real bitcoin" marketing.

Nanobots could be used to repair broken cells while being unfrozen.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:36:42
How are they going to win BTC users over when they are making BTC users lose money? I had respect for BCH to fork what they stand for, but this is just nuts. Makes me hate BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:47:51
Because it’s an exchange and you don’t own the private keys of your money their. Look at what happened with Mt. Gox. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:04:42
A node in the blockchain passes information to other nodes to confirm the authenticity of transactions. When you install the Bitcoin Core Node app on your computer you become a node too.

What are paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:20:02
Coinbase is good to purchase Bitcoins. Ideally you would transfer your coins to Jaxx or Coinomi for mobile or Electrum for desktop. But beware of high transaction costs. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:04:21
As a student I bought BTC for 10 euro when it was 800$ worth. I diversified it with other altcoins, but converted it all back to BTC after Ether stabilised, and suddenly now I have 35 euro. That’s free money, totally worth it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:06:46
Lol how the fuck can they see the transfer without the IBAN number. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:38:31
In euros BCH is already below 1000€. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:41:28
I also recommend this. With a credit card you can but as low as 2$. But don’t keep your coins there. Transfer it to a secure wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:35:09
The network was spammed with mini transactions by bots. There is a waiting line of unconfirmed transactions. You’ll have to wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:10:15
If we get to the point where it is funny to use fiat, I'd imagine that fiat has no value anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:08:52
Spamming the BTC network with mini transactions is market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:09:24
Is the network still congested, I was looking to buying now?
Edit: Nevermind, transaction fees are way too high right now for me.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:25:34
Depends on the miner fee you or the exchange decided to pay.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:36:16
Great, soon we’ll have 3 bitcoin communities. But I feel the same way, so sick and tired of the split community. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:43:27
“I just bought pizza with bitcoins”
*laugh track plays*
Yup, that’s the kind of “jokes” this show makes. Just throw random IT words and the audience which doesn’t know what it means laughs at this word because they don’t want to feel dumb.

I hid a paper in my home, told my mother and sister about it. It's a small puzzle to figure it out, I'm sure they'll find someone capable to help them.

In Europe we call free healthcare, unemployment salary, free education etc social facilities. Those are socialist elements in a capitalist free market. A mixed economy maybe. Social-Capitalism.

I made a random choice yesterday by selling my ETH and DOGE to BTC. Best choice ever.
I'm going to move it all back to ETH, since I don't understand shit about the coming hard fork.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:46:04
I tweeted "Bitcoin will boom soon" just before this happened. Don't thank me.
Personally, the signs were good lately with Coinbase entering new markets and Litecoin Foundation buying a portion of a bank.

It doesn't! WomWom Core is WomStreams puppet!
I introduce to you WomWom Cash, which I most definitely did not premine, it's the real WomWom Coin.

It's not about the atm's. It's about the exchange s that are available in the Netherlands and Belgium. Lower competition = higher prices. Check Bitonic and Litebit and see it for yourself.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:44:10
Lack of competition.
