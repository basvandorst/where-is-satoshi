If you have a mortgage with the bank, chances are you'll get a letter, possibility a call from someone asking questions, after a short conversation you'll put down the phone, log back into your exchange and buy more BTC.
What's the bank going to do? Ask you to take your mortgage elsewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:06
Well said, so let's just ignore you then

Don't get your news from Twitter, just setup a Google search alert for the term "cryptocurrency" and read everything.

Not having access to your account kind of makes it difficult to move money into the mortgage, wouldn't you say?

You're missing the point, in this market there are PLENTY of interested buyers. If said buyers are fighting over a scarce commodity said commodity will rise in value

A suburban New York hospital technician accused of using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to launder money meant for the militant group Islamic State was arrested on charges of money laundering in support of a foreign terrorist organisation and bank fraud, prosecutors said Thursday.
Federal prosecutors in New York's Suffolk County claimed in court papers that Zoobia Shahnaz, 27, used fraudulent credit cards and loans to accumulate $US85,000, which she attempted to transfer to the radical group Islamic State before attempting to go to Syria to join it.
Reserve Bank of Australia governor Phil Lowe this week warned that Bitcoin was a case of "speculative mania" which was "more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions."
Prosecutors said that after travelling to Jordan to work with the Syrian American Medical Society, Shahnaz returned to the United States and applied for six credit cards, which she used to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

I beg to differ
If there is nothing to buy the price will rise due to scarcity

Crypto is the protocol of value transfer for the internet, as all commerce is conducted over the internet it stands to reason that the value asset (Bitcoin) will need to be used in the process. 
How do you get Bitcoin ? you buy Bitcoin.
What are people doing ? buying Bitcoin.

The fight hasn't even started, just wait and see what happens when the US finally wakes up to the realisation that Bitcoin will dethrone it as the global currency
The US isn't going to sit by and watch it privileged position in the global financial market be taken away.

@_date: 2017-11-21 11:38:18
I though the point of this wallet was that it didn't do private keys at all?
My understanding was that you gave it your public key and it tracked transactions and available funds?
Am I wrong?
