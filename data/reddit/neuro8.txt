Dragon? Or Cthulu?

Small link of relevance is a message in the blockchain as my wife's holiday present:

Was in the subway. Just saw the post on front page after I posted!

Should I delete this thread?

I like the idea! If you can wrap it into a client-side application, it would be similar to Spotify with a Bitcoin-wallet attached. ISOHunt founder also seems excited about the concept:

The distinction between "commodity" and "currency" for bitcoins has gone back and forth, as it shares properties of both. Normally, it's a de-centralized cryptographically secure "currency" which is an accepted medium of exchange.
The commodity aspect comes from it's finite-ness (unlike fiat currency which can be mass-produced / reduced to affect money supply), and difficulty to acquire, as well as some other aspects. It's not thought of as a true commodity because it's not useful except as a value-of something (unlike cigarettes, pork, grain, etc. which are consumable or have some value based on their use).
It's a hybrid of something new and exciting, which is the best part of living in the 21st century.

Similar offer: I'm a developer on mobile and web applications. Would be interested in hearing a sweat equity for development sprints. Pm if interested.

Awesome. This looks really fantastic, especially if we can begin testing with a secure GUI on color coins and color definitions.
@_date: 2012-12-22 02:08:42
That's great!

This might have been brought up before, but what about the innovation in Point of Sale (POS) systems? Basically, since tablets came on the market and integration with web services have become more available to non-business enterprise solutions, it's within a food truck, a restaurant, a clothing store to have a smart-mobile device (tablet, phone, etc) to accept BTC transactions (via mobile to mobile or typing in an address or QR code) to transfer funds.
I semi imagine having an account at stores, bars, restaurants would help. And the time to validate a transaction would be a barrier but maybe there's a crowd-source solution (proximity to a node or some such?)
Electronic commerce requires a way to gather and validate currency, right?

Well deduced!! So long as it's not mistranslated as "Merry Christmas honey for my down voted I love you gesture"
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:50:29
Would make sense to define goals, or a development roadmap and "make this a successful project"...
@_date: 2013-06-17 19:36:58
Going to match it. :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:23:54
Gotcha. Well if you have specific ideas on what you'd want to improve feel free to PM me. I'm a developer by trade.

Frankly, they offer a directory listing service. And SOME time and effort is spent in both the development / design / hosting. If you're saying they automated it, then kudos to them for working smarter than harder. But they provide a valuable service (from what I've seen) and are pushing Bitcoin as a viable means to support such service (even if it's to continue hosting). 
So listing good quality torrents + promoting bitcoin = value (in my personal blockchain)
@_date: 2013-06-17 19:36:38
They have &lt; 1.0 BTC. I think it's fair to say they have less than a single coin. They have 4 deciBitcoins (

Not a problem! We also make cards (nice stocking stuffers). We're just glad to give the community one more type of good, and increase their purchasing options!

When you put it like that, it sounds cheap...
There's a message in the hash
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:21:48
Through blockchain? Or converting the hash's of addresses? For the former, you should just see them in blockchain.info. There's a pull request incorporated in the next version that will display messages using OP_RETURN in the scriptPubKey area.

Ah, someone else beat me already. With visualizations no less. Great work though!
