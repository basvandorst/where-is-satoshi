So anyone who gets paid via paypal or moneybookers doesn't have so much hassle with moving money. And people with foreign bank accounts are also ok. But the latter will be only relevant for someone with international company as these can "on the paper" employ people in another EU member state if they have office there (and some banks will open bank account without physical presence). Well, that's still pretty bad for the average Joe.

K, that's too bad. Well since they are probably not interested in BTC  in technical way maybe it's not a good idea to start with "what it is". It's marketing, you could start by what it does for them or by an example of use that could be interested for them (IDK like some large company that they know implemented...something).  
I just had this situation earlier today, I mentioned BTC by coincidence with no plan. The other person asked "What is it?" so I made up an answer based on the background of the person: "It's kind of a virtual currency, but there's a technology behind it that got picked up by pretty much every big financial institution. It looks like it's going to be quite a big deal." Part of me feels I'll go to hell for this but I know that whenever I start explaining that something is cool and why it is cool everyone is like "yeah yeah (we all know you're weird, whatever)" and then they'll start to use it couple months later once some "influencer" starts to do so.

Alright that's fair enough. Still a minus point for not being a linux high-school kid /joke

I sold btc yesterday on localbitcoins for the first time. with ewallet. now I am sweating if guy will do reverse payment.

Can you wear a Bitcoin T-shirt maybe? Pamphlets remind me of religious organization I wouldn't do that 
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:42:24


I noticed that on Dutch-owned exchange. You cannot withdraw coins unless you get verified. Surprised it's against the decision of ECJ.  
  
I also have a logical problem with a creator of cryptocurrency paying tax on what was "nothing" for a long time, the government then taxes it as it starts gaining perceived value. I would kind of understand attempts to avoid taxing it because if a creator of cryptocurrency taxes what he created then there is no "change" at all and cryptocurrency turns into just another regular product to buy online. (I am talking about the creator whoever that is)

I am a girl but only thing I can do also is generalization. Maybe there is a thinking pattern, maybe not.  
I first heard about BTC I think in 2011, a colleague in the lab told me about it. But he was saying things like "it is interesting political concept" etc and he was this kind of 'saloon revolutionarist'. He was talking about concepts a lot but his real life never reflected any of that. So I didn't even google it back then because I thought, okay, this is some invention for these golden kids, not for us who need to take care of ourselves.  
I could definitely see similar pattern in other girls around me: "no matter how hard you try nobody cares so keep a low profile, grab a middle class spot while you can and don't think too much about your life"  
Well, I did question my life and I didn't grab a middle class spot but my life really is something between a series of fuck-ups and series of fuck-offs, depends on who's judging, but where I come from this is a very bad thing for a girl as girls should be submissive and simply accept the main stream. (I moved to another continent)  
So like said if what I described is common for most women (which I don't know if is) it really can only be the case that women will start using BTC massively first when it gets adopted by most men.

Most companies generally have some kind of offshore scheme nowadays, or if they are localized they'll have an offshore company or two for tax optimization. That's not dubious at all.  
This is the important bit:

Ok. Yeah I read about that.

Alright that's cool. I've got one 5 years old (2.10 GHz, 8GB RAM, disk I think 500 GB I replaced the original one)

That's interesting.   
  
It's actually cortisol and testosteron which both make men more prone to riskier choices. Women were dropped from the study since the correlation between hormonal levels and decisions was poor. Female hormonal system is a bit more complicated.  
  
But it was just a test if hormones and trade decisions could be linked at all. (Someone had the idea so they tested a bunch of people to see the numbers but there's no more reason for it) I think someone saw the hormonal levels as a way to measure "emotions" as emotions change trade decisions.

How is it with eWallets on Greek addresses?
@_date: 2015-12-27 04:18:36
I hodl all my coins but I still make notes when I buy coins -- how do you know how much to sell for which price when you don't know how dear you bought them? Why don't you get a paper notebook or whatever and make notes like  
  
date, exchange, b -&gt; name_of_wallet  
date, exchange, name_of_wallet -&gt; s   
  
or at least set up few different wallets for different buying price levels  
you are the bank now, keep it organized

This is something people on one German forum mentioned a lot (related to buying prescription meds online). We all have stealth security but we always write down something somewhere to have access. Memorizing something is far safer even than paper.

I read about Trezor and Satoshilabs here on Reddit a lot. I also spotted Ledger wallet but it doesn't seem to be so popular. What is the reason to prefer Trezor?
@_date: 2015-12-04 13:08:40


Apparently people cannot google as someone's post explaining this was ranking when you searched for "most reliable bitcoin mixing" or something like that (quite sensible). Though it would probably be easier for newcomers if it were a sticky post.  
And...You never know. OP claims to have a CS degree and at the same time says he "had to install IRC client" only because of BTC. To me that's hardly believable when it comes to someone with tech focus.

I like it. Content aside, some points to the design: I am having some issues with CSS in Firefox so you might want to cross browser test it later on... [browserstack.com](  
Another thing is that for sakes of readability it's better to have paragraphs of 2-4 short sentences each.

I saw that bitcoin exchange, it's on the way to jl. legian not far from the big crossing (nakula?) I think? I didn't know about any bitcoin enthusiasts there though, quite curious about your next post.  
One thing I can confirm is that selling btc for cash is much more convenient anywhere in asia than withdrawing from atms...either you get withdrawal fee or 0 fee plus bad forex. with btc even if you have 0 reputation on lbc you can sell for whatever price you get and buy at that price on another exchange.
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:58:30
Thankfully. I had the suspicion that someone was trying to "sell us dreams for cash" with cryptocurrencies (that's a quote from Scorsese's Casino) but then...who can say they control the (market) psychology completely?
@_date: 2015-11-22 04:06:00
That is a good strategy - making it the cool thing.  
(Although it is not focused on Bitcoin enthusiasts, which was OP's question.)

hah literally, it's got so far.

Parabéns ;) Brazil in 2014 was when I learned about BTC.

another thing is where will dollar be by the time bitcoin gets so far (if). it's like trying to make it real compared to what.

similar here. to go around the nationalistic aspects that work against me.

That's what some economist forecasted, isn't it? I cannot recall the name. He said USD would get stronger but that would be only in comparison to EUR. Later USD should fall too.
