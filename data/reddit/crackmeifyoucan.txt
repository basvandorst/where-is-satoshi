You can still write your pass phrase down somewhere. No one would likely even know it needs to be hashed to produce a private key.

Valid points. I'll help out:
1. The phrase is composed of words, not meaningless characters.
2. It's indexed by Google and shows up in search results.
Like I said, this is to see if search engine indexed terms can be crawled and used to crack passphrases, not to see if you can sha256 random phrases and find something.

I posted a brain wallet cracking challenge yesterday. It's protected by 5-6 words that appear together on Google, so it should be fairly easy to crack. All I got was people calling me stupid and bitching and moaning about how it's difficult to crack and how the challenge is unfair (presumably because I'm just not just giving the coins away).
Put your time/resources where your mouth is and crack it, or shut the fuck up once and for all.

Every word totally makes sense and individually returns millions of hits, so no gibberish in the phrase. I won't give away the details though. All I'll say is that if you copy &amp; paste it from Google, it produces a valid key.

Well this is great then, it validates that the brain wallet concept is secure. I am sick and tired of people beating their chest and calling others stupid and talking about entropy, thermodynamics, the nature of randomness in the universe and how humans are bad at randomness whenever someone mentions brain wallets.
If this can't be cracked, then it's completely infeasible to crack custom-made passphrases with personal information added or whatever.
Again, I am not trying to give these coins away; I merely want to see how secure the concept is against dictionary attacks. Think of it as a security audit.

This actually sounds like a great idea. Might implement this sometime soon.

Again, I am not trying to help someone swipe these funds. If you were cracking a real brainwallet, you wouldn't get any help from its owner. I want to see how secure a phrase that exists in the public domain really is.
