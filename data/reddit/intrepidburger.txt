Debt doesn't form "bubbles".  A bubble is when an asset's price is driven far past its true value due to speculation.  Debt is not an asset class.  Bitcoin is, however.  
Bitcoin can and has formed bubbles.  It hit $20k last year and is struggling to hold 60% of that now.  All of crypto is down ~90%.  That's a bubble.
I love crypto and blockchain, but don't turn it into something it isn't.  It's not a hedge against speculation, it's one of the most speculative assets in existence.

The last few times what's happened?  Corporate debt expansion?  That's simply not true.  The corporate debt increased only 10% over 20 years.  There are years before that where it expanded by that much and there was zero recession.
He is seeing something that's not there.  


That's not how it works though.  Debt ratios are the same anywhere because they are an indicator of expansion without growth.  A higher number is a higher indicator in every country.
But even the claim that it's unhealthy within itself is not true, because America had the smallest increase as well.  73% corporate-debt-to-GDP is low.  I don't see how you can make the argument that it's bad.  What indicator is causing you to make that conclusion?

It's not that they're hitting certain highs.  What absolute quantity is an objective measure for the downturn?  There isn't any.  What you're seeing is the flip from increase to decrease, which as I said, is the *effect*, not the cause.


I don't know how many times I have to repeat this, because both of you seem not to be reading it.  It's not "historically high".  It's only trended upwards slightly, and is at a level that is both lower and growing slower than almost every other developed country.  Countries who have not seen a recession.  The evidence points strongly to there being no recession, not the opposite.


The Fed has direct control over the flow of "cheap money", since they set the interest rate.  They cranked up interest rates to 2.75 from 0.25 in just two years, the fastest rise in history.  If the Fed was still worried about "cheap money" they could simply crank up rates further and you'd see less borrowing (and thus Central Bank printing).  


The subprime scenario was a combination of many factors, but the chief one was that far too many people were given loans they had zero chance to repay.  This was because of mandates in the 70's and 90's that forced banks to make these offerings to poor people.  Rising interest rates along with the masking of those toxic debts led to the crisis.  The current level of debt held by corporations is quite healthy.  They are producing more output than debt (less than 100% debt-to-gdp, unlike 20+ developed countries in the other guys' original link).  If a sudden economic downturn hits, corporations aren't on the hook for all that much and can weather it out, unlike people who suddenly couldn't pay their mortgages anymore.
I'm glad we can have this discussion.  I'm always open to having my mind changed with good information and exchanging ideas.

The cuts were a symptom of a larger cause.  In this case there is no larger cause.  The cuts were a retraction of the overly hasting increases.  They jack it up to 2.75 from 0.25 in just two years.  They're just releasing the choke.
There is no collapse pending.

Right, but it's lower than every country, including the quantity those countries were at 25 years ago.  Sweden's ratio was 100 in 1990.  Canada's was 84.  South Korea 76, Australia 75.  That's all from 1990.  America is lower than all of them *today*.
Those countries did not see collapses in the intervening 30 years. Why would the US, who has a far, far healthier quantity, see one any time soon?

His second paragraph showed that corporate debt balloons *after* a recession.  Which it does -- when there's a recession, the ratio between debt and corporate growth goes up, for obvious reasons.  The corporate debt ratio does not *imply* the recession, you have cause and effect backwards.  There is zero indicator that a recession is happening or going to happen (a recession is defined as two negative growth quarters).  
If you get stabbed you bleed, but if you start bleeding from your nose it does not mean you are going to get stabbed.  X causing Y does not mean Y causes X.  The thing is, even in this scenario X is not even causing Y; he is using the *absolute* value of the ratio to indicate the recession.  Which is dumb, because it climbs over time which you can see in the chart.  From '83 to '91 it climbed by a staggering amount to a record high.  No recession during that time.  The current absolute value is the same as 2008's.  By extrapolating the chart the ratio could climb two times higher and there would be zero recession.

I've spent a whole decade studying it, so I'm not sure I need to "look into it".  For starters there were many economists who called out the bubble in the early 2000's, notably famed Paul Krugman.
The mortgage crisis was a problem compounded from multiple layers.  It started with the Carter-era mandate to provide loans to low-income households, and then repealing Glass-Steagal under Bill Clinton which removed banks being required to limit how much speculation they could take on with the investments. Added together you had toxic loans that could not be repaid and were shuffled into other high risk investments to hide how terrible they were.  Eventually the bubble popped and banks were left holding this unpayable debt.
It had everything to do with government meddling in the free market, and nothing to do with "economists".

Irrelevant to a discussion about US Federal Interest Rates


The market is up 26% since Jan 2017.  It's not a huge bubble.  Certainly not one that would a recession upon contracting (like it did in Dec 2018).  


I think your information is a little bit dated (and you perhaps didn't click OP's post).  Interest rates were 0.25 under Obama, but they were cranked up to 2.75 recently.  You can see there was a period in the early 2000's that was lower than the current amount.
You're worried about nothing.

Glass-Steagal made the problem worse.  It's analogous to blowing pure oxygen on a fire.  By itself it's not a bad thing, combined with the fire it's absolutely terrible.
The CRA was a terrible policy, but another terrible policy (the GLB act which repealed Glass-Steagal) would have at least had the silver lining of limiting its damage.  Combined it created the atmosphere for the giant bubble.

That. Is. Not. How. It. Works.  
Just stop making these claims, alright?  You're making people in the crypto space look incredibly stupid.  You are really hoping that by stating an incorrect view *really* forcefully it'll magically become true.  
The Fed doesn't *cause* cheaper fiat money.  That's not a thing.  They simply adjust the rate of borrowing by controlling the *cost* of borrowing (interest on the principle, i.e. interest rates).  The idea is to keep the rate of inflation *steady*.  Roughly 2% per year.  This creates an environment that is conducive to long-term growth (as businesses can calculate their long term costs) and it avoids cycles of deflation and hyper-inflation.   This is a *good* thing.
The interest rate was a monumentally low 0.25 throughout Obama's entire term.  It was raised up to 2.75 in just two years under Trump as his economy took off in order to avoid hyper-inflation, the fastest choke in history.  They released their choke a bit as it was deemed too much, so they scaled back to 2.25.  
They *raised* the rates to avoid hyper-inflation.  This is a scaleback from that attempt.  It's not an attempt to *create* hyperinflation, it's literally the opposite.
Please stop talking now.

It feels intuitive which is why many people believe it, but it's wrong.  The main indicators to look at are debt-to-GDP, which is a marker between spending and earning, and total assets held.  In the event that the US was suddenly called on to repay all of its debts it could do it, the US holds trillions in assets.  
The absolute size of the debt is not important.

Oh jeez, I see where your mistake is now.  I honestly forgot some people only know how to think like poor people.
Of course you're not investing your money if you have little of it.  That's not what I was suggesting anyone do.  You came up with that yourself and thought it was stupid (it is, but the idea came from a stupid person so it's a given) .  I was stating that from the bank's perspective their costs are not recouped from smaller bank accounts.  Even though you can't afford to invest it...the bank can!  Your measly $100 is still money added to the pile.  It's still worth something when invested.  But not enough to pay for their services which cost money, so they charge you.  But you are still giving them $x in interest regardless.
Just because you won't risk taking the opportunity doesn't mean the opportunity cost doesn't exist!

Right, but those people usually have very little in their accounts meaning their opportunity cost is low. Worded another way, they are getting more in services than they are paying via their invested dollars.
If your bank requires a min balance to get services "free", it's because the interest on that min balance is enough to pay for the services.

You either have some money in your account or no money in your account.  You agree that only these two scenarios exist?  Simple enough for you to follow?  If you have some money left in your account that is not used for food, that money is used for investment by the bank.  It's not literally locked up, it's part of their total capital holdings and when you take money out they pay from their liquid holdings.  If you have no money in your account you are not withdrawing or spending it, by definition.  
If the interest on that amount is less than what they need to operate, you usually incur bank fees.
