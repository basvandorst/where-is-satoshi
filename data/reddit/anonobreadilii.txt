... this will be said at 10MB blocks with near certainty; same with 100MB blocks, and 1GB blocks - for all the same reasons by all the same people.
With Gavin Andresen now pushing for unlimited block sizes, who do you think you're fooling?
Will you people just admit that you want 100% of nodes in datacenters for crying out loud. Stop wasting everyone's time.

And here I was thinking National Propaganda Radio would try to surreptitiously taint Bitcoin - a money without government - at every step of the way. Boy was I wrong!
How could I have *ever* doubted a paid establishment mouthpiece *catering to a voting white collar audience*? Thanks, @_date: 2016-06-30 03:47:49
NPR's most-listened-to shows are syndicated national content with well-known establishment sponsors. Please excuse me for not caring if local NPR news stations running nationalized content aren't making gobs of money shilling for Corporate America.

Most of these people just want no block size limit.
They're never going to have some "light bulb" moment that causes them to reconsider; not when they fundamentally *believe* deep down that Corporations running 100% of nodes in datacenters somehow constitutes "decentralization".
They'll believe Corps running all nodes in datacenters is "decentralized" at 2MB blocks, at 20MB blocks, and at 20GB blocks. To them, it's just an accident of history that ordinary people are able to run nodes on consumer hardware today. We shouldn't have that, now should we. Not what Satoshi had in mind, they say.
Hence, you will never see these people say, "hmmmm, you know what? it's damn near impossible to run a node on a home desktop PC now, and that's bad so I guess we should freeze the limit despite exploding demand in order to try to stay decentralized".
It will never happen since they flat out disagree with that thinking on all levels.

That quote was out of context, but Paul Sztorc ripped Buterin to shreds (!!!) in that comment section. If you managed to come out of that article thinking weak subjectivity solves anything whatsoever short of creating another path to funneling more money into the Ethereum priesthood, you've either been bamboozled or are an Ethereum shill.

Money is a confidence game. Thanks for playing!

I'd look at an industrial seed expeller press. That is, if I had a solar powered vertical farm with excess capacity, and existing customers for my *existing* agribusiness, I'd lean towards expanding my existing product line into cooking oil. Think about the synergies.
And I wouldn't even *entertain the notion* of mining for BTC if I couldn't power ASICs 24/7, just in general, since the ASICs will be obsolete and pretty much worthless within 5 years. If you're not squeezing every last drop out of them, I mean the margins are *already* razor thin.

The author's gist is mostly correct, due to the DAO being pushed as a risk-free investment product. Because it was advertised as a risk-free investment, if Ethereum hadn't bailed out their many investors, a class action lawsuit would be IMO a near certainty.
However, I would disagree that the bailout through hardfork route was ethical.


The Ethereum Foundation easily could've drawn down their massive pre-mine funds to refund investors directly. I don't see the problem with drawing down their pre-mine funds, actually I see that as the best possible option given the stigma of pre-mining and this being the perfect excuse to wipe their hands clean.
Especially so since the DAO supposedly raised $150M for "furthering the ecosystem", so a direct pre-mine bailout would've theoretically resulted in a fair trade.
In short, the Ethereum priesthood easily could've bailed out investors directly, without violating their purported principles. Of course, since their purported principles were nothing but an advertising slogan designed to enrich the founders, that wasn't a very good option.

If all you wanted to do was decide who owns what, in a manner such that if anything goes not to your liking, you can rely on a court of public opinion to rectify things, well you're in luck! We have that already.
**It's called the fucking court system**.


JFC, can the Ethereum shills spin this any harder?

Segwit is virtually identical in effect to a 2MB block hard fork. But then again, 2MB throughput doesn't achieve *anything* that 1MB doesn't also achieve. It's 3 tps vs 6 tps.
And BitTorrent seeders don't require 10-machine clusters in remote datacenters to seed files: you can seed files on your laptop easily. BitTorrent is a perfect example, in that hundreds of millions of people use it, but those 100s of millions of people don't need to buy Corporate services *to* use it.
Conversely, if we had to fit the transactions of those hundreds of millions of people onto the Bitcoin blockchain directly, you *couldn't* run the Bitcoin system without having a datacenter.

That's incorrect, on multiple levels.
1. Private torrent trackers actively reward users in various ways for seeding torrents. See also: JoyStream
2. You don't need a 10-machine cluster in a remote datacenter to seed torrents. See also: Bram Cohen, author of BitTorrent, for his take on the block size debate


This is a copout. Gavin Andresen is *already pushing* for unlimited block sizes. None of you bigblockers have ever been interested in 2MB, you're not interested in 2MB now and you'll surely beg and plead in the same ways for the same reasons once 2MB is hit. FYI 2MB is only 3 tps more than we have now. It's hardly worth getting choked up over.


Right, but miners don't feel the externalities of storing the blocks forever; heck, most mining companies may not even be around in the Bitcoin space in five years time. They don't care about node operators having to perpetually store transactions until the heat death of the universe. Miners have short term profit incentive, it isn't clear whether the miners mining at any given time will be here in the longer term.
Also, it should be noted Mike Hearn, one of the chief architects of "bigblockdom" had the following to say about sustaining the mining ecosystem in a zero fee environment. Taken from his thread titled "**Funding of network security with infinite block sizes**":






AFAIK, outside of the normal speculation no one has suggested any other workable alternative to paying miners in a zero block scarcity environment besides "a kickstarter for block rewards". Honestly, combined with gigablocks, how on earth can anyone look at that as being anything other than hopelessly centralized? Where is the long term thinking?

Again, BitTorrent users, despite their being hundreds of millions of them, *don't* need a 10-machine cluster in a remote datacenter to seed files. You can seed files on just about any old desktop PC.
Conversely, if hundreds of millions of people wanted to dump all their daily txs on the Bitcoin blockchain, 2MB surely wouldn't handle it all.
Do you see? BitTorrent scaled in a decentralized manner, such that *hundreds of millions* of users aren't *required* to buy Corporate datacenter services to take advantage of the network. Not so with Bitcoin scaled to gigablocks to support that same quantity of users.
