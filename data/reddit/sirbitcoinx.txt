Wow really? Are you quoting that scammer Andreas popispopulos? Let me remind you that he got people into mtgox, defended mtgox until the very last scam and then when the scam was obvious he made a statement blaming it all on karpeles, now he did the same thing with neo&amp;bee, got people into investing in that scam, gave his word, his advice, recommended this, defended Danny the CEO and his company......until the scam was too obvious and then he makes another statement saying how fucked they were etc etc, stop worshiping andreas seriously , he is the biggest scammer in bitcoin and he loves getting his dick rode by deluded bitcoiners like you. Whatever he recommends next will be a scam, whatever he is involved next will be a scam, and people like you will be riiding his dick and ignore his pasts scamms. WOW you amaze me , idiot

To be fair, he's got a point. As a finish, I do not feel that my government is spying on me 24/7 like the american NSA...

Indeed, but there is no point talking about it here mate, the guys in this sub won't accept facts and they really would do anything andreas tells them to.
