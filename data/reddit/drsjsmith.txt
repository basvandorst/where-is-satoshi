You didn't mention that the ATMs in Bali have a withdrawal limit of only 2 million IDR at a time (often only 1.5 million IDR), with a flat fee for each withdrawal.  The units on the currency don't actually matter all that much (and Indonesia has been planning to redenominate the rupiah anyway, although that process seems to have slowed), but acquiring the currency is indeed inconvenient.
Any success paying with Bitcoin in Bali?

Agreed.  The "fridge orders milk" use case doesn't require Bitcoin.  You could rig it up right now, using local fiat currency for payment, assuming your local grocery store delivers in response to Internet orders (my local grocery stores sure do).
The usefulness of Bitcoin is more noticeable in other situations.  In another thread, we were discussing use cases involving foreign travel: widespread acceptance of Bitcoin would eliminate the need to change your local fiat currency into dozens of other fiat currencies, whether directly or via ATM.  Bitcoin would be incredibly useful in lots of places in the developing world if widely accepted there: in many places, much of life is low-tech, but they still have cell phones, which is all you need for a Bitcoin economy.

I think there are precisely two alternatives: either Bitcoin will fail, or (because of the finite supply of Bitcoin) Bitcoin's eventual rise in value will outpace that of any other currency.   I only think Bitcoin will fail in two situations: if civilization as a whole collapses, or if there's a concerted worldwide effort to destroy Bitcoin.  I don't see either of those two situations as particularly likely, so yes, I think eventually $1.00 USD will equal 1 bit, and then less than 1 bit, and so on.
