The recent crash was mostly to do with investor speculation on the fork and then the confusion with Segwit. Not a real crash, so, to speak, a small market correction. The recent rally and confidence boost people have since the announcement of the fork is likely to keep values buoyant until Spring 2018.

If you have some already: keep it. The market correction won't come until 2018 now. A lot of wallet companies are relying on the market to hold steady until 2018 when they can get support for Bitcoin Cash up and running for their customers. After that, well let's see how the market feels, ya know. 
Also, many of the rallies that took place, were merely recouping the losses experienced prior to Segwit2X and Bitcoin Cash fork.

The current inherent value of Bitcoin arises from the fact that it is limited in supply and is primarily in the hands of a few daring individuals. Over 90% of the world's population likely does not own any bitcoins, so, the current valuations are indeed inflated, to some extent. I think that we're likely to see current Bitcoin markets hit their true inflated valuation peak in 2018. I am not so sure about it after that.

That's not strictly true. Hedge funds are notorious for playing basically all-in on a dead hand but typically these are smart people who have access to way more insider knowledge than the rest of us. So, they know what they are getting into, most of the time. Case in point, would be the hedge fund which predicted an Argentinian default and then got their govt, aka the US, to make Argentina pay the hedge fund for that bet, effectively.

True that. The elite hedge fund managers are billionaires literally playing around with their money by pooling it together.

Lol, that's a good one. Gold values have crashed in the past, as recently as, Spain's economic crisis which was caused, in part, by over-abudance of gold being brought initially causing a drop in market value followed by a series of costly wars which Spain could not pay for due to heavy privateering (pirates) by the British Naval Forces. 
Gold isn't a bubble by itself, its abundance is a bubble. The over-abundance can lead to economic crash and not enough meant you couldn't pay your troops.

Let's not hype things up too much. I want eth to hit 1000 too, but at a measured pace.
