I just looked on GDAX (dunno if that's any good TBH, quick google) and their market depth chart indicates you'd have to sell $1,000,000 of bitcoin to move the market by $100.

Yeah but someone down the food chain will have to. That coffee shop owner still has to convert it back to pay taxes, staff, and for raw materials. If it costs them 2% then that's going to get fed back into the cost of the coffees they sell you.
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:35:42
Yeah. The 'I need cash abroad' problem is already solved. Anyone operating a bitcoin ATM also isn't going to do it for free. Unless they feel particularly altruistic.

And back again to BTC when you leave...

And I'm pretty sure they need to charge a fee to pay the guy's salary, therefore you'll still be paying to use a bitcoin ATM, right?

Even so, most ATM's in England are free. You feel ripped off anyway if you have to pay £3 for some crappy ATM in a captive market type of location anyway. If I had to spend £5 to get £100 of bitcoin I'd feel completely overcharged for the priviledge. Why would I bother when I could just get cash (usually for free) and save the vendor a transaction fee if I felt like being nice.
I guess it's an 'early adopter' premium. Or perhaps a money laundering fee.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:47:10
Yes. No it didn’t 
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:02:01


plus the volatility risk between the sale and the conversion. Even a 3% daily move could hit your profit margin pretty hard. Of course it could go either way...
Interesting discussion though - obviously as you say, retailers are not going to use an ATM to cash in their bitcoins unless maybe they're small experimental shops like coffee bars and such. IDK.

Just curious. How much would it actually cost a complete bitcoin newb to safely buy $3 in bitcoin? Dead serious. Time, effort etc. I don't even know what 'places like Circle' means.
Edit: OK I went to 'Circle' and requested an invite. Clock has started. Easy so far, but nothing has happened yet.
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:59:46
Yes they can. I can for example set up a cash settled bitcoin futures market that doesn't need any bitcoin at all, just an index to base my settlement off.

My bank doesn't charge me to withdraw cash. Other people who borrow money for the bank fund my free cash withdrawals. Works for me.

personally as a passive observer in all this (as in I don't own any bitcoin, just grab the popcorn to watch the rollercoasters) I'm not sure this will have a positive effect. The mainstream media are basically reporting it as bitcoin = digital currency to buy illegally traded stolen nudie pics. This is not going to drive mainstream adoption in my opinion.

Wow. even if I take out £100 from an ATM I might get charged at most £3 or 3%. How is 7% attractive to retailers? And what is up with that article: right above it says:


WTF. He's made £2660 in commission. Wow.
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:58:28
Well, you can launder up to £1500 a day in cash. Walk off with your anonymous bitcoin and then cash it in online at your exchange and now it's in your bank account. Seems easy to me. If I were the local police, I'd probably be keeping an eye on the CCTV there to see if people are paying in large sums of cash on a daily basis. I'm a bit late to the Breaking Bad party: I've been daydreaming about what you'd do with a basement full of cash. This seems ideal. Hypothetically of course.
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:21:34
If you sell them back to the machine you'll get about £86 :-/
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:42:26
I don't think it was harsh. A little close to the truth perhaps, but your example is better assuming OP is only buying bitcoins to pay expenses on a fairly 'just in time' basis.
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:43:07
They don't. It's a bad analogy. It only works if the cookies are identical.
@_date: 2014-09-02 12:03:33
I'm not sure I get what you're suggesting. Are you saying I should take note of the fact that the comic I had is worth something? Also, in your analogy, the car would need to be stolen would it not?
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:00:42
beers are getting expensive these days...
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:43:32
Yes, that is correct. The same is true of cash. If you want an intermediary to handle it for you, you pay a commission. That's what retailers pay for with credit/debit cards for moving virtual fiat cash. Even better, they don't have to handle actual cash which is expensive in its own right, so even 3% seems like good value compared to moving and counting cash.
My point is that don't tell anyone there won't be fees: clearly there are, at least in the short to medium term when you still have to convert to and from the local currency that you have to buy your raw materials from if you're a retailer. 5% is relatively high too, so you'd hope it gets cheaper.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:36:09
I looked at their website for 5 minutes. It doesn't mention SMS.
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:35:00
I'm going to set up @_date: 2014-09-10 15:52:56
Ok, that is a good analogy to a point, except most of the time I'm spending money in my own country, so 5% 'tax' to spend it in bitcoin does not appeal to me.
Even with the forex analogy, you can buy dollars with pounds here with no commission, but on a 8c bid offer spread. So 4c each side of the mid which equates to about 2.5%. I don't expect it to be done for free, but if you equate this machine to a miner, then you could say instead of the cost of mining, I put a machine there and people pay me bitcoins and I give them instant cash - what's that worth? Or instead at least make a bid offer spread in the machine that equates to a 'decent' percentage similar to a high street currency exchange. As it stands I still think it's a rip off and I wouldn't use it.
It's definitely a good start, and I'm sure they'll get cheaper. When it's easy for me to purchase bitcoins here and spend them abroad, cheaper than my bank will convert my debit card spending, then I'd be happy to reconsider as I'd have an incentive to buy them.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:23:01
I think possibly the last thing you want is a bunch of Wall Streeters from Greenwich taking Bitcoin and turning it into their next derivatives trading toy. Would it be a good or a bad thing?

In terms of 'killer app' I think a much bigger danger will be something like Apple's NFC payments that should be coming with the iPhone6 - see [zdnet]( If this gets adopted the same way that Apple manage to get people to adopt new technology (ipods for music, iphones for smartphones) it will be huge. Yes I know android has it blah blah but NFC tied to a credit card securely will probably trump any sort of QR code payment system, at least in that particular real world domain.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:38:19
True. Clearly I've never done it before.

Apologies I forgot to add the /sarcasm tag. Take a look at 
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:10:27


I have a serious question related to this. How do retailers who operate on really fine margins deal with volatility when the price goes down. If you sell something at a 5% markup and the exchange rate drops 5% in a day, then your end of day mark to market profit is zero. That's way too much of a risk. Of course it can go up as well as down.
Even in that situation, do etailers do real time pricing in bitcoin. I was having a discussion with someone about bitcoin this morning and I watched the price on bitstamp go up $7 and down $5 in the space of a 10 minute discussion. Do you price stuff on a daily basis like a gas station or do you price things in real time. What happens if someone puts something in a basket and checks out 10 minutes later and you've lost 1%? I'd find it hard to make the leap unless you build in a premium for bitcoin sales given that you have to do your accounting in base currency.

Customers would be people who don't want the hassle of storing and securing the 'physical' asset. Even if your asset is electronic, it still needs to be secured with hardware, firewalls, keys etc.

So basically... 
10 use electricity
20 mine bitcoin
30 pay for electricity with bitcoin
40 goto 10
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:45:10
They're not futures. Limit orders are good till cancel. You can put in a bid right now to buy at $1 but it won't get filled until all the other bitcoins bid at a higher price are sold.
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:39:12
4%? Another example of the 'no-transaction fees if you use bitcoin' fallacy?
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:56:24
I don't think you understand what paper means in this case.
Say I think bitcoin will be worth $500 next month. You think it will be worth more, so we enter into a forward agreement where I agree to sell you bitcoin and you agree to buy it from me at $500.
There are 2 ways to settle this. Either we agree to cash settle it based on some bitcoin index, eg the bitstamp price at 5pm UTC in a month's time. If it's actually trading at $400 then you owe me $100. It's a paper trade, like a bet. You can do this with Gold, interest rates, or equities, pretty much anything.
Or, in a month, I have to supply you the bitcoin (whether or not I actually own any right now) to settle the trade and you have to give me $500 whatever it's worth. I have to buy BTC for $400 and give it to you so net I'm still up $100. It's a deliverable forward i.e the underlying has to exist.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:54:47
And we have a winner. 1% of the population has 99% of the money to actually pay for stuff.
OK but seriously. How do I pay for stuff with bitcoin and SMS? Genuinely curious.

Funny how you can state the obvious and yet be downvoted for 'not contributing to the discussion' which on many subs these days seems to be the case if you simply oppose the hivemind. The only solution to 'exchange fees' is a single global currency, or something parallel that you can spend in most places. In some countries this turns out to be the dollar already: try going to central america for example: you can offer people dollars for cash purchases and they'll be quite happy to take them. Maybe that's how bitcoin will evolve as another parallel alternative, but the cash problem is already solved by the ATM as you said, and that's what this discussion is about.

Ironically this sort of transaction creates brokers and thereby a system not dissimilar to the current investment banking system. There will also be derivatives, options etc. It's everything many people complain about with the current financial market system.

If you buy gold, you sell gold futures as a hedge to 'lock in' your return, thereby removing the risk that gold might go down in value. You are looking for a guaranteed return, rather than a gamble that something might go up or down, which is just having a position.
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:08:32
Clearly you have no idea what hedging means. If you just buy bitcoin then you have a position. [Hedging](

Sorry but MAS don’t mess about. They’re a good regulator. They push hard on new tech adoption including AI. They know what they’re doing.

@_date: 2019-11-30 18:26:35
This is no different to them vaulting gold for clients. I don’t think they’ll be taking their own crypto positions. Too volatile. They generally don’t do ‘own account trading’ anymore. They might hold positions for a while when hedging but I think this is all client business focused. Warehousing fees.

it's called a bid/offer spread. it pays the people who work there to offer services, they pay taxes, etc. stop with the 'fuck banks' crap.

Out of interest (as a lurker) what is the current BTC/Gh/s rate? i.e how many bitcoins would you earn if you run 1Giga of hashes for one second if you know what I mean.
Maybe it's easier to say BTC per Gh/s per day. Whatever, what's a meaningful return from a set up like that.
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:45:48
yeah, seriously, how does a fairly low margin business deal with market risk like that: you'd have to immediately hedge your currency risk back into USD so you'd have to charge at least a bit more in bitcoin (no pun intended) to cover your currency spread, let alone the market risk.
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:18:03
Ok so around $5 a day per Gh/s. Good metric. Sorry to convert back to lay currency :-)
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:37:33
