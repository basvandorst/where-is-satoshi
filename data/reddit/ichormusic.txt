This is awesome! Please suggest that they do some cord management in the back. Use some black velcro straps to run it down the back of the table leg or something :)
Make the presentation look a bit nicer :)

I tweeted them with a request, no response yet though. They're usually REALLY good about responding to tweets. At least regarding their delish rittos.

Just had my 1st BTC purchase. Sooooo cool. BitPay and Shopify rock!
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:33:14
Great analogy, thanks!

If anyone wants one, PM me the wallet address that you want to use, and your physical address.
I'll do the 1st one for 20 mBTC, and any additional ones for 12 mBTC. Shipping included. You should get them within around 2 weeks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:18:31
It's sooo easy to create a new wallet, though.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:04:39
Hahaha! If I can figure out a way to make this process a little easier, I'll be able to come down on the price a bit. Hopefully to around there. I'm sort of new on this machine at the time being, so it's not a super efficient process for me yet.

Let me know if you have any good selling points that I can use on them!
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:33:09
Will do! What color tint would you want? I can't imagine a clear one working with a scanner, since I believe the QR code requires the black part to be darker than the white part.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:09:48
Not sure. Since there will be some set up time for each one, my initial thought was around ~0.02 btc for the 1st one, .01 for each additional one with the same address, shipping included. Do you think that would be fair?
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:55:14
Agreed. I'll have to talk to the guy running BitTracks.com and see if he's able to do that.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:41:22
i like it!
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:43:20
I did that same thing a while back. Sold at $177, waiting for it to drop. Not once again did it get that low. Within 2 days it was over $300 and I was out a bitcoin when I bought back in.
Last and only time I'll ever try that.

Haha, thanks. That's half a million dollars lol. Insane.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:31:09
GREAT explanation! Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:08:10
Shipping FROM Europe, actually :)

What do you guys think a fair price would be?
We could customize the text under the code, but it would be a little more work, since I already have this template made, so it might cost just a little bit extra.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:58:48
Is it so then?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:53:15
Love this!!

@_date: 2013-12-13 13:28:51
:) of course!
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:00:37
I run a small business and thought that it'd be a novel way to spread the word of using Bitcoin to accept payments, without having my clients wait around while I pull out my phone, open up an app, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:05:34
How much of this is due to the Mt.Gox lag time? It was at 21 minutes earlier... That seems insane.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:02:20
It's a pretty hard plastic. It would take quite a bit to scratch it up.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:02:08
Someone bought 499.99 at $1,000
HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN?!?
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:24:56
Done! Thanks for the advice :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:54:26
Perfect. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:27:17
I was going to call it a blockchain, since it's square(ish), but that might get confusing lol
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:59:29
Hey! I'm working on setting up a site for them.
In the meantime, if you'd like one, PM me the wallet address that you want to use, and your physical address.
I'll do the 1st one for 20 mBTC, and any additional ones for 12 mBTC. Shipping included. You should get them within around 2 weeks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:35:15
Man... that would be pretty awesome! I'll try it out :) Thanks so much :) :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:51:32
Haha, not looking for tips! Just thought some of you might be interested in having one made! I'm thinking about selling them, wanted to gauge the interest 1st :)
I'll try it on some transparent acrylic once I get some in!
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:07:56
Of course!
