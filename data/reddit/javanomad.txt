Unreal timing - I'm flying back into Bali tomorrow - and I've got Bitcoin. BitIsland,  here I come.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:26:13
We moved it entirely. Although we did set up some people in Indonesia with our roaster, operation and how-to so they can continue the process themselves and continue benefiting from the project. More on THAT soon too! 
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:03:59
Thank you all for making our first Roast Station project in Indonesia so successful last year. We have now been able to relocate and recreate the project in Costa Rica. Connecting another amazing regional coffee and the farmers more directly to coffee enthusiasts - all thanks to Bitcoin and you!
@_date: 2014-08-26 04:22:45
Thanks so much for your support - glad you enjoyed the coffees :)
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:23:13
Much needed resource. Congrats to these guys working out of Bali on this!
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:51:56
1. About 2 weeks.
2. Yes, I stamp the roast date on each package.
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:41:42
Are YOU here? Already 2.5 hours into the conference - and the information and presenters have been excellent so far. Some lady named "Bitcoin Baby" is about to sing a song about bitcoin now...
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:46:04
Don't worry - in the end Starbucks HELPS the little guy. Once everyone realizes how bad SB's coffee is - they start turning back to smaller cafes who offer specialty coffees. Just give it a couple years ;) Chinese are fast learners, probably won't take as long for this to happen there...
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:07:16
It's awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:14:23
Thank you for understanding.
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:36:56
If you're not in Singapore and can't stop by in person, maybe tell them "Thanks" for accepting BTC here? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:14:05
Let me coat-tail and say I'm also here and available to answer any questions about the *coffee* :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:49:44
Exactly - there are a LOT of questions like this that immediately pop up. 
But with each questions comes the opportunity for an answer and a solution - solutions that could soon make "incorporating" / creating legal and defensible stateless corporate entities within the blockchain a simple and common thing.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:59:44
Really - getting people to see other possible ways to use the blockchain to reduce red-tape and encourage innovation "doesn't do anything" to help bitcoin? I disagree - this project has already given me some great ideas. The feedback we've gotten just in the first couple hours includes a wealth of questions to be answered that might provide new solutions as well.

@_date: 2013-11-25 15:24:30
I've talked with people involved in both Seasteading and bitcoin - obviously go hand in hand. Wonder if Peter would get on board with this too LOL...
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:11:43
Wow - thanks for the order! Really appreciate it. Just roasted so we'll ship this out to you tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:47:37
I'm glad you liked it - but a friendly suggestion -use virgin COCONUT oil, not olive oil when you make your BP Coffee - tastes much, much better ;)
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:30:31
Good to know - that's why I used "attempted". Please let me know any other examples of earlier attempts at a company incorporating "in" the blockchain like this? I didn't want to be too presumptuous.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:08:16
It is. Try pricing specialty grade single origin Arabica from a roaster in your area, you'll find similar if not more expensive pricing - plus their green beans traveled for 6 months or more on a cargo container before getting to them. We're not offering some year old commercial grade beans for your Mr. Coffee here ;)
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:18:56
I got to see these beauties a couple of weeks ago. (Was there when this interview took place.) Good for demonstrating mining - as far as ROI though....
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:06:30
Namecoin is another piece of this puzzle  - and option that needs to be explored for sure - for exactly the reason you state.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:51:14
The Seasteading institute is a large organization that is working on massive long-term plans for libertarian type cities at sea in the distant future.
The Coinsteading Project is a much simpler concept that is currently underway starting with a single family (mine) about to create a new homebase and lifestyle with Bitcoin. Then plans to expand with a additional members and a co-working space ;)

I was interviewed about this last week. The author just got in touch to let me know it was published today.

LOL - even the sarcastic ones hehehe
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:30:54
This is a really funky cafe on Haji Ln off Arab St. in Singapore. The head of the Singapore Bitcoin Meetup group told me about it when I caught up with him yesterday- so I went there today. Awesome espresso blend for their coffee. (Had it as an Americano). They HAPPILY accept bitcoin for payment. You'd think the financial hub of Singapore of all places would have more bitcoin adoption - places like this are a great start though!
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:27:36
[Edan Yago]( is one of the folks behind this. Just heard him speak on this at Bitcoin Singapore last Friday.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:14:28
11 hours in - I just want to thank all those who made serious thought provoking replies, provided good questions, possible answers and excellent resources for us to look into a build upon here. 
Very helpful and very appreciated. r/bitcoin rocks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:39:59
Thanks for the feedback. As stated, this has just been "done" as an example of what might be possible - and to see what questions and issues need to be sorted - such as the ones you state. Certainly would not be attempting to transact any actual business through it until such details are clarified or ready to be tested. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:34:12
I only had an Americano when I visited a couple weeks ago. That description of the Thanksgiving sandwich makes me want to fly back to S'pore  ASAP! Will have to add it to my to-do list when I come back in Nov. for the bitcoin conference.
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:18:35
Yes we do - and anywhere else bitcoin users are drinking coffee!
@_date: 2013-10-07 06:47:26
Step 1: Have an in-demand product.
Step 2: Let people try it.
Step 3: When they ask to purchase some, tell them, "I only sell it for Bitcoin".
Step 4:???
Step 5: New Bitcoin User
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:07:34
Yes - I'll be coming back to Singapore in November for that :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:38:56
Any specific reasons why, in relationship to what we are looking for? Any specific regions / locales within the country that you would suggest? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:27:14
Just a big shout out and Thank You to - we just started the Roast Station project here in Bali at the beginning of October and we are just about to ship out our 50th order! We owe this to the attention we got and the contacts we made here on Reddit. Thank you for helping prove bitcoin is a viable option for trading a direct-from source product - from anywhere in the world TO anywhere in the world.

Props to reddit user [David Moskowitz]( from [Coin Republic]( for doing the interview and help spreading the word about BTC in S'pore as well!
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:37:01
For now, we've got the weight and packaging designed so we get a good shipping rate on the 200g of coffee size. From Indonesia, it gets a bit crazy for shipping after that point though. Happy to check rates on larger amounts for you though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:45:12
It gets this conversation started.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:57:09
I hope I didn't come across as TOO crazy. Before we met, I had consumed 3 traditional "Kopi-O" coffees, an Americano and a straight shot of espresso over the course of the afternoon at various cafes and Kopi-tiams on the island.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:01:31
Nice - missed that.

One of the best non-panel presentations of the day last Friday - made the trip to Singapore worthwhile. Thanks for filming!

@_date: 2013-10-21 04:59:12
Excellent idea. Simple but powerful way to get the word out - especially since it is feedback that was requested.

Your beans should have arrived by now, yes - please just [click here to contact us] ( - let me know the name you ordered under and I'll look up the tracking and get back to you.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:29:13
Setting up within / near an existing community that is or has the potential of being bitcoin-friendly is part of the plan.
I've heard that many members of the Free State Project were early adopters of Bitcoin - always a good sign. Worth looking into. 
Downsides include, New Hampshire is frickin' cold.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:40:28
Thanks again to David from [Coin Republic]( - Bitcoin Singapore 2013 was incredible.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:37:59
Dave from CoinRepublic invited me out for dinner during my brief visit to Singapore this week and interviewed me after the meal. He just let me know about the video being posted to his site.
Dave is very active in promoting BTC adoption in this amazing island nation and I am indebted to him for helping me spread the word about The Roast Station project and for being a great guide to the bitcoin community here. 
Please note: The audio quality could be much better - he interviewed me in a very popular restaurant - but the discussion was really interesting, if I do say so myself.

I get the feeling he's never downloaded a wallet and actually USED btc or looked into how it was being effectively used before the current speculative phase started getting so much attention. 
And I use to have quite a bit of respect for the Austrians...

[David Moskowitz]( from [CoinRepublic]( in Singapore.
Besides being one of the biggest promoters of Bitcoin in Singapore and running one of the few exchanges there, he also just became the first person to [confirm his recent marriage using the blockchain]( 
Very interesting entrepreneur and Bitcoin community character who I've had the pleasure of hanging with in person.

Thanks! And so is the work you're doing - glad to help keep you caffeinated.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:12:39
That is EXACTLY what we have in mind. Roger Ver told us about both colored coins and Proof Of Existence when he presented in Singapore two weeks ago - these were the pieces of the puzzle needed to make this start coming together.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:10:33
As described in the articles of incorporation, it is intended to be a corporate entity entitled to engage in any lawful business transactions, any where it pleases, in its own name. It need not be more specific than that at this time.
UPDATE: To clarify - the point of this is not what the company "does" or "will do", it's to open the discussion about whether or not a company can be created/verified/defended using the blockchain in this (or some other manner).
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:36:37
Thank you! I see SO much potential in bitcoin for both facilitating global commodity trade and putting more power (selling and buying power) in the hands of the producers.
The [Roast Station Project] ( was launched just four weeks ago as a test - to see if people would purchase a high-quality locally grown and processed commodity with bitcoin. 
We're just a month in - and have already sent coffee to dozens and dozens of bitcoiners / coffee freaks in over 21 countries around the world.
This is already proof that bitcoin can help small-scale producers reach a larger market without the need for as many middlemen - brokers, payment processors, etc...
It also shows that it is a viable currency for consumers who want to make purchases easily from anywhere in the world.

The test Roast Station
You are here
Home » Blogs» Alex Räisä 's blog
On Friday, the 25th October - 2013 Added by Alex Räisä
Roast Station is an Indonesian Java coffee Nomad Bitcoin -related projects . He sells local coffee worldwide, and the only payment accepted bitcoin .
Nomad roast coffee themselves on order and will endeavor to provide the most fresh coffee. Coffee beans supplied , so freshness is guaranteed when you can actually grind beans vastapaahdettuja .
Bali Kintamani
Varastohessut decided immediately after the test Roast Station for service . The payment was made to the website Coinbase payment button , and after confirming the payment was given contact details of the reverse the normal process of online ordering . 200 g bag 0.17 Bitcoin paid and included in the price. Order was 10.12.2013 and 23.10.2013 the coffee arrived .
postal service
The coffee was really exceptionally good. Beans were larger than average , and we estimate the degree of browning 4/5 . The taste was estimated on the basis of two testitiimiläisen nutty, currant and good. Milk with coffee came to the very unique flavors , which I do not African , Brazilian and Indian coffee not previously been found . Perhaps the closest came to mind Monsoon Malabar, which is a mocha ground become drunk . Very aromatic , this " Bali Kintamani ," and it is certainly due to the freshness.
beans mill
I recommend to try this coffee.

This is James "JB" Allen. Just wanted to make sure people know this is for real &amp; I'm a real person.
While we've only just gone live with the Roast Station Project, you can see my previous posts on my experiences here on Reddit:
And on my FB account:
And you can contact me here or through our site:
While obviously there is a trust factor involved with any BTC purchase, as far as me using a criminal's name and going through all the effort we have to find this coffee and put this project together just to scam people, well, all I can say is is over there -----&gt;
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:13:37
I bring these just past the edge of full city. Any darker, they lose most of their origin flavor. It's just dark enough to bring a few hints of a bolder roast into the bean though - rounds the cup out nicely I think.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:07:05
I was there- unfortunately, this discussion wasn't until the end of the day, and many had already left. This was one of two end-of-day discussions that made flying to Singapore and attending the day-long event worthwhile.

Be glad when the Bitcoin Startup's Venture Funding comes in BTC not USD. e.g. "Bitcoin Startup Coinjar Raises 455.5 BTC In Venture Funding".
