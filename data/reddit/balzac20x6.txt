Who the hell invests in currencies?  Most decent stocks make 15-20% a year in the current market, far more if you play smart. Since Jan 1, my stock picks are up 9%, and I'm not even options trading. BTC is trash for investing at this point by all metrics that matter, assuming you're not day trading dips, which in itself is a dangerous game if you don't know what you're doing. But even still, you can make those profits and far more playing stocks.
The people HODLing are fine if you've been in it awhile, but if you were a person who bought in over $17k, your money is probably gone until summer, and even then you'll be lucky to break even. The moment BTC hit 16-17k again, inb4 traders hard sell and cause it to plummet again. BTC is not seeing 20k again unless something insane happens like a big player accepting BTC (which is extremely unlikely). People in general are failing to understand the concept of opportunity cost, where the months you spend sitting on BTC that goes up and down without real gains could have been in other investments that have perpetual upward trends. The BTC meme gains ended the moment traders got ahold of it.

While i'm def shifting assets to RH, how are still people still using Coinbase? You know GDAX exists right, enables trading off CB within 2 minutes, and has marginal fees?

You can't see a bear market in 2 months of data, factually less than 2 months according to your post. You're either a troll or a shill. I day trade BTC for the lulz, so I want BTC to meander; I'm just calling BS where I see it.

You realize BTC is taxed exactly the same as stock capital gains right?

"Buy the dip" implies a stock is under valued on volume and there is an opportunity to make money during a price dump. This phrase doesn't factually apply to crypto given there is no certainty for the value to raise given there is no inherent value. "Buying the dip" in BTC is a gamble with no certainty in either direction. The meme for this phrase in regards to crypto is that anytime the price drops, its a dip, so proceed to buy.

I'm still confused why this is posted constantly. Was MtGox being a very clear scam (even during its brief existance) enough to make literally all future companies automatically likely to fail and cause mass paranoia? Coinbase at this point is essentially a real trading company the same as TD Ameritrade, Schwabb, etc. with multiple offices in the United States. Like them or hate them, I don't think them closing the doors and BTC disappearing is going to fly the same as if Fidelity claiming all their customer stock orders have vanished. 
At some point the idea of burying your BTC like gold is going to have to be seen as questionable in a world where crypto trading is taken seriously. I don't think the idea of hiding your BTC to avoid regulation is going to fly either; the IRS is not playing around and you will go to prison.

Literally every sub circle jerks their sub numbers, but the reality is most of the time the increased gains are primarily bots (extraneous data miners or otherwise).

Are you actually retarded? BTC is already at a 3 month low. If i cared about more memeing I'd already be buying. Austism overload around here.

Do you know how much volume RH trades in stocks per day? BTC is a joke in comparison. If they thought they couldn't handle it, they wouldn't do it.

It's almost as if BTC follows the market ups and downs identically now, PepoThink.

A few very serious financial analysts promised BTC will hit $15k before it sees any serious dips again; that was 3 months ago. OP hating on people buying-in before $15k is straight up ignorant. Even if BTC only increases 10% in a year (which is a near mathematical certainty), BTC is still a better investment than 90%+ of stocks due to it avoiding capital gains taxes (which are astronomical).

Right, I was just speaking in paraphrase and not using real math in my quickpost. In you look at BTC on the month to month like a pennystock, obviously it had insane jumps over 100% in multiple spurts back when it was worth under $1000 ea. I was mainly talking about it in terms of its current total price.

Literally no one can economically explain why BTC is doing anything. It is factually wrong to claim there is evidence of any kind to support BTC gains given it has existed over 10 years, and spontaneously jumps nearly 90% in a single year (most of which was in the last 4 months). If BTC was a commonly traded stock, betters would've shorted it and it would've plummeted to $2500 twice over now. Even Goldman Sachs doesn't understand how to bet on BTC despite manipulating currency being their primary profession.
As for how to explain it logically, the twin jumps BTC has shown both occurred on the worst market days this year if you factor in the 1~ day buyer's delay on the S&amp;P500/NASDAQ. People have been speculating a Bear market for over a year now, and these 7-10% dips cause people to transfer their wealth into BTC, assuming the full bear is hitting (but it hasn't yet).

These kinds of comments are stupid and pointless. People who are new to crypto seeking to buy and sell it as it was designed, ergo as a currency, only to be demonized by HODL morons with no understanding how value works. What if i told you taking your coins offline, burying them in your backyard on a paperwallet, and assuming they will increase in value to infinity is the actual stupidity?

That's basically the case with numerous market segments, e.g. ISPs. Having 0 regulation 'because government is bad' is the best way to ensure cartels and mafias set up shop and lock themselves in permanently.
