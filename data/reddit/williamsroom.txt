This is actually an interesting story, so many angels here.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:16:06
Didn't even look at it that way, they are relying on someone else to do the work.  I initially looked at the issue through Krakens perspective not BTC core's perspective.  Now, I see both sides.  
Edit: Rewritten to stay on topic. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:48:28
It took me about 2.5 weeks or so get finally get verified.  The problems with CB have been a complete nightmare, I will not go back to CB.  The restricted my account, and now I have problems with my BA syncing with my account.  SMH 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:50:22
Sounds reasonable from Kraken's perspective, but that is the problem with BTC Core.

If you do NOT have 2FA enabled then you are committing crypto malpractice, please learn and enable 2FA.

Finally, verified TODAY!!!!

I know that Jihan Wuu is the first person to translate the Bitcoin whitepaper into Chinese, as well as develop the ASIC chip.  Since, China is communist then they can use all their resources to mine while making it illegal for citizens.  Most of the hashing power is coming out of China, which is why the network could be disrupted for weeks as well as spammed.  China is a massive problem, and Donald Trump hates China, so hopefully we can get this shit solved. 
--I'm sorry to interject politics into this, but Bcash was the first interjection of Bitcoin and Politics.  
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:02:13
TBH I think they are picking and choosing who gets verified.  I say that because there have been some who get it in three days, and others in weeks.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:59:13
Actually, I'm going to have to revise that statement.  I was phished on Twitter, while trying to verify my account.  Needless to say I caught it before anything malicious was done.  I guess I will put, "Phished only once" on my resume.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:01:22
I started verification on December 15th so about 20 days.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:28:58
China is no doubt a problem, Isn't bitcoin banned in china? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:26:20
No doubt bankers and the FED are crapping their draws.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:49
I need some help, I have removed all my funds from my Coinbase account, and I can't close it.  It says, "cannot complete the close process just yet" - I'm paraphrasing here.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:15:53
I think I'm going to put, "Never been phished" on my resume.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:29:13
Paypal is another company using bitcoin technology, especially with Venmo! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:03
A private company, was publicly caught!
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:16:44
Don't do that, this is a new frontier.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:31:19
This drama validated my decision to diversify. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:41
damn that was fast lol...
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:07:05
Same here, I'm not a day trader.  The only trading I do is between crypto to diversify and spread out my risk.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:15:39
I got my account restricted from CB when I tried to link CB with GDAX.  The infrastructure is still being built so hopefully it gets better. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:54
Yeah me too! I need it for my Ripple.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:27:50
"Quiet", my bad.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:57:32
Would you say BTC, XMR, and LTC are all cryptocurrencies, while BTC Platanium is an Alt? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:35:49
Exactly what my uncle said at Christmas regarding capital gains taxes.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:10
My quick Bitcoin story.  I invested 1,000 dollars last January, sold half of it to pay for Summer School.  Now, I have holdings in BTC, LTC, XMR, XRP, and BCG (due to fork). So far my ROI is 917%.  I'm expecting a correction, but it will ultimately be good for the long run.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:49:14
Well, I ordered mine last week and it hasn't shipped, I know trezor has a shortage until Feb.  On the ledger website it wasn't disclosed so I don't know.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:55:31
Gemini, I was thoroughly impressed with the Winklevoss's interview, and Coinbase restricted my account when I tried to sync my GDAX account.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:31
Never keep your bitcoin on exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:32:22
And they allow their executives options to be paid in CRYPTO! That is instant insider trading! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:54:37
I'm totally split on that, obviously we know it is more valuable than a dollar just b/c of the technology.  This is all so fascinating.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:14:47
Those guys are for real, I mean they gave you the option to claim your coins every time a fork happened. The only added cryptos that were stable on the backend.   
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:56:28
You are exactly right, I went with Trezors estimation and I'm paying for it now.  Manual is best if you can calculate it right using the current mempool and some of the statistics.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:28:45
That's solid! I'll buy all your monero at a premium, lol for real though! Didn't expect you to have your operating cost down, that is where I think it would be tough, especially the maintenance.  Good Luck!  
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:00:51
The point of that story was to illustrate that Bitcoin is in the front of people's consciousness.  There is a large awareness of it.  That's all.   
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:58:06
Could this be a side-effect of a true singularity, I mean the innovation in the blockchain sphere is astonishingly fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:35:29
These estimations are garbage, I sent a 91 sat/B transaction and it took 11 days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:46
The big red flag is when a major exchange issues an IPO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:33
As someone who is studying business it is the next logical step, the reason that Coinbase cannot handle the growth is because they need the capital to invest in their infrastructure. If an IPO is issued in fiat, lookout!   
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:59:53
The definition of Success;  The achievement of something desired, planned, or attempted: attributed their success in business to hard work. Well done! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:16
Bitcoin is also what happens when Millennial's invade wall-street! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:18:47
I have heard differently, the new tax bill has them taxed, not the current one.  I could be wrong, please correct me if I am.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:44:39
Also, Cramer was praising Twitter, does he not realize Jack Dorsey just started accepting BTC on Square, and there is an integration coming between these two companies; Twitter, and Square. Twitter was also just upgraded to a buy! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:51:28
I am just below 100 sat/b (93.214 sat/b) and it's been four days! I definitely feel your pain.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:15
honestly fees are irrelevant at this point, you need to move your coins off of your exchange.  Anytime you buy any crypto have a plan to get it off of that exchange immediately. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:44:30
So what I did was split my BTC in half bought 25% XMR, 25% LTC, and had like +/-40 dollars and bought some Ripple.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:16:13
Your right, we ain't seen nothing yet!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:22:05
I went from Legacy to Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:45:53
I agree, I keep my principle in BTC and finally migrated to segwit! It will no doubt be an exciting year for crypto, the whole ICO thing was the real bubble IMO.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:54
Its official Coinbase has gone bust! They are not letting you close accounts so that they can still report high account numbers to their BoD.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:57:00
Its been tough, I'm waiting on verification, and a transaction from Legacy to Segwit... Now I get the current bear market. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:54
Are there any crypt-to-crypto exchanges that us Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:56:47
I like Coin Gecko so far, it gives you the hashing algorithm used.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:40:04
I will manually calculate my fees from now on! This has been a valuable learning opportunity.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:44:37
I feel like they are just not even verifying new customers at this point, I have no way to cash out.  I'm not planning on cashing out anytime soon however, it would be nice to have a couples exchanges as backups. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:38:35
Has your Nano shipped?
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:01:35
I have never manually pushed the hex code before. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:09:09
Nice, have you figured out your operating cost?  Which coins are you mining? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:37
It comes down to ethics. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:00:56
I wonder what will happen first?--My transaction getting bounced out of mempool, or getting verified by an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:48:31
Nice!! That does seem like the wait of a backlog. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:47:44
And moving your holdings off of the exchange, but you are exactly right!  I'm glad this is happening before they go public! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:49:18
Already tried that. I tried to sync my Coinbase account to my GDAX account, GDAX suspended my account, then Coinbase restricted my account. This was last Thursday, so I'm just waiting on Gemini right now.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:37:39
Moving coins is tough now with the problem with fees, that's why LTC, XMR, Ripple is what I chose to diversify with.   
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:58:41
yup, its about ethics! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:22
This is the first major breakthrough, and the crazy thing is...It is happening so rapidly. Very impressed.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:32
Clearly Coinbase is a political organization.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:30:37
The low option on Trezor it said expected confirmation like 3 days or so.  I'm in no rush for this transaction.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:53:01
Break what?, it was their in house fraud monitoring system that locks accounts on suspicious activity, and I'm guessing the sync didn't process correctly and it was flagged.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:47:23
So you can transfer BTC to CB and sell it, and then cash it out? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:57:41
Coinbase also doesn't let you select the fee.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:53:49
As a hodl'er do I stay in legacy or move to segwit? Any fact based advice? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:57
I sold my Bcash and then i split my Bitcoin in half. That was my hedge.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:11:32
I sent a to my Segwit address in my Trezor using a low fee, it will confirm right? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:07:09
Thank you for your insight, my exit strategy is still in the works unfortunately...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:16
Coinbase is up to something...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:43:45
how recently?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:45:15
Does anyone know the current situation with Tether??
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:13:47
I think BTC will hit a new ATH, and then only a couple of alts will stabilize at ATH's.  The higher BTC goes will cause a  trickle down effect to only a couple of chosen ALTS.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:32:12
I bought 1 BTC for 1k and new I had hit it almost perfect for my investment plan, not matter what I'm hold'ing for 10 years minimum. good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:41:38
Have you looked at any other alternatives?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:37:23
Next time im just calculating that fee myself, that estimation time is completely off on Trezor.  I wish it just got bounced from the mempool so I could reset the feel.  But I feel you man! yawn is right! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:12:05
it was 2014 and my dad said, "BTC is funny money". Anyway, buy in and diversify. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:27:44
I'm in pending to get verified, about how long should I expect to wait? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:26
What would your correction price be?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:09:30
Nice, looks like they have a backlog, I'll just Hodl on! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:30
They were only going to allow it for Withdrawal only, and that was not until next year! And they had an API leak! Coinbase is a failure! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:24:18
Yeah, I hope this all works itself out.  I sent a transaction at a little less than 100 sat/B on the 20th and I'm still waiting.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:05
Bcash is the biggest failure so far, just like Coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:54:45
I have mistimed every dip and end up buying at an ATH, the funny thing is, I have not lost any money.   Bitcoin, LTC, XMR are a very different beast from other securities.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:50:25
I did put some in ripple b/c if or when you can do on demand atomic swaps going from decentralized to centralized you have a true game changer.  Decentralized so you can store you value, centralized for everyday transactions.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:11:24
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:21:34
On coinbase, click your name and click contact support, they have a separate page you log into, to access your support tickets, did you create one? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:01:09
I would rather wait until another exchange lists it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:30:01
What is the situation with Tether? I have seen some chatter on a specific situation regarding Tether?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:10:13
The point is they don't even need a currency, they are using blockchain and multisig technology already.  They could issue a ICO if they wanted to, but funding and capital isn't an issue for them.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:02
I havn't had funds on coinbase for a while now.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:04:50
Shoot! Very nice though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:07:37
Do you have a support ticket open?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:41:14
The definition of Scam -A fraudulent business scheme; a swindle
How can bitcoin be a scam if it is based on proof of work that is mathematically backed. However, the value of bitcoin is a separate discussion.
