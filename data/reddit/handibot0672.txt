Voluntary exchanges free of coercion are the basis for a civil society. Coerced, controlled, and confiscated exchanges are the basis of socialism. I’ll let you guess where cryptocurrencies fit in.

Hundreds with issues compared to tens of thousands without problems still amount to anomalies. Keep practicing.

Actually they make lightening channel different. Lag time is because bitcoin too big. Lightening channel trim bitcoin, make it smaller shave. So you only get .99 bitcoin on other side but it .11 faster. And that make all difference in world. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:57:07
How do you decide if individuals are "qualified" to trade? That's adorable. Do you know enough about gold to trade it? Do you know enough about General Mills to trade its stock? That's called freedom, little fry guy, and we trust people with it in some parts of the world.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:46:08
That’s okay. You’re a fry guy. No need to make speaky!  
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:03:58
The post was sarcasm, little fry guy. Bitcoin is not a religion. Keep practicing.

I’m still a rocket man. Burning out his fuse up here alone. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:41
My rocket is getting cray cray!  Up 1,183% since a year ago!  Glad I bought in at dollars on the bitcoin. You look so little Elmer FUD. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:46:23
Make for big change, big tim. Make news posts bring all twogether. Jump up down. All happy Bitcoin.

You’re okay baby boy. I’ll watch you down there from my rocket to the moon. Oh my, you’re so tiny. So small. I think you’re waving. Oh my you’re an ant now. So minuscule. Good luck little fry guy so tiny. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:18:29
You’re just a little guy with cents to trade. How adorable. Best for you to be quiet among your superiors, little fry guy.

Whining on Reddit is for the little fry guys lacking discipline and integrity. Go get ‘em, slob boy.

Not really English. Closer to caveman grunting. Adorable.

Yes, real bitcoin exchange. The bitcoins “disappeared” in Japan. I lost a tidy bundle. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:37:33
My question is about withdrawal limits for GDAX and Coinbase. Apparently there is a standard withdrawal $10k limit set that can be increased to $50k for some users. If I plan to sell a large amount in the future, say hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoins, does that mean I can’t or does it mean that I have to send the total amount in small $10k/50k distributions to myself?
Any clarification here is welcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:11:41
Easy to say. Hard to prove. Baby boys talk, talk, talk until the cows come home while big boys show their work. What a fry guy.

Lil Jew is just a fry guy. He doesn’t know any better. He never learned that value is always subjective, never “intrinsic.”  What a baby boy. One day, he will learn on it!

Since GDAX was blocking any login attempts by me, I couldn't see a thing, little fry guy!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:15:56
Because you, and other Moonites, believe it will increase greatly in value long term. Some of us believe it will increase in value, then tank. I don’t have a crystal ball.

That’s perhaps the worst “comedy” I’ve seen on Reddit and there’s some pretty bad stuff here.

Accused, baby boy.

As my rocket continues to go higher you just keep looking tinier and tinier, little fry guy...like a miniature French fry!  So adorable.

It's a very strange take from a group with some level of financial sophistication. "We, we, we....still...just can't understand this crazy technology, so we grade it mediocre...in the meantime, hog futures are A+'s!"

I bought again when it sunk low (when the scaredy cats like you ran away). Now it is climbing; I'm in a great position. Plus my BTC replicated even credits of BCH, so I'm doing great! Look, I can see you...so tiny...so little...as my BTC rocket soars to the moon! Good luck little fry guy!

I’m saying it is sure amazing that trading “halted” at about 9k and people were not allowed to sell at said price, then they magically drop to mid 3,000’s and trading will likely resume. Not fishy at all. Nope. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:07:37
Humans attach value to all sorts of crazy things--look at urban rappers!  Just as we may value shiny metals or sparkly stones or rubbish gangsta music, all lacking inherent value, so too may we value cryptocurrencies. Wake up and smell the bacon, you little fry guy!

You do understand that if an asset changes in value from $1,100 to $1,000 or from $11,000 to $10,000 that the relative percentage change remains constant, yes?

I’ll buy them little fry guy!  I love a good fire sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:35
Which only leads to the underlying queries of: (a) why was trading halted and (b) what caused but one exchange to have three times exaggerated of a price?  Funny business. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:11:38
That’s called Bitcoin, baby boy. Only Roger Ver calls it Bitcoin “Core.”  Get on the noodle Express.

@_date: 2017-12-29 13:26:05
You should see how seasoned crypto currencies operate!  This one called Bitcoin rose more than 1,300 percent in a year, little fry guy. Pretty nifty!

Also, the sky is blue. Thanks for reporting in, Captain Obvious.

Notice that little number getting bigger again, little fry guy?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:14
Now, "magically," BCH is $3,406 on Coinbase. And you weren't allowed to sell when it was up high. That's not fishy at all. No way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:06
What a funny baby boy. Most of his comments are about him getting scared and panic selling adorable!  Also, no way you sold 57 coins in seconds. Nice try, fry guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:22
Man am I buying like crazy tonight!
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:38:30
Just keep practicing little lady. You seem more than a bit incoherent. Okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:15:10
You could sell Bcash two days ago, little fry guy. Keep practicing. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:30:23
Thank you. Little by little we can improve the world and help eliminate inarticulate, colloquial expressions!  Exciting times we live in.

You don’t know the first thing about fry guys, now do you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:24
You're okay little guy. You're just learning on it!

What is a "bankster"?  Is that like Banksy?

Keep practicing, Mr Reddit for two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:33:04
Neat, so the missing $2 billion of coins from Mt Gox can be given back in good faith by looking them up on the “public ledger.”  Looks like I got some coins headed my way!

I love the fleeing of the weak hands. These are the guys who last week were bragging about "$100 bills, yo." Little investments, little minds, and little courage to climb walls of fear. All the better for me.

Seems like the baby boy needs to learn individual responsibility instead of whining on Reddit. Silly fry guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:28
Except it was trading mid 8,000’s but wouldn’t allow sells only buys. Then it changes the price to mid-3,000’s for sells. How convenient and totally not crooked. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:40
Notice the price going up little fry guy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:15
You're adorable baby boy.

Just keep practicing little fry guy. You’ll get there one day.

Back up near 20 next week is my guess.

“Almost coming”?  What is an “almost coming”?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:05:17
I would be thankful if Forbes published something skeptical of bitcoin that was based on sound analysis and data rather than hunches and fear. Bitcoin isn’t magiccoin. True believers in it are just as annoying as auto-disbelievers, like Forbey. Hope I helped you, little fry guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:28:16
So it is perhaps not accurate to describe Bitcoin as operating like a “public ledger” (where you would have info re: transacting parties). 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:14:10
Notice those little numbers climbing back again today my fry guy?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:21:51
Your conspiratorial post was removed, redditor for two minutes. You’re adorable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:40
Because baby boys are acting in the range of the moment...they can barely see beyond their noses. We still see 74% gain in value in the last month. Incredible. And we see 1,448% gain in 2017. Amazing. But baby boys can't look past their nose and run away with weak hands while I buy up their assets. What an incredible Christmas for me!

I’m buying!  This is great!

Just keep practicing little fry guy. I’m in happy buy mode!
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:04:53
You’re a fry guy!  You don’t understand much, but pretend to, and are covered in salt and oil. Gross!

They’ll stop it the same way they stop other things. If you want less of something, tax it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:10:24
There is nothing to hate, baby boy. I am simply here to help you with mastering English, little guy. You will get there one day!  
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:56
This is how free markets work, baby boy. People voluntarily trade, up, down, and all around. Whee! Strap yourself in and get ready for the ride. Oh, and be nice to your mommy dearest.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:02:34
Because certain mathematical predictions suggest there are entirely larger gains to be had. If the predictions are wrong, I've only lost a tiny bit of money (bought Bitcoin four years back). If they are correct, life will be good. I don't peter out at 10%. I do buy more in predictable dips from baby boys who don't follow math or cold logic, but follow blind emotion and sell in the range of the moment. Have to look beyond your nose.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:14:43
You do understand how random distributions actually work, right?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:35:18
I don’t have a crystal ball. When people are sufficiently fed up with being treated like children or slaves, they will resist authority. Until then, they will behave like well taken care of slaves.

"We're with the federal government and we're here to help." Call the IRS; what advice!
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:54:29
Would love to see your theory based on equities. Do share.

Same baby boy who predicted Bitcoin was dead two days ago. What a moronic fry guy.

So very difficult to stop those dips with momentum downward.
OOPS, not.

Sounds like you’re a behind-the-times, slow guy. That year was 2012. Move on Slow Boy.

You almost translated it to English!  
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:10:29
Keep practicing, little fry guy. You'll get there one day!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:21
You're adorable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:55
And here it is building back again, nice and steady little guy. Don't be so scared. This kind of stuff is normal. You'll learn in time!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:56:44
The whole point is to use bitcoin freely as you see fit, little fry guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:32:55
You don’t understand aggressive investing very well, little fry guy. Keep trying. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:28:09
Thank.

Remind me one month.

You come of feed millions, too, OP. Get out there, invent a great new agricultural technique, or invent a herbicide, or earn millions while the world laughs at you, then give it all away. Life waits for you every day. Go make something of yourself.

It’s almost like bank accounts are important things in life. Maybe artists shouldn’t be involved in investing?

What’s “Bitcoin Core”?  I’ve only heard of Bitcoin little fry guy. Just keep learning on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:55:47
Advice: “Juat sayin” adds nothing to your post. It does detract from your post since it illustrates a diminished intelligence. Of course you are “just sayin.”  That is self-evident. No one else is speaking on your behalf. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:25:38
Precisely my point. “Safe” should earn you a C-  potential for explosive growth should earn you something better than a C-.  Silly Forbes. How adorable. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:30:20
Pretty clear why a post from a redditor for two minutes with unsubstantiated conspiracy theories would be removed. You’re an adorable little fry guy.

Someone learned how to use MS Paint.

No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Call your accountant, decide your tax avoidance strategy, then proceed. The IRS exists to be a parasite. Why engage it?

Little fry guy’s only objection he relies on in every comment is “irrelevant.”  He’s just a baby boy trying to learn on it. He’ll get there one day!  He has to get over being a little parrot first!

That’s okay if you have zero trading experience, little fry guy. We all have to learn and I am happy to help you. Keep practicing little guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:11
Bitcoin—stuff humans value like shiny gold or sparkling diamonds. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:32:28
Roger that. But Forbes is a sophisticated player. Really odd that they haven’t done more of a deep dive here to at least try to understand the value of the technology and its potential increase or decrease. Instead we got a shrug of the shoulders and a C-  
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:41:50
Nobody blames you, little fry guy. You keep practicing and you’ll learn on it. You’re up against a bitcoiner for six years and redittor for one year. Ruh roh little fry guy. Just keep practicing. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:29:59
That’s because you’re a baby boy, little fry guy. Try reading it over again, practice your English, and try again little guy! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:25:12
