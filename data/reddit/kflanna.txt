If you don't "realize" (cash out) your gains I thought it wasn't taxable? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:54:25
But even with stocks I thought if you didn't cash out your funds I didn't think they were taxable

Yes you would see your portfolio value right away. It is your wallet but it also tells you how much it’s worth in $usd

Anytime!

So more short term for this kinda thing

I would create a bittrex instead of a mobile app. People sell it because they wanna get their profit before it goes down again

Yeah man that’s why I invest in crypto I love the adrenaline rushes and shit basic stocks are just too boring �� someday when I’m older and have money to invest in stocks and stuff like that I will I am only 18 as of a month ago and don’t even have money to put into stocks 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:58:50
I’m just curious why do you need all those computers to invest? I invest and don’t even have anything like that I just chose some coins I really like and hope they go up
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:23:28
Coinbase if you’re just holding bitcoin other wise I use bittrex and binance

We always want what we can’t have. /: 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:50:36
Digibyte because it’s faster and cheaper I don’t even invest in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:56:05
Oh I thought you meant other coins! Have you ever looked into stock options? Those are super cool and high risk high reward. But it all depends on your goals and how much you want to risk. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:26:21
I don’t see why not
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:30:21
Hell yeah brother. We are gonna be the ones laughing at the bank while they’re struggling to pay off their loans 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:05:35
And I’ll feel superior ��
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:43:47
I love this . ���� i wish my homies were into bitcoin. Hey when it moons they can’t say I didn’t try to help. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 19:24:02
Yo someone please put this into words for a dumb person 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:51:48

@_date: 2019-01-17 13:43:07
You sound dumb. You’re obviously uneducated 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:11:15
What is an open position! 
@_date: 2019-01-18 02:00:59
Guess I’ll be the one laughing in the end when it becomes mainstream and you’re sitting there wishing you would have invested 
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:41:58
I as well have never heard an elder like the idea of bitcoin. Commenting to come back and see what everyone else thinks.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:01:15
Those guys who did that must be celebrating pretty hard
