Yes, I have done all these things with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin must now have a hangover from partying so hard. (such a maverick) I have never seen it rise so quickly and then fall again.

That is not how it works. The people who mine bitcoin don't actually interact with the block chain. They hookup a specialized computer (ASIC miner) to power and internet, provide adequate cooling for the electronics and hook it up to a mining pool which pools the resources to process the transactions. The people mining are not on their computer all day writing code and doing computation. I run mine in my basement. I just have it hooked up running 24/7. I login every now and then to check temps and hash power and let it operate as designed. The reason why the fees are so high is because of the amount of transactions being processed. The blocks are only 1mb each which limits the transactions. The fees you pay are basically a bid to have your transaction processed next. Who ever bets the most gets their transactions completed quicker. The whole thing about Segwit and forks is so they can process more transactions by increasing the block size therefore lowering fees.

You're not being taxed on the bitcoin you have saved, you are getting taxed on what you spend. You could be a bitcoin millionaire on paper, but until you spend those millions the IRS cannot tax you on it. The IRS considers it a commodity not a currency so you pay capital gains instead of income tax. Its the same as buying stock in their eyes.

Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I think she was setting up her guest to explain to viewers what Bitcoin is, by asking a question a viewer with no experience with Bitcoin would ask. A good interviewer let's the guest do all the explaining if they are the supposed expert on a topic. I am more curious as to what the other guy said.

things are getting a little crazy on GDAX. 10k will be a distant memory soon. Or it could do what it usually does and tease a little and then fall down quickly only to rise to that level again in 1-3 days. You can almost predict it if you watch it long enough

Bitcoin Mining is back with a limited pre order. Mining start is 15.03.2018. No refunds available.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:35:53
It says on their website, no refunds. If that's their policy then good luck.

welcome to bitcoin. its best not to watch minute by minute. Just let it ride and hope for the best.

At the very top. Yellow warning box in the buy hash power page says very clearly.

When you make a bunch of money go on a bad ass vacation and don't invite her. Then she will probably get it.

I think you have the same luck I do. I tried trading on GDAX this weekend and didn't go that well. I even setup an auto trader (gekko) and it didn't help all that much. I think I will just stick to hodl and just ride the roller-coaster.

That is not really getting to the point of my question. BTC has no intrinsic value. The value that it is assigned is in relation to a currency like the USD or EUR. If those fiat currencies are no longer viable how would value be given? If there is suddenly a situation, like what is happening in Venezuela where their money is practically worthless, and lets say $100k USD 5 years from now has the same spending power as $10 today. Lets also assume that the value of BTC rises to $50K/BTC in that same amount of time, then the BTC will also be equally worthless because of its value tied to USD. The spending power of BTC has been dramatically reduced due to the inflation of the dollar.

I spend it on occasion. The only problem that will happen is if you are American you have to pay capital gains tax on every purchase since the US tax code recognizes it as a commodity and not a currency. I doubt they will change this in the near future but when they do I think there will be mass adoption and you will see a huge price surge and then level off.

Yep finding that out. It was disappointing.
