@_date: 2019-08-21 20:03:15
Yes it fucking would. You have no idea what you're talking about.
Try actually running a full node and say that. Go on, try it: Patch bitcoin core to 8mb blocks and run a testnet, making sure *every single block* is 8mb in size, because that's exactly what will happen.
The blocks are already too big. I have to store every dickhead's transaction since 2009. Every single fucking one, including yours, including every dumb satoshidice transaction, every noob on Coinbase sending themselves $10 for fun, everything... **forever**. The storage, bandwidth and processing requirements for this are already too high, but I put up with it because I must.
I've had split bitcoin core and my electrumx node into two hard drives so I could actually store this shit and have decent io speeds and throughput.
I can't run a listening node anymore; I can't stomach the bandwidth usage and my ISP gets pissy at me.
I bitcoin goes to 8mb blocks they will very quickly fill up as every transaction would be so cheap that every idiot in the world would stupid data on there, like pictures of cats or whatever else, **and I (and many, many others) wouldn't be able to run a node**. This isn't bcash; *people actually use this shit* and the instant you socialise the cost of this you can bet your ass it will **immediately** be filled up by every single freeloader thinking "wow, this is cool dude. I can store my social security number on here... Duuuude" and then we'll be right back here again, arguing over 16mb blocks because we fucked it up the first time.
So don't fucking tell me that it wouldn't hurt decentralisation. You have **absolutely no fucking clue** what you are taking about. Until you get a clue I strongly suggest you shut the fuck up.

An entry in a database. Hopefully backed with actual bitcoin, but probably isn't. Back to fractional reserve bullshit and the master/slave relationship that bitcoin is explicitly there to prevent.
If this is how you're buying bitcoin then you're doing it wrong.
If I cannot withdraw the "bitcoin" into a wallet to which I control the keys and is verifiable on the blockchain, then it isn't bitcoin at all and it's worth the grand sum of: fuck all.

The difference is that it's much much easier to extract the recovery seed than the competition. And that's important.
Do you rob the house with the double locks and the security system, or the one with a single lock and no security system?
I'm not making the claim that other hardware wallets are bulletproof. But $100 of equipment  to get the recovery phrase easily and reliably? No, that's not good enough. That's too easy. Passphrase or not.

Your understanding is extremely flawed and naive. None of what you wrote there is feasible or has any chance of happening, or even working as you described if these steps were taken.
Also your use of "force the population" and "exert some control" is a scarey and reeks of the exact issues which got Venezuela into this mess in the first place. History has taught is repeatedly that when you "force" a population to do something they don't want to, you're going to have a bad time. Your entire comment is just more of the same of what is killing that country. I'm borderline thinking you actually work for the government in some indirect capacity.
Bitcoin and Venezuela's socialist policies are not compatible. Bitcoin is about freedom, your comment is about forcing control of people and industry, and people will be able to ironically use bitcoin to circumvent that. To think otherwise is willful ignorance.
Once you free yourself from the thinking that Venezuela has been using for the past two decades, then you'll see the answers.
In the meantime I shall tag you as a socialist and not waste my time with you any further.

At which point it's not a 0-conf transaction. It's hit 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:46:39
No, that's the mempool, which holds unconfirmed transactions.
The mempool and the Blockchain are two separate things. There is plenty of resource on this: 
 Transactions can disappear from the mempool and never reach the Blockchain at all.
This did actually happen in 2017 and I actually had this happen to me. Luckily I was the one sending the funds so I just did another transaction from the same address with a higher fee and it eventually confirmed and invalided the original transaction. If I didn't do this, and assuming no other nodes retransmitted my original transaction then it would have absolutely been lost forever.
There is no consensus on the mempool. My mempool can look different from yours. Consensus is only reached when you actually hit the Blockchain, which is 1 confirmation.
The confirmation is the act of the transaction being recorded on the Blockchain. If you send your good/service before the first confirmation you risk not getting the money at all. The risk is variable depending on many factors.

For best comparability, Segwit (beginning with a 3) is best.
But I don't think it'll matter in the long term. bc1 (native Segwit) is best for fees when spending. It's significantly cheaper. More and more wallets and exchanges are supporting sending to them. I moved all my money here a while ago. An exchange I use doesn't support this, but I send to another wallet with a 3 address and immediately send it on to myself with the lowest possible fee. It sometimes takes days to get to me but I don't care as it's in a wallet where I own the keys, so nobody can steal it and I'm in no hurry.
Don't use 1 addresses (legacy). You gain nothing over using 3 addresses and it's the most expensive of the three.
In all cases. Spending from any of them is identical in terms of comparability. It's just more to least expensive from 1 to 3 to bc1.
Use bc1 if you can. 3 if you know your exchange doesn't support bc1 and it'll be a big hassle to have an intermediary wallet. Don't use 1.

@_date: 2019-08-30 05:06:15
Careful. Nothing you describe there is consensus. In fact it's just flat out wrong and is a bit of a "urban myth" of bitcoin. Transactions don't actually expire, there is no expiry date or anything on them.
It takes **one** node to have a larger mempool and hold on to transactions for a bit longer to retransmit them and then everything you said goes out of the window. It could be honest or it could be malicious, makes no difference: once you've transmitted a signed transaction then assume it's in the wild forever and anyone can transmit it again whenever they damn well please.
Use rbf and the problem goes away as you can just bump the fees if needed. take note...
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:03:47
Not really. Most of them batch these days. The big boys are transmitting every minute or so anyway and adding outputs doesn't add very much. It's the inputs which take up the majority of the space.

Good luck depositing 50k in cash without raising some serious alarm bells and spending six months talking to police and being on a watchlist. And checking those serial numbers is impractical.
And if the money isn't cash, the transaction might be reversed if something was illegitimate about the source of the funds. This might happen weeks or months after the car is handed over.
Bitcoin is actually the safer option here. That and selling to a proper car dealership.

Look kids, this is what we call "a lie", from someone with "an agenda".
Anybody can verify this. Feel free to use a block explorer of your choice, or preferably your own node. 
[Block 505225]( was mined which was over 2mb and was mined in 2018 and is the first block over 2mb in size that I'm aware of. We've had **a lot** of blocks bigger than 2mb since then, and they will be over that size again in the future.
To say they are "1.2mb at most" is factually wrong and easily verified to be false and the purpose of spreading such bullshit is nothing more than to spread FUD. According to the website used by the parent commenter the blocks have never even been full.
Why spread FUD? Well, only the parent commenter can answer that.

Doesn't matter. There's no way to fix it. That's what matters. If it was just a firmware update to sort it then fine, that's absolutely fine. But this is literally unfixable. The product's worth is dramatically less now.


So far. That will absolutely change. And it's perfectly possible that we'll hear about it by someone losing their life savings instead of any kind of future responsible disclosure.
And this isn't even the first time a critical bug like this has happened to trezor:  but at least that was fixable with new firmware, so I'll give them a pass there.
They should not continue to sell the trezor until a hardware fix has been put into place. Any existing customers should be offered a refund. Selling something as "secure" with this massive security hole is malicious at this point. This isn't a game. People's livelihoods are at stake.
So you have a choice of ledger, which has a inferior form factor but better security, a trezor which looks nice and has "good vibes" from being open source but can be stolen and cracked (possibly very quickly and replaced without you even noticing it was gone), keepkey, but that's lining Erik's corrupt pockets, no thanks.
I do actually massively prefer the trezor's "look and feel". But when my net worth is on the line, that doesn't count for much.

If they mined by themselves, then yes. If they did it as a group (a "pool") then it would be shared anoungst them all.
Don't forget the transaction fees as well. Unless they chose to mine a block with no transactions (or only chose free ones for some reason) then they also contribute to the total reward for mining that block.

Venezuela can't use bitcoin like that because it's actual money. They would have to actually own and use it properly as they can't inflate the supply to pay for things. They would actually have to live within their means. And their means isn't very much right now.
Venezuela needs major reform to its policies around money as well, which won't happen under the current regime. Switching to bitcoin won't fix that.

Only if there was something that broke the rules on the core protocol. Something that allowed instamining of blocks or broke the 21 million coin limit or something like that. Even then bitcoin would lose a lot of face, and a lot of value. And yes, I'm aware this happened once in the very early days. That's *just about* forgivable. Just.
Ethereum was working just fine, exactly as described: code is law. Someone uploaded a dodgy contract. That's it. "important" people lost a bunch of money because they half assed a contract and so a hardfork happened. That's not okay. That should never be okay. Ever.
If I lost $200 on a shitty contract I screwed up, nobody bats an eyelid, but maybe that's a lot of money to me. Tough shit, I'm not important enough. This is the exact system we are trying to get away from: where the important people have the privilege to do whatever they want and fuck you if you're one of the little people and want to be treated fairly.
Now it's happened once, Ethereum has shown it will happy hardfork whenever it needs to. Once you "break the seal" so to speak, there is no going back. They've proved they are willing and able. It's just about applying the right pressure to the right people.
Remember when binance was hacked? Remember how we **didn't** hard fork and the miners **didn't** attack the network to reverse the transactions (although I suspect only because they were unable to)? That's immutability, that's decentralisation at work and that's what we should strive for.

If they were "non standard" (whatever that is supposed to mean) transactions they would be rejected by the network. That's kinda the point.
The blocks are part of the Blockchain; there is nothing "artificial" (again, whatever the fuck that means) about them. You can verify all of this yourself, but you don't need to as thousands of nodes have done that work for you.
So that's both "points" shot down by the existence of the Blockchain which proves my point for me.
You said the blocks are not bigger than 1.2mb. I have unequivocally proven you wrong and you've offered exactly zero evidence to the contrary.

Check out this transaction that was just mined:

No no no. There is no "14 days" anything. Get that out of your head. **There is no expiry**. The only way you can expire anything is if you rbf the transaction or double spend it somehow, therefore invaliding the first transaction. Otherwise it could technically take years to confirm if needed.


It takes **one** node for this to happen. One node could have an obscene 2gb mempool or something. Other nodes lose the transaction, but this node would keep it and rebroadcast it later on. OP doesn't have to be running that node, *anyone* could be running that node. It doesn't matter. Once the signed transaction is "out there" it's game over.
If you don't know this, then that's fine, this isn't exactly day 1 learning. But please educate yourself before spreading misinformation. There is no 48, hour or 2 week *anything*. Once it's sent, it will confirm eventually unless the sender does something to prevent that.

That setting only is for that specific node. Setting it on your node and hoping that someone else doesn't retransmit it is just pointless and foolish.
Your advice about it magically disappearing in 48 hours from "the mempool" (to which there is no consensus) is flat out wrong, misleading, and potentially damaging.
You should have only advised to wait for it to confirm, use rbf or cpfp, or investigate ways to double spend attack it to himself and then try the whole process again. No science needed.
OP might have waited 48 hours, see no confirmation, assume everything was fine and then send the money again, resulting in recipient getting the money twice. And that's why your advice was wrong.

What if X government attacks it? What's the bus number? It's pretty high in Bitcoin even satoshi himself left the project and look at it now. What happens when 2 or 3 people get thrown in jail or disappeared?
What happens if some asshole millionaire decides to outcompete the miners and mine nothing but empty blocks, or worse reverse transactions?
Basically I'm asking how attack resistant it is. Ideas and community are one thing, but what if it catches the eye of a government or rich people and gets actively attacked? Bitcoin is, as far as I can tell, fairly resistant to this.
Also, POS leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Feels a bit Ponzi like. Also it means the rich/early people get to dictate the direction the coin takes, which can be dangerous.

I have no problem with loans existing, and there will always be a need for them.
However, there should actually be a risk involved and the loaned money should come from somewhere.
Currently they magic money out of thin air every time a loan is created. I would prefer how the P2P lending industry does it: people pay in money they know is being loaned out, and if it doesn't get paid back, that's it, you lose out. Things like provision funds (with an expected lower % return) is a good way of smoothing out the bumps from non-payers. Whilst it's still fiat based, the industry feels much more "honest" than banking.

Let's not kid ourselves.
They don't give a flying fuck about fair in any case.
They don't care if it's fair if new money is created out of thin air and they certainly don't care if Johnny public gets a "fair" cut.
They didn't care if it was fair to steal money from Greek depositors and pension holders during the crisis to prop up non-greek banks. Something they had nothing to do with, but everyone has to bail out the banks.
"Live 50% less please, ma'am". Fuck them and don't believe their lies.

This is completely false. Please stop spreading this misinformation. If you don't know, that's absolutely fine, but please don't just make stuff up like this. It's not helping. Most people say it's two weeks, but that's also wrong.
I've had transactions confirm recently (roughly 2 months ago) after 3 or 4 days. During the spam attack of a couple of years ago, I had some transactions take *several weeks* to confirm (yes, I was being cheap, but it was money to and from myself, so whatever)
It only takes one node to retransmit a transaction and it's visible to others, in their mempools. There no "expiry date" on these things. Nlocktime gives you a minimum block number for a transaction to be mined and appear on the Blockchain, but there isn't an expiration date or anything.

There plenty of incentive, look further. I've had my transactions rebroadcast before after my node forgot about them. "Look guys! Bitcoin is crap! Use $ or my shitcoin instead!" is the motivation, and it's free! Always assume we're under attack.
Some nodes might just be running a large mempool completely innocently and they just retransmit stuff when things get quieter. It only takes one node.


Good, saved any damage your terrible advice would've done


Lol wut? That's making a whole bunch of assumptions. Like assuming the transaction even disappeared from the ledger client. OP may well see it at 48 hours old, make an incorrect assumption, send the money again anyway.
Transaction 1: send from A to B, change to C
Transaction 2a: send from C to D, change to E.
Or ...
Transaction 2b: send from F to G, change to H
Transaction 1 then gets retransmitted (or just confirmed thanks to the cpfp behaviour in 2a). Shit. Hell, even a malicious miner could slip it in just to fuck with people (not aware of that actually happening, but who knows).
Your advice was bad, especially to a newbie. Never, ever ever **ever** assume that a transaction will disappear, even if your client cannot see it anymore. Wait, rbf, or cpfp. 
In extreme cases maybe send 100% of your funds to yourself if the transaction disappeared from most explorers, with a high fee just to be sure it hits the next block and deal with privacy later.
Your advice of "leaving it for 48 hours" was flat out wrong and dangerous, even if the money was going back to the sender anyway (next time dangerous assumptions will be made), and you should never give such advice out again.
I understand you had good intentions, but you didn't think it through and didn't consider what could've happened. This could've been a disaster.

Oh look, an idiot. Let's put this in language you can understand with a good old fashioned car analogy:


So you wanna drive around in a car built in 1890? Four years is plenty of time to sort out the kinks, right? No?
This is **replacement for fiat money, humanity has never done anything quite like this before**. This isn't a video game or some fucking toy. This is difficult, progress is slow, people's livelihoods and freedom are on the line. Everything that gets done has to be done very carefully and under the assumption that we are always under attack. Slow, steady, frustratingly slow sometimes. That's how it works, and that's how it should work.
We have **decades** of development time ahead of us yet.
Otherwise we have shitcoins like Ethereum where they hard fork due to a dodgy "smart" contract and the "wrong people" losing money.
So yes, it's still fucking early. And you trying to mock this technology simply proves you don't understand the fundamentals.
Everything (including Bitcoin itself and crypto currency in general) is still extremely early, and you need to understand that otherwise you're missing a major part of all of this.

Socialism requires a centrally planned economy with price fixing and constant government interference in the free market. Even though history has repeatedly told us this system doesn't work, gullible people think it somehow will be different this time. They are wrong.
Bitcoin is the escape from government tyranny. Be it the corrupt banking system we currently endure, or socialist price meddling, it's all the same: Bitcoin stands for freedom and will not capitulate to what others want. 
This is not compatible with socialism. No way, no how.

Piece of mind. It's nice to have a backup.
I have two ledgers. One I use, and a backup. Funnily enough just yesterday I got a error message on my main device telling me to follow recovery procedures or something. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was fine, so hopefully just a one off and a slightly broken connection to the pc. But maybe it's dying, I don't know. I use it a lot so it's possibly just wearing out now.
And yes, of course I have my seed words backed up, *of course I do*.
It's just nice to be able to say "ah shit I guess that's $60 I'm spending on a new device now" and switch to the backup in the meantime instead of having to fuck about with restoring seed words and being nervous about my cold wallet suddenly being hot, or waiting for a new device to turn up etc.
It's nice to have there, ready and waiting, that's all.
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:09:53
I thought I was clear but maybe not. 2mb blocks every 30 seconds is equivalent to Bitcoin having 40 megabyte blocks. That's more than even bcash. If anything its actually slightly worse than just 40mb blocks as you have the other block information to consider. I can't store that much (1.7tb per year), I can't keep up with the bandwidth requirements of that. And I know I'm assuming full blocks, which is exactly what I should assume.
I never claimed to be an expert, nor am I interested in giving a blow by blow account of every tiny facet of the coin. But I did thoroughly look at what they do and claim to achieve. I'm not at all impressed. It's just Bitcoin with stupid block times, POS, some other tweaks here and there and some pretty software. There nothing here that I care about. This isn't like Ethereum or Monero which actually do something unique. Seen plenty of coins follow this exact formula to this in the past and fall to pieces.
You've managed to remain civil up to this point. I asked. You answered. I gave my assessment and reasons for not running and using it and it being yet another shitcoin (in case you cared). Don't start to get aggressive and confrontational. If you're going to put your opinion out there then you should be emotionally ready for a response.

Whatever your friend put in is already lost. Report to the police (lol, they won't understand it let along do anything with it) and take the life lesson. Don't give *any* more, they know you're on to them and are hoping your friend will be dumb enough to make one last payment to "return the funds". Then it will be loads of excuses, issues, delays. The money will never come.

So I had a look. Nothing too interesting compared to bitcoin to be honest. None of the "extra" features are worth it.
Looked at the blocksize. 2mb. Okay, that's doable. Segwit enabled. Okay, they are taking lightning seriously. 30 second block time. **whaaaaat?**.
Nope. I can't run a node. The requirements are too high.
Supposedly 1120 transactions a second. Uh huh. I'd love to see how that actually works if the network ever actually gets busy. It'll be chaos.
The base layer needs to be slow. Work in lock step. One moves forward, we all move forward at the same time. This doesn't happen if you scream along at a block every 30 seconds.
It's not evil (such as "bcash is Bitcoin!" bullshit from bcash) but it's just another shitcoin which solves no problems, with poor security, silly features, and no real future in my opinion. It's just change for the sake of change and their efforts would be better spend building cool things on Bitcoin, not reinventing the wheel.
Thanks for sharing, but it's a hard no from me.

Litecoin offers nothing of value over bitcoin. It's just Bitcoin with some parameters changed. And less hashrate.
XRP is not a cryptocurrency. It is centrally controlled and they have a history of reversing transactions. It's no better than fiat. 
Monero, maybe. I like what they do with privacy and I somewhat like FluffyPony's take on things. I'm on the fence with that one.
Dash. Lol nope. Borderline Ponzi and the "instant transactions" will go out of the window pretty fucking quickly if they get even remotely busy or the blocks actually start filling up.
Vert. Just Litecoin except a supposedly ASIC resistant algorithm (hint: it's not ASIC resistant at all) and much, much lower security, especially with all those GPUs out there from the altcoin mining gold rush of yesteryear.

Was it that the blockspace on bcash is so worthless that miners have no incentive to bother to include them so literally leave money on the table?
Or was it aliens under the control of gay water drinking frogs that have infiltrated the mining facilities and maliciously set the config files to only mine blocks of 1mb or less?

Your transaction has a roughly a 1sat/byte fee. The network is busy right now and needs more than that to get into the next block.
The fee was low, so higher fees get in before you. It looks like things are calming down. You gotta hurry up and wait and it'll go through. I suspect it'll be confirmed in the next hour or two. Unless a huge amount of transactions go through again.

No, you used the word "empty", not "low". If you're going to argue about it at least quote yourself correctly. Those are two different things.
And it's fairly busy for a 1 sat/byte transaction to go through, which would require "pretty empty". It's nowhere near late 2017 levels, so in that context it's very low, but in **recent** context (last couple of months) and the context of "1 sat/byte transactions gets me in the next block" it's *relatively busy* compared to normal.

No, that's not how it works. At least, not if the system is honest. $20 of labour is worth $20 and should always be worth $20. Anything less is fucking theft.

None of the three affected implementations used C++.
And given all three use different programming languages, you've done an excellent job of proving you have no idea what you're talking about.
Well done.
