First of all get rid of blockchain. They are the worst possible wallet available. I lost a fucking ton of coins to their shitty wallet. They're not to blame for the stick transaction, but still. Get a trezor immediately direct from trezor. 
What you're describing is a double spend. It won't work in short. No node will accept a double spend unless you already flagged the tx as RBF which blockchain.info doesn't support. 
As for how to fix the transaction, it should be easy:
0.005btc came back to your own wallet as a change output for the transaction. It's in the address above. That address is somewhere inside your wallet. If you send it back to yourself with a really good fee a miner will see in and want to include it in a block but in order to do so he has to confirm the previous one too. Since he can't confirm one without the other. 
Look inside your wallet and see if there's a way to send specifically from that address only. It might require freezing the other addresses. Play around carefullly but ideally you want to send that unconfirmed 0.005btc in the address above back to yourself with a really good fee. 
If that's too complicated you could send the whole balance of your blockchain wallet back to yourself. However this is a waste of money, since you're going to send every input inside your wallet and that makes the transaction bigger and therefore more expensive to send. 
Try and isolate the address above and send just the 0.005 back to yourself again. 
Use this site to estimate the fee you should include and take your time.

Transfer btc to localbitcoins. Pick a seller with 100% feedback on more than 500 trades, and an account older than 1-2 years and you will have no issues. There's escrow protection on bank transfer so you can't get scammed. You will probably only ended up paying a 1% fee compared to market rate. Easy.

Provided it's not more than 10k then use localbitcoins. Payment will be instant, and the risk of a chargeback is virtually zero if you pick a buyer with more than 500 trades 100% feedback and over 2 years old account. You will get an effective rate of around -1% most likely too.

The only thing you have going is your social media presence, where sub par intellects can feel good mixing with other sub par intellects at how 'smart' they are for thwarting an attack on Bitcoin by a company that has no commit access to the bitcoin repo and just one developer in the top 5 of a project with hundreds and hundreds of contributors.

Those are 'user friendly' exchanges. I.e. For noobs. Doesn't even mention being stable. As for Coinbase being on there, that is one of the least stable exchanges out there, if you would even call it an exchange. There's only one stable trustworthy exchange out there in my opinion and it's Bitstamp. Those guys are so good they make the rest look like amateurs.

Send it to localbitcoins. Tons of traders there that will buy it from you for PayPal. Pick only a trader with over 500 transaction and an account older than 2 years with 100% good feedback to make sure you don't get charged back.

Bcash is a good market to trade. It's users are so stupid they still don't understand what dog shit bcash is. Always rebuy your coins, but sell on every pump. I've taken upwards of 20btc in profit from these fools over about 6 trades (2 way, sell, then buy back).

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:10:42
Typically they lock you out for a period if you lose 2fa access. Or so they should. In that time they should email you to say a 2fa removal request has been made, or if you log in it should warn you or cancel the 2fa withdrawal request. Some sites are designed by idiots though, so they haven't necessarily implemented it in a secure way. G2FA is a great app though.

There is a CONSTANT stream of people selling bitcoins on LB. When you create a brand new advert on localbitcoins even if you're offering the highest price it won't put your advert at the top until your advert gets some bitcoin put through it. So once you get your first few initial trades from your advert it should appear at the top of the list. In my country the best price for selling btc is around 0% or just below. As long as you have some feedback and sound professional then you will get sales. Maybe it's the lack of reputation/feedback or maybe it's because your advert isn't at the top, but there's a constant flow of people selling coins I assure you. I've done this for 5 plus years now. Obviously you're at the mercy of the timing of when someone comes along to sell, but it's the cheapest entry into the market. If you have some btc you HODL long term you can leave them in exchange (I recommend Bitstamp) and as you buy x amount on LB you instantly sell x amount on Bitstamp to instantly hedge your position. Hope that's useful.

In countries like the uk, sending coins to any serious exchange involved a SEPA or wire transfer which stake days to weeks to arrive. Our domestic uk to uk bank transfers are instant. This has created a thriving secondary market that usually trades at a high premium over the price (6%). People are happy to pay this for the convenience of almost instant coins. 
This is all because uk banks will under no circumstances accept bitcoin businesses as customers.

I like how bcash supporters are so gullible they support a coin run by a guy who lied about being Satoshi (Craig), a guy who has zero credibility and is mentally unstable (Roger), and a guy who wants child pornography legalised (falkvinge).

Were you sending 0.24 or 0.005? How much is remaining in your wallet? 
Basically it looks like you have a change output going back to your own wallet. This change output will be unconfirmed too. I suggest you use child pays for parent to send this unconfirmed change back to yourself. If you do this with enough fee it will confirm both transactions at the same time. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:14:53
You need to read the whitepaper or do some research on how bitcoin works. The value being sent (1 bitcoin or 1 million bitcoin) makes no difference on how long a transaction takes or how it's prioritised. 
When you submit a transaction you are bidding for a space in a block based upon the fee you attach relative to the size in bytes of the transaction. The size in bytes has noting to do with how much bitcoin is being sent. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:50:20
They will both conform in the same block. One cannot confirm without the other being confirmed at the same time. A miner will look at both transactions and average out the fee to decide if he wants to pick it up. Assuming both transactions are the same size this averages to about 122 sat/b for both which if you check  is probably going to take quite a while to confirm. If it's not urgent I suggest you wait at least a week to see if it gets picked up. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:15:00
It's literally not possible. Anyone with coin to sell on the second market knows they could go on localbitcoins and sell at +4% which creates a floor. The only way to get cheaper is to offer a service buying bitcoin. I.e. Create a buy advert on localbitcoins offering to buy people's bitcoin at -1%. After LB fees this will be 0%. This is the cheapest way to acquire coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:24:20
A place like GDAX will have software that detects altered images and dates. Often the date of expiry is baked into a long serial number on the passport so even without a connection to the central database they would know something was up. Plus again there's companies they subcontract to spot all this in documents. I definitely do not advise this. Guaranteed they will catch you and block your account, AND seize your money on the exchange pending possible police enquiry.

@_date: 2018-01-14 10:39:49
So that's 100 change addresses already pre generated? So the wallet wouldn't need to have been backed up after the last transaction? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:06:10
OR, maybe you just have no idea what you're talking about? Ever consider that? Bitcoin is evolving slowiy and carefully. We don't have some amateur developers like bcash behind the wheel. We have people who understand you make irreversible changes slowly and carefully.

Since when you create a brand new advert it appears way down the list you can actually cheat to get it up too quickly. Just create a second Lb account and 'sell' btc to yourself. You obviously lose 1% to LB fees but to speed things up it works a treat. 
LB advert visibility/ranking essentially depends partly on volume through the advert. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:00:03
There is no escrow on cash in person trades on localbitcoins. There is escrow on cash deposit in bank trades though. You will not be able to get coins at even close market rate, if they're offering this then it's clearly a scam. Nobody would sell you coins at market rate when they can easily sell them above. 
Trasndferring bitcoin to localbitcoins would take on average 30 mins provided they send the coins with enough of a fee. Since they need three confirms and on average a confirm takes ten mins provided they set a high enough fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:06:54
In the event it never confirms all btc is returned to the sender including fees. It's like it never happened. This should be two weeks but in short it can take MUCH MUCH longer. (Reaseach child pays for parent as a solution to stuck transactions). Bitcoin can never be lost anyway. It either gets sent eventually or returns to your wallet. Maybe even research replace-by-fee if you plan on sending low fee transactions so that you can up the fee at a later point if it confirms. 
Yes you can turn off your computer. Once sent your unconfirmed transaction is stored in the networks memorypool. (Unless it eventually falls out and cancel ofcourse).

To send money to Bitstamp you need to make a sepa transfer or a wire transfer which take a coupe of days plus, whereas on LB you can buy for uk faster payments where it's instant. 
Most uk banks don't look favourably at people sending and receiving from their bank so when they see a payment to or from a recongnisable company like Bitstamp they are bound to taken notice. They don't usually close your account immediately buy they might demand you stop. On localbitcoins it's just random people you buy from so they have no idea you're buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:17:37
Bitcoin is working exactly as it's meant to. I'm not sure you understand. Read the code, it's working flawlessly as the code describes. You're brining politics into it. If you want a centralised coin that nobody uses because the devs behind it are jokers you can use BCH. If you want a coin that won't surrender an inch of decentralisation then use btc.

No it wouldn't be compromised. However with the combination of the xpub and one private key, YES, it would be compromised. 
I would avoid this scenario entirely if I was you. If you have some reason to want to share one private key from your ledger, do it from inside a passphrase protected subwallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:44:58
I don't think it's strange or unprecedented at all that after the price rose to 19k that it then dipped. This is exactly what has happened before and will happened again and again. People taking profits. If 1million bitcoins need to be taken out of the market that's going to take a while. That's probably around $18billion. People need to realise profits eventually. It's not manipulation, it's natural. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:56:06
No problem at all. Yea, be very wary if it looks too good to be true. Nobody is going to sell coins cheap. Mycelium trader is nowhere near as popular as Lb anyway so it's full of adverts that are totally out of date sometimes. On localbitcoins, as well as looking for cash trades (in person) you can also search for cash deposit trades where you go and put the money into the traders bank account. The trade has escrow protection in this instance. 
-raise a trade for 2000usd
-2000usd of coins get frozen in traders account 
-you deposit cash in his account in the bank
-trader sees deposit and tells Lb to release the coins to you
With escrow if he lies and says he didn't get the money or refuses to release for any reason you show the deposit receipt from the bank proving you paid and support will release the coins. This is very rare but just means you're protected. Compare the prices against cash in person trades and see what's best. Good luck. If you don't have a trezor or a ledger already then buy one. It's $60-$100 well spent.

Probably one. I'm hoping my exchange (Bitstamp) will become a hub and I can either a) open a channel with them that will be connected with anyone I want to transact with via other channels, or b) I will be able to load a channel for free using btc I hold on Bitstamp. It's really not rocket science. 
You fund a channel with however much you like. Probably just spending money for low value purchases you want to make instantly with no confirms for virtually no cost. Why would I want to pay $0.01 on a $0.05 purchase? It's a checking account vs a savings account. If you keep btc on an exchange (like most people do who plan to trade if the market moves) then this is only the same. LN channels will be as or more secure than an exchange. 
Wallets will deal with the user experience. I don't understands https vs http. Or smtp, but I still use it without issue. 
Bitcoincash is going to explore onchain scaling (if it can ever fill 8mb blocks), and we're going to scale offchain exponentially with all the users we have and see how that goes. Best of luck!

To clarify, as long as the words were displayed one at a time on the trezors screen then you are safe. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:59:21
When you buy a trezor you should have generated the 24 word seed yourself. The trezor displays each word one at a time for you to write down. 
If this is not the case and you already had a seed then I would immediately send the coins somewhere safe while you erase the trezor and start again by wiping the device.

In an ideal world I would also revive the coins into an address you control the keys for, just incase he send a low transaction fee. If you revive the coins to an exchange for example and he accidentally sets the fee too low it would be very awkward sitting around for hours waiting for a confirm. At least if you control the keys like in mycelium, trezor,or electrum, you could just use CPFP to send back unto yourself with an appropriate fee to make it conform. If you have any more questions just ask. I did this for 5+ years and I only got stabbed once, and choked unconscious once, so it's pretty safe.

It's possible that it never confirms. Use  to best estimate what fee you should include. There are 177k transactions waiting right now. You don't have to outbid them all, you can bid somewhere near the top and just wait however long. 
Stuck transactions can be sped up with techniques like child pays for parent if it applies, research that too.

Bitcoin works on really big numbers. 
There's about 2000 words a seed can be made from. So that's roughly 2000^12 That's a REALLY Big number, bigger than humans can comprehend. Nobody should ever generate the same wallet (12 seed words).

Why would anyone use an exchange that reduced this flexibility? Who would impose this on all exchanges? Why would a person want to be put in a position of not being able to react quickly to changing conditions?

LB specifically state they cannot act as an arbiter in face to face trades. They also specifically allow trades to take place outside the trasaction system, since you would be paying a 1% fee simply for the release mechanism, which is totally free if you simply send from one LB wallet to another anyway. Support would not be able to offer any meaningful escrow on a cash trade so any trader who knows what he's doing would never enable it. No trader would even use the transaction system to raise an order then release it either (except in extreme fringe cases released to text release codes). I say this after making a living doing this as my full time job for the last 5 years until I retired at Christmas.

Bcash is 70% these 3 people. Why you think people like Roger and Craig can decree that blocksize will increase once blocks are full. Bcash is a joke and people that think it's the real bitcoin have no idea how it works. Occasionally you get someone credible come along like gavin Andersen, but let's be honest he's salty because he ruined his own reputation claiming crainwas satoshi. Let's not forget Mcaffee either.

If they have good reputation going back over 1 year you should be pretty safe. Immediately ignore anyone selling for under market rate. Most likely they just haven't updated their price, it's coins from illegal activity, or it's a scam. 
Meet somewhere public. Don't worry about counting cash in the open, the fact you're doing it in the open suggests what you're doing is notillegal. Bring a cars ownership document and leave it on the table if you don't want to arouse suspicion, but don't let the trader see your address obviously. 
There's no escrow protection on localbitcoins for cash trades (I assume that's the platform you're using). So they may want to just send you the coins directly to an address you control. This is normal, but I prefer if traders have the coins already in localbitcoins. This is because if they already have the coins in LB you can just give them your own deposit address from localbitcoins and when they hit send the coins are instantly in your LB account. This means you don't have to wait around for one confirmation since LB just transfer the balances instantly between you. If they want to send directly to a wallet from a wallet outside LB this is still normal but make sure you wait for one conformation and tell the trader in advance that you need him to stick around till the transaction gets one confirm. Also remind him to set a custom high fee high enough so that you get included in the next block. This is potentially a negotiating point. Make sure he's happy to pay a high fee as a deal sweetener. Also specify you won't accept an RBF transaction (replace-by-fee). Take a friend for backup, but expect him to want to receive and count all cash before he sends, since he's the one with reputation and you're the stranger.

The THC oils as oppose to the CBD oils are the proper 'treatment'. It's so much more highly concentrated than in edibles.

I'll send you 0.01btc towards any treatment you see fit but start researching you type of cancer and THC oil to see whether it might be effective. Too many testimonials for it to be bullshit.

There is plenty enough literature on LN to allow you to understand exactly why it's decentralised. People run nodes for free for the good of the community, why not LN hubs? Places like exchanges will likely integrate the service with their platform so as to attract customers and ergo gains trading fees. I average $20k in fees per month to my favourite exchange, so attracting new customers can be extremely lucrative. Even if fees are just 0.01 cent, this is basically free money to them. It's also scalable way beyond on-chain scaling while being completely decentralised and censorship proof.

Whoever wrote this article has an exceptionally poor understanding of how bitcoin works.  
Miners very often start mining on a recieved block before even validating it. Typically this causes no problems, but in the event they accept an invalid block (like this example). It will be rejected by every full node on the network (another reason BCH supporters are so dumb saying we don't need nodes), and their chain will be ignored by anyone following the consensus rules. This is literally bitcoin 101. That website is terrible.

Yes, you have it correct. The price might be $20000, but there might only be a buy order for 0.5btc at $20000. So if you hit sell 100btc at $20000 it would match you with the 0.5btc buyer and they create a sell order for 99.5btc.

As for importing your seed, it's likely the seeds are compatible yes, however even once it's imported into electrum you will still have non Segwit coins sat in your wallet.

No. if you just swept one private key from your old seed that does nothing to the old seed. The seed is an infinitely long list of addresses that never changes. But once you sweep from that key to an address from a new wallet obviously you need back that one up too.

It's a little complicated to explain to noobs. I suggest you research the technology behind bitcoin. Then you should have an idea why what you said is so funny. BCH is popular with newcomers to crypto who can't understand the complexities. Almost all early adopters prefer bitcoin, miners prefer bitcoin by about 90%, users (node count and transaction count) prefer btc overwhelmingly, way more than 90%. 
Don't get caught out by all the sales people shilling BCH. They want your money to drive up the price of their coins. There will only ever be one bitcoin and it's not going to be some centralised shitcoins with two of the least credible people in bitcoin heading it (Roger Verr and Craig-"let's all forget I pretended I was Satoshi"-wright).

If you buy on LB and you click on someone's sell advert, you will pay a fee on top of the rate. If you create your own buy advertisement you can advertise that you're willing to buy someone's coins at say for example market rate or maybe even market rate minus 1 percent. If you don't have much feedback that may take a while but once you get your first couple of sales they will pour in. This is how most traders get their cheap coins. Decide what payment method you can offer, and then check what the highest rate anyone offers to BUY at for that payment method. Hope this helps.

Does it have the plausible deniability password that trezor has? 
@_date: 2017-02-11 09:09:56
Yes, that's the beautifully magical thing about HD wallets. If you back up the seed words when you first set up the device then no matter how many future addresses you generate on the device, they're all automatically backed up by the words you write down at the beginning. It would work on any trezor plus even some other online wallets so keep it safe. 
Correct, someone had your seed then they could restore it themselves and take your coins 
Getting ahead a little but trezor has and extra protection feature where you can hide your coins further called plausible deniability. Basically what this does is adds a password prompt whenever you access your trezor (on top of the pin). The trezor will accept ANY PASSWORD or no password at all and act as if you got the password correct, but it will show you a completely different wallet for each password. E.g. You can manage a wallet for each family member all on the one device. Entering the password "DaughteR1986Polly" would show you one wallet, and entering the password "Myp3r5onalCOINS6654" would show you a completely different wallet. Obviously unless you logged in and put coins in each wallet would be emtpy but this means under duress you can give the attacker either no password (takes you to the default wallet), or a password to some wallet with just a small amount in. This is totally genius. It also means you can be a little less paranoid about keeping your seed backed up in several places since they would also need your password to access your coins if they restored it as if you deposited your coins in the wallet opened with the password Myp3r5onalCOINS6654 then restoring with the 24 word seed and no password would look like your wallet was empty. Keep a little bit of coin in this password unprotected wallet as a canary in the coal one for if your seed gets compromised by someone or if you're ever held in duress and forced to reveal your seed. Hope that makes sense. 
Additional info; when it generates a wallet it just uses an absolutely huge random number. The seed works in the same way replacing numbers with words. There's a pool of 4000 words or so and picking 24 random words gives entropy (randomness) in the region of 4000x3999x3998x3997..............x3988x3987x3986 which is an insanely large number. Bitcoin is amazing and beautiful.

If you imported it into mycelium for example it would send the change to the same paper wallet again I believe*** but there are some ways of redeeming it that would spend whatever you didn't spend as a fee. So if you spent 0.1btv from a 1btc paper wallet it would send a 0.9btc miners fee I believe***
You buy two hardware wallets so you have one spare to recover your wallet using your seed in case the worst happens and you lost it or broke it.

Whoever owns the address you sent coins to, get them to resend the unconfirmed coins to themselves with a huge fee. In order to claim the huge fee on the second transaction the miner also has to confirm the preceding transaction. Hope this helps. It may confirm on its own depending on how much of a fee you included. Find out how many satoshis/byte the transaction was sent with. If it's over 50/60 it will probably eventually confirm. Worst case you get the coins back, so don't panic.

I don't think you understand the meaning of 1 bitcoin being a totally arbitrary number, it literally means nothing. Multiply everyone's holdings by ten or divide them by 100 and it would make zero difference. It's literally a totally arbitrary unit that has zero relation to an ounce of gold.

-As long as you don't hold large amounts of coins there at any time, buy anywhere and transfer immediately to your own wallet. LocalBitcoins is my favourite for the million payment options and because it's p2p.
-Fuck coinbase right in the ass.
-The paper wallet generators you refer to generate single keys that should only ever be used once. Sure there are ways of importing a key into a wallet with other keys but it's ludicrous to do today. Almost all wallets offer a 12-24 word seed that if you write that down on paper means you can never ever lose the bitcoin in that wallet no matter how many addresses you use. The only benefit to a single key paper wallet would be if you generated it offline (cold storage) which is almost pointless too if you use a hardware wallet like a trezor (has a 24 word back up seed you write down on paper)
-I've never used one before, but as for why it won't generate the same address twice (even when you're not connected to the internet), it's because the the pool of available private keys is just unfathomably large (although finite), and the chances of two people ever generating the same address randomly are less than winning the lottery every minute for a year or some crazy shit. It's never going to happen if the entropy used is correct. 
-No, just buy another trezor and input your 24 word seed. 
-Couldn't advise, trezor is such an amazing product there's just little need to do so in my opinion. Buy a trezor honestly, cannot recommend this enough although I'm sure the other hardware wallets are great too.

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding your question, but if you deposit 1btc on an exchange then you're already 'bought in'. To make extra bitcoin if the etf is approved you need to sell that bitcoin after the etf is approved when the price rises, then rebuy bitcoin when the price falls below the price you sold at. If we pretend there are zero fees to sell and buy just for the example, you deposit 1 Btc, price is $1200, etf gets approved, price rises to $2000, you sell your 1btc for $2000, you now have $2000 but zero bitcoin, you then hope the price falls. If it fell to $1500 you could spend your $2000 and buy 1.3333 bitcoin. However the price might keep rising to $3000, in which case if you tried to rebuy your bitcoin you would only be able to buy back 0.6666 bitcoin. Best advice if you don't know exactly what you're doing is to just HODL. So many people lose money or bitcoin trying to trade. 
If you're talking about leverage that's a whole different ball game in which you can effectively multiple your gains and losses by 3 times for example. Beware though, you can lose EVERYTHING if the price fell to $800, you would literally have zero bitcoin and zero dollars.

From my admittedly limited understanding; any safe increase at the moment isn't enough and risks a HF (something the core devs are trying to avoid), increasing it meaningfully to like 128mb for example would give a huge advantage to the biggest miners because of the costs in today's technology, which would increase centralisation further. Also the maliability issue rightly needs fixing first to enable second layer payments. I think they are looking at increasing the raw block size after (core devs insis Segwit IS a block size increase) as far as I know. It's not like Bitcoin is broken with a 1mb limit, it's just getting a bit expensive.

His point still stands. You expect people to deposit bitcoin to an address they can't back up? Basically this is for people trading small enough amounts they can afford to lose and pay $12 for some throwaway hardware. Seems like a pretty Limited use-case product to be honest, because although the system is probably pretty secure, nobody is ever going to take that for granted with any serious amount of bitcoin and the $12 fee is just outrageous for a tiny bit of bitcoin to go on. I'm ready to be proven wrong but I own 6 of the older model opendimes, I've traded for 5 years and I've never come across a reason to risk bitcoin on a device I have to trust won't break with my bitcoin in on it.

@_date: 2017-02-27 01:49:22
Yes. But you need to include a very large fee. If you spend those unconfirmed coins with a large enough fee, the only way a miner can collect the second transaction fee is to also confirm the first transaction at the same time, since it's impossible to get 1 confirm on the second tx before the first also has 1 confirm. Obviously the fee on the second needs to be big enough to also cover the first transaction too.

Absolutely. I recommend the Trezor and memorising the seed. It's 24 words but surprisingly easy if you break it down to 8x3 words. Also you can set an optional password whereby the seed alone doesn't give access to your coins, without the password it just shows another empty wallet. This means you can be a little less worried about someone finding the seed you've written down. It also means under duress you can provide the raw seed with say for example a small amount in, whilst your main stash is behind a password effectively invisible. Maybe ledger offer this also but I only have experience with trezor.

I know im over simplifying matters but we just got segwit thanks to S2X. This seems like a betrayal. The miners voted overwhelmingly for s2x. Is a doubling in capacity really SUCH an existential threat to bitcoin? Serious question. Can't there be some attempt at placating them such as scheduling it for 18 months? A sinificant amount of time for optimisation and a relatively short time considering how long we've been discussing scaling. I've come to terms with the fact that Core do know what's best for Bitcoin, I really have, but you don't just need to compromise more, you need to be seen to be compromising.

You can even look for someone who banks with the same bank. Unless you're the advertiser, LB charges no fees. Each seller offers a different rate, choose the best rate for you. LB acts as escrow holding the coins until you confirm you revived payment at which point you click release coins. Make sure to ask for feedback since having history on a site like LB is very useful.

If a miner wants to win the block reward, plus all the fees from the transactions he includes in that block, he has to compete with all the other miners on the network to solve an equation. The first person to solve this equation wins, they prove to the network that they solved the block and then everyone starts trying to solve the new equation for the next block. There's no way to solve the equation except by brute force, I.e everyone is just guessing random numbers, plugging it into the equation and seeing if it works. Each time a miner makes one guess this is one hash. The more miners mining the more hashrate there is. To make sure blocks average every ten minutes the network adjusts the difficulty of this equation every 2016 blocks. So if there is twice the amount of hashing going on, then after 2016 blocks the equation will get twice as hard to solve. This keeps an average of 1 block every ten minutes. If there was 1,000 hashes per second happening on the network or 1 trillion, the difficulty adjustment means there would always average one block per ten minutes once the difficulty adjustment kicks in. However the more hashes the network has, the more secure the network is against attack. As long as no miner controls in theory more than 51% of the mining power.

Specifically, assuming they would allow this:
-if the exchange goes down and I have an open channel but the coins are with me (on LN obviously) can I force close the channel to retrieve my coins onto the legacy chain?
-Exchmages obviously have to be careful when broadcasting withdrawals that the withdrawal is legitimate.

I might be getting a bit deep here but bitcoins never really physically exist anywhere but also everywhere. Bitcoins are just entries into a ledger that says x address has x amounts of Bitcoin. This ledger exists on every persons computer who has a copy of the Blockchain, which is a LOT of copies all around the world. So your bitcoins will always exist, it's just a case of retaining access. The best way to retain access is by using a wallet that provides a recovery seed (HD wallets). This recovery seed, usually 12-24 words is like a secret treasure map that shows you exactly where to find your coins. You also never need to make another backup once you have that seed written down because it covers literally unlimited addresses. As long as you have these 12-24 words written down you will never lose your coins. Electrum is a HD wallet with a recovery seed. As long as you have that seed, even is the electrum software disappeared you still have your 'treasure map' that points to the location of your coins, you would just need to ask someone how you would transplanted that into another wallet, so that wallet can find your coins. Sometimes it doesn't even need translating you can just enter the words exactly as you did in electrum.

You really think that if core came out and said let's hard fork to 2/4mb there wouldn't be widespread consensus? At least to a degree that any remaining chain would have ZERO benefits to tout over the 1mb chain since 4mb (or even 2mb) blocks aren't going to affect decentralisation to any significant degree. Maybe I'm being stupid but for what reason would anyone stay on the old chain other than to be an asshole? I appreciate that's all the reason some people need but could there really be any less viable of a Blockchain than an asshole chain? Even 2mb, it gives us time to breathe and it would go a long way to satiating a lot of the critics of core. Even if the method (HF) is more controversial surely there is nothing anyone could come up with to disagree with it? Anyway I'm sure you're sick of talking about it over and over, thanks for the reply.  Anyway I don't think we should be scared of creating these asshole chains.

Ypu should never reuse an address, especially a single address paper wallet. Not only is it not quantum resistant anymore but it's also been exposed to an online computer and maybe worse, blockchain.info.
If you want an offline-ish reusable cold storage, create an electrum wallet on a non-persistant version on tails (electrum) is preinstalled) and just write down and memorise the seed. Whenever you want to send coins just recover the seed inside tails and send. Its technically not an offline wallet but it's pretty secure.

Wow, Luke-jr! Thanks for all the work you do for Bitcoin, you're clearly a smart guy. 
However I do think that people's reservations about Segway are not completely unfounded. What I think is that a standard block size increase is less controversial that SW, and implementing a standard block size increase would ease the pressure in the time up until SW is either accepted or rejected. Don't you agree that denying a standard block size increase before SW is tactically motivated to increase the chances of getting SW activated? Whether SW is good or not don't you agree that there is some form of coercion going on here that could be described at a little bit unfair?

From a user perspective you won't notice much diffemeve whether you use legacy or segwit addresses. If you send your coins to the segwit half of your wallet then next time you send a transaction it should be considerably cheaper. Segwit is essentially a way to get more transactions inside a block so it's around 4x cheaper because you can fit 4x more SW transactions in a block than normal (legacy) transactions. 
Wallet providers just know that there's still some people unsure about segwit so they leave the option to keep using legacy. The developers (mainly Luke I believe) found a way to upgrade the bitcoin network so it was reverse compatible meaning that people aren't forced to move to segwit addresses, and old non segwit wallets didn't become invalid.

Edit: I see you mean you just paid 400 sat for the WHOLE transaction. Post the transaction ID here. If you have a change output from the transaction you will be able to do child-pays-for-parent.

For a small amount like that it's probably fine to keep it in Coinbase. Otherwise you're going to pay a transaction fee to withdraw it. 
Should you decide to take full custody of the coins a wallet like electrum is highly recommended, or if you start accumulating much more, then a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:22:18
I disagree. Crypto is backed by nothing. The market decides the price and as we see with the flow back and forth between BCH and BCH there clearly is a shared capital pool between the two. Quantitive easing introduces new money that is totally fungible with the existing money supply. I can see where you're coming from but each fork has its own value proposition and valuation by the market taking value away from bitcoin based upon different fundamentals, not inflation.

Hello Redditor for 2 days. If you pick a name like BTC-SUPPORT, maybe it's better to understand bitcoin a little better so you can give more appropriate advice. I appreciate your think you're helping but maybe you have some way to go before you're equipped to give advice. Posting a transaction ID in a public forum poses very little risk unless you're doing something illegal you don't want tracked. People regularly post txid's to people offering to speed up theor tx or help with issues. 
As for your other comment giving advice, you're telling him to double spend a transcation without knowing if he has RBF turned on, which is highly unlikely. Better advice would be to see if the tx has a change output and then use child pays for parent. Just for future reference.

I'm not sure how much an s7 would cost in electricity per month but someone is paying that bill, and there's no way he's signed a contract without a fair usage clause. Or else you could just sell your neighbours electrucity at a 50% discount for example. If an s7 doesn't cost that much to run for a whole month you might get away with it but I'd be skeptival. Also if he tells you after 2 months to behave you end up stuck with an expensive piece of hardware.

There are only so many bitcoin coin addresses. They aren't infinite. I like to think of generating a bitcoin address as like picking a random grain of sand from a random planet from the whole universe and storing your bitcoins on it. If someone was to stumble accross your grain of sand then they could take your coins. However, as long as you pick a truly random grain of sand from the whole universe, and not just for example just pick one on mars for example, the chances of them ever finding the grain of sand you picked are incalculable. Not only do they have to pick each grain of sand up, they also have to do a quick calculation to see if the grain of sand actually contains any bitcoin. This is just totally impossible with today's technology basically. Your 12 word seed is basically like directions so you can find that grain of sand again. 
As for how it stores unlimited addresses with one seed, I like to think of it as part of the seed points to that first address and a part of it is like a little extra set of instructions that says "the next grain of sand is located Xxx,xxx,xxx planets to the 'north' and xxx,xxx,xxx planets to the south" then follow the same instructions to find the 3rd address, 4th address etc etc. 
Obviously it's not exactly like that but I think it reasonably explains the idea of how it works. Also I'm pretty sure there are more addresses than grains of sand in the known universe, a better example might have been to use atoms instead. Humans can't comprehend just how big very large numbers are. 
Fun fact: if you started with a piece of A4 paper and somehow managed to fold it in half 104 times, it would be wider than the know universe. Crazy right? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:07:55
This is very useful. I was thinking of doing it the same way. However the question was which wallets to use? Electrum was my first choice. Am I right in saying since there's no replay protection that instead of using two wallets I can just use one? (For sending the original splitting transaction). What if the wallet rejects the rbf transaction since its confirmed on one chain? Do I need to point my electrum wallet at a specific node? Or delete it and restore it? This was my only question. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:05:30

Setting up a hardware wallet is incredibly easy. They come with instructions as well as many video tutorials done online. 
Paper wallets are a bit more complicated to do securely. If you meet someone in person I'd be a bit worried about them somehow compromising your computer or tricking you in some way. Search for a guide on secure paper wallet creation and just learn. I'd probably just splash out for a hardware wallet. I have a trezor.

Selling you that much for cash would be complicated compliance wise. €15k per 30 days is the maximum cash transaction without AML KYC being required (unless it's been lowered). Most traders don't want to deal with the complexities of holding people's info and storing it, which requires a license to keep. So they just keep under that limit. Just do trades with several different traders. It's spreads your risk of getting robbed, and you will get to meet several of the local traders for networking purposes. If it's for investment purposes, maybe it's wise to average your buys and spread it into small purchases anyway. You can also look at a cash deposit on LB too, where you go and deposit money into someone's bank inside the actual bank. Again, low limits but it's not going to take that long to do. 
Otherwise just deposit it into your bank and send it to an exchange.

You sign a message with the address, not the bitcoin. Everything on the network works on signatures from addresses. When coins move from an address, in the background what is really happening is that address is signing a message saying move X coins to X address. The signature proves to the network that the address owner has permission to move the coins. When you sign a message to prove you own coins instead of 'move x coins to x address' (which bitcoin wallets do automatically when you click to send) you would just sign a message like "hey Reddit, I'm proving I own these 20k coins on 20/11. Then everyone here would be able to verify that the key that controls the message signed that message. That way we know they control them. Most bitcoin wallets have an option to sign a message using address somewhere in settings.

1) how long would it take your personal internet connection to upload 8mb of data to 8 different peers? Then assume 3 blocks found within 1 minute (not unusual at all). 192mb of data to upload... over the course of a day multiply 8mb x 144 blocks x number of peers it's being broadcast to. That's a lot of data. Even with one peer that's 1.15gb. Poorer countries have even slower internet connections with even more strict data limits. If just western rich countries host nodes, how is that being your own bank? 
2) a hardfork to increase blocksize would 100% be very contentious and lead to a network split. We don't want that. It just makes bitcoin look stupid. 
The "obvious solution" explains why it's so popular, but also wrong (in my opinion). 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:51:36
Not to be too much of an asshole, but I think you've embedded yourself in a conversation you have absolutely no idea about.

You need to go and do some reasearch about how bitcoin works.

Not sure about compay. Generally it's pc clients I've seen. In electrum there's an option if you left click the address you want to sign the message with, then a text box pops up, bang your message in there, click sign, then it will spit out a massive wall of random looking text. You share that text with whoever you're trying to prove ownership to. They then use a client to verify that that the message was signed by that public key. Trezor does both I think. I.e. Signing and verifying.

I apologies but it looks like you're expressing strong tendencies for BCH. BCH hasn't encountered any scaling issues because nobody uses it. It might have a block limit of 8mb but it barely fills 100kb. Maybe several years from now it might experience some if they're lucky. 8mb is as close to zero in the grand scheme of things as 1mb. It's a million miles from the capacity we need for the vision of bitcoin we all hoped for. So adding all that extra stress on the network for a stopgap solution is useless. Especially when it would require an extremely contentious hard fork resulting in a guaranteed split in the network. BCH managed a hardfork just recently with a few weeks notice. This should worry anyone. For a hardfork to go through so easily with so little warning shows how centralised it is and how it's probably 5 or 6 years behind the decentralisation of btc.

You people are seriously brainwashed.

Get real before you lose all your btc. 
If you can't spot a pump and dump as obvious as BCH you're going to get real hurt in crypto. You have a lot to learn. Meanwhile the seasoned traders are milking you lot dry.

Unfortunately unless we sacrifice what makes bitcoin bitcoin; decentralisation, we can't scale yet to the rising demand. In reality bitcoin as it is now before layer 2 solutions isn't suitable for small transactions. 
Even though we preach about owning your own private keys or you don't own bitcoin, I would suggest that for such small amounts you should leave it on the Coinbase exchange and then withdraw when you have more, or wait til fees drop. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and we are being very cautious about not doing anything that could permanently jeopardise it. Bitcoin cash or other alts are a great way to learn about crypto, send cheap transactions, experiment. Once you understand how it works then come back to bitcoin where all the serious investors and tech experts are. Just make sure you understand what things are going to cost you before you invest, Bitcoin is not yet user friendly for non technical people.

There's a risk if someone sets up your wallet they will steal your coins. Don't worry about setting up a wallet, it's easy. A wallet like electrum gives you 13 words to write down. This 13 words back up any address the wallet gives you, even if it's a million addresses. As long as you have those 13 words written down it's impossible to lose your bitcoin due to user error, like deleting the wallet or losing the pc. Keep those 13 words safe and don't let anyone ever see them and you're pretty safe. 
Obviously if you need help, just ask here. Just make sure the advice is given in public. Download electrum now and try it out. It's as fool proof as possible. Set a long password when it asks you for a password too. Even if you forgot the password, as long as you have the 13 words you can restore your wallet easily with no password needed. 
Then start researching more. You may find a wallet you prefer but electrum is vey trusted.

There's only one coin people actually want to invest in though. Only one coin with any demand. Only one coin with the best developers in the world.

As a result fees are higher because people actually want to use it. I agree though, new users should start with altcoin alike litecoin, Ethereum and bcash. Once they play around with these altcoins they should be ready to join the big boys in bitcoin.

Hahahaha. You need to understand the level of FUD going on here. A lot of people were scammed into buying bcash in a pump and dump orcastrated by Roger Verr and r/btc. They bought bcash at ridiculously high valuations after being lied to and told that it was going to overtake bitcoin. These people are desperately trying to pump bcash so they don't lose money. It's never going to happen. Check fork.lol and look at the pathetica amount of hashrate bcash has compared to btc. Even when it was more profitable miners didn't switch. I'm sorry to tell you but that was a one off pump and dump so the smart traders could offload their bcash at insanely high values. Best to just sell your bcash before taking anymore losses. 
As for slush, they were one of the first mining pools. Only the newcomers to btc don't understand that bcash is just another shitcoin. I'll bet 1btc this 'rumour' is BS by some pathetic bcash bag holder trying desperately to pump that shitcoin.

I've been doing this for years now. It sounds hard to begin with but it takes very little time to remember. I still remember my last 3 seeds (12,12 and 13 words) as well as my current (24 words). 
I still have it memorised but I now have a trezor (24 words). I couldn't rely on another 2 trusted parties to remember 24 words so I now have that 24 word seed written down in 2 places but I have a passcode set that means the 24 words alone are useless. This passphrase is simple enough to remember for anyone so it's not written down anywhere. 
My family being able to recover my coins in the event of my death is as important as securing them from theft. Every time I go skiing, rock climbing or anything dangerous I always get them to confirm they understand the recovery process before I leave. Morbid but true. I'm not sur if they've put 2 and 2 together as to why I always have these little practices right before I go away on a trip doing high risk activities yet...

Bitcoin is best left to the experts I'm afraid. Typically new users that struggle understanding the tech will try an altcoin like litecoin, Ethereum, or maybe even bcash. Once you play around with these altcoins you should be able to understand bitcoin and join the big boys. 
Trying to explain bitcoin to someone with very little experience is like trying to explain the economics of bitcoin to r/btc readers. They just don't understand, it's a bit complicated. Most of the people in this sub are the early adopters, so we don't really cover basic principle such as this. Especially when you can google and find the answer quite easily.

The biggest indicator was Roger and Jihan investing so heavily. These two are both billionaires. Both of them aren't just going to go down without a fight. They have too big egos. 
Rapid price increases followed by slow progressive decline showing nobody wants to hold the coin except for profit, then boom, sharp spike, then another slow decline. 
If someone wanted to buy BCH and actually accumulate it, they wouldn't make tons of market orders incurring massive slippage. They would place bids and wait for people to sell into them in what was a slowly declining price. Instead they very publicly start eating up the orderbook over the course of half a day while all the brainwashed fans boys of r/btc give you free promotion telling everyone they know that they should sell their bitcoin quickly before it's too late. Rinse, repeat. 
It will be interesting to see what happens later today when Bitcoins difficulty adjustment kicks in. R/btc is claiming miners plan to leave btc en mass in a deliberate attempt to fill the mempool and increase fees and confirmation times leading to a price crash. We shall see what happens but I think we will see a BCH rally upto that point. I'm certainly going to trade it.

Really sorry it took this long for someone to just give you the easy answer, but here it is.
-Set up an account on LocalBitcoins and confirm your email and activate 2 factor authentication for security hacking up everything you're given. 
-click on wallet inside LocalBitcoins, it will give you a big string of random letters and numbers starting with a 1----------------- withdraw to this address inside your site digital goods site. 
-once the coins confirm in 30 mins to 1 hour simply use the search box on local and pick how you want to sell coins coins. There are people offering to buy coins for literally any payment method, using any bank you like. Pick someone with a good reputation over 1 years old. UNLESS ITS A CASH TRADE LocalBitcoins offers escrow which means LB hold the coins and don't release them to the buyer in between you raising the order and you clicking 'yes they've paid me'.

For Norway click the 'quick sell' tab, set the country to Norway, currency should automatically go to NOK, select online offers (as oppose to in person cash trades), then click search.

-a guy using PayPal at  bollocks to PayPal though
-someone offering online national bank transfer at  username frha. He's been online for 10 months with 100% feedback so he looks legit. Loads of other sellers too. 
-once you've withdrawn bitcoin to your LB address it's pretty easy to raise an order for however much you want to sell. 
- just make sure you don't release the bitcoin till you see the money in your account.

It's shouldn't be, no. The only things you can hack by porting (having your number put on a SIM card the hacker has) is accounts that will allow you to do things like reset passwords via SMS 2fa. Most sites allow you to remove google 2fa but they wait you wait a long period of time before actually removing it. Sometimes 30 days, so you'd have 30 days to get back in control of your accounts before the hacker could remove google 2fa after they gained access to your mobile number and subsequently your email accounts. Best advice is to protect your email address with google 2fa NOT SMS.

If you had $1000 in your exchange account and you wanted to create a buy order, typically in my experience they would always let you create a buy order for $1000, so if the rate was say $1000, you could create one buy order for $1000 at $1000/bitcoin meaning a total amount of 1 bitcoin could be absorbed by your order. Exchanges only take the fee once the trade has actually taken place. For arguments sake if the exchanges fee was 0.1%, once someone decides to take your bid and sell you 1 bitcoin, you would end up with net 0.999btc to withdraw and they would end up with $999.
Sometimes exchanges operate a maker/taker fee system whereby those providing liquidity (i.e. Putting up orders to either buy or sell) and waiting for them to fill are charged less than those who come along and respond to the order already placed (i.e. Removing liquidity). In the above example if the maker/taker fee was 0.1/0.2, since you placed the buy order and waiting patiently (providing liquidity to the order book) you would still get a net 0.999btc, however whoever came along and took your offer (removing liquidity from the order book) would be charged 0.2% giving them a net $998. Supposedly this promoted price stability and stimulates liquidity on the exchange, which seems very logical. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:11:12
The public key is a hash, a specific mathematical function. This means that changing one letter would mean the address wouldn't be a valid address. There's probably a near zero chance that changing one letter from a valid address would end up with another valid address. Basically although addresses look like a random string of letters and numbers they actually aren't and bitcoin wallets quickly check that any address you enter conforms to this rule. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:51:19
Memorise your seed. I promise you even though 24 words seems a lot, if you break it into 8 lots of 3 words it's actually really easy. I have a terrible memory and I've easily memorised my last 5 wallet seeds. Learn the first 3, then the second three, reappear in your head, then the third lot, then the fourth. In no time you'll be able to rhyme it off. Keep a paper copy too but use the 'plausible deniability feauture' so that even with the seed, they need to know a secondary passphrase. You can tell the passphrase to family just in case as well as keeping a paper copy somewhere secure.

Yes I understand. Problem is that almost everyone here is a massive fan of Bitcoin. We all believe that it's revolutionary utility could lead to it being valued at magnitudes more than what it is now. So do we recommend on buying it? Abso-fucking-lutely! Are we saying that if you buy it right now you're definitely going to make profit in the next month or two? Anyone reasonable would never say that. For all we know it might enter another bear market for a couple of years before picking up again. The fundamental utility that bitcoin offers means that IMO it surely should be valued at some higher price than it is now at some point in the future. Will that be next week? Will that be in 2 years time? Will there be a cheaper chance to stock up on some bitcoin in a few months time? Will you be kicking yourself in a couple of months time that you didn't buy any because it's now $15,000? Nobody knows mate. Bitcoin is a high risk investment for many reasons. There's never been anything like it in history. Invest only what you can afford to lose. 
Despite my rational tone above, I'm a massive fan of bitcoin and I hold 95% of my wealth in bitcoin. A massive risk. I could lose 50% of my wealth overnight, but I understand the risks. Pick what's right for you, and don't invest more than you're prepared to lose.

I'm sorry to burst your bubble but this sounds like an absolutely terrible idea. If you have no legacy market experience and no bitcoin trading experience the chance that you could make a profit are virtually zero. Bitcoin is also such a high risk asset that you shouldn't be investing anything you can't afford to lose. Bitcoin lost 40% in a matter of days just recently for example. Exchange fees are another thing also. With a fee of 0.25% per trade (typical fee for someone not trading large volumes) since you have to buy AND sell to realise a profit, this is 0.5%, which means the market rate has to move in your favour by ~$20 before you make a penny. Please do not try this. 
That being said, there are easy trading opportunities in p2p trading (Localbitcoins is basically the hub of all p2p trading globally). Buying and selling there, you offer a service and charge a premium for said service. You nought create an advert to sell at +5% and buy at -5%. Giving a huge spread to buffer any volatility. Depending on where you live look at lB and try and see if there is any opportunities for profit. Whether it be buying for cash, selling for bank, buying for PayPal and selling for bank. Find a niche that has a reasonable spread. 
Obviously learn about any regulations and laws in your area.

I think that strategy is reasonable as long as you plan to hold long term. Don't sell in a panic if it falls to $3000 or even $2000. Don't think "shit I've lost money", think "shit I could have bought more if I'd waited". My game is accumulate as much bitcoin as possible before it becomes to expensive to buy. 
There's been multiple bad news recently about bitcoin, China banning exchanges, South Korea banning ICOs, the potential SW2x fork. Yet the price has stayed strong and recovered well, which leads me to believe maybe this isn't as much of a bubble as I thought it was. I can't see it ever dropping bellow $2k dollars even if we had a mega dump now anyway. Just buy 100 every time you can. 
What country are you in? Maybe there are p2p trading opportunities like LocalBitcoins to help you accumulate?

Bitstamp is the legit OG of exchanges. I couldn't love them more.  
No downtime, no hacks, never even had to send them a support email, never had a withdraw/deposit delayed and I generally keep 20-30 coins there at a time. 
IF, (and that's a big IF) your story is true, then I have all faith that they will make the situation right again. Bitstamp doesn't scam people. It doesn't make any sense that they would do that. 
Either you've been flagged because it's a new account and it's high volume, OR, you're doing something illegal. Maybe sending money from a dodgy account etc. Either way I'm confident Bitstamp will deal with the situation appropriately. Go get your lawyers involved if you feel the need.

I don't really have any experience with that to be honest. I only use the exchange to send my bitcoin in and trade. Stamp allows unlimited withdrawals and deposits of crypto. With kraken even with the high value account it's easy to hit the withdraw limit when you withdraw each time you finish trading. Funnily enough they allow unlimited deposits in crypto though, meaning people are encouraged to leave large amounts on exchange. Still I guess the quick withdraws is valuable.

Yes you can. If you go in settings, then advanced, then enable passphrase encryption. Every time you load your wallet it asks for a password. If you just press enter without entering any password it just shows your original wallet. For any password you can come up with it just shows you another wallet. There basically is no wrong password, every password leads to a different wallet. Truly genius. 
Just make sure you create a passphrase encrypted wallet, check the first address, then close the wallet entirely and anger the same address again. Then check you still have the same address just incase you spelt the password wrong twice. I once tried opening my life savings account to find it empty. Totally shit myself. Tried the password again, making 100% I spelt it right (22 letters), still again wallet was empty. Totally shaking in panic when I realised I had my caps lock on, so it showed me an entirely new wallet.

For realtime watching the price and orderbooks I stick to finex and stamp. For stamp just access their site and click the tradeview tab. For finex I use bfxdata.com. 
If by bitcoin stocks you mean securities like ICO tokens, I really wouldn't bother. The majority don't have a decent business plan and will never turn a profit, maybe never even create a revenue stream. It's even more high risk of an investment than bitcoin. I'd say just buy the dips and maybe, just maybe, consider investing a small percentage of you bitcoin into altcoins you've absolutely thoroughly researched if you want to speculate on more than bitcoin. 
Use an app like blockfolio to track your portfolio of bitcoin, alts and fiat to see how you're doing in realtime too. Obviously coinmarketcap.com shows alt prices as I'm sure you know. 
Even consider becoming a peer to peer trader somewhere like LocalBitcoins for example. It's much easier to turn a profit when you're offering a service you can charge a premium on. 
Good luck!

It looks like you're just using your computers built in hardware? If you were mining in 2009 then you would be receiving bitcoin. However mining hardware has become more and more specialised since then and now unless you buy a dedicated ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) miner you won't stand any statistical chance of solving any hashes (mining bitcoin). 
You could try mining altcoins, but you need to do profitability calculations based on difficultly first. Try researching on bitcoin talk.org maybe?

I'll be making a cup of coffee and remember him. Then three weeks ago he hit me up for another trade. Coins still in the same wallet, still on windows. Offered to buy him a Trezor with my own money.

@_date: 2017-10-17 22:04:19
Yea they reply to emails fast. Can't fault trezor. 
I understand the fact you want to be sure you have the backup written correct but you do add another attack vector by entering the seed on your computer. Even though it asks for the 24 words in a random order, it is (at least theoretically) compromising your security. However if you have a four word passphrase on top I suppose it's pretty safe. I used my trezor to generate a new 24 word seed then used the first four words as my passphrase (and then deleted that wallet obviously). Since humans can't come up with random words so I hear.

Consequences of someone getting access to an online account; unauthorised account access, personal data leak, identity fraud. All can be fixed.

@_date: 2017-10-10 18:43:13
You're always safe to do nothing. While all three chains exist your private key will be able to send coins on all three chains. 
Since claiming coins from 2 chains requires you to import your key into a wallet that may not be as trust as some of the bitcoin wallets I would consider creating another paper wallet and moving just your bitcoin to that one. 
Reason being that if you come to claim all three using one private key that involves importing your private key to three different pieces of software. There's always the possibility one of them could be malicious and steal your coins on the other chains. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:25:18
Stocks are assists. You own it and you plan to receive a dividend. Limited us or chance of growth. Bitcoin is a store of wealth, a currency, and more. Look at the total amount of dollars or euros (in the trillions) or the total amount of gold (in the trillions) and you find a more appropriate comparison for Bitcoin. If you consider bitcoin as still in its early adopter phase and highly undervalued then huge jumps as people speculate whether it might turn into the next gold/us dollar make more sense. 
Also don't get too hung up on the unit of '1 bitcoin'. One single bitcoin is a totally arbitrary measurement unit. With a fixed supply and infinitely divisible units it means very little at all. If you instead use mBTC (1/1000th of a bitcoin) then the prive is only moving a few cents/dollars. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:45:19
Electrum is great. Write down your 13 word seed and any coins you ever send to that wallet are protected, even future coins, you never need to backup your seed again. 
There's 2 forks, on oct 25th (gold) and one early November (S2x). Once the fork happens your wallet will still only display the original bitcoin, however when someone releases a wallet for that forked coin, as long as it's a wallet that supports a 13 word seed like electrum (pretty common) then you just import your seed and you'll see exactly the same number of forked coins. 
Note: just incase the new wallet is malicious and intends to steal your original bitcoins (giving your seed to anyone or any software is absolutely not advisable, but you have no choice to claim the coins), so you should create a new electrum wallet after the fork (write down your new 13 word backup (and don't mix it up with your original seed)) and send your original coins there. Hope that makes sense.

in theory there should always be enough miners to mine transactions. Even if we got down to 1 miner, the difficulty adjustment would bring the difficulty back down far enough to average 1 block per ten mins. Obviously with 1 miner the network wouldn't be secure though. Even after block rewards are gone, transaction fees should sustain enough miners to keep the network secure (we hope).

Yes that's the only seed you need to back up all your crypto stuff stored in that wallet. There might be other wallets that support the same seed, or even just recovery software but I'm not specifically aware of either. 
Tip: memorise your seed too. Break it into groups of 3 words and it's surprisingly easy. I bet you can do it in 30 mins and never forget it. Obviouslys still keep a paper copy.

Localbitcoins or Bitbargain. Initially as you build reputation you may pay high fees, but if you privide ID and make some transactions you will start to be allowed to buy cheaper coins as sellers believe you aren't a fraudster that will chargeback the bank transfer.

Sorry I though I was replying to a stick transaction question. If you're sure the balance is still there I would assume it's a bug in the LB website.

Firstly, unless 300k is something you can afford to lose, and something you are prepared to lose, this is an utterly ridiculous idea. No offence but your statements that you expect bitcoin to be at that price in 12 months time shows you must be really new to bitcoin. Bitcoin is a super high risk investment and we could easily enter another bear market for 12 months just as easy as we could see 10k. 
If you have 300k available in your portfolio for a super high risk investment then go to an exchange. I reccomend Bitstamp. Open an account, verify your ID, then before you wire in $300k mail then and explain you're about to send them a very large amount of money and you want to know what you might need to be aware of. Should you send them proof of the origin of funds? Would they like a statement from a law firm, I have no idea since I've always bought peer to peer for less than 10k at a time. A much better idea would be to wire in a smaller amount each week, purchase coins then withdraw them to a wallet you control (trezor or ledger would be my choice). This averages your buy price, and it also limits your exposure to assets being frozen because you inadvertently triggered their suspicious activity detecting processes, which might take some while to prove that you have a legitimate source for all those funds.
Seriously, if you couldn't face seeing that money turned to 100k inside 2 months don't even consider it. Bitcoin is too new, too wild, and too unpredictable.

I guess with enough resources you don't necessarily need to make a profit immediately if you hold long enough. It just becomes a way to acquire. 
There are mining calculators out there where you can calculate based on the efficiency of your hardware what price you need to be paying for your electricity. Some miners certainly are making money. It's just a constant arms race for more efficient miners, and if you don't know all the intricacies it's probably a risky business. I really don't know much detail about mining unfortunately. Check bitcoin talk forum maybe.

You can't. Every node will reject it since they already know those outputs are spent. They're unconfirmed but sat in the memory pool. Had you enabled (RBF) before you sent it then you could do this, but it's extremely unlikely you had RBF turned on.

I've never made a fiat withdrawal, and only one fiat deposit years ago, but I really can't fault them. I use the same withdraw address and deposit from that same address so they know I'm just trading and not upto any funny business, but I honestly can't fault them.

A little bit convoluted I have to say. How old and how smart are the people you're talking to? 
The way you explain the creation of an address sound like you just mash the keyboard to create an address. The bit about checking the address hasn't been used before sounds like we're relying on people being able to take other people's coins if they wanted to. If you want to keep its as a mail analogy maybe phrase it that you use a piece of software to generate a completely random address that is so long and huge that it has never in the history of the planet been seen before and never will be randomly generated ever again. It's so big and unique that there are more combinations than there are atoms in the known universe. So many that we use each address just one time (even though we can use them as many times as we like). The number the software creates will give you two separate addresses (pub and private). The two numbers are paired in such a mathematical way that calculating 1 from 2 takes a split second, but calculating 2 from 1 would take more energy and time than the known universe has. Once the address owns entries on the ledger (bitcoins) the only way to move them is to provide a digital signature from the secret one telling the network you have permission to move coins in that address. A digital signature is a mathematical way of proving you own the secret key without actually showing anyone. 
Maybe consider an email analogy or possibly just explain it in terms of current banking. I.e. You open an account (create an address), make a deposit (buy a bitcoin and have the seller send it to your address), then pay someone from your account (sign a transaction and broadcast it to the network). Then you can explain after that how the coins come in to creation (mining), how the protocol gets upgraded (consensus, forks etc), why people value bitcoins at all (trustless, limited supply, fraudproof, public ledger)
Also I'm not sure all addresses have to be 26 characters. 
I'm sure either way you do it you'll smash it. Watch some YouTube videos. I'm sure there's one called bitcoin under the hood or something that's quite good.

You can have the same wallet (set of keys) or the same address (single private key) in as many wallets as you like at the same time. I'm not sure Coinbase and blockchain are compatible though since you can't export your keys or seed from Coinbase as far as I'm aware. I have several trezors with the same wallet inside. If I opened two at the same time, on my pc and one on my laptop, and then sent a transaction on my laptop, my PC would virtually instantly show the transaction leaving that wallet too.

The margins back in 2012 were as much as 25%, even more sometimes, but that was because of a lack of liquidity from there not being that many traders. I was making minimum £500 a day, anything upto £2000 into 2013. Now there's so many people doing it the margins are pretty thin. Take a look at localbitcoins from page now and check what the highest buy offer is vs the lowest sell offer. Then deduct 2% for LB fees ( you pay 1% fee as an advertiser for buying and selling). I'm sure there's room to make money but not like the old days. Also getting a bank account to work with is very difficult if you tell them what you do. I've just been holding ever since. 
There's still opportunities to make money but it might involve looking at other payment methods other than bank transfer that aren't so popular. Or different platforms like Bitbargain where the price goes up at night as all the sellers go offline. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:58:55
In that example the trail stops with localbitcoins as far as I'm concerned PROVIDED the all regulations and laws regarding the purchase were followed. For example if you bought £500 gbp from a seller on LB who happened to be a drug dealer, then you're at no fault. No one is going to convict for that, you had no responsibility to ask where such a small amount originated from. In the cash of £10,000+ maybe the police might want to speak to you, but even then I can't see them punishing you as long as your money was clean. It's the same as with paper fiat. If a -£20 note was used to buy a cheeseburger right after a drug dealer took it as payment they won't try and prosecute the burger vendor. 
Buy huge amounts of btc from someone with no ID and he's a drug dealer then you've unknowingly facilitated money laundering, which is still a crime.

I'm not talking probabilities either. I'm acknowledging the hypothetical scenario of absolutely no fiat. (Obviously this would never happen as countries would issue their own crypto, but again, agreeing with your hypothitival). 
Do you know what an orderbook is on an exchange? Like bitstamp, bitfinex etc. This is how price discovery takes place between trading pairs, eg USD/BTC, BTC/ETC. The design of the orderbook allows a price to be determined of one side of the pair in relation to the other. 
A post fiat world with no state issued currency would have way more commodities traded like this corn/btc cotton/btc gold/btc etc etc. It's likely an index or basket of these pairs would form a way to price things.

If you didn't send the full balance of your wallet there's a good chance that the change went back to your own wallet. This means if you send your entire balance that's in your wallet to yourself with a very generous fee it will make the first transaction confirm at the same time as the second. This is called 'child pays for parent'. Depending on how many transactions you use to fill your wallet this may be expensive. If it's not a huge amount of money I would just wait.

Maybe "past performance does not guarantee future results"? I hate to legacy quote you but it's true. There's no reason to put all your eggs in one basket. If you put all the cash in your bank account into bitcoin then you're so exposed (from the sounds of it). Why not hedge by just building a home with the $300k, get a loan to make it 400/500 if necessary. Sell that home and use property development as a hedge to your crypto. If you own over 50btc you're in the top 1% of the top 1% of the top 1%. You are not going to miss out if we achieve the vision you're hoping for. I couldn't be more of a bitcoin evangelist but do you really want to check your phone every ten minutes for the next year worrying that maybe you just lost $50k? You have easily enough bitcoin to live a dream life if bitcoin ever achieves half its potential, don't risk it all. Do what you will but from an outside perspective it just seems extremely reckless.

You would be right if was trading to accumulate fiat, however I was trading to accumulate bitcoin. Not to say I haven't made some horrendous decisions along the way though. I sold 43 bitcoin for a £2200 item back in 2013. Then I sold about 66 bitcoin for about £85 each to fund me moving to another country to take a bitcoin 'job' that was going to pay me in bitcoin. I went over October the 26th 2013. First pay day was end of November, I got paid 3.96btc because the rate was now ~$1000.... so over a months work and i basically lost ~62btc. That's without my attempts at trading on exchange as the price rises and falls. I must have lost 20+ coins over the years trying to play the market. So now I just hold and live a meagre lifestyle until I have life changing money enough to never worry about work again. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:00:05
Localbitcoins is like coinbase in that there are people buying and people selling. Except there's two ways to buy bitcoins and two ways to sell bitcoins. 
Buying bitcoins
A) You visit the site and buy bitcoins from someone already advertising bitcoins for sale. *****this what you did*****
B) YOU create an advert offering to buy someone's bitcoins and sit back and wait for someone to come along who wants you to buy their bitcoin. 
Selling bitcoin 
A) you visit the site and find an advert for someone offering to buy your bitcoin (someone else doing buying option B above)
B) you create a sell advert and wait for someone to come along who wants to buy you bitcoin (Someone doing buying option A above)
Basically you're paying a fee to the guy who made the advert because he's offering a service. That service being that you can just access the site and buy/sell IMMEDIATELY without waiting around. 
If you instead provide the other person the service you can demand a fee/lower price. 
For example you might see that the lowest price to buy bitcoins instantly is +4% of market rate. However the price that someone is willing to buy bitcoin at might be -1%. Think of this as a spread. The only way to buy cheaper coins is to be that guy advertising to buy someone's coins. 
Three things to bear in mind:
-Localbitcoins charges a 1% fee on every transaction to the advertiser only. They always take this in bitcoin. The person looking to buy/sell immediately pays no fees. 
-You need to get some feedback on the board before anyone will use/trust you. Nobody will sell to someone with zero feedback. All transactions go on your stats so make some transactions and be sure to ask if they would be willing to give you feedback. 
-Localbitcoins organises all adverts based mainly on price. So the cheapest bitcoins for sale will be at the top of the buy section, and the advert with the highest price will be at the top of the sell section. HOWEVER, when you create a brand new advert even if it has the best price, it won't appear at the top. It will only fall into the proper rank (i.e. At the top of you offer the best price) once the first transaction has happened. For this you either wait until someone eventually finds the advert further down the list, or you cheat and make a second LB account and sell to yourself. 
Hope that helps. LB is one of the best resources for btc and having a reputation there is a great asset.

Further to my last comment, if we totally forget fiat value for a moment and assume our strategy is to accumulate as much btc as possible then the upcoming fork provides an opportunity to increase your holdings. I personally made about 17% fee bitcoin is exchange for my worthless bcash shitcoins. I'm asssiming 2x will be the same. If I can make an extra 20-25% bitcoin by selling my 2x coins then I really don't care so much what my bitcoin are worth. Maybe other are thinking the same and this is why the price is looking so strong right now.

Don't get carried away. No matter what people tell you Bitcoin is a very high risk investment and we just had 10x gains in 12 months and we're headed to a very contentious fork. 
If you bought now and held 10 years I'd be certain you will make a profit but there's a very good possibility that the market could retract for a year or more afte this bullrun and if your position is at a 40% loss there's a good chance you would sell and take the loss, so you would never see the 10 year gains. 
Invest only what you are prepared to lose and disregard anyone who tells you that you should pour your life savings into a high risk investment as it hits all time highs of 10x where it was last year. These people are amateurs and their advice is worthless.

@_date: 2017-10-02 01:41:16
All it means is that the transaction he received before he sent them to you isn't confirmed either. Basically he had an unconfirmed transaction and he sent it on to you. Unless it's an RBF (replace by fee) transaction he can't cancel it, I would assume it's not an RBF scam since he would have already cancelled it. 
If it's been 6 hours then it's probably got a low fee so it's at the back of the queue. If you're getting nervous and just want to see it confirmed, send the entire balance of your wallet to yourself, but add a very generous fee. This should get it confirmed next block. This method is called child pays for parent. I believe it would be a few weeks before it fell out of the memory pool (effectively cancelling and reversing the transaction), but it's nice to just have confirmed coins.

The current fee to get a quick confirm is approx 310 sat/byte according to bitcoinfees.21.co, yours was sent with 30sat/byte so it might take a very long time. 
It looks like you didn't send the complete balance of your wallet when you sent the transcation, correct? It looks like some change went back to your wallet. This means you could use child pays for parent since there's still an unconfirmed output in your wallet. To do this you can either send the full balance of your own wallet to yourself again (this might be expensive if you filled your wallet with lots of transactions), or you could isolate the one unconfirmed change output and send that to yourself (if blockchain supports sending from that specifics address). 
How much were you sending? 0.08btc or 0.01btc? 
Also do you control the private keys to the address you were sending to or is it an exchange etc?

Not unusual at all. It can be 1 second or 2 hours between blocks and it wouldn't be especially unusual. On average it will be 10 minutes but over such a short sample range it's not reliable. The bigger the sample size the more reliable the 10 minute average should be. After 2016 blocks if it's too many blocks the difficulty goes up, if it's too low the difficulty goes down to try and make it ten minutes.

Mining is worth it sure, but only if you have extremely large amounts of money to invest and access to cheap electricity. 
The only people I know make money mining are those people that mine altcoins and then sell for btc. Mine early on when the coin is released then wait for a rapid rise in price and then sell.

Pretty poor article based on virtually no facts. That's not to say bch doesn't look like a buy at its current low price but the idea it has a chance against btc is pretty preposterous. Have the bch team come up with anything new at all? In the end it was a fork supported by a tiny minority of miners and a crappy Dev team and will only serve as a pump and dump scheme.

Ok let's assume blocks are 1gb and they're also full. If you're running a node you're likely to be connected to around 6-8 people, let's say 6. How long do you think the average commmection takes to upload (not download) 6 gb of brand new data? I don't know about you but I live in the uk and by the time my nose had relayed 6GB of data there would likely be another 4-6 blocks been mined. I'm not an expert on Bitcoin tech at all but I understand the kind of chaos this would cause on the network. Nodes/wallets/miners  receiving transactions at the wrong time is a massive issue. You could spend coins to one operator and then spend the same coins to another. Seems in my limited understanding this would probably break bitcoin. 
Like the other guy says too, a linear scaling solution isn't even going to touch the sides for the kind of scaling we need. Storing data forever on a blockchain should be seen as the valuable resource that it is, and storing every purchase of a $1 coffee for eternity just isn't a valuable use of this resource. I think big blockers mean well but they're just short sighted in my opinion.

If you want to just use them to buy bitcoin, then Kraken is fine. 
However if you want to actively trade it there, I would say in my opinion it's one of the worst exchanges I've ever used. The trading engine and the website is absolutely awful and slow. Also they count every deposit and withdraw against your monthly limits. So if you want to withdraw you btc while you aren't trading then you end up going over your limit, which encourages people to leave coins on the exchange which is a terrible idea. Bitstamp is a million times superior for trading.

Guy comes in my shop in mid 2012, in conversation about politics and libertarianism he tells me (a total stranger) that he's been buying imported ecstasy from the Netherlands over the web. Blown away I tell him that even though he has gotten away with it so far that he's going to end up in jail once they trace his payment to the supplier. He assures me that this new Bitcoin thing means there's no record of payment, they're like £1 each he says. The libertarian bank hater in me can't believe that there's a decentralised permissionless payment stystem like this in existence, how could that possibly work? That evening I googled bitcoin, the price was actually £4 a coin. That's strange, how does that work? Who sets the price? Researched orderbook exchanges and related price discovery. Cool! Found out there's a max limit on the number of these infinitely divisible coins. Wow! Bought £2600 worth of bitcoin the next day, which was £1000 more than I actually had in my bank account. 
Found localbitcoins a week later where people were selling bitcoins for +15% and offering to buy them for -10%. Started trading bitcoin on my phone while I was working for fun. 
Early 2013 gave up my £35k/pa + bonus management role to trade bitcoin full time in my underpants from home. 
Never looked back, never been happier. Still in my underpants a lot. 
Note: If you're a drug user I think ordering drugs in the post to your address using a currency that stores your transaction for eternity is an absolutely ridiculous idea, but I'm comfortable with people doing what they please if it means we can compete with the bankers that control the world via their monopoly on creating money.

Bey difficult to lose your coins. 
During setup the trezor will display on its screen the 24 word seed that you need to write down. It's goes through all 24 words twice so you can double check you have them written down perfectly. You need this to restore your wallet incase you lose it. As long as you have this you're totally safe. 
The trezor will also ask you to pick a PIN number. Use a 9 digit pin, it's more secure. Enter it twice. The PIN just blocks physical access incase someone finds your trezor. If you were to forget your pin or lose it, you can still recover your wallet using the 24 word seed. So keep the 24 word seed safe. 
That's pretty much all you need to know. The setup guide is brilliant. You shouldn't struggle at all. Once it's setup you will just use the web wallet to access your wallet. Even though it might look like you're using a browser wallet like blockchain.info, you aren't. Your keys are stored offline in the trezor.
Just double check the address before sending and you will be fine. Just click receive bitcoin and it will give you an address to deposit to. 
Optional - you can add an extra layer of security called a passphrase. This is sort of advanced, but highly reccomend in my opinion. It makes your coins virtually unstealable, even if someone managed to find your seed, but if you forget your passphrase you lose your coins. So maybe save that till you're comfortable with the normal wallet. 
I have 3 active trezors and I've given out over 10 as gifts. Couldn't recommend them more. Let me know if you have any questions. There's also the trezor subreddit. Developers are always answering questions there but you can more than likely get any answers you need from someone in the community (like me). 
One last thing. Don't forget to write down your 24 word seed perfectly and in order....  that's pretty much all you need to make sure you do not to mess up.

There are broadly two types of sell (or buy). One is called a market order, the other is called a limit order. 
An exchange matches buyers and sellers. There is not an unlimited amount to buy or sell at any particular price. The available sells or buys are organised in what's called an order book. See this link for an example of what bitstamps order book looks like as a graph. 
One side is people waiting to sell, the other is people waiting to buy. You notice that the middle never quite touches, or else if it did bitstamp would just action a trade. The order book is made up of limit orders (buy and sell). These are where someone has come along and said "I want to sell X amount of bitcoin for X price and I'm willing to wait until someone comes along" OR "I want to buy x amount at x price". The orders sit there until someone comes along wanting to fulfil the order or until the user cancels it, maybe to adjust their price/amount etc. The other type of order is the MARKET order. This is where someone comes along and says " I want to sell/buy x amount of bitcoin and I don't care about the price, just take what ever is available on the orderbook" this eats up one side of the ordebook depending on whether they were selling or buying. If they were selling then this would be what we know as a dump. The price would be driven down as the people offering to buy bitcoin on one side have their orders eaten up. 
The bear whale did a limit order, not a market order. They basically plopped down a massive sell order at $300 for 30,000 coins right where everyone could see it. Normally people would see this and crap their pants assuming the price is going down but nobody panicked and the price barely went under $299. The order stayed there until traders had bought up all 30k coins. If he had done a market order it would have likely cleared the orderbook on the buy side and he would have probably got an average sell price of $90. 
Hope this helps.

Investing in altcoins is extremely risky. Ethereum seems like a really great idea (unlike most alts), but really do you think it has more potential than Bitcoin which is potentially about to get a capacity increase that would presumably increase its market cap significantly? I wouldn't invest a lot in alts if it was me personally, and certainly not unless I thoroughly understood it. Learning the finer points of trading alts takes a lot of research and understanding of why they rise and fall.

I'm sorry I don't know why it saying max fee exceeded. Maybe try restoring your wallet after making sure you 100% definitely have your seed written down correctly. 
If you go on the Blockchain you should see that your transaction on the Blockchain shows the amount to sent to the destination wallet as well as another random amount going to a different address. This random amount should be going to an address inside your own wallet. 
Search the destination address you sent to, then click the hash over the top of the transaction and you should see what I refer to. Sorry I can't be more help.

No sir, you are infact the idiot here so please educate your self a little better before you start with your mouth. Margin is not a term you would apply to this situation. Its not a profit margin like you seem to be getting confused with, it's a commission. Localbitcoins don't buy and sell anything, they make a largely passive income from the site. Their margin is the total revenue they get from all sales on the platform (the 1%), minus the costs of running their servers and paying employees to moderate transactions.

I'm not a particular expert but recently I've noticed a few transactions I've sent not showing up, a couple times in mycelium, and once at the receiving end where a guy I sent to claimed I hadn't sent the coins even though I could see I had on the Blockchain. Resolves itself after a short period of time. Maybe this is due to the memory pool or transaction not propagation properly (I'm just pulling ideas out of my ass, I have no idea if this is a plausible solution), but maybe this could explain what happened. Trezor sent the first transaction, then couldn't see it on the Blockchain so it dissapeared and you sent it again? Just a thought. Wierd because I've never been unable to see a transaction instantly in any wallet I've used.

If it says success and not that it's full it should work. No need to try twice. However viabtc only have less than 15% (total guess, cba looking it up) of the hash rate so you have to wait for them to find a block. Give it 5 hours at least.

GBT shares are 'securities', so he was implying that investors there are paying double spot price of the actual commodity bitcoin. Bitcoin trades at spot price. He didn't say which exchange, he just made the comparison that a security that derives its price from Btc is trading at double spot price. To have replaced 'spot' with 'X index price of btc' would have made it no more correct or incorrect to. His whole statement stands.

Bitcoin is inherently traceable. If you were planning to do something illegal I would think twice about it. The idea bitcoin is anonymous is generally not true. People use mixers to mix their coins in an effort to mask their origin but just think for a moment who else might be using those mixers? You might end up linked to something like terrorism or child pornography. I guess buying them for cash is one method but if the authorities want to catch you, they will, and don't forget all records are kept on the Blockchain FOR ETERNITY.

Spot price is the actual price an asset is trading for on an exchange. People who buy off exchange OTC (over the counter), or peer to peer (p2p) usually pay a premium (or sometimes a discount) relative to spot price. So I might advertise to sell some Btc on LocalBitcoins for a 4% premium over spot, meaning I'm charging 4% higher than the price on the exchange. Or I might respond to someone's advert on bitcoin offering to buy my bitcoins at a 1% discount. All relative to 'spot price' or 0.

Most people use an index. Which will be made up of a weighted mixture of multiple exchanges. For example coin desk is an index. It's the same as commodities. There is no central agency for gold I don't believe, the 'official price' of gold will be an index too. Made up of several different markets where the exchange of gold takes place. Since gold is considerably more liquid than bitcoin and gold exchanging institutions have no problems with banking relationships the prices between exchanges are usually a lot closer, meaning far less arbitrage opportunity because money flows a lot easier between exchanges when there is an arbitrage opportunity.

When you 'own' bitcoins somewhere, in reality the coins aren't physically anywhere. Reall what you own is units on a shared ledger. Your 'account' is represented by a public key on this ledger. All you're doing by having a wallet is preserving the private keys to that public address which means you can proved to the network that you own those coins and move them. Trezor and all wallets are essentially password managers to the Blockchain so you can prove you own those entries on the ledger.

If you sent all the little bits of bitcoin to the same wallet it will have consolidated them into an overall balance even though they're probably all stored in different addresses. I really don't see the point in sending them all to one address though. You would consolidate your btc into one single input in one address but you'll have to pay a transaction fee to do that and right now fees are high. I would probably just leave it.

If you mean viabtc accelerator then they only give 100 transactions an hour and the 100 new transactions becsoen available exactly on the hour but get filled within 30 seconds so you need to be ready to submit it at exactly one second past the hour. 
If you're the sender then CPFP only works if you have a change output as part of the unconfirmed transaction in your wallet. Do you know if this is the case? Have you enabled custom fees? I set a fee of 0.1btc on a transaction just a few days ago to get a huge chain of unconfirmed transactions to confirm so I can't see how it's not working. Does electrum still allow you to send coins from a specific address in your wallet? Maybe try just sending the change output alone. Customer fees is definitely enabled though yes?

Just to clarify, I wasn't backing a 2mb blocksize increase per se, just the notion that it's been 'agreed' to, and violating this agreement could cause more of a systemic risk to bitcoin than node centralisation. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but if we don't follow through with the 2mb I believe there's going to be fireworks.

Firstly enable custom fees in settings in electrum. 
Next look at the transaction on the Blockchain. There's a 90% chance that you will see that along with the amount you were sending to the destination address that your wallet also sent another amount to another address at the same time. This is the 'change' and it should have been sent to an address in your own wallets. Either send this particular amount of coin to yourself again or easier, just send the whole balance of your wallet to yourself again. Use a VERY GENEROUS custom fee if you want it confirmed in the next block. 
Note: if you look on the Blockchain and see there is no change transaction then this won't work.

Good call on the crumpling. However I'm not sure what you think is funny about the first part. I'm not just going to take someone's word on something. I want to know the whole story was true and it's a genuine person. I'm not trying to denigrate Costa Rica. 
I should add; I don't want to see your face.

You're deliberately taking his comment out of context. He clearly means that they're too cheap compared to legacy transactions.

Ok thanks for your opinion.

My suspicion is that you're the fall guy. Ie they're sending you filthy money to send them btc in exchange. 
However, there's a chance that their business model just doesn't work because they can't get a bank account for the company, which is very plausible. I worked for a company with over €10million euros in assets and we couldn't get a bank account. That's the only legit reason I can think of for using your account. I'd ask them why they don't just have one big company account and unless they give this exact answer I'd bail. 
As far as your liability goes, you have responsibilities to do due silligence, you're probably classed as some kind of financially regulated business too. If you do the due diligence with them to find out where the money's coming from and get some legal advice to find out if you need to pay attention to any specific regulations (which you probably do). Don't necessarily drop it like a hot potato, but you sound like you haven't done enough due silligence. If they're legit and you explain you just want to be sure before you pour your heart and soul into the role, I'm sure they'll understand. Just be prepared that it might well be illegal. 
Edit: I think a better description would be a contractor for them, as oppose to an employee. Certainly that's the way authorities would look at it.

Thanks. I always have time for Andreas. I was lucky to meet him one on one while he stayed at a friends house. Whether he's right or wrong he oozes sincerity.

I'm curious what they consider a large amount of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:47:12
Oh great, so bitcoin does still work as a payment network. Fancy that! No problem.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:17:09
Electrum probably. Write down your 13 words and you're good to go. I would argue it's a lot more secure than Blockchain.info and you're far less likely to lose access.

Buy 0.2 now, then buy 0.1 more every week. That or any method you prefer that averages your buy cost over a longer period. Or if you aren't short on money, and losing 50% or more or the value of your investment doesn't scare you then just fuck it and buy one now, but don't even try and trade it, just hold it and never ever sell it.

I'm a LocalBitcoins trader in the UK for the last 5 years. Using a bank is questionable since the risk of having it blocked is high. Send me an inbox and I'll link you to my profile and contact details.

Being a "node" means you have a personal copy of the blockchain yourself. Most wallets don't actually have a copy of the blockchain (it's pretty big ~1Tb). They connect to trusted nodes to check their balances and broadcast transactions. In 99% of cases this is fine security wise, but obviously the ultimate set up is to have you're own personally validated copy of the blickchain.

Withdrawn 7 times the past 10 days. All above $1000, all arrived within 10 mins. I also had 6 eth stuck after they disabled deposits and I'd already sent the coins. After 2 days of withdrawals coming back online (and a new different eth deposit address, worringly) they were credited to my account. Still waiting on a reply from the ticket though. I wouldn't worry yet, they're likely just swamped.

If there's even the possibility then surely you should recover the wallets ON A SAFE MACHINE, and then ON THAT SAFE MACHINE, create new wallets and move your coins. They could have installed a key logger or anything. Be careful.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:57:30
Either you had more than 30btc in your wallet aside from the $12 or you sent it from a wallet you don't control keys to, and they sent it from a wallet that had more than 30btc in. Like bitstamp or LocalBitcoins for example.

Wait till exactly one second past the hour and submit it to the viabtc accelerator. They offer 100 free spaces every hour but they fill up within 30 seconds so you need to be ready at exactly on the hour.

You can create a non-persistent tails USB and generate the seed on electrum which is pre-installed. At least in theory the wallet file should be gone after you shutdown. Just make sure you verify the tails ISO image. I did this for years. For at least 12 months I didn't even have it written down because two other members of my family had it memorised along with myself. Kept pretty much all my funds on it too. True story.
Edit: after three people had it comfortably memorised (actually really easy) having the paper seed backup around made it feel insecure so I decided to burn it. Extremely strange sensation burning the only physical copy in existence of your wallet backup for a very significant number of bitcoins. I've moved on to a trezor now (I keep a paper backup of the seed but I memorised the 24 word seed anyway), but we all still remember the electrum seed and we can and have used it as a secret code/cypher between the three of us. Actually pretty cool.

Blockchain.info is not the most highly rated wallet by real bitcoin ethudiasts. There are a lot of horror stories and several aweful experiences I personally have had. A client like electrum is probably more recommended in my opinion.

You can't lose bitcoin, it will just go back to the original wallet before transactions were sent if it falls out of the memory pool. I would reccomend sending your total balance to yourself again (into the same wallet, just a new address) but include a VERY generous fee. The miners will look at the fee and average it out with all the previous unconfirmed parents based on weight (satoshis divided by the size in bytes) so considering the first is very large (about 8x bigger than your typical transaction) I would make it quite generous. 
However since it's such a relatively small amount and you control all the wallets maybe the best thing to do is just let it cancel itself and wait.

I ordered a trezor and paid the extra quick delivery and got it next day. Didn't look at other options. That was direct from the manufacturer as well.
Come to think of it I'm going to order a few more right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:13:30
It averages out across all unconfirmed parents no matter how many there are. They all have to be confirmed at the same time you see. One can't be confirmed alone. It's all or nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:14:41
I'm assuming you sent from bitstamp/coinbase/ LocalBitcoins, or a wallet you don't control the actual private keys to then. The rest is their bitcoin. Just the change going elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:44:34
It's been a long time since I used armory but there was definitely a way to bring up a list of all the private keys and public keys side by side, even offline. The only downside is you would have to check each key to see if it has coins in one at a time since change outputs will be sent to a new address each time and each time you clicked receive it would have given you a new address. I know this because I personally did it myself a few years back. You can import the keys into Blockchain.info easily if it's in text form, then transfer it to a more secure and reliable wallet like electrum for example. 
Just make sure you don't miss any addresses. When I came to do mine it was spread out across about 30 addresses. If you used it a lot it could be hundreds. I'm sure there's an easier way to do it if you're a whiz, but it's definitely possible as a simpleton, it just takes time.
