I wonder if they accept bitcoin for drugs too and not because bitcoin is falsely accused for being used for drug dealing and buying but because it's mexico and the cartel and drug problems there are huge

It's obviously a socialist dictatorship that includes "democratic" in it's name to seem a bit different than the rest socialist dictatorships that have happened throughout history but it's the same old shit killing millions of human beings

Politically socialist, economically capitalist because otherwise their system would be unsustainable

Why only coinbase? Why not disq or localbitcoins? Sites that don't require a bunch of personally identifiable information

I've got something very important to say about this and that is i live in Venezuela, a country taken over by socialism an authoritarian leftist regime that won't allow the private industry and free market to grow but they all want the money for themselves and let me tell all of you that SOCIALISM is indeed DEATH.
P.S when you talk about the reality that the country is going through and you publically go agaisn't the gobverment they will put you in jail and they also recently killed a politician and said he killed himself but that's a lie to cover that murder

They should have converted all that money into bitcoin in 2011 
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:38:56
You can still avoid taxes with bitcoin

I live in venezuela and they are the most wanted just because the gobverment doesn't want anyone making money and also because the gobverment in itself mines cryptocurrencies and they don't want any competition

I live in Venezuela and this country has been disemboweled by socialism, if you don't believe me then go and look for videos, photos and news about how people are dying in here because of lack of medicines, food and also the prices are all sky high and that was directly cause by the socialist dictatorship we have here. Socialism IS death

Socialism and corruption go hand in hand and also what a "coincidence" that the gobverment of my country is socialist but it's also corrupt and a dictatorship, basically shut up you fucking communist scumbag that doesn't want to see reality for what it is
