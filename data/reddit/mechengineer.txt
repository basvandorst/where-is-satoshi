Telling people can make it into a self-fulfilling prophecy, if people believe him.

Tianhe-I was never the top super computer in the world.  At its debut in October 2009, it ranked only 5th.  The updated version, Tianhe-1A, was released in October 2010 and is presently ranked as the top supercomputer.  Tianhe-1A, however, uses 7168 NVIDIA M2050 GPUs (as well as a bunch of Xeons).

[Logistic functions]( are better for modelling things like techology adoption and population growth.  You seem to already have figured it out, but just lacked the proper name for the function type you were describing.

Nah, they won't close your account for that, they'll just freeze your assets for 180 days and make it so that:
* You are never again able to act as a seller
* You are never able to close your account (they retain all your banking information, etc.)

Actually, they do owe something...particularly in large, sparse countries like the USA and Canada.  If the government were unable to provide roads, electricity, and other services to remote areas, nobody would live there.  The problems for city-folk come along when 1) they need resources from the far reaches of the country, and 2) other countries eye those resources and begin to question the international legality of the country's borders since nobody is even living there.
