They are easier in terms of development cost.
The hard part is to convince people to upgrade to new software.
But since we are going to hardfork anyway, I find wise to push all the changes through a single hard fork and avoid coding a complex soft fork.

It says INDIVIDUAL transactions happen "without creating a on-blockchain transaction". They are real bitcoin txs since you need to sign them using the PRIVATE KEY or else you will NOT be able to spend the coins, and the balance of your tx is eventually recorded on the chain, when the channel closes. Even LN needs bigger blocks to function better, and we will eventually hardfork to 2mb of NON-WITNESS data. If you want cheaper transactions, just jump to a segwit enabled wallet once segwit SF  aactivates. So calm down and watch bitcoin change the world.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:48:01
Still none has explained what happened with bitcoin.org,also theymos made a thread on that on bitcointalk.org. Maybe they will explain after the dust clears.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:20:53
I have spent so much effort to explain that LN txs are real txs and will also get 
a capacity increase excluding segwit,only to recieve a toxic replly of what it is and what it isn't. Your words contradict reality.

The ultimate question:
Will we need to download the entire 80GB blockchain for the initial sync, or the 30GB Mimblewimble chain will be enough?
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:29:17
They are doing it to compensate for their ETC replay attack loses.
After BFX hack, they received an influx of new users to point they servers couldn't handle the traffic, so no need for them to worry for loosing customers.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:17:48
Since none has opened his mouth yet, this lies in the "speculation category", unless you have backstage info...
@_date: 2016-08-28 21:47:49
You will need to trust the 3rd party pruned blockchain.
Unless you managed to find a way to sync, without downloading and verifying every block which would be a major breakthrough...

@_date: 2016-08-05 20:12:01
So we will get lots of new stuff on top of max block size limit...
But why didn't we deploy segwit as a hardfork which would be easier/safer?
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:15:45
I'm just curious... I once read aproposal on that... It was too technical for me to follow.

@_date: 2016-08-31 17:20:36
Note that your transaction is a bif trascaction. Typically transactios are about 500 bytes big. Your is 11581 bytes, or roughly 23 times larger, whice means you need to pay 23x the typical fee rate to get the transaction in a block in reasonable time. Note that a segwit transaction would make your transaction much smaller, as the signatures would be saved in the witness space.
Also, with Schnorr signatures, you could combinne multiple signatures to save even more space... 
You should be proud of your transaction, because while it is BIG, it burned 78 UTXOs while creating only 2!
@_date: 2016-08-28 14:09:01

**Don't do it.** This will lower the level of security of your full node, because you will need to trust the downloaded blockchain.
On top of that, this is pointless since you already have the blockchain yourrself, you only need to prune it.
just run bitcoind with -prune=550, 
or better add prune=550 in bitcoin.conf...
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:19:14
Actually my .bitcoin folder is 2.2GB with prune=550, so u/mustyoshi was right.
The utxo is needed to know the balance of each address, and thus it is necessary to verify new blocks.

If their transactions don't confirm almost immediately, their support will get REKT from ignorant kids complaining about &gt;20 minute wait times.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:53:02
How do you expect setting up a pruned node in under an hour?
Pruning still requires downloading the massive blockchain and verifying each transaction since the genesis block. There are NO magical solutions, full nodes operate in a trust-less way, by verifying everything.
Any technical source backing that kind of improvement?

I think that as the fees increase and the decentralization stays the same, the sweat spot of the maximum block size gets higher. Of course that's something that the community collectively should decide.

Bitcoin exchanges all over the world are experiencing verification backlogs due to surge in demand. New money can't buy bitcoin because exchanges couldn't adapt to the sudden inlux on new users. The backlogs will eventually clear.
From Bitstamp some hours ago:
Verification process
To speed up the verification process, we have partnered up with two external automatic verification providers. And the integration of both providers into our work flow has already resulted in daily approved customer accounts rising by 100%."
Is that enough to you?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:35:43
Buying bitcoin today is harder than it used to be months ago because the exchanges cannot even clear that backlog of new users. People on Bitstamp from late November 2017 are still on the backlog. Deposits are backlogged too.

There is a consnsus rule that caps the block size at 1MB, in order to limit resource usage. Thus, there is a 3.5 tps tx limit, 7tps with segwit. 7tps is nothing near VISA, mastercard or paypal. That limitation has led to increased transaction fees. It used to be possible to send a 0 fee transaction. Realistically, it was sub $0.05.

Stripe were among the big names that supported bitcoin. It looks like that lightning is mainly good for micropayments and segwit wouldn't be enough even if it were adopted yesterday. Bitcoin value has appreciated by an order of magnitude. Hundreds of thousand people register on exchanges every day. But the system can only process 350k-700k transactions. Plain and simple, that's not enough.   That's the hard truth.
What boggles me down is that while the blocksize stay the same, the fees can get **arbitrarily** high. Thus, the price to pay for decentralization (static blocksize) is dynamic (fluctuating) depending on demand.
Without giving credit to the fake satoshi, "other sub" Bcash minons, I think it would now be wise to start a dialogue in the community for a change.A change to solve the problem. A change to the real, decentralized coin. 


We got work to do guys.

2) You need ram. preferably more than 4 gigs. 8 is good, 16+ ideal. An ssd is also a plus.
Run it with command line 	-dbcache=3000 or more depending on ram. CPU is no more a bottleneck after Core switched to libsecp256k1. A low end cpu will do.

There are two reasons afaik.
Furst a small block takes much less time to verify.
And since the fees make up only a small fractions of the total gains, there is low incentive to include the transactions in a block.
Secondly, some miners are SPV mining. They will not be able to 
include transactions, but they can mine on top of the block headers.
SPV mining requires only an SPV wallet, which is much less expensive to run compared to a full node implementation.

Well the main reason is that we will eventually end up with two discrete UTXO sets, because we need an old one to maintain compatibility. A clean hard fork would have only one utxo database at the cost of compatibility with old nodes (and thus the hard fork).
At least, this is what the people in rbtc are saying, among other things. They keep fighting segwit for polical reasons, and pumping altcoins. It's hard to tell whether or not this is a valid argument, or just a political tool.

Well each node has to make many utxo look ups 
to verify a block. This means we need to store it in fast memory, ideally RAM.
The utxo set is roughly doubling every year, and we reached a point where many low ram nodes are caching parts of the utxo set out of ram. If you have an hdd, you get a performance hit, which is bad if you're a miner. And the UTXO will continue growing even if we don't fork the chain for a bigger size.
The only thing we actually have is segwit, but I don't know to what extent it will help. We'll see.

I think that very few people hold a copy of the ETH blockchain, and eventually the blockchain will be lost forever. The question is, does it matter? Does the market care?


Ethereum development is largely centralized anyway, why would loosing the history hurt that much? IIRC the same happened with Ripple years ago, when a server had a data failure and they din't have a backup!
I firmly believe that discarding the history will be essential if you want to scale at greater transaction rates. Bitcoin will also be getting similar -fast sync features in the future. It is called UTXO  commitments.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:53:05
It looks like you are condusing block headers with blocks.
A block header is an 80-byte chunk of data inside a block, containing information of that block and past blocks.
Block headers contain the merkle root hash of the transactions in the given block. Thus, only the chain of the block headers is required to establish **SPV** security.
No matter how big a block gets, its header will *always* be 80 bytes long.
At 10\*24\*365 blocks per year, the block headers will grow by 10\*24\*365\*80 bytes per year
or roughly 4.2 MB annualy.
The image above shows the total blockchain size over time, icluding each block in whole.
Currently a typical block is almost one million bytes, or four orders of magnitude bigger than its header. As the blocks get bigger and bigger while their headers stay at 80 bytes, that difference is only going to get greater and greater.
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:27:00
This is what op said. We are coming up on a limit.
Fees are not fine. I didn't say fees are fine. Despite the fact fees are on the rise, we are doing good. This is what I said. Also, people are willing to pay those higher fees. See? 350,000 transactions in a day. 
They should get lower, given segwit activation. Segwit would have already been activated without this meaningless fight. People used to complain how sw will take too much time.  Now that sw code has hit the realeases, they are complaining how segwit is bad.

Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin is computer code:
* Globally transferable (Doesn't care of borders)
* Globally accepted (You will find merchants accepting bitoin in almost any country )
* Fast (Settlements happen every 10 minutes)
* Very cheap tranfers for larger sums. (Send $1000 and pay $0.2 in fees, send $1m and pay the same. )
* Does't discriminate (Doesn't matter who you are, where you are, what God you believe in or your sexual preferences )
* Censorship-resistant, anti-fragile  ( You cannot ban free software.[1] It's the BitTorrent of money)
* The economic policy in bitcoin is governed by software, cannot be changed. Cannot print money out of thin air. 
* Pseudonymous ( The blockchain is transparent but if you don't publish your address you will retain privacy. )
* You own your money, not the banks. Traditionally banks operate on fractional reserves, meaning in the case of a bank run the bank will not be able to return money to everyone. ) 
* Sending money from A to B is just one use case. Bitcoin can leverage the blockchain to achieve complex refund scripts and smart contracts without middlemen and lawyers, that are just not possible with traditional money.
* Overall It is a very hot research area like AI (machine learning...)

[...]Tether claimed that the supply of tethers would not increase until their banking problem was solved, yet the supply of Tethers has actually increased by 482% since this announcement.
From July 2017 to August 2017, the supply of Tethers has increased by over $100,000,000 ‘USD’.

Well 'market manipulation' costs money and the spam will eventually clear up  to reveal the real volume.
But the above chart shows a never ending UP trend.
Bitcoin is clearly getting more and more popular which I find
a better metric than price, which can be exaggerated/inflated with hype.
Well of course we want to get rich don't we? But we shouldn't treat bitcoin as a get-rich-fast scheme. We should rather treat it as a way to change the world we live in.

I can't describe my frustration with words.
Back in 2013 everyone was like:"Ohh come on! Blockchain is not an issue! We can prune it! Don't worry!" 
Now, three years later we are stuck on an endless toxic debate. 
Of course we need to download every block anyway, but there are proposals to commit the blockchain state(aka UTXO set) to each block, making the "IBD" as you call it irrelevant(albeit with slightly reduced security).
Now that compact block relay is up and running you magically started to care about IBD.
There is no need to store every spam and coffe tx for ever. Eventually we need to forget about them.

@_date: 2016-11-04 10:26:39
Yeah because there are many other crappy blockchains, not big enough to make scalability an issue. 
It's like the economy of scale doesn't apply to blockchain growth. 
Bitcoin will always be the most scalable chain provided that the development team integrates new developments.
It's not that bitcoin is loosing groud. It's just that the total market cap includes more and more diversified blockchains, aiming to do other things than just (barely programmable) internet money.
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:50:21
I have never heard someone lost any bitcoin due to the low security of SPV wallets.
SPV wallets privacy could be easily enhanced through encryption and TOR.


This lies on the verge of altruism, since there are already some nodes running, why bother with one more?
In my opinion the costs of running a full node don't justify the benefits over an SPV wallet.

@_date: 2016-12-13 20:56:33
First of all, you shouldn't.
Your node will end up only validating and updating the utxo cache.
While the security level will not be affected, you will not be contributing to the network by uploading older blocks.
If you are fine with that, or you don't have the space and bandwidth to help the nework,
put this in bitcoin.conf: prune=550

@_date: 2016-12-11 14:35:53
It makes sense. You can verify that a particular transaction happened in a particular block by using the merkle root hash in the block header, without even getting the entire block. This is described in the section 8 of the whitepaper.
It is called SPV (Simplified Payment Verification).
Although very efficient, it is less secure compared to a full client.
 
Electrum is a popular SPV client. The headers are stored in the blockchain_headers file currently 35.4 MB.
Bitcoin Core is a full client, meaning it will download and verify the entire chain ~100 GB.

1. As long as miners don't include fake witness data(which they shouldn't cause this will make their blocks larger/longer to propagate without making any more profit), the segwit  blocks will be at 2.2 MB maximum.
2. With segwit2x that would be at 4.4 MB. 
3. It will also take a while for the ecosystem to upgrade.
Your link appears to point at a 404 error page, I had to turn to google for the actual paper [1].
It indeed says "The block size should not exceed 4MB, given today’s 10 min. average block interval" 
4. It was done with one year old hardware prices in mind.
And most importantly:
5. There is No reference to IBLT technology. That is because the bitcoin client didn't adopt the IBLT/Compact Bock/Xthin feature which **significantly reduces the block propagation latency**. (A big thank you to the Core team for this)
To conclude, the maximum blocksize can safely get higher than 4MB, certainly within the limits of S2X.
The problem with 2X is the **corporate takeover without community consent.**

ALL these tutorials are outdated, because you NO longer need to compile core to run on the pi.(as of 0.13 released last month)
Running a bitcoin node in MUCH easier now.
Steps. 
1) Download bitcoin-0.13.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz from bitcoin.org or any other source, and VERIFY
These are the exact instructions
2) bitcoin.org instructions --&gt; 
Note that core devs decided to compile without gui, so only bitcoin-qt here. only command line. However it will still be a full node, and you will be able to interact with bitcoin-cli getinfo and bitcoin-cli stop.

The later the establishment interferes with bitcoin, the better. We should fight to prevent them from enforcing a new controlled digital currency. If you want to interface with the 'distributed ledger', bitcoin is the eway to go!!!
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:36:03
well you can prune the blockchain before you evven start downloading. just add prune=550 in your bitcoin.conf
It will take almost a month for the pi sync the whole blockchain (pi is weak).
I recommend syncing the chain to your pc and then transferring to the pi.
@_date: 2016-09-22 03:18:13
Haha that's a late one!
You will download the entire blockchain but 'old parts' get deleted before the sync ends, so the total space needed is less than 5 GB, maybe ~3GB, I don't really remember...
You will need to set up raspbian.
Then you will need to get and verify Core 0.13(Only the 0.13 version has ARM builds for the PI)
Get the ARM linux 32 bit image(PI3 is the only 64 bit capable PI, but Raspian is 32 bit so...)
The instructions to set it up are there... 
And here. 
You will need to SKIP the *Bitcoin Core GUI* part cause the devs did not include GUI build...
Make a file called bitcoin.conf and put it in the bitcoin data directory. The bitcoin data directory is a hidden folder in the home directory named '.bitcoin' .
Add this sample bitcoin.conf in your bitcoin data directory.  
 Add the command 'prune=550' in bitcoin.conf to enable pruning.
You should be able to access the daemon with bitcoin-cli.
There are many bitcoin-cli commands. Be sure to check the connection number.
Normally bitcoin makes up to 8 connections. 
If you want to really help the network and get more you need to port forward bitcoin and assign a static ip to your Pi.
Ohh also note that syncing with the Pi might take A LONG TIME(3 weeks) so you should first syn Core on a PC and then copy the synced data directory to your pi .bicoin folder.
That's it. I hope it helps :P 
I know it's  a bit messed but it will do the job. 
Please let me know how your progress. If you have any questions feel free to ask...

Has Ray Dalio lost the pulse? The founder of the $160 billion hedge fund Bridgewater Associates is all over the place spouting his management philosophy of radical transparency. He has been making TV appearances, attending conferences, and whenever possible plugging his new book, “Principles.” There’s even a TED talk touting his “believability-weighted idea meritocracy”—whatever that means. And now Mr. Dalio is trying to bust into China to manage even more money.
The investment whiz lives and manages by a set of principles that employees have to memorize. The list is filled with gems you might encounter at a silent yoga retreat. “Most problems are potential improvements screaming at you.” Or this reworked cliché: “While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.”
Speaking of pain, Bridgewater is losing money this year. Through July its flagship fund is down 3%, while the market is up more than 10%. Does this transparency stuff even work? Bridgewater videotapes every meeting and arms workers with iPads filled with apps like the emotion-relief Pain Button and the co-worker-rating Dot Collector. Mr. Dalio must figure that only under these conditions will employees tell the truth instead of what he wants to hear. Maybe this is all a distraction. But you’ve got to be a little cuckoo to run a giant hedge fund, and I think Mr. Dalio is crazy like a fox.
The core of investing is quite simple: Determine what everyone else thinks, and then figure out in which direction they are wrong. That’s it. No one tells you what they think. You’ve got to feel it. That’s why Wall Streeters say things like, “We are lowering our above consensus expectations earnings estimates.” It’s all about figuring out what is priced into a stock right now. That’s the pulse of the market, the collective mind meld aggregated into stock prices. I know from experience this is the hardest part of running a hedge fund. You can find the greatest story ever, but if everyone already knows it, there’s no money to be made.
And the pulse changes with each government statistic, each daily ringing of cash registers and satellite images taken of parking lots. That’s why stocks trade every day. Real-world inputs and the drifting pulse drive the psychotic tick of the stock market tape. Once you feel the pulse, then and only then can you figure out how everyone’s wrong about tomorrow, next month or next year. And believe me, they’re always wrong. Stocks rarely tread water.
How do you find that pulse? It’s hard enough to invest your IRA. Can you image managing $160 billion? Wall Street analysts have earnings estimates that no one trusts. There are whisper numbers and the chaos of message boards and tweets.
It’s best to survey your own people. That’s why Bridgewater has some 1,700 employees. A friend of mine learned you have to take a Myers-Briggs personality test before Bridgewater bothers to interview you. He was told he was “not right for the job.” But it turns out that only a tiny handful of employees make any of the investment decisions anyway. Clearly Mr. Dalio doesn’t trust them, so he tries to remove their biases surgically, hence the radical transparency and the illusion of a meritocracy. Mr. Dalio doesn’t care about employees’ opinions or ideas; he just wants to take their pulse to figure out what the market already knows. Or as he puts it: “The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively.”
This is not uncommon. I once visited the Wall Street offices of a well-known hedge fund guy you see on TV. He pulled me aside, pointed to his employees, and said, “You see these people? They might as well be holograms.” He made every buy-and-sell decision himself.
Mr. Dalio is a great success story. His terrific returns attracted $160 billion in assets. But these things work until they don’t work. Wall Street is littered this year with the roadkill of busted hedge funds. Pine River, Passport and Greenlight are downsizing involuntarily, meaning investors are redeeming their money from funds with awful returns. Others, like Seth Klarman’s Baupost, are returning money because of “limited investment opportunities.”
Too much capital is often a burden. There are only so many good investment ideas out there, and it’s late in this cycle. Mr. Dalio’s principles are unique but probably not applicable to many other businesses. As he says: “Truth—more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality—is the essential foundation for any good outcomes.” Here’s a truth: If Bridgewater has lost its mojo, Mr. Dalio would be smart to manage a much smaller pot of money rather than torture his employees.

1) Convert your seed in binary form.
2) Generate a pseudorandom binary number with the same number of digits as your seed.
3) XOR the random number with your seed.
Now you should have 3 binary numbers;
Cold Wallet Seed, Random Number, and XORed number, each with equal bit length.
XORing the Random number again with the XORed number, will give back your Wallet Seed.
4) Forget your cold wallet seed. Just keep the Random Number and the XORed number.
Let's Call them S1 and S2 for simplicity.
5) Give S1 and S2 to two trusted third parties respectively.
Since the S1 and S2 have the same bit length than the original seed I guess this doesn't degrade security.
While this is very technical, it could be standardized to be more user friendly.

There are 2 options. Sidechain or Altcoin.

The pi 2 is a 32 bit device and Raspbian is also 32 bit only. Make sure you run 32 bit binaries.

I think the worst thing about SW-2MB was that everyone interpreted the agreement fitting his own narrative. We need to be dead clear, preferably with code and not text. 
I don't care how segwit gets adopted, but after some months of stalling, the fact that bitmain signed the agreement is very suspicious.

It is long FUD at all. SegWit is not active as of now, did not even lock in as of now. That means there is a non-trivial chance that segwit will not get activated, because only the miners are running bipp-91 software. And we are not even sure about that. Nothing is over.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:51:02

It is roughly three weeks. In two days, miners are supposed to stop mining on top of any non-segwit signaling block.(BIP148)
If everything goes as planned, segwit will lock-in for activation in roughly three weeks. We are now in BIP148 signaling period 19. It is mathematically impossible to lock-in SW in that period. So Segwit is supposed to lock-in block 479808, when period 20 ends.

Ethereum is 90% speculation. Ethereum is using features that bitcoin hadd since 2009. I mean even Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the scripting possibilities, but restricted bitcoin script to very special uses. Keeping an ethereum node running will soon be more expensive a from bitcoin.  Look at the node trends.
Turing completeness comes to a cost. And when you are considering investing in an altcoin, you do it for the long term.
It might work as centralised system though, it will still have some value, but bitcoin has noothing to fear from a coin prone to blacklisting addresses from thefts. Coindesk pusses their own agenda just like blockstream does. But you dont seem treating both with the same skepticism....

*"Microsoft is already seen as a trailblazer in the blockchain space and customers are looking to us to make blockchain ready for wide enterprise adoption. We need to move quickly to maintain our momentum."*
Blockchain is ready for custommers. It's called bitcoin.
It looks obvious that Micro$oft wants its own propiertary blockchain solution, outside of the bitcoin ecosystem.
There is no need for Micro$oft to move quickly, it's a dead company. Failed to enter the smartphone market, their new Windows 10 OS is free because this is the only way micro$oft fool people into installing their Operating Spyware™ crap.
The real innovation doesn't happen inside a company like micro$oft, it happens in the bitcoin forums, and irc channels...
"We need to move quickly to maintain our momentum."  = "We need to move quickly to establish our blockchain solutions over the competitors."

If you can't have "Private, censorship-resistant online transactions" then you are not Bitcoin.
If you can't have transactions, then you can't be money in the first place.
That was my point.
I am a bitcoin enthusiast, but I would like to see some real scaling solutions there before I claim that "Bitcoin will change the world".
A 3 tps network simply can't be global money. We need many orders of magnitute higher than that. And simply increasing the blocksize will not do. High block propagation times is a big issue and even with compact blocks, I would argue that we can do only 4MB blocks. Not enought. My only hope is the so-called "Lighting Network" but nothing is perfect, even LN will need bigger blocks. Future will only tell...
@_date: 2016-07-10 10:11:02

They think that segwit is bad, and the 2mb block hardfork that comes with segwit2x is not worth it.

@_date: 2016-07-10 11:16:37
I can see...
At least the end of Moore's law is close. 10nm is possible, but I heard that 7nm will be hard. As the pace at which ASICs are advancing slows down, I guess it will become easier and cheaper to design chips as they will keep up longer.That will let more "players enter the field"
After that, price of  aelectricitynd cooling will be an important factor, and I guess there are colder places than China....

Well I think the cheapest option is to use an SBC.(Single Board Computer).
Currently the most popular is by far the Raspberry Pi.
But since it has only 1 GB RAM, you will have a hard time syncing the chain of blocks. RAM is a ajor bottleneck. There exists however an alternative to the the popular and community-supported Pi, the Odroid C2 with 2GB RAM and a faster processor. I guess the Odroid can sync the blockchain in less than 10 days, while the Pi takes 3 weeks. I recommend running a pruned node to minimize the costs of the sd card. a 16 GB card will do fine. I run my Raspberry Pi node on an 8GB card with most of the "extras" removed to free up space. In case you  go with a Pi, see here how to free up space from raspbian. 
I synced the blockchain on my ubuntu laptop and then copied the syncced chain on the Pi to spped up things a bit :P.
Currently I have 15 connections!

I think it will go up building on rumors of the end of the scaling debate as miners gear up for segwit2x. Segwit will get activated before the UASF split.

I acknowledge that. But it is not acctivated, nothing changed, we are stuck on status quo.
