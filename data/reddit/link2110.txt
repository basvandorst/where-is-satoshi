I just did this, I doubled my BTC. Totally legit. 
0 BTC x 2 = 0 BTC. Math checks out guys.

WHY ARE YOU EVERYWHERE? HOW ARE YOU EVERYWHERE?
And I don't mean replying to the comment, I'm almost certain that you've got multiple years of gold at this point. It's just that you are active in like every sub that I read lol

Essentially, too long. If/when BFL ships this, if you placed an order today, by the time you got it, it would take you anywhere between 3 months to over 2 years to make back your investment. 3 months being super optimistic and 2 years being more realistic imo. Read reply for reasons why, he explains it pretty well.

I have blockchain, I was pretty much thinking the same thing. Show up/meet up, show that you have the cash, get them to send the coins, verify that you got them, give money, leave. Kinda like CL with a verification step in there.

you didn't read the second part, did you?
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:33:44
Why? I was just thinking somewhere public, like a park/coffee shop etc.

LS have been stuck in mid november for well over a month now. Don't expect them to ship out anytime soon. Also I assume you mean Feb 2013.
