Lol I think the main point is that you can use it there, people find anything to complain about.

I know but it is the hassle of converting constantly to bitcoin that deters so many, including myself.

Fair enough, I was actually at the bar last night due to them hosting a crypto event. Ironically, nearly no one in Malta's Bitcoin club would spend their bitcoin, because they believe it will be worth so much more in the future.
I think that is the real problem facing adoption. Only time will fix that, along with a massive increase in price, or else no one will ever use it, due to the speculation that it will be worth more once everyone wants it in the future.

Can I use Bitwage as an employee, even if my employer does not offer the service?

Well not bad considering its been open 3 weeks ! New owners, closed for months.

Yes exactly! What I am looking for is somewhere I can buy more so commodities with bitcoin (stocks after crash), even if it just paper. I know I am being a bit all over the place in my replies but I am not that familiar with this kind of thing.
Eg If I want to buy uranium to be able to buy my document saying I own it, with Bitcoin. With no fractional reserve banking esq going on, if you get me?

I mean like say i buy paper gold on say etoro, if the dollar goes balls up what happens then. If I sell would I get dollars or whatever?

There are blockchain projects that are looking to have proof of ownership etc, think vechain is doing something like that.

Thanks looks like the type of thing im interested in. 
But looks like a bit of a scam!

Thanks, but it is that I want to move away from using fiat for stuff like so.
