Thanks, appreciate it!

Well the fact of the matter is, S9s are second to none. I gotta go with what's going to make me money man. This is a business decision, im not going to use a lesser miner to prove a point. Although, if these dragonmints coming out are legit I'll be happy to switch.

I thought about that, but I feel like my total hash rate is a significant variable. I don't feel like the profits from 4 different pools at smaller h/s would represent what I would make with my total hash rate. If anything I'll just try out a couple out using all the miners. I really feel like slush is the way to go though so it will be the first.

Looks like slush will be my pool of choice. Thanks everyone for your recommendations!

We are talking about actual mining here man. If someone buys one Antminer you are not mining for profit it’s a hobby. I’m talking about actually investing in it as a business and putting up some dough. I wouldn’t consider myself a miner with one S9 in your scenario. 
That being said, I invested $60,000 into my mining operation. Now ask me if I would rather buy $60k worth of btc or take my mining operation. I would take my mining operation. I suppose in the end it’s a matter of opinion on which is a better investment. I just think mining is if you plan on putting actual money and effort into it.

China probably accounts for a little over half the hash rate, they will keep it afloat. Electricity is damn near free over there so they can profit at low btc prices. Not to mention difficulty will drop. Hell, it’s possible I can mine at $1700 if there are enough people that have a higher electricity rate which will make them quit mining before I have to. Who knows, but I’m not worried. The price will bounce back eventually. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:49:37
China is pretty damn cheap. Not free, but cheaper than most countries.

I think what Duality means is although with mining you are more dependent on crypto sticking around there is better chance of return. Let’s say you invested in btc when it was at $16,000. Well now you are at a loss vs mining where the price obviously matters but you will make a profit regardless of what that price is. Even though btc is down I’m still making just under $400 a day. If it goes back up to $16,000 I’m back to making $800 a day. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:15:54
So let’s say you have ten miners that are not making a profit so you double the amount of miners. Yea, you have double the hash rate but you also have double the electrical costs making twenty miners at the same loss as ten. Savvy? 
Although, this does work in the current state of mining because there is a profit to be made. I’m  going to double up my operation, but not to stay afloat. It’s more for the future profits.

I can vouch for this. I run 24 S9s and make plenty. Unless of course you consider 24 miners big. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:08:24
I personally run 24 Antminer S9s. I’ll run these bad boys until I start to break even. Plus there are a ton of people that are just now receiving their miner shipment from when they bought back in December when prices and profits were up. If this continues and the price moves down to around 3k you will see a fat drop in hash rate. At least, that’s when I will shut my Mining operation down until prices go back up. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:38:18
Depends, right now I’m keeping it until the price goes up. I sell on the exchange 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:16:24
Only if you buy miners and leave your operation stagnant. If you only take a little profit starting out and put the rest of the profits into more miners, I’m not so sure. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:46:31
I agree! I guess what I was getting at is I think people are buying more miners believing that mining profitability will increase in the future, not so much to stay afloat.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:06:53
Not really. As long as you don’t take all the mining profits and reinvest in more miners, keeping up with the difficulty isn’t a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:31:38
Yea but your scenario is assuming you won’t reinvest in more miners. If you reinvest in miners and consider your first two scenarios you can forget about it. Especially the first one, in which I would be able to not only at least triple my operation but also make more a day as the year goes on? Consider the second scenario and I can still easily keep ahead of the difficulty. The third is obviously a loss for everyone. Not to mention that mining is basically passive income. Take a little off the top for some fun money and put the rest into more miners.
Edit: I already said it was riskier upfront, just more likely to see profit on a consistent basis.

Because this is far more interesting, fun, and lucrative. The roi is nice and after that it’s like I’m getting paid to acquire btc. In times of extreme ups and downs I still make a profit regardless of the price vs investing in btc I have to worry about selling peaks and buying dips. Mining is practically passive income and I’m also helping out btc in general.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:15:45
Well miners need an incentive to mine. Without the rewards for mining nobody would do it and there goes bitcoin down the drain. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:49:54
It’s a fact that hash rates will plummet if mining isn’t profitable. Me personally, I’m not paying $2000 in electricity out of my own pocket to support bitcoin and neither will anyone else. Mining is supposed to be mutually beneficial. I mine and support bitcoin, get paid in bitcoin and then sell it to willing buyers all the while putting more bitcoin into circulation. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:45:32
Yea I suppose I would if it was even, of course I have other bills besides electricity so I at least want to pay those as well. I would hate to have to dip into the emergency fund though. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:37:21
On the exchange 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:53:29
I would still say mining is safer in a time of extreme ups and downs.
