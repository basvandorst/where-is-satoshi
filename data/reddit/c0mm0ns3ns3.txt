China is the most dominant country with regards to Bitcoin - both in Hashrate power as in terms of posession. You guys really think, Bitcoin (price) is independent!? For real? Time to wake up folks

On 15 August 2010 over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol...

Bullshit, here's an answer from a miner:
Hi attacker,
I've reviewed your contract and do not consider it valid. Therefore I am making the decision not to enforce it.
Your refer to the code of your contact as authoritative. This is a fallacy.
According to the code that is responsible for administering your contract - namely, the code that mines the Ethereum network, each miner has complete discretion to decide for himself which transactions to include in a block. As miners we have the ability to decide not to recognize your transactions as valid. You knew this when you made the decision to manipulate the contract, so that was a risk you took, which appears to have backfired.
You are welcome to pursue your case in court. Good luck with that!
A miner

I expect BTC to die ... I don't need anarchist money I'm more into the  blockchain tech and I don't have a Problem with government controlled FIAT money. A harsh opinion which will get downvoted into hell in this sub but well you know it's just my opinion

Nah it has nothing to do with my parents and I'm a fan of more autonomy but I want the best of both worlds compared to some crypto anarchists. Having a government is good, paying taxes is fine, having rules and laws is good, law enforcement et cetera et cetera. Freedom of choice is important too, but freedom in a collective/society needs boundaries an this is where governments come in.

Shall we bet this case won't repeat?

Nah it's all good mate, I'm 100% ETH and thankful for BTC paving the way, but for me it's time to trololololol

I'll admit I'm exaggerating ... as a store of value BTC will remain but not with these ludicrous 250k price predictions
