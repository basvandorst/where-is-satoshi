I would recommend not leaving behind more than one can afford to lose, on an Exchange. They've got advantages. As soon as one's cryptocurrency is in one's account in the exchange start the process of sweeping it into a paper wallet or a hardware wallet.
Just a thought.

What you are doing is trying to speculate and predict the price in the future. The reality is that the price can fluctuate more and at any time.
Best thing to do would be to buy when you have some additional funds.
Always remember: Do not buy more than you can afford to lose.

What you should be doing is the following:
* Go to [bitaddress.org](
* Right click on the page and select "save as". Save to file to a convenient location on the computer.
* Disable Wifi access on your computer. Disconnect the ethernet cable from your computer.
* Shutdown the system.
* Restart the system while the wifi is disabled. Ensure that the ethernet cable is also disconnected. From now on, you will stay disconnected until the successful completion of 8all8 of the following steps.
* start up the system and log in.
* Locate the file that you saved, above.
* Click on the tab that reads, "Single Wallet". Follow the onscreen instructions.
* After a few minutes, you'd have two strange looking rectangular blocks.
* Print them out WHILE STILL DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET.
* Voila! You  made your first paper wallet!
Repeat above steps for as many wallets that you want. But always follow them strictly in sequence.

Or, putting the man on the moon never really occurred. It was a hoax.
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:11:53
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:18:34
Not really. There are just hiccups.
I look at the long term potential and i think it has a long way to go upwards.
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:31:08
I see this as an epic invention since the wheel and fire. I am also purchasing because one day, I hope my son will turn around and thank me for it. I'm in it for the long term.
Oh! and like you, OP, I'm HODLing too! And I've broken even, too!
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:38:24
Welcome and enjoy the ride. Remember to HODL on tight.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:46:22
You are correct.
I shall keep this in mind for future.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:22:27
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:17:54
Wow! A whole year! Hats off to you!
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:33:23
keep HODLing
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:44:07
Thank you for the correct information. I shall not.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:53:34
Nah. just to get onto the BTC bandwagon.
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:17:20
You should create a paper wallet at bit address.org
Send all of the online btc to the public address of your paper wallet.
You're all set. No fees. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:56:07
I'd say dont go for it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:19:57
I'll plough it back right into another purchase of the awesome bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:02:01
I bought some yesterday (about 18 hours ago! and I'm buying some today (maybe 6 hours hence).
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:47:49
Keep HODLing
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:08:55
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:42:42
Thanks for this example!
Would you recommend doing this kind of stuff with BTC and BTC only?
So, to illustrate suppose the price of BTC climbs by 10%. I now typically have made a profit of 10% (noob to speculation, finance and the markets and it's intricacies). Suppose I use liquidate 5% my total BTC investment and put in an additional 5% to purchase more of bitcoins, would that be a good strategy? (I am assuming that math made sense).
I'm on hodl
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:15:21
Why not just store your cold btc (not being used / required for the immediate) in small fractions on paper wallets? Even accidentally it will never connect to the internet, it does not need batteries, works even when there is a power outage or no internet connection.
Sweep in the amount required into a hot wallet for spending. 
This calls for pre planning what fraction of BTC holding you want on each paper wallet.

I predict BTC will hit the moon in one week
Damn. It's my word against the OPs. Unfortunately i cannot provide any proof (and i'm certain neither can OP) 
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:21:48
What is said BT device breaks? Or is washed away in a flood?
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:44:09
Super. Today I Learned!
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:05:10
Thanks! Didn't see it that way!
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:03:08
Thank you for your time and effort. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:09:08
Super Thanks! That clarifies a lot!

I'm from India too!
It is best to transfer all your coins out of any exchange (Indian or otherwise) and distribute it across paper wallets.
When you want to sell, sweep one (or however many paper wallets you want) and then sell the coins.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:28:32
I've been hodling since my very first BTC purchase transaction, which was in the middle of May 2016.
I propose to hodl for a long time. as in (*at least*) 7 years.
Yes. I see this as a long term investment suitable to be a hand-me-down to my son.
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:18:44
Remember Mt.Gox.
It's not all that difficult to transfer to and from paper.
But Hey! I'm just recommending what i think is correct. You're free to decide on your own!
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:32:06
After doing some reading for about 3 months I was fully sold. I'm a HODLer for the long term. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:13:02
Completed. Felt great!
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:56:10
how is this done? @_date: 2016-06-20 05:44:43
Because we're talking about, *cold, hard cash!!*
(cold - cold storage. Get it?)
Jokes aside, won't we all sleep well every night knowing that our hard earned money is securly in our possession? And that we have full control over it? And that we can transact with it whenever we want?
I know i would!

Since Bitcoin is already here, i'd rename that to:
The future is now. Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-14 11:20:25
multisig means i do not completely own my bitcoins. that is effing dangerous. what if the other side crashes or goes bankrupt or has an invasion or security breach
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:10:51
Thanks for this useful guide.
@_date: 2016-07-19 07:34:49
You mean something [like this]( ?
EDIT: correct frmatting.
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:43:55
Congratulations to you! May your brother make many Bitcoins!!
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:38:34
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:58:06
I think its an excellent idea!!
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:27:43
Then, by your same logic, OP,  why do people have Christopher Columbus day / Founding of US / etc day in the US?
@_date: 2016-07-19 08:15:21
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:06:33
It's peer to peer. No banks and middle men.
 Want something. You got that something I want. Why should a middle man interfere and make money in the process?
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:39:12
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:06:46
It's 100% 
My only investment is in BTC
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:07:18
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:39:44
Is there a standard procedure to follow when BTC sent to wrong address?
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:42:55
If you want to buy Bitcoin using cash, go to LocalBitcoins.com
Please check your local laws and regulations. You may also need an ID.

I knew there was some subtlity i was missing!
Thank 
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:03:15
You should have put a QR code of a wallet of yours. You'd probably get some BTC and the tee would've been more functional.

I think there is!
Bitcoin needs to go mainstream, right now!
