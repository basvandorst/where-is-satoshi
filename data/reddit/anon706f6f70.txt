A hard fork on ad revenue streams.

Great point: How will content creator who is unaware of bitcoin/brave, but uses AdSense on their site, get their cut from Brave replacing their ads?

Who is funding this?

It is coming from a trusted source: Apple. If you're talking about the developer, how would a developer become a trusted developer that would screen out scammers but allow newbies?

OK, I saw that on their site, but I think your reiteration helped clear it up.

Is the main business model really to just replace ads with their own not-so-invasive ads? Why would an advertiser opt for that, other than just to diversify just a little bit more over other major ad programs (ex. AdWords)?
The part about users donating to content providers *sounds* great, but I don't see it being truly viable.
If a user isn't willing to pay for content, what other way is there for a content producers to make money other than paid ads?

If you bought because you believe Bitcoin is going to change the world, then you’re in it for the long term. Hold, forget about it, and came back when it is 100k - 1 mil.
If you bought to play the market and make some quick cash, then this is part of the game, and you’ve got to be OK with the complete unknown of short term swings.

If the people are willing to adopt cryptocurrency over fiat, I bet they'll be fine adopting metric prefixes and the full decimal system.

I love it: "krisives" was criticizing this pull request through satire, but the author consider it at face-value and updated it to support Krisives' idea.
From a developer perspective, the --ignore-hash-code flag is far better than the --dao-soft-fork flag.
From a crypto-currancy perspective, IMHO, it is a terrible idea :).

You know what would make it even more universal? To use the fucking metric prefixes.

Seems reasonable to make simple comparisons like this to help an audience unfamiliar with Bitcoin.
Scientists frequently make "silly" analogies and comparisons when describing new topics. Nearly all quantum analogies to the macro world are very wrong, but it help the layman get a glimpse at the meaning.
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:21:53
I see your point, but I'm not convinced saying "impossible" is better.
There are things that we define as cannot be done. Matter cannot be created. A number cannot be divided by zero. These things are impossible.
You mentioned not confusing people without intimate knowledge of cryptographic probabilities. If you tell them a private key cannot be guessed, or found randomly, then it is a disservice to their understanding.
Teaching them, "the universe will have likely imploded on itself before you guess it" is way cooler anyway :).
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:01:05
Oh man, I don't think anyone suggests using the JS based sites live, on a network attached machine. All of them suggest to disconnect a machine from the network, boot into a temp / no-install OS, and run the scripts locally.
If you don't suggest the same for your CLI program, I would make the same arguments about it... I don't know what you, or Python, or the OS, is saving and potentially reporting.
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:27:15
I think a better analogy for an old 70k address is: you toss the deed to your house in the garbage because you thought it was worthless. The house then becomes valuable and someone found the deed to claim ownership. I think that is OK.
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:11:53
If you haven't already, you can make bip-38 encrypted keys for printing on paper. That way, even if the paper is stolen, there is a layer of security there.
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:22:37
Not impossible, but improbable. I could roll enough dice to create a private key, and that first combination could be the 70k address. Highly, ridiculously improbable, but possible.
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:12:49
And to add to this... create multiple copies of your bip-38 encrypted paper, and spread them out geographically (e.g. in a relative's safe)
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:55:23
Safe deposit box is probably a bad idea for cryptocurrency. Depending on where you live, the safe deposit box may be inaccessible until probate is complete. The contents of the safe deposit box may be of interest to the estate / probate court.
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:22:06
Make it something you'll never forget. I my opinion, it doesn't have to be an overly complex password, as it is just a delay tactic.
The first, main layer of security is your home and safe. If your encrypted paper keys are stolen, you'll have time to acquire your copies, decrypt, and swipe to different keys before the thieves realize what they have and brute force your password.

@_date: 2017-09-24 02:56:23
Yeah, I reviewed that one. I wasn't thrilled about it being JS (dependency on browsers / Node).
There are many script flavors of SSSS, and what scared the shit out of me was that the SSSS I produced by a JS impl (I think it was the one you linked) did not process correctly in a python impl (I forget which I tried in this test).

My point is that we believe segwit should happen independently of other changes, not "segwit is all we need". Iteratively upgrading is the best practice. There is no engineering reason to combine.
Also, If we believe "1MB" is arbitrary, then I think we must believe the same for "2MB".
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:57:45
Don't ask "why not"... ask "why". But for "why not": Less risk in doing one thing at a time, the two are not related, one is tested more than the other, and you're not supposed to compromise or play politics when it comes to critical software.
