How does blockchain, crypto, bitcoin, *et al.* give you back your privacy? Didn't a bunch of really messed up fucks just recently get busted, solely because they used bitcoin?
EDIT: Given the downvotes, I assume there are those that disagree with me on this but no one has bothered to really explain why, so I'm going to take my opinion one step further and say that the blockchain is actually anti-privacy. Every transaction in and out of your wallet is recorded in the blockchain, in perpetude. And anyone with a modicum of understanding and access to the internet or a full node can look up any transaction you make. All I have to do somehow link your name to that wallet and boom, I can see every transaction you have ever made. Can't do that with a bank account

Isn't the first rule of bitcoin "Don't tell anyone how much bitcoin you have"

Are we sure that wasn't meant as an insult?

This time, if it hits 6K, I absolutely positively will buy. Promise

This right here. The blockchain is a journal, an infrangible record of transactions. Nothing more

Are we there yet? How 'bout now?
