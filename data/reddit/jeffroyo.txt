Jumping on this instead of clogging up with a thread - how can I get the bcash from my electrum wallet? 
I understand I need to make a new wallet and transfer BTC out and will have the BCH left to move to a BCH wallet - but do I need a different PC to make a new Electrum wallet or can I do it on my current system ok?

People play video games for the same reason people drive fast, or shoot guns, collect things, or do any one of millions of different activities dude.
It's a hobby like any other, it brings enjoyment, community, a sense of satisfaction and has countless positives.

So is gambling.

Sucks, doesn’t it?

It is no more important. To you maybe, but not to those people. You want more money, they want better graphics. They invest in hardware to reach their goals, you invest in crypto.

How is playing video games wasting your life away dude?
By your logic you're wasting your life away on reddit no?
Is it hard to understand that different people enjoy different things in life? 
&amp; people wanted an actual change to the global economy years ago when Bitcoin first came out, until the knobjockeys started HODL'ing as an investment and the whole blocksize debate crippled it's use. Now it's just a bunch of noobs who use that as an excuse for their 'get lambos' crypto ~~investing~~ gambling.

Sold all my crypto already mate, don't care for any coin. No faith in it anymore, it all got corrupted by morons.

Too late. These dipshits fucked it all up waiting years for LN and then it being so complicated that nobody knows wtf is going on.
I remember a few years back Bitcoin was being used as a currency, all you had to do was raise the block limit, by now it would be everywhere, we'd have simple wallets for the layman, the public would be using it to buy everything online. Even then I truly felt we were on the cusp of it going mainstream and being used everywhere.
But no. 2 years later we have an unusable 'currency' that has gotten infinitely more complicated and scary to the public, that everyone sees as a scam, and that is dropping like shit, as well as a trillion shit coins just muddying up the waters.
GG guys, well played.

When anything costs double that it used to then you're gonna complain.
You have money right now btw, it's worked fine for centuries. Wanting 'better' money is no different to wanting better graphics or video processing really. Not that 99% of those in crypto now want better money anymore anyway, they just want more of the 'old' money.

?? They haven't been forced to do anything like that. In fact more and more publishers are looking at VR which needs high powered cards.

Because some people enjoy video games more than reading a book?
How can you not understand this?
I enjoy swimming much more than running. If I want to get some cardio in, why the fuck would I run when I can swim?


You never played FIFA with a bunch of mates and a few beers? Never played Mario as a kid with your mum or dad? Fought your siblings on Mortal Kombat?
Even online it's fun as hell with randoms dude, and that's why people play - it's fun and they enjoy it.
