It's most likely a pump and dump coin living of Doge's recent hype that's going to leave every single investor disappointed.

While they deserved that criticism at the start, I think they've proven that they're not a pump and dump.

I don't own any dogecoins, nor did I ever post something on that subreddit as far as I know. I think you ran out of arguments and started guessing at this point. Why do you dislike them this much anyway?

I don't feel like arguing with you any longer. You seem like you're bitter that Dogecoin has as much success as it does and you just dodge every question.

Give me a reason to think Dogecoin is a scam. Any at all. 
I can already tell your next comment in advance: "Give me a reason to think Shibecoin is a scam. Any at all"
Also: What's with the upvote bots?

If they are for real, I hope they are successful, but the name makes me think it's a scam living off the dogecar hype.

Why do you feel the need to put them down? Are you trying to rile people up because you're afraid they'll be successful? It's a comment with -2 on a subreddit where posts get upvoted because the people want to see the pretty rocket you get when you upvote stuff.

Great dodging, champ. Like I said in another comment, I don't dislike them, but they seem like a scam.
