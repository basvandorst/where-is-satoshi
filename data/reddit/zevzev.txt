Vulnerabilities in code/ software  mainly are caused by the libraries/frameworks the programer chooses to use without researching if there are any vulnerabilities for that particular library/framework.

Don’t go on your gut, use charts RSI and MACD on tradingview 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:08:29
I really hope you don’t have to do this in reverse order :/
