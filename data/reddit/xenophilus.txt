I see you're a determined little shit with a superiority complex. I'll leave you with this; If we kill people, what makes us better than criminal murderers?

You kept your backups unencrypted on your hard drive. That's on your end, nothing Blockchain can possibly do about it. Do not go and complain to them, instead, learn about tools that make cryptography easier, like GPG.

It's funny because the scale only works up to 160 ish, 4 standard deviations above the mean.

And I'm saying that's cruel and unusual, and should be stopped at all costs. In terms of crime severity, rape &gt; digital money laundering.

Currently the NFC is locked to ApplePay, but the fingerprint scanner can be used by 3rd party apps. So the buying would work, but ApplePay would be a no-go until at least next year at this time.

Yes. Do you have instructions for toothpicks, too?
