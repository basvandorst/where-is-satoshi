Indpendent Reserve or Buyabitcoin both are quick.  Buyabitcoin is super quick but needs a cash deposit to westpac

Well they are part of the global media cabal so technically yes they disseminate propoganda in lieu of 'news'.  As does every other MSM outlet.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:37:36
HODL! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:12:36
250 is a start mate... Once the money is in btc... Write it off as lost so you can remove any emotion. This i find is the KEY to having a stress free HODL  
I bought in when it was 4600AUD and it has thankfully stayed above that however if it went to 500 tomorrow id still HODL and buy more!
