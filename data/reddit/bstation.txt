If its not legal then maybe it won't happen.   I would imagine it is legal, its legal to leave money on groundd no?

I agree, I only meant to touch on the fact it is silly to call it bitcoin regulation when you are not directly changing the tech, source code or protocol.  But I agree with your point.

M2 estimates the value of all currency in existence in dollar value since dollar most widely used, but you could use another currency instead, but all are hypothetically accounted for.

Well it seems VERY silly to demand any tax on an innovative global asset that isn't fully understood, with a tiny "market cap" and trying to grow.

It makes me feel better to say it.  I am tired of news articles and politicians referring to bitcoin regulation, when they are really talking about regulation on businesses that use the bit coin network.  Companies that use electricity get regulated too. Go figure.

Neat, thanks.  I am also curious how many coins will be lost over the years.  This will also increase the price.  Anyone have an estimate on how many coins will Bd lost in next 5 years?

It would be neat to place a wallet with zero coins somewhere, and then allow for donations, and real ease location clues as when certain amounts have been donated.  Also be able to track when it is found and redeemed by winner.

The QR code is the key to the coins I think.
