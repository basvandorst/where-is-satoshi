Interesting use of bitcoin. Is there a convenient API on the bitcoin client side to integrate this into e.g. e-mail?

No, it's just history repeating. (-:

I found that the market depth on   is a good indicator for the stability of the price: the volume of the buy orders essentially bars the price from going down too fast -- just as the sell orders will give it a hard time going beyond $50.

Why link so some arcane blog? Here is the **original post**:

Predicting the Bitcoin economy (the miners and the BTC markets/exchanges) is very hard. I'll try to name all relevant factors:
* difficulty
* network hashrate (i.e. speed of all miners online)
* bitcoin price (BTC/$ exchange rate)
* reward per block (ATM 25 BTC/block)
* cost of power
* efficiency of mining gear
* behavior of traders
All these factors influence each other. E.g. if the price per Bitcoin rises for a while, then people will rush to invest in BTC, which in turn fuels the already skyrocketing price. We've seen that in June 2011. Simultaneously a big sell might crash the price and cause everyone to bail out. But at the same time a high exchange rate will make people buy new mining gear, which quickly leads to a higher difficulty. Another example is the reward per block, which just recently dropped to 25 BTC/block. Months before the drop the BTC price was relatively stable at about $6-7. Together with the difficulty then this was just below the cost for powering a GPU rig to mine one BTC in average. In the aftermath of the reward drop the price stabilized at approx. $14, which again balances the cost of power per BTC. 
So, what does all this mean for the upcoming ASICS? It all boils down to how their owners behave: **hoarders**  or **sellers**? First off, they'll greatly increase network speed, which will make the difficulty rise. Those miners will now have the majority of the BTCs being generated. Mining will become unprofitable for the GPU miners. These miners were plenty in numbers and many were using already existing gear, so hoarding is ATM still popular except for the few individuals who made this a business. The ASIC miners again are right now making huge bets on the hardware. So they might want to cash out quickly to secure their investments. But more BTC on the market results in a price drop, which will make it even harder for the ASIC to pay for themselves. But then again I might be wrong and the owners of the ASICs are all hoarders...
tl/dr: BTC economy depends on a fragile balance of interdependent factors, ASICs will cause a stir, interesting times ahead.
