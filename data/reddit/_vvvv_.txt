I'm not wrong, you just don't understand.  There's no need to introduce currency to correct for lost coins because the value of the remaining coins will self-correct.  Europe couldn't run on one 100 Euro note, since it's not infinitely divisible.  However, it could feasibly run on 1 BTC.

The original proposal was that a distributed committee would need to be formed to issue more bitcoin in the future, which is simply wrong.
Bitcoin is deflationary in nature, so that's an "issue" whether this bitcoin committee is replacing lost coins at 1:1 rate or not.  It's simply a matter of how much.
Although I agree it couldn't replace USD "right now", I disagree that a deflationary currency could not work for the following reasons:
* I still need to eat, live in a shelter, cover various health related expenses.
* Investors and entrepreneurs will look to outperform deflation.
* I don't want to wait until I'm 95 to live the life I dream.  At some point people will just pull the trigger and spend.  I've already "cashed out" on some luxuries, in fact, and I don't regret it.
It's almost always more profitable to invest your USD in low risk investments than buy a new car, or a laptop, or a Gucci purse but people still do it.  So there's a point where it's not about profitability vs spending. Judging bitcoin on its explosive growth as how it will always be doesn't make much sense.  For example, if we assume bitcoin stabilizes in 15 years and experiences 10% deflationary growth per year after that, both investors and consumers would still spend.  When does it stop making sense? I don't know.  But does deflationary mean unfeasible by definition? Absolutely not.

You're wrong,  Sure, standard C floats have a limit but when you introduce a patch you can use a different data structure.  For example, check out python's bigfloat package.  Bitcoin is infinitely divisible because it's software.

Yes, the value of 1 bitcoin will adjust to demand. 21 Million coins or 1 coin is arbitrary.  The network can function perfectly fine with any amount of BTC.  If 4% of coins are lost per year long term the value of the remaining coins will grow 4% given everything else remains constant.
The stability arguments are overstated.  Bitcoin is an emergent technology and is severely undervalued so it undergoes dramatic swings. We'll see the increased stability that everyone complains about when it is a normal part of the majority of people's life &amp; portfolio. Sure, that's sometime in the future, but so is a reality where we are legitimately concerned about the decreasing number of available coins and considering to "create a centralized committee to tell all the distributed parties where to set the new bitcoin limit".
As for the save/don't spend argument: Sure it makes me spend less than I would normally but I also need to eat and live inside a building.  I'd also like a lambo and some other shit and I don't really want to wait until I'm on my deathbed. Easy money makes people spend, just look at lottery winners.

If the dollar crashes, but your loan remains table, you need to work _less_ to get the same 10$ once wages begin to adjust.  On a short term loan it's probably bad for the reason you describe.  On a mortgage which spans many years this is plausible.
For example, in the 1950's minimum wage was about $0.75/hour.  If you were getting the 6-11 dollar minimum wage which is standard now back then, you'd be pretty loaded.  If you took out a mortgage on a house (about $15,796 for a cheap house) then and didn't begin to pay it off until today it would be pretty damn easy to pay it off with almost any job - despite that milk and eggs have now been adjusted to inflation as well.
Hope this clears things up.

It is not normal, but potentially not a failure of bitcoin software - might be hard drive issues or OS issues/improper shutdown etc.  Unfortunately it can be difficult to tell exactly why it is corrupted (or any file for that matter).
I don't know if it's still around but there used to be a -reindex flag that you could use with bitcoind that would try to rebuild the broken db and download from where it found issues.  You could try that.
One way to mitigate the troubles it causes it is keep a copy of the db backed up somewhere.  Then, if there is a failure, you can swap in the saved version and only catch up the time in between from the network.  You can compress the file during storage to save space if you need to.
If you feel like poking around, checking the disk with disk utility, and checking your logs in /var/log/ or using the Console application to do so would be a good place to start.

Map of string,string for key/value pairs, so maxlength would be string.max_size(), system dependent. I don't know if there are any other restrictions internally, but I would imagine not.  Max_size for strings is typically massive for most libraries/systems, so practically no limit.

There are many on there that contain a "no" result, and there are many untested printers.
As far as I know, printer steganography has never been used in a case nor an investigation (especially one as small as this) and it would be very hard to catch someone you didn't already suspect since the printer isn't tied to the person (until you raid their house). That is, the printer isn't registered to you at purchase.

I apologize if you really are legitimate, but the site does seem sketchy to me.  Lack of input validation and the likes will really make people not confident and will lead to posts like mine.  Additionally, if there are PHP exploits than it is possible for someone to execute arbitrary code or change what is displayed, sending to their private addresses instead.  SQL is not required to have security holes.
The structure I imagine your site having is as follows: 
-On site load at index.php, get all js/html/css.
-When user clicks invest, show random address from  which contains an array of pre-generated addresses.
-On post, submit amount, pre-generated address that was selected, and user submitted payout address as post to index.php.
-Association of payout address and deposit address is saved somewhere.
-Separate machine handles processing.  When funds received at an address it controls, remove address from  and generate a new one, insert it.
-After allocated time (10 days), calculate payout and send funds to payout address.
What happens if two people load the page at once? They may get the same deposit address.  How does the site know who is the real depositor and who is the fake depositor since assumedly each user can have a different payout address than the address they sent funds from? If they are both real depositors, how can they watch the address to make sure the funds don't move as you claim? If half the funds were taken, they would both feel comfortable that their funds were still available since the balance would be sufficient for their payout but not both people's payout.
I'd feel more comfortable with your site if you:
-Removed payout address completely and only sent to the address that made the deposit (and noted this on the site).
-Generated unique addresses on the fly.
-Offered multisig transaction option to guarantee neither party could move the funds without both parties consent.
-Had real identity information in whois.
I have a hard time believing you can make back interest fees in advertising, but I won't go there.  I don't wish to slander your company if you are legitimate, and I don't want people to get scammed either - we have had enough of that in Bitcoin.

It adds to security because people can look at it and make sure there aren't flaws in it - sort of like open source software.
If you have security that relies on people not knowing your algorithm, it likely has problems, and it's probably a lot easier for someone to find than developing a groundbreaking attack on well-established crypto.
For example, SHA256 and RSA are very widely known and looked at by thousands of trained experts.  This is exactly what makes them trustworthy.  Would you be comfortable with a developer who made personal modifications to RSA to produce a secret algorithm?

Tor traffic can be identified (but not inspected) at ISP level, so (if the headline here is taken as truth) they would simply ask the ISP who payed the bill at what address that Tor traffic was visible.
There are a variety of masking techniques (such as pretending to be torrent data), but not used by default and may still be identifiable as Tor data.

You can design and build really interesting things and find no real market fit. Etherium is still a toy, despite the core functionality being implemented.  They need to find services that really depend on it. Even cost savings often does not offset the hurdle of switching to some new platform or technology.

Duly noted, I like discussing issues when both parties are logical.
I don't think we shouldn't talk about Ripple.  I think is the appropriate place to do so and honestly, could use more users regardless of what I feel about Ripple.  I don't think it should be promoted yet, simply because there are too many unknowns.

I'd certainly hope the developers of a system implemented the best option they could think of.  However, I've found people to be particularly defensive of their ideas, especially when it could make them a lot of money and when they have invested a lot of time into it.
JoelKatz does mention antiscams system "wasn't awful" and just provided no real benefit (besides not including XRP or OpenCoin which may be worth the cost of managing the blockchain to many people).
Additionally, it seems JoelKatz was the one to stop discussing the topic.  Antiscams ended with a well thought out rebuttal.

My apologies, it appears you are correct.
However, my argument still stands.  Use of XRP as a currency is not voluntary, and OpenCoins intentions are suspect at best.
Someone needs to hold large amounts of XRP (or lose money for any exchange), and all XRP held is at risk of losing value.

Perhaps you need to be clearer about what you mean.
Private keys are generated locally and the public key is not even directly published to the network until a transaction is made.
If you are saying _if_ a private key is transferred over the internet for whatever stupid reason then someone could intercept it then yes, I agree.
If you are saying that theoretically some person could generate keys forever until they found the one that accessed the address you keep your coins at then yes, I agree, but it's completely impractical. Overwhelmingly impractical - some might even say impossible.
If you are saying that someone could intercept web traffic to someone you send your address to and change it to their own address then yes, it's possible, but it isn't what the OP is asking.
Also, private keys aren't encrypted according to the protocol.

For once, I generally agree with you.  In fact, XRP doesn't even need to be used as that placeholder.

I didn't say it wasn't possible, I said the danger was over exaggerated.  People can switch pools, and I suspect they would if a pool operator was malicious.
A pool operator doesn't own the hashing power of their pool.  If an _individual_ held 51%, they would not be at risk of losing that power, since they owned the hardware.

Coinbase's model is built on orders taking a while so they can buy the coins at a lower price.  When you place an order, you are mostly commiting to buying at that price.  If you bought on gox, you'd not be able to cancel it, so why do you want to cancel on coinbase?  You are pretty much trying to game their system.
When you place an order there, you should realize you are commiting to buy at the price listed after the cancel button dissapears.  There have been too many people on here trying to cancel their bank transfers or empty their accounts to prevent the charge from going through.  While that might benefit you, it hurts the bitcoin ecosystem and is simply not fair to coinbase.  Don't be that guy.  They are one of the only places that take bank transfers easily.

As a CS masters student studying cryptography you should know what is actually implemented and what is described in theoretical papers is often quite different.  Minor oversights in padding, PRNGs, or message re-encryption can diminish the security of a system, among other things.
Additionally, what makes you so certain breaking sha256 is impossible? There already exist (weak) mitm and preimage attacks against it under certain conditions.  While breaking sha256 would certainly have far greater implications on society than destroying bitcoin, it is not provably secure.
Although I **don't** think any such flaws exist in the bitcoin protocol or implementation, I definitely think it's a valid concern that anal_sockpuppet has.  Pointing to a whitepaper and telling someone to take a class isn't a valid argument.

And those people likely got bitcoin into the system using a gateway.  Therefore, you are holding IOUs from a gateway.  Maybe many people trust this gateway right now (since it's pretty much the only one), but with -many- gateways, there will be many different kinds of bitcoin IOUs.  Your friend may not accept Bitstamp IOUs in the future, so a "trust path" will have to be found.  XRP removes the necessity for a trust path.
If they are issuing their own IOUs, it is unlikely anyone will accept them besides you.

If you had the gateway source code, maybe.  Then again, you're only transacting in IOUs so you'd need some infrastructure to accept resources, and return them when someone wants to cash out.  And if you do that, you are most likely breaking regulations depending on exactly what you transact.
And even if you had that, you'd need a lot of people to trust you to get anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:18:46
That makes no sense.  There are XRP -&gt; bitcoin exchanges.  If XRP could be obtained freely, BTC could be obtained freely.
If it has value of a fraction of a dollar (like yen), and people hold hundred of thousands of XRP, it has value.  And that value just promotes OpenCoin and investors to cash out at the cost of everyone else in the system.

Yes, of course they _can_ try to exploit the system they implemented (but didn't invent, really) to its full potential without any considerations of fairness. That doesn't make it any less dangerous, and that doesn't make it wrong for someone such as myself to speak out against their actions and warn others to be cautious.
The banking system exploited a number of different things it could in attempts to make money.  Clearly they _can_, and they don't need to try to be fair, but the process has ruined some peoples lives and technologies such as Bitcoin have grown from that.  They are a direct challenge to the power of the financial system and I don't want to feed back into such a system (with Ripple).
Anyways, I think we understand each other pretty well. All of my discussions (which have taught me a lot) boil down to what we have been exploring here (is it okay or right for OpenCoin to have control over the Ripple economy?) and discussing if XRP is technically necessary for the system to operate well.  I hope to disprove the latter with time, but the former is an ethical discussion and, as such, can never be solved.  It can only be understood.

There has been a lot of discussion about XRP and if it is necessary. [For example, here](  The final few posts, antiscam designs a system that may work without XRP, JoelKatz admits it would work but would be a pain to manage another blockchain, and then doesn't respond to further discussion.


If Ripple becomes a worldwide transaction system, it very much does matter who is in control of the currency.  I do not think the developers should not profit.  However, they should profit as being the early (est) adopters - not because they have set the entire system up for their eternal benefit from the start. Would it be safe for a single organization, let alone a company of a few workers with no real laws or rules to govern them, to be in control of instant inflation at the cost of everyone else?  Is fixing spam, with this method that was thought up to grant themselves profit,  worth risking worldwide financial servitude to a centralized agency?
This sort of control is very scary and very dangerous if you believe Ripple to be a major game changer. It only makes the situation worse when Opencoin has already been intentionally deceptive, secretive, and violating open source licenses - how do you think they will behave in the future?
Opencoins Ripple, as it stands, is diametrically opposed to the core ideals of Bitcoin.

This isn't the main point of your post, but something I have thought about.  You mention it is remarkable that nobody has stepped forward to take credit.  While it's true it might be tempting for Satoshi, it is certainly tempting for those looking for easy fame and fortune.  However, it would be hard for an imposter to convince many people without having access to Satoshi's accounts or his wallet.  In this way, bitcoin is protected (in a weak way) from being manipulated by the opinions of an imposter Satoshi.
Only the real Satoshi can step forward to take credit with any reliablity, and only if he/she/they have access to their old credentials.

Bitcoin is distributed.
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:05:11
First thing to do is transfer it to a new address, with permission.  There's no way for you to check who has access to the account.
Once you have the funds in a separate account, encrypt the key to the account with a (more secure than you think you'll need in your lifetime) password.  Many clients will do this for you.  Print with archival ink on multiple sheets of paper, put it on a few different USB drives.  Duplicate the process a few different times.
Buy a few lock boxes at banks, buy a vault at company.  Put them inside, leave them there. As mentioned, you can use shamir's secret sharing too, if you're so inclined.
Erase the hard drive twice. Destroy the computer and printer - throw the RAM and hard drive into a fire.
Make sure you remember the password.. You can think of how to deal with this part.  Issue is, if anyone else knows it, you rely on the security of the banks - vulnerable to social engineering.
Do the whole process a couple times before hand to make sure you can reliably retrieve it all, and that everything goes smoothly.

Might want to take a look at mining LTC on those devices and conveting to BTC.  There are LTC pools as well!
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:15:21
Let's say you open an account and do all the mandatory stuff (get your first 300, add trust for Bitstamp, some USD/XRP exchange that doesn't exist yet, etc.)
Then you want to sell some BTC for USD.  You add BTC to your Bitstamp and set up a buy offer.  It gets filled fine and someone transfers you their XRP for your Bitstamp IOU.  You take that XRP over to the USD exchange and find someone selling USD for XRP.  You accept their offer, get the USD IOU, and transfer it out.
Now, that's great.  With a fixed amount of XRP distributed evenly across all users this might work (ignoring other serious issues like rogue exchanges).
But, that's not the way things are.  OpenCoin and OpenCoin's investors are specifically planning on exchanging much of the massive amounts of XRP they hold for "real" currencies once it is profitable.  I have no doubt they will exploit this as much as possible, particularly their investors who have no real interest in the wellbeing of Ripple.
So let's say Ripples reach some stable rate of exchange and an investor decides it's time to cash out.  They introduce a few million XRP to they system and get a nice chunk of BTC from people.  Those people are now holding XRP.  They are "stuck" with the devalued XRP.
OpenCoin and it's investors can cause immediate inflation at will.  This violates the core ideals of BTC.

And OpenCoin holds practically all the XRP.
The argument I hear most often is basically "XRP is not meant to be used as money, therefore this is ok!  OpenCoin will distribute the XRP!"  But, if OpenCoin distributes XRP not only is it acting as a central agency, but since that XRP is used to exchange for "real" currencies it enables them to trade for "real" currencies without adding anything to the system.  This devalues the IOUs that anyone else holds (and makes them rich).
They have a huge amount of self issued IOUs.  Who owes them?  Anyone who holds XRP.

What does intrinsic value actually mean?  For example, why is gold priced higher than iron? I don't think it is for it's physical properties since most gold is not used for that purpose and there are plenty of other things that "work" for these purposes.
From wikipedia:
"intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a **medium of exchange and a store of value**. Examples of such features include **divisibility**; **easily and securely storable** and **transportable**; **scarcity**; and **difficulty to counterfeit**. When objects come to be used as a medium of exchange they lower the high transaction costs associated with barter and other in-kind transactions."
With commodities, intrinsic value is commonly said to be, for example "The market value of the constituent metal within a coin."  But the "market value" is based on demand and resources that it takes to gather it.  I'd argue that golds demand lies within it's perception as a store of value and its scarcity, not in its physical qualities.
From investopedia: "Intrinsic value - The actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both tangible and intangible factors. Value investors use a variety of analytical techniques in order to estimate the intrinsic value of securities in hopes of finding investments where the true value of the investment exceeds its current market value."
So intrinsic value cannot be measured, really, it can only be estimated.
Bitcoins scarcity is mathematically based instead of "we think it's scarce".  And it does take energy and money to mine. I think it fits all definitions of having intrinsic value.  If not, then gold is priced absurdly beyond all intrinsic value is has and we should transact in alcohol instead.

He agreed my counterexample, and the existence of CAs were good examples of scenarios which might violate this supposed theorem and agrees the statement is too vague to really be able to be proven.

Because that government would benefit from stability, and risks another government adopting if we follow the prisoner's dilemma example.  The governments would all "win" if they all refused to adopt it, but if one of them chose to while the rest didn't those who didn't would be at a major disadvantage.  Therefore, it's only logical for everyone to adopt since it would be an "okay" solution that doesn't have any disastrous consequences for themselves.

Elliptic curve involves primes, but its difficulty is in calculating discrete logarithms, not prime factorization (unlike RSA, for example).  Bitcoin doesn't use RSA.
Also, it is not quantum resistant due to elliptic curve usage.  Elliptic curve is vulnerable to theoretical speedups from quantum computing attacks.
Quantum resistance comes primarily from the hashed public key for addresses.  There is a many-to-one mapping, and the problem degrades to brute-force even with quantum computing (which isn't magic, it just can reduce the computational complexity of specific operations.)
This is why you shouldn't use an address after you send a transaction from it.  You publish the public key to send the transaction, and then open yourself up to attacks on elliptic curve (which is, as far as we know, very secure - but it is weaker than _not_ revealing it and who knows what new technology will bring.)

I don't see what your point is.  In fact, I don't see any PHP framework vulnerabilities listed on the front page.
I work in computer security. Yes, just like any other web technology, PHP and Perl can be insecure, but no one in the industry would seriously recommend not using them.  Just think about what you are saying. Probably any major website you can imagine uses, or has used, PHP - Google, Facebook and Wikipedia to name a few.  
Also, sqlmap is pretty much a toy.  I guess if you were really stuck or wanted to automate a ton of work (like a corporate setting) it could be useful, but for the most part it's dramatically more efficient and elegant to manually explore SQL queries.

It is not logical to hold anything more than trace amounts of XRP.  
It is unlikely the price will rise significantly after most "public" XRP has been released if it is not widely used.
OpenCoin and it's investors are waiting for the price to rise to sell XRP.
This will happen if people invest in XRP.  If they do so, it is likely they lack understanding and the risks of doing so,
Selling massive amounts of XRP devalues the value of the XRP everyone else holds.

@_date: 2013-11-20 00:24:47
1. With regards to your post one layer out, the actions of the author of a piece of work does not determine the truthfulness of the work.
2. Equating some feature of ripple to bitcoin or another technology doesn't necessarily provide any evidence that it isn't "a scam".  They both could be.
3.  To me, the "scam" of ripple is not ripple, it is OpenCoin and XRP.  Specifically, that XRP was entirely premined, minimally distributed by the programmers (and not the inventor, either) to whom they thought were worthy, and its purpose obfuscated.  Since they plan to profit from rising XRP rates, but XRP is not necessary (well, enough to have any value really within the current implementation and at all, I believe, in a ripple without OpenCoin), I can only imagine they hope users use it as a store of value.  Then, they can (or their investors, whom they have given large quantities to) cause immediate devaluation by selling off portions.  This seems deceptive to me and is not made clear anywhere - indeed they even claim it as a coin.  At least they used to, I don't bother to check their site.
Despite my first point, I haven't checked out the ripplescam website in a long time and when I last did it had some outdated information.  I just wanted to make it clear it wasn't really a valid argument.

I don't think this can be proven.  Cryptography is not defined spefically enough for that to occur. 
Counter example:
Suppose a system where Bob wishes to share a message with Alice, but only after one month of waiting.  Suppose Bob only can communicate one message, which must be communicated immediately,  and then can no longer communicate.  Suppose Alice has unlimited computing power.  Suppose Sam is a trusted third party.  Bob sends his message to Sam, who releases it to Alice after one month.
Can this system exist without a third party?  Must both parties trust the third party?

Yes, you are right.  As I said above I actually like ripple _technically_ but think OpenCoin is corrupt and XRP is unnecessary.  I do think that people will put savings into XRP if ripple becomes widely used without understanding that it is an issue, and I do think that OpenCoin intentionally makes the fact that XRP is not a store of value hard to discern and confusing.
I'm not going to support a system that feeds off the misunderstanding of its users.  Ripple doesn't need OpenCoin.

But IOUs alone don't exist for currencies, they exist in the context of the exchanges that issued them.
Suppose Alice wants to pay Bob with her Bitstamp BTC IOUs, but Bob doesn't trust Bitstamp, he only trusts mtgox.  Then either a path must be found in which Alice can trade someone who trusts Bitstamp and mtgox Bitstamp IOUs for them to owe Bob mtgox BTC IOUs, or Alice must convert the currency to XRP (which are essentially IOUs that can't be manipulated by any exchange) and transfer the XRP to Bob.  Since XRP is not associated with trust (except in OpenCoin, which is the main issue), Bob is not taking any risks.  He can go and exchange that XRP at any gateway.
OpenCoin admits XRP is intended to be used this way in addition to it being a "tax", despite what Nooku claims.


The system doesn't require XRP to operate.  A tax on the percentage transfered would be sufficient.  It was invented as a way to make large profits from the system.

There is the theory (not that I agree, but it's a common point that is brought up) that when there is enough support from the bitcoin ecosystem, businesses will come to fill that role, and transactions will occur mostly when moving money between larger companies.  For example, (with fiat) Visa moving money within it's own business is super easy.  Interacting with another bank probably requires more paperwork, logkeeping, and fees.  Some exchanges already do this, for example.  You don't actually make transactions occur on the blockchain until you withdraw bitcoins.

No problem is worth a centralized organization controlling 80% of all wealth within a worldwide, fully accepted transaction system.  Even 10% is almost too much.


Rippled has been distributed to gateways such as bitstamp.  Rippled was forked from bitcoin.  Bitcoin carries an open source license.  Opencoin realizes this and states they will release the source code but they have not.  They have exported the software anyways.  Therefore, they are in violation of open source licenses. 


It may be unfair for spammers to _attempt_ to manipulate or bring down a system temporarily, but it is definitely unfair for Opencoin to have direct control over the currency.  Neither is acceptable.

From what I've seen and read, OpenCoin is not very honest or trustworthy (opensource issue, lack of communication on XRP, secrecy about discussing certain topics).  Even if it was, I don't think such power should be in the hands of one company.

Yes, Bancorp can do so as well.  Yet, if Simple takes a positive stance and Bancorp doesn't particularly care it would be less likely for them to get involved with placing arbitrary restrictions on Simple.
Also, such restrictions could already be built in some sort of agreement to prevent Bancorp from using such power.  I don't know the legal situation.

You can just ignore any transaction without consequence, I doubt any human even sees it.
Also, you should expect (in general) to get the least beneficial option to yourself for BTC payout.  What I mean by this is sometimes you will get your "quoted" price, and sometimes you will get around the "current" price, but I have found it's most often the one that nets you the least BTC.  Because of this, I like to put an order in DIRECTLY before going to send, so the time for change is lowest.
EDIT: Few extra tips: 
 -You don't need to print the sheet out or actually go to the location you said you would - any moneygram location will work.  You can just email it to yourself and check the info on your phone or write it down if it's easier for you.
 -It's much easier to fill out the bill pay form than use the phone.
-The 500 USD daily is to prevent additional paperwork and trigger money laundering alarms, but it's not enforced (by zipzap or bitinstant comparing against your recieving address) if you go to multiple locations.  You can use fake names and telephone numbers, I have never been asked to prove my identity with moneygram in the 5 years I have used it (when sending).

I have used Ripple quite a bit, actually, by buying XRP off people from the free giveaway threads for cheap and exchanging it for about four times its price off the (agreed) fools within the Ripple system.  It's not easy anymore because the people on the forums want a better price, but it was for a while.  My experiences with the system have shown me that most people I am working with do not understand the system very well.  I don't blame them, Ripple is significantly more complicated than bitcoin, and there is a layer of political uncertainty from OpenCoin on top of that.  Because of this, I believe people will continue to place trust in XRP when they shouldn't.  Did OpenCoin intend this? Probably not, maybe.  But I bet they will be happy to profit from it at the loss of anyone holding XRP.
I don't agree that XRP is necessary.  OpenCoin claims it is so but I reckon a similar system could work by taxing IOU exchange.  This would grow more slowly since you needed many more users trusting each other but would ultimately not be dependent on XRP.
As for the speed, I still don't quite follow, sorry.  With Ripple, you need to get money into and out of the system somehow.  This will mostly be at the same speed as transferring money to and from Bitstamp.  Perhaps I'm missing something, care to elaborate?

Well, I think the distribution process is the key issue.  Everyone had a chance in bitcoin (and still does, theoretically).  This is not the case with XRP - it can be considered entirely premined.  Yes, there are giveaways, but they are insignificantly small unless you are a business partner.
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:41:07
I've covered it for the most part in this thread already, but it boils down to:
* Entirely premined.
* They gives a lot away to investors.
* Despite the communities claim that it's not supposed to be a currency, they promote it as such.
* Intended as a vehicle from which they can profit.
* Arguably unnecessary for operation of the system.
These facts combined make XRP pretty sketchy.  In the best case, it is just a way for them to make money and a poor idea.  In the worst case, they are intentionally planning on making large profits off their misinformed and misled users.  Regardless of what OpenCoin's views are, some of it is out of their hands now, and will only be more so the more they give XRP to investors.
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:19:01
Yes, the comparisons are a bit extreme.  I believe this is because Ripple, as you mentioned, hasn't really gone _too_ far yet.  As such, it isn't certain exactly what will happen.  But, I believe the risk is there, and it's important to discuss _before_ it has gotten a lot of traction and certainly _before_ it is blindly promoted as the problem free, next big thing.
You will notice I don't argue against the concept of Ripple.  I argue against OpenCoin's implementation and XRP.  I certainly hope another solution rises to take the current implementation's place - in fact, I would be seriously inclined to work towards such a goal if the source code was released, and probably even if it isn't.

There are a number of different payment services which make the process easier.
The staff will have to be trained, but the process would be roughly like this:
* Party runs up a tab.
* Party wants to leave, tells the waiter they want to pay with BTC.
* Staff member enters amount on computer, tablet, or phone using bitpay or coinbase's service, and displays (or prints!? That would be awesome.. on receipt paper) the payment address.  A new one is generated for every transaction.
* Staff waits for payment to come through and group is cleared.  You don't need to wait too long honestly.  You don't want to get ripped off, but it's entirely possible for the party to just leave on a busy night or chargeback the transaction if they wanted to steal drinks.  Regardless, confirmations should start show up pretty quickly (20 seconds - 5 minutes) as long as they include a reasonable tx fee.
You could make this process easier by printing other data such as a suggested tip or something for the customers as well.

What is this then?
The creators, developers, and investors have admitted they are building the system and spending money promoting it because they expect XRP prices to make them profits.  XRP has to be held with someone; not everyone can cash out since XRP is being added without additional other currencies being added as well.  Therefore, it's unreasonable to say that everyone can just not hold much XRP.
Do you trust OpenCoin unconditionally? How about the investors they are giving tons of XRP to?  The whole Ripple model is BUILT to make them millionaires.  Please stop promoting it and do more research.

Trust transactions can just be time limited by the system I believe.
Other traffic can require a widely trusted IOU to be attached as payment, or multiple IOUs (in very small portions, equivalent to a tx fee).


I wish I could understand this, I really want to.  Let's just pretend I want to convert my LTC to BTC and withdraw it.  I have already set up trust and everything, but I have no money besides a bit of XRP.
I transfer LTC into the the system using a gateway (Litestamp).  This takes time equivalent to transfering money into Litestamp. Then I set up a trade.  Since I trust Bitstamp already it isn't too difficult.  The trade gets confirmed and I have BTC. 
Then I want it in my wallet, so I set up a withdrawl request from Bitstamp, and get my BTC out.  Then I transfer it to my wallet.  This takes time equivalent to withdrawlng from Bitstamp.
How is this different from transfering into btc-e, swapping for btc, and withdrawing assuming all exchanges take the same time for their actions?

Perhaps partly, but if they profit, they will profit at someone's expense.  Namely, those who hold XRP.  This is fact.

I doubt they'd ask you to prevent it from reappearing, you have no control over that.  Safe harbor laws apply in the US which basically states you can't get in trouble for what someone else posts or uploads if you are not aware of it.  And most people don't spend much time snooping through the blockchain, especially if the data needs to be extracted by special software.
I could write software to extract CP from any data source - the stock market for example.  Would anyone storing the ticker history be in a similar situation? What if I manipulated the stock prices to be the binary for CP?

That's true only given the premise that bruteforce is the only attack feasible.

Use this username and password with mining software on a machine you'd like to mine with (preferably with a good/multiple GPUs).  CGminer is a good choice for software ( but there are plenty.  After some time, you can login to your account at the pool and see how much you've mined.  You can also register additional workers under your account if you have multiple machines.

Even if the technology is decentralized, the control of the currency is centralized, since OpenCoin owns it all.  There's a difference between a centralization of the network, and a centralization of power.
It doesn't really matter if more XRP can be minted or not - OpenCoin can "mint" new currency by releasing it into the pool.  Yeah, this can only happen once, but given the insane percentage them and their investors hold they could manipulate the currency for decades.
I am not talking about the software with my statement.
XRP is not only meant for spam protection.  It is meant as a universal IOU for easy transfer across gateways.  It *will* be used as this.
Regardless of if people admit on subforums somewhere on the internet that it is vague, the fact that it is **there** and claiming it is a currency, and claiming it is open source, is **misleading** and manipulative.

That's what entirely premined means.  It's semantic.  They started holding all the XRP that existed.


Do you trust this? What does "distributing" mean?  How much have they already given to investors?  Does this come from the 80% or the 20%?


If the current situation is any indication many people will attempt to store value in XRP.


I do, if it is being done at the cost of misinformed or naieve users who don't understand the system, or if it would potentially lead to an even stronger consolation of financial control and power.
OpenCoin is not transparent about what they really mean, and they are being deceptive about other issues (like the open source issue).  This doesn't promote trust.

Decentralized and distributed do not mean the same thing.  Your statement is factually incorrect.

Because it is at a loss to the misinformed, and because, if operated correctly, could grant obscene wealth to a centralized agency.
Bitcoin was specifically developed out of the desire to move _away_ from agencies controlling commerce and the unfair distribution of wealth.

If you believe in Bitcoin because it will make you money, Ripple is probably fine.

Within the Ripple system, it does not.  You can only trade Bitcoin IOUs to people who trust the gateway.  Selling for XRP removes the requirement for trust of mutual sources.  It makes things easy in OpenCoins implementation (although I don't think this is the best or only solution).
I am opposed to Opencoins Ripple, but I disagree that Bitcoin IOUs (which are no different than USD IOUs)  serve as a better medium for easy and secure transfers between gateways in the current implementation of Ripple.

@_date: 2013-11-20 03:40:32
I agree with most of your points.  OpenCoin put work into developing code and building relations so of course they can structure things however they like, including holding all the XRP and distributing it how they like.
Many Ripple supporters argue that it's not a store of value at all, just a "stamp".  But, many people don't understand their purpose fully and many people are holding significant funds in XRP without understanding its use.  They see it like bitcoin, and I don't think OpenCoin cares.  It benefits them for XRP to gain value.  While this is okay, I don't think it's very ethical.
I don't buy into the artificial scarcity of diamonds, either.  I do see that OpenCoin has an incentive to keep the XRP price high, so it's not likely to see massive dumps.  Yet, it's still a system where you are forfeiting inflation control to a central agency (or a few, if you count their business connections) if you hold XRP.  Therein lies my dilema - I love P2P currencies and technologies because it gives _us_ power and frees us from the decisions of central agencies who may not have our interests in mind.  I don't want things to go full circle, back to a technology that is deceptively distributed, but has a lot of the same issues I tried to leave behind.  And, if things do go that way, I want it to be because people were making informed decisions that were different than mine - not because OpenCoin paid for enough relations that they were well positioned in the market with a shiny website and people didn't understand the situation.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:17:16
I don't think BTC was designed to make it's developers rich.  That statement has no evidence to support it.
Like pretty much everything, being early to new technology can make you a lot of money.  That isn't odd.  The fact is, after Satoshi released the software to the wild and published his paper and told the world _anyone_ could mine.  Most people who heard of it probably shrugged it off - why spend power to generate coins that don't even mean anything?
Anyone could "be a believer" in BTC early.  Many of these people made bitcoin what it is today, and this took a lot of time, energy, and great risks.  For these reasons it is fair that were advantaged.  This is not the same case for Ripple.

I am conceding this point for now.  [JoelKatz claims the source was distributed along with the binaries.](  Bitstamp doesn't respond to inquiries on the matter.


I'm not sure what you mean about this - how has the Ripple community latched onto bitcoin to negotiate between untrusted parties.  You must trust parties to exchange Bitcoin within Ripple.


The software isn't free yet.  The question is, how successful do you think the software will be?  Will it make the developers a million dollars? Fine.  Will it make the developers a billion dolalrs? Fine.  The issue comes when everyday, normal people have transactions occur in this system without even knowing it and Opencoin or its investors start devaluing their money massively and abusing their power.  That is something to really consider before supporting such a system. Their "solution" to the hard problem is a greedy one, and I don't think it deserves a potential multi trillion dollar influence over future trade.  Some disagree, but I find they typically don't resonate much with the ideals of bitcoin - which is fine, but myself and many others do.

OP - dag1893 is right.  Mining on your home computer (regardless of type) would not be very profitable at all.  ASICs such as the BFL miner would make sense to use, and you can mine on a Mac fine.
However, BFL has had a lot of problems getting its products out and there is a huge line so if you order now you won't see it for a long time.  By then, the difficulty will have at least doubled, and probably tripled since Avalon is shipping chips.

* XRP is not necessary.
* XRP is created for investors and OpenCoin to profit.
* If OpenCoin and its investors profit from selling inflated XRP, someone who spent "real" money on XRP will lose the value of their XRP.
* Most users do not fully understand this concept.
* OpenCoin and its investors are planning on profiting at the loss of its users, and at worst, profiting from their lack of understanding.
* Bitcoin was made, at the core, with ideologies that include oppose centralized agencies and organizations controlling the release of money and being parasitic of hard working individuals who were invested in the system.

A P2P system doesn't particularly need any money to support the network, at least not from a central agency.  They are "giving away" large amounts of XRP to their business interests and investors to increase adoption to the system.
It become exploitative when you think about why anyone would invest in XRP (and many people already are), and why OpenCoin and their investors are running their entire business off XRP speculation.  It's clear there's a disconnect somewhere, and I don't think OpenCoin has any intention on making things clearer for anyone.

I do not think ripple, the concept invented before Opencoin's implementation, is a bad idea.  In fact, I think it is a very powerful idea.

Imagine if Ripple was used as the glue between every financial transaction between currencies.  Would you want opencoin granting themselves 30% of that?  No organization should have that sort of power.
Of course they will release some.  I suspect they will release just enough to maintain the optimal price for their own benefit.

Yeah, I can see that as a potential risk.  And, if you're in it for profit alone it can be a scary risk.
Yet, it's hard for me to buy into such a stance.  The government has not shut down torrenting and I believe many would like it to.  Additionally, the cost of attacks grows daily- a 50% attack would take a ton of money to implement right now.
At the end of the day, bitcoin itself is resilient to any issues caused by massive devaluation (which could be done via market manipulation, probably) and many would just see it as an opportunity. And even if a government succeeds at destroying bitcoin technically, another cryptocurrency will be engineered to fix the issues it fell to.

OpenCoin is profiting from the misunderstandings of its users.
OpenCoin decides who profits.  Satoshis system encouraged anyone to adopt it early and profit.

Your claim that I am "shunning something like ripple just because it is a perceived competitor" is baseless.  I am asking for less posts in this subreddit because I see posts about minor **bitcoin unrelated** updates to ripple, like blog posts from OpenCoin itself, here daily.
I do believe OpenCoin has ulterior motives and seeks to profit greatly from their system.  Until it fixes these things, I don't think it should be promoted.

This assumes attacks on ECDSA are reduced to brute force.
There is nothing that proves ECDSA private keys aren't easily recoverable through some other way. If there is a way to simplify the problem, it's likely the time would be cut to a realistic form.

That is not entirely true, but at the core it is valid.
It's the extra value from the inputs to a transaction that is sent to a change address (and included in the transaction along with the sending quantity.)  The extra value can include the entire balance of the address, or it can contain only a portion of it.

I don't think bitcoins will ever be illegal.
But if they were, I don't think they'd just let you keep using them since you bought them before they were illegal.
You'd not get in trouble for having them before, but you'd have to kiss your riches goodbye and just forget about them or risk prosecution.
The price would probably be all sorts of fucked just based on the news leading up to the legal changes anyways.

If I can condense your argument (and correct me if I'm wrong, please), you are saying that, if ripple was very densely saturated with user to user trust, trust paths between _any_ two users could be found easily - and I agree.  The trust connections grow exponentially.  This concept is quite similar to the ["six degrees of Kevin Bacon game"](
I think the network has a **very** long way to go before this is true for the vast majority of users.  Until then, XRP will be widely used because it is _easy_ and, in some aspect, safer (no gateway/friend defaults).  And, while it is used, users are at risk.


Thank you, I think it is important as well.  I have contributed my fair share to free software as well, but I don't think someone's contributions increases or decreases the validity of their argument - if that's what you were trying to say.  Otherwise, thank you for your contribution to free software!

The sourcecode is open for anyone to adapt, and I'm a firm believer that with enough desire (and money) anything can be engineered.  Especially artificial limits or inefficiencies.
Even if his personal project fails, he has laid the groundwork for future p2p cryptocurrencies.  The concepts are burned into the collective consciousness and a new frontier that generations will explore academically.  He has already succeeded.

I think the threat of pool operators in 51% attacks is over exaggerated.  They could potentially do some damage, but they don't own the hashing power themselves and it would be pretty clear what they were doing very quickly.

Thanks for the link, high quality reading of real discussion.  However, it seems JoelKatz concides that XRP is not necessary, just convenient.  This is pretty much what I have stated throughout this thread.

Sure.  Ripple, while it is an interesting idea, is owned and operated by OpenCoin.  OpenCoin added something unnecessary to the picture - XRP (or "ripples").  XRP is an entirely premined currency.  This means OpenCoin (and it's investors) hold **all** the XRP.  They claim this is so they can distribute it, and they have distributed a little, but they also admit (and it's pretty clear) they expect XRP to rise in value so they can make massive profits off the currency since they premined it all from the start (see their comments from the "ripple sending passwords in plaintext" thread from a few days ago).
Some people will state XRP is not a currency and should just be thought of as a "stamp" or a way to help promote the integrity of the system.  However, OpenCoin, the Ripple website, and the users already in the system are reffering to it and using it as a currency.
In the world of Ripple, OpenCoin is acting as the central agency, despite using p2p distributed technologies.  It controls the influx of currency.  The lack of this is a core concept of Bitcoin.  Ripple simply wears the mask of a distributed p2p service.
Ripple is built on IOUs issued by gateways.  XRP is IOUs that are not associated with any gateway.  By holding XRP, you don't have to risk loss of your goods if the gateway has problems, and can transfer between gateways with ease and without granting trust to too many places.  This is very convenient.  However, since OpenCoin and its investors hold the vast majority of the XRP, they essentially have self issued IOUs from everyone else.  Whenever they decide to "cash out" they will devalue everyone elses hard earned or traded XRP, and probably significantly.
Ripple _would_ work fine without XRP.  Now, why can't we just use Ripple with minimum XRP held (to add trust, make an account, etc.) and just have a highly connected web of trust between users and gateways to exchange gateway IOUs instead of XRP?  We could, if we all knew this was best.  But Ripple is hard to understand, and hard to explain, and "just use XRP - it's safer" is an easy message to give to new users.  Because of this, OpenCoin is essentially preying on those who lack understanding.  I don't want to support an organization built on a corrupt scheme, even if they've got an interesting idea.
There are other issues as well, like the long promised source code hasn't been released.  Honestly, I _suspect_ this is because they think someone will fork it and invent an ethically correct version of their system,  providing competition.
Long post, probably incorrect grammar.  It's late.  Let me know if you'd like to know anything more (or disagree).
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:39:39
You say "Ripple fixes lots of the issues in BTC without replacing it", but you only gave one (pretty useless) example: banks and BTC exchange**r**s (not exchanges) won't have to worry about eachother.
You say XRP is not a store of value, and I agree it shouldn't be, but OpenCoin **brands** it as a currency and OpenCoin and it's investors are literally banking on it gaining value so they can profit from it.

I disagree with point number 1.  It doesn't make any sense to mine BTC with normal computer hardware right now unless you have free power, and it's just going to get very worse in the next few months with BFL coming out.  Used computers lose a lot of value, and it's going to take a while for you to mine any significant amount.
ASICs value will drop if the value of bitcoin does, yes.  I'd still go with the ASIC.  However, if you want to be safer, go with FPGAs at least - they have plenty of other applications and should still hold some value.

You know, you can "double spend" credit/debit cards as well.
If you forfeit your anonyminity to hold some "quick" funds to spend with a bitcoin debit card I could see it happening.  The consequences of overspending would be the same as they are with the current situation.  Someone (bitcoin bank) comes after you with interest.
Now, I don't like this system, but I think it would work.  I'd probably buy into it with a 20 BTC balance and use it for coffee and bar tabs.
@_date: 2013-05-01 09:43:05
While it might not seem like it since I wrote this thread and also argued with you about Ripple a while ago, I actually believe it is true in theory.  I think the concepts behind Ripple are useful and could provide superior options to exchanges.  This is why I think it's important OpenCoin makes serious changes or the project is forked and modified or reverse engineered.
I would strongly support a version of Ripple without any backing agency (or one without direct control) and modifications for fair distribution or removal of XRP.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:25:25
