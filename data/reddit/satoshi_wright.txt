The key is not available! Here's why...
When I sign as Craig Wright Satoshi, it is not the same thing as if I sign myself Craig Wright.
Bitcoin is different, because bitcoin doesn't rely on refutable nuances. The abstract notion of truth falsifies at the human level as it falls on itself.
What you and the media further validated is the point that you can't trust yourself the same way you can trust yourself. Fundamental, when considering how you choose to align your thoughts to this space.
The same way you know to trust a digital validation. Without overwhelming evidence non-contrary to the fact, Satoshi might as well be typing this for all you know, and you wouldn't be able to prove otherwise.
just Craig Wright.
There's a tainted amount of similarity between an opportunist and a revolutionist...therein lacks the ability to differentiate. Nevertheless, due to untold events, this was imminent
I am Satoshi Nakamoto only If I sign. Gavin was always there, and quite frankly, I don't see anybody more deserving of the honor. But, I'm not Satoshi Nakamoto if I say I'm Craig Wright. Consider the loop closed.
So what exactly is it? How and why did we ever get to the point that makes us resist the very fabric of an uttered truth that's beyond reasonable doubt. I'd concur it has to do with history. But for what it's worth, and from what has been show today..there's cry out for better
Good news, it's a different era..
And we must take the leap. Glide past these walls that have chained us so very long and land unto a medium that's temperament, pure and rich in transparency. The current monetary system as we know it begs to be overhauled, because the system as we know it, is run by us.
It's outdated, and prone to self-interests /deceit. There is a better because we are in a new era.
Here's where you come in. What you just demonstrated in the last 24 hours merely is no less than exertion of power at your disposable. You yield no less authority than that which can hold even a Satoshi to the very standards of a conman.
**So starting using it!**

**Appeal to authority: A failure of Trust**
  Silence is not a confession. Before we decide to believe what we believe, it is necessary to verify the information being asserted....that goes of the asserter...
..AND the enquirer. That said,
That burden initially rests on whoever sparks the claim.
AND trust..demands extra ordinary proof.
