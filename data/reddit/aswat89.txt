I have enough that I stopped giving a fuck. 
I just look at them periodically and say “oookay”.

Easy way to get scammed by the way.

They can’t that’s the point.

Gyft sells a number of gift cards for bitcoins, it includes best buy. 
BitPay can turn your btc into amazon gift codes.

There are so many exchanges I don’t know how they would enforce such a ban. Even the Russian and south East Asian exchanges won’t deal with this person?
Locally should be an option in most major cities as well.

It’s anyone’s guess dude. All people are doing is speculating.

Whoops. Looks like my phone autocorrected. 
It’s “gyft” in the App Store.

Are you having problems buying more bitcoins or cashing out?
Pretty easy to cash out at 90% spot value no questions asked in the states. 
Look at local bitcoins and other such services, a little more leg work but in your case worth the effort.

The value of btc could do a lot of things. 
These predictions are getting tiresome. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:09:13
Best Buy through gift app, or amazon through bitpay app.
