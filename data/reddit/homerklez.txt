Apparently the real Satoshi used the word "bloody" before:  
Bitcoin. A new online currency.
“Sorry to be a wet blanket, but, writing a description of Bitcoin for general audiences is **bloody** hard. There is nothing to relate it to.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, July 5, 2010
also you can google/bing the quote and it comes a lot.

So, I googled how many transactions a payment processor like Visa takes in a day.  According to this website its approximately 32,000,000 per day.  
Now, today one bitcoin is worth ~455, the miners make approximately $11375 per block, and $68,250 per hour, thats $1,638,000 per day in block rewards.
If Satoshi opened up his castle to everyone, and we caught up to Visa's 32,000,000, and charged $.05 per transaction, that would be roughly $1.6 million in transaction fees.  Granted I'm talking about the 100 years from now example.  In your example Satoshi would need more soldiers to keep the network secure, but I think soldiers = hashing power, not necessarily miners.  If we kept the same amount of miners, and the technology got better for mining, which it obviously will, wouldnt it work itself out?  In my example, Satoshi doesnt get more soldiers, but their soldiers get guns to replace their swords, and missiles to replace their cannons.
Another thought, transaction fees are measured in fractions of bitcoins, lets use .0001 as an example, as its worth about $.05,  When Satoshi opens up his castles, and the peasants all start using his money, Satoshi can never print more money, so the value of the existing currency has to go up because of scarcity.  If there are 100 people sharing 21 bitcoins, and all the sudden there are 1000 people, yet there are still only 21 bitcoins, the price of those coins has to go up, as the peasants would be competing over those coins.

Also quoting wired.com's article:  
When a UCLA professor nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for a Nobel Prize earlier this month—and he was declared ineligible due to the mystery of his identity—Wright lashed out. “If Satoshi-chan was made for an ACM turing price [sic] or an Alfred Nobel in Economics he would let you bloody know that,” he wrote on twitter
According to your navy seals theory, maybe he wanted to be found so he could be eligible for the Nobel prize?  Seems to have backfired though, now that he's got the government up in his house now.  
Hard to say at this point, I had made my judgement about Dorian not being the real Satoshi pretty quick, this time there is much more evidence, the question is about the credibility of the evidence.

So, if you calculate that the network is currently at 287k ths, and you added 51% more hasing power, you'd be adding another 146.37 ths to the network, thus you'd have a grand total of 433.37 thus you'd in fact only have 33% of the network.  To truly pull this off, you'd have to either take control of 51% of the existing miners, or you'd have to basically add about 299k ths, thus adding about 51% more miners.
Now if we use your calculations, we get:
((287k currently+ 299k which you'd be adding * .51) / 5.5ths)* $3600
Which equals about 195.6 Million, + 1 fusion reactor + closer to $20 million in power supplies (which also may be included) + thousands of football fields + $21 million in copper wiring + $102 million in air conditioning

Actually this is false.  There are only approximately 13.5 million bitcoins in circulation, and some people have hundreds, even thousands.  Satoshi is said to have about a million bitcoins.  
Some day perhaps 15m people could own a full bitcoin simultaneously, but that wont be for many years, and likely wont ever happen :)

I'll be honest, I've seen some MSI 280x and boards for cheap and I didnt buy them.  Not because the quality of the hardware but rather MSI support's stance on miners in general.  So at this point I dont care whether they take bitcoin or not, I still wont buy their product.
I had to look it up, but a while back someone was asking MSI support for help and the moderator in a support forum said: 
This is a user to user forum and that stance is not MSI's its this forums as its run by users to help other users (MSI HQ Users-to-Users Forum) and we are just like you and use MSI made equipment ourself's and the moderator team and admins have decided its not a good thing to help with as we would be personally responsible for helping someone with a activity that is potential illegal and would be open to court actions individually so sorry for our own protection we can not"!
I realize that it was just a MSI support forum, however if they let their mods talk that way to paying customers, without taking action then screw them.
TLDNR: MSI Support basically said because some people use bitcoin for illegal purposes, they will not support their hardware for mining purposes.

Tell your parents,  did you know if you'd have invested about $1000 in apple in its IPO in 1980 it'd be worth about $394,000 today?
If you'd have invested $100 in bitcoin in 2010 it'd be worth 75 million today.   
The bitcoin article was written last year in may,  the price was about 4k if I remember correctly,  so actually probably twice that today. 
Then talk about big companies supporting it,  like Microsoft,  newegg,  tiger direct,  overstock,  Expedia,  etc...

You can download them into a local wallet on your computer.  Go to  and download one.  This method is also not quite safe as you can be hacked.
A safer method would be to get a cheap computer or tablet, download the wallet to it and then pull the internet plug (keep offline).  Also make sure to keep backups of your wallet.dat in case something happens to said computer or tablet.  Also encrypt your wallet with a pass phrase.

Sure you can compile a list of things that are bad with bitcoin... but you fail to see that they are outweighed by the problem with the dollar.
Whether it is legal or not is not in question.  The US government knows it exists, they're not actively trying to make it illegal (except for 1 senator).  They cant control it anymore than they can control the internet.  The government only wants to figure out how to tax it.   The law doesnt say everything you can have, they only talk about the things you cant have.  ie... I have a logitech G510s keyboard, no where in any law does it say I can own it, does it make it illegal?  Heck, at one point it was illegal to own gold.  They talk about goods, services and commodities.  As long as they dont say I cant have it, then I can.
Whats the US Debt up to?  You say the richest person (Presumably Bill Gates) has 67 billion, not quite the same thing... he did not create the US Dollar, he simply earned them.  The US Government creates the dollar, and owes something like 17 trillion of them.  What is to stop them from creating more?  I dont think I've seen a good estimate of how many dollars are actually in existance.  At least with bitcoin I know there will never be more than 21 million, so we lose a few bitcoins on the way... It just makes the ones in existence more valuable.  You need not pay for things with a whole bitcoin, it can be divided in to several decimal places.
People lose money all the time on bad investments, stocks collapsing and people have their lives ruined by things like credit card fraud.  Sure you can say people helped fund that with bitcoin....  In a world that accepts bitcoin, there is no information in a place like Target for a hacker to steal.  A hacker goes into the database, see's millions of bitcoin addresses and decides he cant do anything with them (except pay them money) and goes to look for credit card numbers.  What will help bitcoin become viable in the future is some sort of super security in which a user can hold bitcoin without fear of being hacked on their own PC.
You already know the response to the "bitcoins help finance the worst things we can ever imagine in this world" Quote.  They wouldnt stop just because bitcoin ceased to exist, before bitcoin people just used dollars, if bitcoin dies they'll continue using dollars.  Its easy to point out the bad things bitcoin can be used for (its also easy to point out the bad things dollars can be used for)  Now look at some of the  good things it can be used for things like donations, sending money from one place to the world to a loved one in another side of the world without paying ridiculous fees.  You can buy groceries, food, clothes, bed sheets and computer equipment with bitcoin, the difference is Credit card companies arent hoarding 2 to 4% fees for every transaction taking place.  You can send 20,000 bitcoins for something like 20 cents.  The equivalent for paying that amount with a credit card comes out to something like $260,000 assuming a 2% transaction fee.  Who are the real crooks?
I'm going to skip the 51% attack thing, and let Andreas explain it:    the TLDR is they're being watched they'd be able to do like 1 double spend and then they'd quickly be booted, people would leave the pool and bitcoin would be stronger afterward.
To answer the quantum computer thing, its not like one day someone is just going to have a quantum computer and destroy the bitcoin network.  If quantum computing happens to be as gamebreaking as you make it sound, lots of people will have that, and it'll just be the next version of the ASIC miner that you'll have to have to mine.  All it does is drastically increase the difficulty of the network.
Anyways, I unlike you see promise in a world based currency thats not controlled by one government.  I see a world where people arent trying to make a fast buck with bitcoin, but rather want to acquire it to carry out their normal lives, buy food, cars, houses, etc...  In the U.S. our dollar is pretty stable (for now, how many times has the US almost defaulted), many countries like Argentina and Zimbabewe are not.  Bitcoin may not be the front runner when the dust clears, however I believe that a crypto currency will win out in the end.

I like watching Andreas Antonopoulos speak.  I like his take on the long term outlook of Bitcoin:  
Fast forward to about 1:33:00  for the last question.
Long story short, its either going to fail catastrophically or its going to the moon, there's no in between.
My personal belief is somewhat similar, if it doesnt fail catastrophically, it will be huge. Bitcoin to me isnt a get rich quick scheme.  Many people just want to put a few bucks in and get a few thousand out...   If bitcoin works the way I hope it will someday, you wont need to cash it out for dollars.
At the end of the day, you dont want dollars, you want the stuff dollars can buy.  If you could spend .5 bitcoins and get a car, why the heck would you change it over to dollars first.

I would say there are lots of misconceptions about bitcoin.  People associate it with buying guns, drugs and other bad things.  Truth is you can buy those things with dollars, euros, gold and other types of currency.  
What makes Bitcoin different to me is:  Dollars/Euros, etc have value because the government says so.   Bitcoin has value because the people say so.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:42:00
As you're finding out, its a peer to peer decentralized currency, not owned by any government.  It makes it easy to send currency anywhere in the world instantly.  
If you dont already know, there are currently about 13.6 million bitcoins in existance, they get created through a process called mining (dont worry about it, its not profitable), currently 25 bitcoins are created every 10 minutes, this goes down over time (by half every 4 years).  There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existance, unlike the dollar which no one can tell you how many are floating around out there.  Which is why I say hold, or in the bitcoin community you'll hear the term HODL.  :)
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:27:40
Nice tip :)  You can spend bitcoins at places like newegg.com, dell.com, tigerdirect.com, overstock.com and many more, or gift card places like egifter.com and gyft.com, if you own an xbox you can spend bitcoin on microsoft credits and more.  As someone already mentioned you can go to coinbase or circle to "cash out".
If you dont need to cash out at the moment, it might just be a good idea to hold it.  It'll fluxuate up and down in value as compared to the USD.  Just an FYI, if you would have put $10 into bitcoin in October of 2009, it'd be worth about $7 million dollars today.  Many people think bitcoin is in its infancy still and could jump to ridiculous highs again.   Here's an interesting graphic published a few months ago when bitcoin was worth about $650 each:

First of all, the current price of bitcoin isnt as big a deal as everyone is making it out to be.  Bitcoin is defined by more than its price today, it'll either be really high in a few years or basically at $0.
Second of all, miners have more invested in bitcoin than you probably do.  Equipment costs them money, electricity cost them money, and they're the ones keeping the network secure in the first place.  Their equipment becomes outdated really fast, and their reward will halve in a year or so.  
People keep freaking out about the price in the short run, dont forget how fantastic last year was for adoption.  Think of all the huge companies that began taking bitcoin as a form of payment:  Tigerdirect, Overstock, egifter, gyft, newegg, microsoft, expedia, direct tv, and more!  Whats really driving down the price is the fact that these business instantly convert their bitcoins to cash.  In the long run however, the more business that accept bitcoin, the better chance they'll be able to pay their employees/suppliers/bills using bitcoin and they may have a better incentive to hold it, if that ever happens, the available bitcoin supply will shrink.
The reason that bitcoin's value isnt through the roof right now, is that everyone plans to sell it at a higher price.  The reason for this is that you cant yet buy everything you can buy with Dollars, Yen, Euros, etc, using bitcoin yet.  As more and more vendors  accept bitcoins, people will be less likely to want to trade their bitcoins for fiat currency.  Ie, if I can buy the car I want for X amount of bitcoins, why the heck would I trade it in for dollars first.

Apparently you dont know how bitcoin works lol.  
Neither Gavin nor Satoshi Nakamoto can now change the bitcoin code without consensus of the miners.  If Gavin introduced a code to "block the reward" as you put it, who would mine the new protocol change?  
The more important thing is, bitcoin isnt here to get you rich quick, or make you money.  Although the price of bitcoin is important, its not the only thing.  Last year Bitcoin might have been considered the worst investment of 2014, but no article has said bitcoin is the best investment over the last 5 years.  I've said this many times, a $20 investment in late 2009 would be worth millions today.   
That being said, think of all the great things that have happened with adoption in 2014.  Newegg, Tigerdirect, Microsoft, Overstock, Expedia, Direct TV, Egifter and Gyft, and a whole lot of companies began taking bitcoin.  Because they're all converting directly to fiat, its going to drive the price down, but in the long run the more companies that take it, companies may one day hold their bitcoin if their suppliers and employees will accept it, and there is a finite supply of bitcoin.  The only problem right now is the supply outweighs demand.

Consider this, there are currently roughly 15.6 million bitcoins that have been mined total, there will never be more than 21 million.  The country that uses Bitcoin the most is China.  Imagine just 1% of the 1.36 billion people wanted just 1 bitcoin.  Thats 13.6  million people.  
If that many people were trying to get their hands on bitcoin, there wouldnt be enough because there wouldnt be enough sellers.  The first couple million coins would empty most exchanges and jack the price up beyond $10,000, and most people would hodl.  Now imagine if additionally just .1% of the rest of the world wanted bitcoin.  Imagine having just 1 bitcoin in this scenario.

The short of it is...  The block size directly affects how many transactions can be done (on the chain or bitcoin network)  The debate comes in because the current block size on bitcoin core is 1 MB, and even at 1 MB the entire blockchain size is over 170GB.  Imagine if the block sizes were full at 2 MB, it could be as big as 340 GB and over time that number will grow into terrabytes.  You could get more transactions per second/minute by increasing the block size, but it's far less likely that anyone would download the blockchain and run a node (more nodes more security).  Hence the debate, one side wants bigger blocks and faster transactions, the other side wants to keep the 1 mb limit and find a different way to scale more transactions (off chain, lightning network) but still be able to keep the blockchain size reasonable.   I'm not taking sides... thats just a short summary of it, I'm sure there are other things I'm leaving out.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:57:03
I believe the limit was put there to make sure people didnt spam the network and make the blockchain size like 1TB in the earlier years because fees would have been tiny and you could have made millions of transactions just for the sake of making the blockchain size so big that no one would download it.

Relatively easy to answer:  
If you look, Tesla has approximately 164.26 million shares available to trade and purchase, and is traded mostly by Westerners.
Bitcoin has only 16,421,725 coins in existence (increasing by 12.5 every 10 mins or so) but has a maximum limit of 21 million and is used all over the world.  (Mostly in China)
The scarcity of bitcoin is what makes it worth more than Tesla per coin.

I agree with the calls to get a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S.  "In bitcoin, possession is ten tenths of the law" - Andreas Antonopoulos.
But your ELI5 explanation is: 
If you keep money in your bank account and it gets robbed, the government will insure your money (they will pay you back up to $250,000)  If you keep your bitcoin on an exchange and it gets hacked/robbed (which has happened many times), you just lost your bitcoin.  
Now Coinbase is supposedly FDIC insured (if you live in the US), however as many people have discovered if your account gets hacked, this is not covered by their insurance.   There are increasingly sophisticated hacks that even break 2 factor authentication by taking over your cell phone number.  None of this would be possible to hack if you took possession of your bitcoin.
Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger require you to push a physical button to send transactions, so even if you left it plugged in and your computer was hacked, the hacker cant press the button on your Trezor/Ledger.  They can however replace your send address, so be careful when sending transactions.  (Match up the address to the address you're sending with the address on the screen of the Trezor/Ledger)
As someone mentioned before, when you get your hardware wallet, test your recovery key.  Keep this information safe.  Do not save it on your PC, email, cloud or anywhere a hacker can gain access to it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:59:41
Yes:  
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:54:54
To test your recovery key, send a small amount of bitcoin to your Trezor, (unfortunately fees are pretty high right now) but like $1 to $5.  Then wipe the device and restore your Trezor using your recovery key, just to make sure it works properly.  You wouldn't want to have your Trezor malfunction during an update or something and wipe your device, only to find out that you wrote down your recovery key wrong, when you have say a bitcoin or more in it.  If it works properly, you should have the same amount of bitcoin in your trezor as you did before you wiped it.  If your balance is 0 or you get an error, then something is wrong, and you only lost $1 - $5 in the process (plus fees).
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:09:30
So the issue is that there is a 1 MB limit in place that limits the amount of transactions for approximately ever 10 minutes.  The average transaction size is approximately 500 bytes (don't quote me on that) but given this hypothetical number, the network can only process approximately 2000 transactions per every 10 minutes or so.
Now currently there are over 40,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed  .   There have been well over 200,000 transactions stuck before.  The problem is that there are more transactions being created than the network can handle, so what happens is that if you want your transaction to go through it becomes kind of an auctioning system.  The miners will now prioritize the transactions that have the highest fees, and thus you are competing with 40,000 people to try and get your transaction confirmed before theirs.  That is why the transaction fee is so high.  
Now when we talk transaction fee, the bitcoin network (blockchain) ignores the amount of bitcoin you are sending, instead it looks at the size of the transaction.  Fees are measured in satoshi's per byte.  1 Satoshi = .00000001 bitcoins or 1/100 millionth of a bitcoin.  Currently the recommended fee is between 300 bytes per satoshi (for a 1 hour confirmation) and 450 satoshis per byte if you want a fast 10 minute or so transaction.
