Yeah ive spotted that on YT also.... its funny, statistically YT is apparently a male domain with the majority of viewership being male.... yet if you type in 'minimalism' you get pages and pages of women youtubers

There goes that darn patriarchy again excluding women from technological progress

Left wings are mostly feminists and SJWs. They cant find a victim narrative in bitcoin therefore its not interesting to them.

I see the females are dominating the key topics

Exactly, or stop bitching about the supposed pay gap

I have bitcoin in my Jazz Wallet. I want to send back to coinbase and liquidate. Coinbase has warned me only to send BTC to the address and any Bitcoin Cash will be lost in the result of a transfer.
Im confused over this whole bitcoin split thing. Do I now own BTC and Bitcoin cash in my jazz wallet but Jazz cannot split it out yet? Therfore by me sending it to coin base ill loose it?
Can someone help me out here. I dont wanna loose money.
Edit: HODL is not an acceptable answer to my above question. I thought id say that before the comments rolled in haha :)

Thanks for your help on this. Is there an easy way I can sell my BCH and buy BTC instead? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:24:58
in some ways it makes me happy because it still has a lot of room to grow, but I guess some people are not inclined to ever want to buy it

Whats the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:32:28
backed by math, what does that even mean.... all software is backed by math, that doesn't mean it isnt hackable

Ah so let me see if I understand you correctly.
I can get an Electon Cash wallet and use the private keys from my Jazz Wallet to load the wallet. Once I have done this I will be able to view my BTC in my Jazz wallet and my BHC in my Electon wallet. I can then transfer all the holdings from my Jazz wallet over to coinbase knowing I still have my BHC safe in the Electon Wallet. Have I got this correct?
Does this also mean I have more money than I think I do.... For example if I have £1000 in my Jazz Wallet and Jazz cannot view BCH, does that mean that I have an extra few hundred that isnt being shown on my Jazz Dashboard? Happy days if yes!

it could happen though, right?

Lets be honest though the people spending bitcoin on retail electronics are doing it for novelty factor only. Until Bitcoin replaces things like PayPal because its simpler to use we can't really say it has real world retail use
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:10:59
so technically this could happen to bitcoin, if people stop mining them then the price drops?
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:38:41
Ive had it stored on coin base for around 6 months now. Im kinda looking for direction on what is a good next step. Ive looked into the bread wallet and offline storage such as Trezor. Also considering paper wallets. Just need to understand pros and cons of all and what is a good next step.
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:38:58
fair point
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:02:22
Oh I understand that the demand drives the value. similar to gold.
I also understand that each bitcoin is harder to mine than the last. Im just wondering if all of the computing power is actually doing anything useful?
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:10:08
yes but supply and demand says you can loose your shirt
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:32:41
yeah man, 1 Zimbabwe dollar is still 1 Zimbabwe dollar... HODL
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:38:41
whats the logic in buying something with no value?
P.s I hear Zimbabwe dollars are a catch right now...
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:34:08
yeah spend it on cash

Why did some of the alt coins go to zero? a failed system?
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:25:03
Thank you for the detailed reply. Im not sure if you have answered this and I missed it but my concern is. Saying it spits and I now own Bitcoin1 and Bitcoin2.... If EVERYONE decides to sell there Bitcoin2 and buy Bitcoin1... Then the price of Bitcoin2 would go to zero and the price of Bitcoin1 would rise.
Sure the market caps would be exactley the same so I wouldnt loose money. But I would have lost the opportunity to do the same while Bitcoin2 had some value. 
Are my assumptions correct?
