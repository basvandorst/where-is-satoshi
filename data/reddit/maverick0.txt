Fair enough. I'm looking for the cheapest way to supplement / free up my GPU so any time I see mention of cheap(er) block eruptors, I have to at least look into it. If you do re-sell, I'll keep an eye out. Thanks :)

I definitely learned a fair bit about trading and investing here as well... I cashed out not long ago since I was starting to lose out and in hindsight that seems to have been a good call.
I had only invested what I managed to mine myself, so no big losses, but still sad to see such a site and service be taken down.

You reselling these or do you have a ridiculous set up? :p
Edit: Why the downvote? It's a legitimate question?

If for some reason you need someone local, I live in Winnipeg and would be willing to help if I can.

I just invested a few of the few coins I've mined into TAT-ASICMINER shares. Unless I interpreted things wrong, this TAT is microshares for ASICMINER. Given that, do you guys know if these also pay out dividends or am I just better off waiting to sell at a better price than I paid?

I checked out your site and then realized your business name. Holy crap, I can pick up a USB miner locally! I've been looking to buy a USB miner, but shipping is usually prohibitive. 
I might have to cash out some of my btc investments just so I can pick one up! Are you guys open on Saturdays? I would love to stop in and check out your shop!
