What is the best way to earn money with bitcoins?
Selling pizzas. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:19:16
Ok. I did but that only indicates it's a different recipe.
 Is it hot sauce as in 'Tabasco hot sauce, or does it have a different purpose/use?
@_date: 2014-04-13 08:51:00
Wow. Over my head.
@_date: 2014-04-24 08:49:36
I read KFC wallet 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:26:53
That's cool
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:50:17
Welcome back
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:55:56
A house for 0.25 BTC. I like the sound of that.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:19:09
Would coinjar app help? You'll have to get some coins into the account but then it seems to be straightforward?
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:23:47
About two months ago. And then it crashed.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:15:42
This is GOLD!
(i should get one)
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:26:29
I don't agree. Criticism is good. 
Most criticism is quickly flagged as trolling here. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:05:30
It's coinjar.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:48:30
You're shooting blanks on android 
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:31:48
Yes, the graphical bug changed all 0.0009 text into zero for just a short while. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:53:33
Thanks. Scary stuff still, I wish it could not be cracked.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:33:12
It's morning here already. Still going.
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:13:23
My password is about (can't be too careful) 15 characters, capital/lower and some numbers. Easy to crack?
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:49:41
So what's the purpose of encryption if it's so easy to crack??
@_date: 2014-05-11 07:24:58
More plz
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:14:55
That is your reply?
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:26:42
How often does it refresh and does it refresh the whole site of just the numbers? Don't want to burn my data allowance on this. 
Also, what about a shorter term chart? 1hr, 2hr, 6hr, 12hr?

@_date: 2014-04-28 22:31:20
Yes it is, but considering I am in Australia I guess the cost of the sauce plus added cost for shipping might be a bit more expensive than what I pay in the shops for Tabasco sauce.  I visited the Tabasco place in Avery Island, Louisiana about ten years ago and that was quite the experience :)

Come on, a Harry Potter die-hard like you should should know better, this is magic happening right in front of your eyes. I believe crypto currency, one way or the other, has a future. I'd rather be part of this when this is all being shaped. Rather to go down with it then to miss out on a opportunity. It's not just the destination, the journey is all part of the game.
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:53:08
What's the source?
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:08:02
Just read it all and judge if you find it creditable or not. 
Lazy attitude.
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:11:45
Get a life.
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:29:58
So what's going to happen, is he ever going to appear in court, to answer some questions? 
Because I understand that nobody still knows why these coins are gone/lost/stolen/inaccessible?
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:10:01
Previous performance etc etc
@_date: 2014-04-19 04:28:19
Possibly bad press and as a result of that fear. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:10:09
Not exactly what you do want or don't want, but I bought my 1st bitcoin at Coinjar today. Yes, they need to verify identity, and you need to create an account ( don't think you can get around that anywhere), but it was quite a smooth operation.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:01:07
+5 doge
Because you asked for it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:51:19
Wow nice website.
Oh no wait. It's actually ugly :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:38:14
Yes, but Frappuchino's sold out that day. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:25:20
Should only become a 'problem' from the beginning of May.
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:17:07
Seems legit
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:25:15
You want space?
@_date: 2014-04-08 09:55:22
How would he ship such a fragile object?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:13:45
Are you subscribed to this sub? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:23:21
It's been great so far.
@_date: 2014-04-21 09:28:29
So do you think he spent it, or did he lose it (keys)? Or was it stolen?
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:04:57
Nope. Check the sidebar.
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:17:18
What is your suggestion?
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:53:34
I'm not worried. Looking for a good price. May be in a couple of days.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:47:38
That is bull.
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:01:28
Wait. What?
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:45:19
I thought there was a new logo?
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:15:27
Solid advise
@_date: 2014-04-05 08:14:43
You forgot the instant transaction verification.
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:04:40
Where's the secret? I don't see it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:05:55
But it IS possible?
What if every creature on the planet creates a couple of offline wallets today?
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:37:15
How many confirmation do you need to verify the transaction? Even 30 seconds is too slow, imagine waiting in line for 30 seconds every time that a customer makes a payment. 
Not trying to be difficult, but I really believe the verification delay is the issue with cryto's. It can't compete with any if the mainstream payment options, like credit card.
Will this delay ever get fixed btw?
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:05:11
No I won't sell.  
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:12:17
But basically it's the same? Just a different recipe? Or is this something completely different? 
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:46:49
How does this answer my question? 
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:14:22
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:44:11
Money of the future. I get it now, don't use it now, bit maybe in the future when it's usable. (I have BTC, don't worry, but I find it far from practial at this stage)
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:37:02
I bought last week. I also hold doge coins.
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:59:19
All coins were stolen?
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:10:47
It's not the only reason. I want to be able to access my funds from phone, desktop, laptop, tablet, anywhere, anytime. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:32:44
I will not use a local (on my PC) wallet, for this reason, and also for the reason that the constant download/update of the block-chain uses too much of my data allowance. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:17:40
Or just some messages tied to a worthless coin.
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:42:26
I wish I could. This is very addictive.

@_date: 2014-04-28 22:03:07
What is the size of these bottles?
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:02:56
That.1000 won't do it. I'm in here for the 50.000.
I'll buy some more coins over the next couple of days/weeks,  I think 10-15 coins,  $4500-$7500 at current prices. This could at some point set me or my kids up for life. Or not, but I have at least tried. 
Depending on what the price will do over the next couple of weeks when I am buying, I might buy more or less than that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:48:02
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:50:48
Hoe many bitcoins did you recover if I may ask?
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:15:38
Oh that small. 
I'll try the recipe instead :)
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:51:57
Who got hacked?

@_date: 2014-05-03 00:52:16
Girls! Shut up.
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:25:55
What's going to happen with Karpeles, is he ever going to appear in court, to answer some questions? Because I understand that nobody still knows why these coins are gone/lost/stolen/inaccessible?
@_date: 2014-04-25 01:05:07
What are the units of the sizes of the pieces on te website?
 Cm? Inch?
@_date: 2014-05-03 05:28:18
Only 904625697166532776746648320380374280100293470930272690489102837043110636675 pages to go. Awesome.

Sorry earth
@_date: 2014-04-19 13:49:35
Yeah, last time i visited a bank was when I was 8. What have bank opening times to do with Bitcoin advantage?
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:49:48
Should have probably been 'best way to get rich'.
Thanks for the tip :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:58:03
No trolling, but this is why I believe Bitcoin is not yet ready for mass adaption.
I'm in. But I'm one of the few. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:43:58
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:28:53
At this rate, zero.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:53:06
Thanks... That's a reassurance for me. I am not alone :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:46:12
I'd do it. 
  
  
If you've seen the movie, you may as well sell it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:42:21
I touch and go.
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:07:14
Elaborate, i have another $1000 underway to my Coinjar account, not sure if I should buy the BTC now or a little later. You seem to be onto something very important.
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:46:18
Not just watching the price, watching it all happening. No worries, I do have a life :-) 
Edit: I see what you mean; F5. 
I wasn't regarding to the price, but to Reddit and news on Bitcoin/crypto's.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:23:49
Alright, get it. I will still try your recipe and maybe order some after that :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:53:28
Most people don't even make 20 BTC a month. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-04-12 06:56:20
Wow this shows how small we(*) are.
(*) I bought 1 coin today
@_date: 2014-05-09 05:18:11
I like it.
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:40:56
Wow. You got an TL;DR please? 
Not easy to please :)
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:23:44
Same he, first I didn't even realise there was meant to be a character there at the start of the sentence.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:36:34
A little too long I guess. Don't you think?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:44:50
So what's the chance that someone else(offline) creates the same wallet address?
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:43:29
... And Mark Karpelès is the proud dad.
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:41:27
Would that have anything to do with the NAB? Didn't think it should/would?
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:20:51
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:35:52
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:44:50
No but quite similar, or not?
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:40:05
I decided not to use a local wallet. I can't download the entire block chain, too much data. Will not create a paper wallet either, i need to use and trade my Btc, not hide it under a mattress. Money of the future will be stored online.
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:25:34
Money of the future. 
Not money of today, obviously.
(Me: bull, hold, but don't like the way we have to manage the coins, it's pathetic for this time and age and for such a revolutionary currency)
