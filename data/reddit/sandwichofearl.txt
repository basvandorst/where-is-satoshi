The savings in fees will only be realized if the sender is sending from a segwit address.  If it is a legacy address to segwit address, then fees will not be any different.

When it comes to 'regular'  bitcoin transactions, do you consider the full nodes who relay your transaction to be middlemen?

Bitcoin is the money dapp.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:59:04
Best to have a few channels open with a few peers so that any channels with unresponsive peers can be closed and reopened with new peers and you continue using the other channels normally in the meantime.
L2 is complimentary because it is better suited for small and instant payments.  We know L1 is going to be limited due to the need to keep it decentralized.
You only need to verify that the opening transaction for the channel is on the blockchain, your lightning wallet contains the necessary data to verify the updated channel funds (though it would be smart to backup this data incase you lose access to your wallet).
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:04:14

@_date: 2019-07-22 02:12:06
Actually, to be more precise, nodes will accept 12.5 and anything less than that (no problem if a miner underpays themselves).
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:40
It would still continue to be the miners, but instead of earning new coins, they earn only transaction fees. (They are currently earning new coins + transaction fees).
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:17:06
If you held bitcoins on August 1st 2017, then you should be entitled to an equivalent amount of bcash (since that was when bcash was created).  From my understanding, coinbase will give users access to their bcash sometime in January.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:30:57
I think the bigger problem with Bcash is that it only has a tiny fraction of the mining power Bitcoin has.  Therefore it is highly susceptible to a 51% attack by any of the large Bitcoin mining pools.  
You always see bcashers touting "it's better than bitcoin in every way", but really, the truth is that bcash is less secure than Bitcoin, and if it is less secure, then it isn't better than Bitcoin.  Why would I want to keep any of my crypto wealth on a chain that is only secure at the mercy of ANY ONE of several big bitcoin mining pools?
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:44:15
Dude, xrp took the easy way to scaling by sacrificing decentralization - are you able to run a ripple node? Think about it another way: If I want to store my wealth in crypto for 5-10 years, which system would I choose? The resilient decentralized one (Bitcoin being the prime example)? Or the easy to shutdown centralized one(xrp)? It doesn't take a genius.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:26:40
Actually it would be about double the capacity if everyone used segwit, but I believe that would be good enough for now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:35:56
It isn't useful for large transactions because you can't expect most channels in the network to operate with large amounts of money (for example, the majority of users have less than 2btc, probably much lower than that even).  IIRC, the lightning network specifications limits channel creation to 0.04btc.  So any transactions larger than that amount would likely be easier to do on-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:22
Long term savings on the most secure blockchain is a legitimate use case that doesn't really require paying any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:40
Safer option is obviously to push for more segwit usage.  Definitely not a smart idea to push for a reckless blocksize increase (as we have seen with the code for 2x).
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:50
A poorly planned blocksize increase would cause more problems than it solves.  If people want lower fees, then we already have a 2mb block solution called segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:52:33
Yea, that is a problem, but if I was in your situation, I would have to ask myself if it is worth paying the higher fees now, or sit on the sidelines waiting for a an easier way to buy (but at that point, bitcoin price might already be two or three times more expensive).
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:47:03
Don't think so as bcash users and exchanges are highly susceptible to 51% mining attacks.

And plus, lightning isn't going to be useful for very large transactions, so those will still need to be handled on-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:57:40
It's going to plummet soon anyway when coinbase releases their users' bcash coins.

@_date: 2018-09-30 13:56:33
Over the longterm I don't think it will be, but let's assume BCH is best for payments - I don't need to store my wealth on such a network.  Only less than 1% of my wealth needs to be ready for fast payments.  The other 99% of my wealth needs to be kept safe for many years, which is what BTC is optimized for because it is the most decentralized and trustless (I will likely always be able to run a BTC full node on my PC - can't say the same for BCH).
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:24:16
Yes, lower fees is one of the advantages. There are no restrictions with sending between legacy and Segwit addresses.

He doesn't know what he is talking about.  His first statement about the ledger growing in an "unbounded" manner is false - there is a limit to the number of transactions that can fit in each block.  The good news is that the unbounded growth/transactions can happen in second layer networks so that regular laptops can still run Bitcoin full nodes.

bitaddress.org can be used to generate wallets in bulk.  I'm on a slow computer, but it only took under 2 mins to generate 300 wallets.  the bitcoin core wallet lets you send to many addresses at once, and I'm sure plenty of others do as well.
So to send to 10,000 new addresses, i would generate 300 wallets at a time, collect the address (and safely store the private keys).  Use bitcoin core to send 10k to each of the 300 addresses (all in one transaction).
Then generate another set of 300, and keep repeating until all funds are in new wallets.
I'm sure someone more computer savvy than me can get it all accomplished in well under 1 hour.

I see what you mean about power to the people, but I believe the primary definition of Communism is that everyone has equal share to the wealth.  However, not everyone is equal on the blockchain - as a prime example, there are people who hold much more blockchain tokens (bitcoins) compared to others, and the Bitcoin blockchain makes it impossible to redistribute wealth equally to everyone. (So in that regard, it is anti-communism).  Bitcoin is closer to the ideal of voluntarism rather than communism - everyone is free to access/use the Bitcoin blockchain and leave whenever they want to.

It wasn't Bitcoin that hardforked last year, it was bitcoincash that chose to "hardfork away" from Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is still "United" regardless of transaction type used.  I personally use segwit, non-segwit, and multisig - it's all interchangeable, all works seemlessly together.

Node decentralization isn't the biggest problem with the small blocks vs big blocks debate.  It is hardforking that is the bigger issue here.  Hardforking always runs the risk of splitting the blockchain into 2, such as eth and ethclassic for example. But this would be a much bigger problem for bitcoin than ethereum because bitcoin gets its value from people holding it as a store of value (people having faith in the 21 million coin limit). if the bitcoin blockchain splits into 2, then the number of total bitcoin doubles, and this will forever ruin bitcoin's status as digital gold.

They can get to 1.5-2.5mb maximum with more usage of segwit.  It would be like saying BCH has 0.1 mb blocks (because that is what is being used), but the maximum is actually 32mb.

Might be useful to compare how much an M-pesa transaction costs.  From this site (
"The cost of sending between Ksh 501 to Ksh 1,000 is Ksh 15."
Which means it costs around 15cents USD to send 5 to 10 USD worth using mpesa.  
So maybe if average fee per transaction is over 15 cents, then we should start to worry.  but then again, mpesa is limited geographically, while bitcoin works globally.

I'm interested in the potential of lightning as a means of doing away with pay walls.

This highlights Bitcoin's superiority over the privacy altcoins.  Any inflation bugs in Bitcoin are noticed quickly and patched quickly.

How about building a chainlink type system without the shit-token.

What's also cool is that no softfork/hardfork needed for this upgrade.

I agree. **In rollercoasterguy we trust!**

You are exaggerating. Like I said above, we could quickly see some effect since it should be easy for the big Bitcoin companies to start using segwit transactions between themselves.

It doesn't make sense to be against activating segwit - if you don't like it, just don't use it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:09:55
I think once it is activated some of the large Bitcoin companies can very quickly start doing segwit transactions between themselves which would help out alot.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:49:08
I think it means different digital assets and tokens on various blockchains will be able to be instantly traded with one another without going through any exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:39:07
If "emergent consensus" of what the network nodes wanted (signaling for) really worked, we would have activated Segwit already. EC just doesn't work.

Day trading is extremely risky especially if u don't have any experience.  Safer option is to buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:26:53
Exactly. If bitcoin ever loses its censorship resistance / trust-less usage, it will very likely lose them forever. Low fee payments can be implemented in several different ways easily enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:10:17
Incorrect, the risk associated with hardforking is definitely much higher, so it would need a longer activation period to ensure safety.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:39:08
The majority of network nodes are signaling readiness for segwit *only.*
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:44:37
Not necessarily because a hardfork would need a longer activation period to ensure it is done safely. So segwit is the quickest solution.

Gavin should first say "I believe I was tricked". 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:31:11
Seems pointless. Even if a miner made a larger block to collect the reward, the rest of the miners would simply see it as an invalid block and it would simply ignore the larger block. We already saw a larger block mined by the bitcoindotcom mining pool recently and it was treated as an invalid block by the network.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:51:03
Is there any reasoning behind that statement?

@_date: 2017-05-11 14:33:44
BU is based on EC and EC is clearly not working. If EC worked like people claim it does, then the miners should be on board with what the vast majority of the network nodes are signaling for, and that is clearly Segwit ONLY at this time. But no, miners don't seem to respect the current "emergent consensus" of the network (which is Segwit).

Paste the bitcoin address (NOT PRIVATE KEY) into  and see if there is a balance.

It can still be digital gold as long as we are building off chain methods that are 100% redeemable on-chain.


If you think you have an on chain method that doesn't severely sacrifice decentralization, then please share it.

@_date: 2016-07-11 14:49:47
Price for anything is determined by supply and demand.  If demand stays the same or increases while supply is restricted (block halving), the we should see price go up.  But nothing is guaranteed and bitcoin could collapse.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:23:56
Bitcoin's blocks are currently bigger than 1mb. It seems you already came to the right conclusion: the bitcoin blockchain needs to be optimized for security, decentralization, and censorship resistance above all else.  Cheap payments can always be done via a number other systems, such as LN.

If you want the safest place to store bitcoin, then you should really consider a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger.

The way bitcoin works is that transactions are bundled into blocks about every 10 mins. This is done by bitcoin miners. They get awarded new coins for doing this. In the beginning they would get 50 bitcoin per block. But about every 4 years this reward gets cut in half. It was 25, but today is the first day that the reward is 12.5 for each block.

Small amounts gradually over a longer period of time.  If the price continues to go up, you might have to settle for trying to obtain 0.1 BTC (10,000,000 sats).  Some say the new trend is "stacking sats".

If he is, then it would be a good way of proving that bitcoin doesn't belong to Satoshi.  Bitcoin is ours now.  But be realistic, Craig is most definitely not satoshi.  His tactic is to misdirect noobs (and it seems to be working on you).
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:55:11
That might not be the best for long term storage of Bitcoin.  But did you at least do the backup procedure (write down the words on paper)?
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:48:40
Sure, but you still got to do an initial download of the entire blockchain. If we do have 8mb blocks, we will have a a blockchain greater than 1TB after 2 years, at which point it becomes infeasible for a new user to start a node to do ISP data caps.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:39:33
I see you are running TeamViewer on your computer - I recommend you do not use this computer for storing a significant amount of Bitcoin.  There have been reports of people having their computers hacked because TeamViewer was installed on them.

My preferred use case is to use it as a trustless long term store of value, even if it doesn't appreciate against the dollar.

Assuming the majority of miners upgrade to segwit, "anyone can spend" won't be a problem since miners now read such transactions as segwit transactions. Old "non-segwit" nodes trying to spend this would never get such transactions confirmed by the miners since the miners would now enforce segwit rules on such transactions. So that isn't really a problem to be worried about.
I don't understand why you consider 1.7MB blocks a hurdle. Are you saying you think blocks should have a larger maximum size? If so, then a) segwit actually allows a max size of 4.0MB and b) adopting segwit now doesn't mean we can't do an additional increase later.
