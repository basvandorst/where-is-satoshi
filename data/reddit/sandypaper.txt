If i sell you something in USD and you hold that USD compared to the EURO and it goes down. Who's fault is that? Yours for holding onto the USD. In this case, she should be smart enough to know different currencies against your own are going to be different and ever changing.

They have a competitive advantage over you. Just because you are interested doesn't mean it has to be fair for you.

Miningrigrentals is my personal favorite. Excellent cs too.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:55:14
Have support cancel your withdrawal. Buy certain alt coins that can still be withdrawn and get out with 85-95% original value. Only thing that worked for me
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:45:58
Very impressive.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:43:30
Could you imagine the blowback if something like that happens? How can the government one day auction off all of the bitcoins seized only to turn around and ban it... Won't happen.
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:21:28
Wow I am extremely impressed. I will also be dedicating an SSD or two for Storj.

Waiting on mine. Can't wait. I wish I was a slushpool user though they ended up getting it for 33% off or something ridiculous like that. =(

I lol'd so hard. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:06:48
Thanks. The terms are confusing. So what would the abbreviation for a BIT be. Just BIT? Bit = 100 satoshi
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:33:06
Naaaah this is the best coverup ever!
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:11:07
Work firewalls too =(
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:52:11
I won't use bits simply because it means 1000 satoshis. Why not just use satoshis as that is the denomination from the beginning. 200,000 satoshis please. Thanks
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:08:01
I'd prefer not to say why I do it, but another reason would be if you have a TITAN doing 300 MH. Instead of having it kill most altcoins by pushing that hashrate on it, you could split it up into 100, 3MH groups and unleash it on a spread of pools.
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:35:02
2500 XBT = .00000100 x 2500 = .0025 BTC in total held? Is that right? 
Edit: I do like the effort involved in remaining transparent.
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:46:14
This would also let the person being spammed know someone is messing with them. Why else would kraken send them tons of duplicate registration emails. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:34:56
He does make quite the point though. Just keep that % you need from your paycheck for the big purchases and do everything else through local bitcoins or whatever you choose. Don't waste unnecessarily. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:53:44
Oh definitely. He said he has already invested in 16 startups I believe. He is going to be insanely rich once this shit really takes off

Localbitcoins + meet in a police station. =)
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:02:58
Ah boo. That is exactly what I want though, to be able to direct 1 single chip or a grouping of chips to 1 pool, and then have maybe the other half of the chips to another.
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:21:43


Damn though. Such high fees.
The transaction charges range is from 66% down to 0.16% depending who is involved and the amount of money:[19][20]
    up to 66% for a transfer to an unregistered user
    up to 30% for a transfer to a registered user
    the lowest transfer rate is 0.16% to a registered user for KSH 70'000 (800 USD, 580 EUR)
    the cost for withdrawing money from an M-Pesa agent reach from 20% max to min 0.47%
Bitcoin could eliminate that nonsense
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:07:09
I wouldn't completely trust brain wallets though as you may forget and it has been hacked before. Do a quick google search and you'll find some dummies using weaker pass phrases which are easily brute forced. If you can be complex as hell then ya you're good on that front.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:45:02
I'm going to make a ton of assumptions.
2 Billion total computers, about 40-50% could have constant internet connectivity. Let's keep that at 45%.
900000000 total internet connected using their "Screen saver" to mine. I'll just assume you that it's on 24 hours and you can break it down from there and that the cpu can mine at around 2 GH.
900000000x.00002 = 18000 Petahash. Now that i write it this just seems wrong. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:54:25
Exactly. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:22:56
You should put quotes in it or something otherwise you look like the dummy spewing out money
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:05:59
Problem is how consistent is it? If I want a 100 MH device split in 10, 10 MH pools, would it be consistently 10 MH on the pool or would it be 100 MH on each pool round robin style just going down the list.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:52:03
Slap on the wrist, no criminal charges filed. 
Edit: The "payout" benefits Chase also. Stock rose after the news.
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:37:13
You pay a premium? What premium is that?
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:45:02
Ya I would definitely be careful doing that. Never know if they would come knocking on your door for that.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:25:24
This 100%.

What? Are you for real? How can ANYONE determine what is spam and not spam? Not a single person.

And now you have to keep on raising your fee if you want your transaction confirmed in a timely manner. Seeing "oh i paid this much in fee and it confirmed quickly" type of posts is bad. That is completely besides the point. Great you can afford to spend an extra quarter to transact quickly, but how about someone in Africa who cannot do that.

I could potentially just help you fill in information in my spare time. I had no idea this wiki existed.
Is there any marketing you have done for the site in the past?
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:51:54
A few posts later you see
"So, "Allow the alert key to reduce the difficulty by 80%, exactly once
on one of the 1015 blocks between halving and difficulty adjustment."
And we should consider smoothing the rewards (as described in my post,
can be done via soft fork) to prevent this from happening again. In
microeconomics literature, 'kinks' in incentive-systems are
almost-universally agreed to be very undesirable."
Crazy. Changing the fundamentals of bitcoin completely, Why not just make your own coin?

These types of websites look great, but every website looks this way. Can't we come up with something unique rather then copying that same worn out theme?
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:50:27
Awful article...
@_date: 2016-02-16 15:13:34
Definitely does, but it could be the truth.
There are a ton of overhead costs associated with mining and if they had to setup everything from scratch it may not be worth it. It's easy to test a few batches of your units, but to run it in large scale production may not be worth their time, especially with the ridiculous difficulty bumps that have been happening lately. 
Then again...

Why not use a value closer to expectations? You say close to .005 but use. 5?

That's not the way he said it. He is right. Apple is one of the few who can do this because of how big and well known they are.
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:21:52
That's your problem right there. "We". You are so far in the camp of one side you probably have trouble looking fr any other perspective bow. "We" don't need that. 
Be rational. Think things through and make informed decisions. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:32:25
I get the feeling they get away with this because it isn't an like their exchange. Bullshit either way. You set the price, I paid for it. Give me the product.
