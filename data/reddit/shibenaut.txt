There are many things that are annoying in this world. But being "annoying" has nothing to do with being "intrusive or rude" like you claimed. 
If you have such a problem with advertisements, then feel free to interact with mediums of entertainment that do not rely on advertisements to earn money, such as subscription-based radio stations (XM/satellite radio), or pay-per-view channels on TV.

From what I gather from the translated post:
* If you owned **coins** when BTC-E went down, you get 55% of your coins back, guaranteed (in the original coins that you owned). The other 45% of your balance is contributed to the BTC-E balance book and is a way of socializing (sharing) the losses that BTC-E endured when the FBI confiscated their stuff last month.
* If you owned **fiat** when BTC-E went down, you will get 45% of your balance back, guaranteed, but it will be returned to you in the form of cryptos, split equally between these 7 coins: BTC, LTC, NMC, NVC, PPC, ETH, DSH (presumably bought at the current market price). The other 55% of your balance is the same thing as the last bullet point: socialized losses.
* How does the socialized losses work? BTC-E has partnered with investment firms that are basically taking a tally of BTC-E's balance book, and seeing how much they're still worth (taking into account all of BTC-E's previous profits, less the losses BTC-E endured during the FBI takedown, and less the funds being refunded to customers). This final number of how much they're still worth is then converted into "BTE" tokens, and then refunded to customers. 1 BTE = 1 USD.
* Coin owners will get the 45% of their remaining balance back in BTE, and fiat owners will get 55% of their remaining balance back in BTE.
* Earliest date of withdrawal is end of August.
* You will need to provide your personal info in order to withdraw (KYC laws).
If I interpreted it wrong, please correct me.

If you were under the impression that Bitcoin was decentralized before SegWit, I have a bridge to sell you.
Control over Bitcoin mining had already been centralized a long long time ago. Not to mention the amount of Bitcoin wealth concentrated in 0.1% of the Bitcoin-using population.
SegWit simply transfers that centralization from miners to entities willing to maintain off-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:52:38
So every single time we start hitting the block size cap and fees start getting ridiculous, we need to go through the same deadlock we *just* went through in July/August? Why not just update Bitcoin to have a 100Mb limit instead of inching it up every time we need on-chain space?
SegWit seems like a much more elegant solution by moving transactions off-chain from the start.

Thanks for all the responses! I was sitting around, and came up with this Bitcoin metaphor that hopefully many can relate to (excuse the Monopoly reference):
Pretend that we're playing a game of Monopoly, infused with Bitcoin technology (blockchain), and the total amount of cash in circulation is an agreed-upon $20,000. But only $200 is released at a time to each player when they pass 'GO' (mining). Players begin trading, and I want to pay $500 for the Boardwalk property that you own. We make the transaction and all 4 players jot down the same transaction on each of our notebooks (a distributed ledger). Perhaps we're playing this match for a small crowd, and 8 other people jot down the same transactions with us too.
We continue playing for awhile, and I suddenly have to go to the bathroom. When I return, I notice that you now have $1000 in your possession and remember that for the entire game you only sold boardwalk to me for $500. I look at another player's ledger and realize you were paid $300 rent by Sally (who landed on your Boardwalk), and that you crossed 'GO' once. I take a quick tally, and the total cash in circulation is definitely still $20,000 (no new cash could've been secretly introduced without everyone noticing). I record the new transactions, and confirm that my ledger now looks identical to everyone else's. Everything checks out.
Since there were 12 people constantly verifying the transactions (as opposed to only 1 person/banker), the entire game becomes more trustworthy in my eyes, and makes the money have more weight because every dollar is accounted for, at all times. That is the fundamental beauty of blockchain. Now imagine that you were playing the same game, but with players located on 4 different continents (borderless), could exchange any amount of money in minutes (cheap &amp; fast), and the players have their identities hidden by default (anonymity).

With Lightning enabled between Bitcoin and Litecoin, it relieves pressure off Bitcoin's already-clogged network. If you want to make some quick transactions, Lightning enables people to quickly swap to Litecoin (without using an exchange, or paying exchange fees).
Lightning also brings more privacy to transactions, since you don't have to route through KYC exchanges.

Buying part of a Bitcoin has nothing to do with anything.
0.1 Bitcoins costs more in USD today than it did a year ago. By that very definition, Bitcoin is too expensive if your goal is to acquire 0.1 Bitcoins.
If it's too hard to understand, substitute Bitcoin with pie. You want to buy a slice of pie (let's say it weighs 200g). That slice of pie cost $1 the previous year. This year, the same 200g slice of pie costs $10. That slice of pie, by definition, is now too expensive for you to afford, because your goal was to buy that same 200g slice of pie -- **not** to buy $1 worth of pie (which now would only get you a 20g slice).
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:10:33
He merely stated "it's too expensive for poor people to buy into". **You** were the one who brought up the topic of "buying part of a coin" (which is correct).
If you wanted to buy 0.1 BTC, it will cost you a lot more USD to purchase today than it did a year ago. So the person you're replying to is also correct in his statement.
TL;DR you are both correct, but your reply has nothing to do with what he said, because you misunderstood his claim.

Turing Completeness of ETH means Ethereum has many more vectors for potential attacks. The Ethereum ecosystem doesn't just include the blockchain itself -- it includes all participating developers who go on to create high-usage applications, such as wallets.
The most recent incident was of course Parity. But DAO was the first major event to influence the direction of Ethereum (DAO caused Vitalik to fork the chain).
When you create something for 1 or 2 singular purposes (Bitcoin, Litecoin), you can focus all your attention on patching loopholes to guarantee those purposes succeed. However, when you create something that aims to solve an infinite amount of purposes (like Ethereum), it's only a matter of time before one thing or another happens to the ecosystem.

For simplicity's sake, let's say you have 10 aggregate Lightning transactions that are queuing to be confirmed on-chain. To settle those 10 aggregate transactions with Bitcoin, suppose it would take 100 minutes. Then by definition, those same 10 aggregate Lightning transactions would take 1/4th the time (25 minutes) to clear on Litecoin.
Sure, Lightning Network frees up a lot of on-chain space for both Bitcoin and Litecoin, but with enough traffic, on-chain space will still be limited, and neither Bitcoin alone or Litecoin alone will be able to handle the volume of users on a global scale. By spreading out the traffic between 2 coins *and* Lightning Network, BTC + LTC will be ready to handle many more transactions than if either were doing it alone.
Plus, with similar traffic, fees will naturally be lower with Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:04:11
Lightning Network is able to "process" a handful of transactions off-chain, however, when enough transactions are accumulated on Lightning, the aggregate transactions still need to be confirmed on-chain.
So the point is, Lightning transactions still need to be funneled back to the main chain for settlement. With equal technologies, Litecoin will always be much faster to confirm (4x). Also, the fees to process LTC will always be inherently lower.

All perspectives are valid in crypto at the moment. It's a new asset class, treading into uncharted territory.
But to counter your point about the past year of surging, consider that Bitcoin (and other coins) suffered through a 2-3 year bear market from 2014-2016. So the gains we've seen this year could be making up for the lack of any volatility during those dead years.

They think they're going to cash out (and many will). But many will be converted to crypto purists, where they see the upside in retaining their crypto assets because they see its advantages over fiat money. Once we have more crypto sinks (places to buy stuff with crypto), then the case to hold crypto (and not revert back to fiat) will become stronger and stronger.
Case in point, I now convert a portion of my income into crypto, and see crypto as a regular part of my cash flow. Unlike stocks, where you need to call up a broker (or log into an online account) to sell off your stocks, then wait for funds to transfer to your bank account... with crypto, you can directly pay for things if a vendor accepts it as payment. In short, crypto is much more liquid of an "investment", and no 3rd-party entity can ever control where or how I spend my crypto.

It's not an "influx". The 1 billion dollars comes from somewhere. If  you were to sell your coins for USD on an exchange, there would be people buying your coins with *their* USD. That's why it's called an **exchange**.
So once you've swapped all of your coins with other people's USD, you transfer that USD, chunk by chunk (maybe $100,000 USD at a time) to your traditional bank account. Pay your taxes to IRS, as you would if you won the lottery or won big at a casino. Then you're done.

Ethereum is complex for complexity's sake.
From what I understand, something that is Turing complete can be used to solve any problem, given enough time. After all, Ethereum was created to be the swiss knife of cryptos, to be a catch-all platform.
However, all of that complexity also brings along an infinitely greater risk of unforeseen attack vectors against the Ethereum ecosystem.
In other words, Ethereum is the antithesis to the age-old saying: "keep it simple, stupid" (KISS).

Litecoin was sitting at around $4 earlier this year, then with a string of positive news, it began rising to $10, then $20, $40, $60, etc. It hit an ATH of $90 a couple months ago, and is slowly making its way back there.
But the main selling point of Litecoin is that it's a mirror of Bitcoin's software, with several tweaks to make LTC 4x faster at confirmations (2.5 minutes vs 10 minutes), 4x the supply, and also cheaper transaction fees. There's also a couple differences on the back-end, like Litecoin's Scrypt-based mining algorithm vs Bitcoin's SHA-256.
Either way, future improvements to the Litecoin software (e.g. LN, Schnorr, CT, MAST, etc) will be shared with Bitcoin, and vice versa, since these two coins are very much alike, with similar visions for the future of crypto.
