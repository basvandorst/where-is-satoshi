OK, let me rephrase:
his claim is factually wrong - 8 decimal places is not "an artificial limit" - as far as bitcoin software is concerned bitcoin value is not set with decimal places - its not set in bitcoins at all, but always in satoshis as whole number (also see my answer to below).
Here is the proof - code don't lie (&lt;snip&gt; represents removed code).
In [amount.h]( the amount is defined as integer (whole number):
    typedef int64_t CAmount;
and in Bitcoin-QT [this is how the formatting is done]( for presentation:
    QString BitcoinUnits::format(int unit, const CAmount&amp; nIn, bool fPlus, SeparatorStyle separators)
    {
        &lt;snip&gt;
        qint64 n = (qint64)nIn;
        qint64 coin = factor(unit);
        &lt;snip&gt;
        qint64 quotient = n_abs / coin;
        qint64 remainder = n_abs % coin;
        QString quotient_str = QString::number(quotient);
        QString remainder_str = QString::number(remainder).rightJustified(num_decimals, '0');
        &lt;snip&gt;
        return quotient_str + QString(".") + remainder_str;
    }
the amount is passed as whole number and based on what output format is requested (BTC, mBTC, uBTC) correct number of decimal places is produced (division by factor). In same source file this are values for factor:
    qint64 BitcoinUnits::factor(int unit)
    {
        switch(unit)
        {
        case BTC:  return 100000000;
        case mBTC: return 100000;
        case uBTC: return 100;
        default:   return 100000000;
        }
    }
We good now?

@_date: 2014-10-02 07:27:21
Wrong - internally value is stored in satoshis as whole number, its just presented with 8 decimal places to show "bitcoin value".

Maybe not let the community directly vote, but let us do the time-consuming part:
1. Have a *membership pending* status for 30 days that is meant for collecting public opinion on said application.
2. Have a clear message that anyone commenting should provide some proof to their statements, all non-compliant comments are discarded (this can be done by 1 or 2 moderators).
3. Crowdsource comment rating, most relevant comments should surface
4. Have a small review board (5-7 members representatives of existing members), that reviews comments and approve/reject application. Their final *report* should include *review* of top comments.
I think this shouldn't cost an-arm-and-a-leg - it probably takes less collectiove energy that was put into this reddit post ...

**FI looks laundering risk with bitcoin**  
By: TT / Business World  
Published April 9, 2013 16:20
Fine Inspectorate warns that the virtual currency Bitcoin open for anonymous payments and therefore can be used for money laundering. Inspectorate therefore requires registration of companies selling and buying currency.
The registration requirement was introduced back in late 2012, according to Karin Boman char, press secretary at the FI.


So far, two Swedish companies that offer consumers to buy and sell bitcoin for traditional currencies - Goobit and Kapiton - registered with FI.


TT: Do you have any cases where you had reason to look at some bitcoin transaction?


The Internet-based payment instrument bitcoin, launched four years ago, traded primarily on the Tokyo-based site Mt Gox. There, the course in dollars rushed upward in recent weeks for courses over $ 200, from levels of over $ 10 per bitcoin during most of 2012.
Governor Representatives warned last week individual consumers to exchange rate risks when trading with bitcoin, but the bank sees the current situation does not bitcoin as a threat to the stability of the Swedish financial market and payment system.

@_date: 2014-02-25 08:20:41
And then what?    
You can't confirm the identity behind every address that received BTC from MtGox. And even if you say "aha, this went to the address of registered customer" it could have been a hacked account, fake credentials, ... its been going on for a long long time ...
And also keep in mind that these stolen BTCs have most probably been transferred, split, mixed and joined so many times there is no way of tracking it all ...

They don't move - they are pulled and replaced.
Graph is just a presentation of a state in particular time - it is redrawn continually, but not for every change on an exchange - so sometimes you will see the walls move, other times disappear and reappear somewhere else - it depends on your internet speed, time between pull/replace (different if its done by a bot or by live person), server load, speed of your computer ...
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:36:29
No, its not enforceable - if you have bitcoin you can use it anywhere you want.
But keep in mind that the device with your wallet may still be seized - and your bitcoins with it, so I'd recommend locking the wallet with whatever security it uses and making a **secure backup** so you can access it even if your primary device gets stolen/seized.
I'd recommend [blockchain wallet]( - its available from your smartphone or wherever you get internet access - just make sure you only access it from computer you trust.

How do you know this is MtGox wallet? Its probably not...
Your 3 BTC are strictly virtual now, for which they may or may not have real coins somewhere. What you see in this transaction is a payout to someone that withdrew 200 BTC, this is someones private address.
Think of it like this bank situation - you can go to the counter and deposit $100, they credit this amount to your account, but a guy that comes and withdraws $100 gets the bill(s) you put in. You are looking at this guys pocket contents now ...

I think Apple did it right this time and it may also be good for bitcoin.
Let me say that I'm not a fanboy - I don't own (and never will) an apple device, use their service or give them money in every way. But I am a SW engineer and if they did it the way I think they did it it is OK by me.
There is not much to go on, since only thing I found was that they generate "dynamic security code ... generated for each transaction". So my idea of how its done is as follows:
Add credit card to Apple account:
* create digital private/public key combo for every credit card (CC), saving keys in internal secure vault
* send CC info &amp; public key to the bank, creating a link between card &amp; crypto
* delete CC info from phone
And the way payment happens:
* POS terminal creates a (signed) transaction with amount and its ID (visible to all involved parties)
* via NFC send transaction to the phone
* phone adds CC signature and digitally signs the transaction, thereby confirming payment
* phone sends signed transaction back to POS in same NFC session
* POS sends transaction to Apple Pay server (this is why they don't know exact details about purchase)
* Apple sends the transaction to bank/CC issuer where account is charged, status of charge is then send back to POS that blinks green for OK, red for fail
You can see that there are some similarities with how bitcoin operates.
If we add bitcoin to the mix - in 1st part just create the wallet and store the private key. The payment can be done similarly (from POS perspective its exactly the same):
* POS creates a (signed) transaction with amount and its ID (visible to all involved parties)
* via NFC send transaction to the phone
* wallet SW on phone activates bitcoin part which looks up an (Apple) exchange rate, creates bitcoin transaction to some Apple address and adds it to POS transaction, and signs POS transaction
* phone sends transaction to POS via NFC
* POS sends transaction to Apple Pay server
* Apple extracts bitcoin transaction, checks it (inputs, free, btc value vs fiat amount) and if its OK broadcasts it to the networkd (or they may even have their own miners)
* send the status back to POS
Now, I know this will NEVER happen, but was a nice thought-experiment none the less ...
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:09:56
Yes it can be done, but I bet it won't.
Your proposal changes basic information of every transaction. To make it work all mining and all wallet software must be changed to support it. And to make it harder it must be done at approximately the same time - we get a chicken&amp;egg problem - this is why change like this is very unlikely to happen ...

This is exactly one of the problems bitcoin solves, but keep in mind:

Your point?
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:29:34
Pure speculation, but this is how it could go down if system was set-up poorly:
1. Attacker somehow got the IP of Bitstamp hot-wallet server - probably by watching where Bitstamp BTC withdrawal transactions were relayed from (probably there is even simpler way)
2. Attacker found a remote-execution vulnerability on a service running on that server
3. This gave him "shell access" to server
4. After another "privilege escalation" attack on server he got root privilege
5. Attacker found where wallet.dat file is located and grabbed it - he got the key to the kingdom
After copying wallet to another system he grabbed coins and ran for the hills ...
Now there are some possible simplifications:
* steps 1&amp;2 are not needed if it was an inside job
* steps 4&amp;5 are not needed if bitcoin application RPC port is open on internal network
My guess - they should check the interns ...

It would probably be best if Dockerfile was in its own git-repo (webwallet-docker?) - [see how mongo image is set-up](
You can then register repository at [official docker registry]( and take advantage of [automated builds option]( so its only compiled once for all users.

Interesting, but we have a chicken-and-egg problem - I'd want to see BitID support in my wallet of choice, but it won't be supported till enough sites use it, sites will use it only if there is support in most used wallets ... Guess I've found "a new itch" as a developer - finally have a reason to hack on [MyCellium source]( :) 
... also the SSH login via [libpam-bitid module]( demonstrated by Peter Surda in comment under the post is something I'd love to use :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:00:32
Your theory presumes that all miners would exit at the same time. I don't see this happening.
Its more possible that the network looses something about 50 % of hashingpower because a larger miners stop their farms. At that time blockrate goes to 20 minutes (which we all can live with) and at next re-calculation diffuculty its re-adjusted.
And lets not forget - if some big miners step-out there is suddenly again an opening for smaller operations ...
All in all I don't see this being a big problem ... but don't get me started on exchanges with 50x leveraged shorts - this is a real problem affecting the price.

NOTE I don't work on Bitcoin software and don't have intimate knowledge of its workings ...
.. but, if a read and understand it correctly there are 2 additional methods added to bitcoin rpc protocol
1.) getblockbycount(...)
I *think* this can be called to get the block and its transactions by block-id; same info you get visiting  to get transactions in block 469193
2.) getnormalizedtxid(...)
this is their way of fixing the *malleability attack* - method should return deterministic (always correct) transaction-id even if transaction is changed before getting confirmed in a block
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:19:22
Agree. Best move to do with all hot-wallets. I would have done the same - move everything that could be compromised to known good cold-storage (would be better that it was multisig, but thats beside the point).
Why is there a presumption that on a system like Bitstamp there is only one hot-wallet? Nobody heard of redundant systems?

Having this artificial block height/date is another Y2K bug waiting to happen. But how about we create bitcoin v2 addresses - lets say that they are identified by starting with 2 and 4 (?).
Transactions with satoshi decimals can only happen between v2 addresses. Input from v1 to v2 address can happen based on the rule you set (0 weight), and sending from v2 to v1 can only happen with amount that can be presented with 0 weight ...
OK, I changed my mind - its possible we can see it happen ... but this still doesn't make it "infinitely divisible" ;)

China sees exchanges as an easy way to:
1. move money out of the country
2. rob uneducated masses
Miners are creating value &amp; (hopefully) paying taxes, so IMHO there is conflict on that front.

@_date: 2015-10-13 11:29:47
I don't like this - this makes it even harder for price of BTC to raise, and it will amplify downward-pressure.
to elaborate:   
we have exchanges A,B and C on this sidechain.
If I'm sitting on exchange B (when I say ***I***, I'm thinking of bot under my control) and the price on C rises I'll take arbitrage opportunity and "quickly" move my coins to C and sell, thereby preventing price on C from escaping.
Looking at price movement into another direction: if price on A goes below price of B because of weak support I will dump my coins on B instantly and hold on to fiat, wait till "stable bottom" is reached and re-buy.
Now, I know this is already happening but with a bigger delay, and that bots *have* coins/fiat on multiple exchanges, but with longer delays there is still a chance of someone else sending his coins to opportunistic exchange before me, so my tactic would mostly be to *hodl* ... but this changes the dynamics, and tactics will change ...

This looks nice - so if I understand this correctly it works similarly as par2 does for file recovery?
If we presume that intersection of transactions that all miners have is 90% of all transactions, how big would IBLT (that is sent from A to B) have to be? Probably 10+x % of block size?
[i guestimate x to be between 2 and 5]
edit: intersection not union /doh

How is upward pressure amplified? You can't move fiat that fast (unless you are also thinking IOUs that mentioned somewhere above)
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:00:59
Its a **private sidechain** (invited and vetted clients only), so You and I (as exchange customers) will have no direct access to it, so we will be unable to handle IOUs (directly). For us it will probably work by connecting accounts on different provider platforms, and then sending founds between them - the transaction will happen automagically (similarly as how you can post to facebook from your twitter account)...
And responding to situation I described with "don't worry, you will be able to sell your claims with discount" is just a bit ignorant ...

OK, but AFAIK out of 5 companies mentioned (Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin and Xapo) only Bitfinex offers margin trading.
So if a dump is happening on BTCC, there is no way that going long on Bitfinex can offer the support - [volume is about 3:1]( and not everyone will do that.

@_date: 2015-10-13 12:04:44
If I understand the system I (as a customer on any exchange) would not deal with IOUs - they would be issued between exchanges.
So if I trust exchange A and exchange A trusts exchange B its not automatically transitive that I trust exchange B ...
Therefore if (bad player) B missuses the trust of A, A can go belly up, along with my money.
All I'm saying is I trust sidechain to do right with bitcoin transactions, bit I wouldn't trust it with IOUs ...

I don't get it. I'm a long time BTC holder but I don't mind they offer alts - it doesn't affect me ... just an alternative for those that want it.
