Hey, the official Abra account here. 
Currently a limited amount of users can purchase bitcoin with their American Express card on Abra. We are doing a slow rollout to ensure the best user experience for all parties. 
If you are interested in getting the AMEX funding option on your Abra app please reach out to support let them know, and the team will get you going as soon as possible. 
Thanks and let us know if you have any further questions. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:57:24
Hey u/thehighrollers! 
American Express is one of our current payment methods. We have not rolled it out to all users just yet. If you're interested in having the ability to use it within Abra please email support requesting this and they will put you in our priority queue. 
Thanks and happy trading. :-)

If you have bitcoin and Abra, as long as you are not a US citizen you can invest in stocks and ETFs.  Just deposit bitcoin into the app (Add Money tab), add a stock to your Portfolio watch list, then tap the Exchange button to buy stock.  
You'll receive cash dividends in the form of USD.  Unfortunately we don't have any banking partners in India at the moment, so for now you would only be able to withdraw your funds to another crypto wallet.  Let me know if I can help answer anything else.

As a product manager, I am focused primarily on growing our active (i.e. transacting) user base.  We keep an eye on the entire funnel to try and identify opportunities, but the game we're playing is to grow our user base and to keep them happy.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:20:19
Glad to hear Abra is used in Venezuela.  If I understood your question correctly, we do not currently have a banking partner in Venezela, so to move your funds out of Abra, you'll need to withdraw them to a different crypto wallet.  You can withdraw USD to a Bitcoin address in Abra, for example - the USD will be converted to bitcoin when you withdraw, so it's like buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:13:23
That's an interesting question, but I don't have an answer other than we would likely adopt support for whatever becomes the de facto standard in the Bitcoin community.  In some regards, what we are building at Abra is a layer on top of Bitcoin.  Our solution is to use multi-signature contracts to offer non-custodial access to stocks. I'm not sure how to define that in terms of layers, but the idea is the we are building investment features in traditional equities on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:45:04
Really sorry to hear that.  If you don't mind sharing, are you based outside the US?  We haven't had much bandwidth to work on improving the Simplex flow.  If you have another crypto to deposit, that's a way to add money to the app, but I suppose you're trying to use fiat to buy crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:49:30
Hi Anthony, glad to hear you've had a good experience with Abra!
Withdrawal (aka "Network" or "Mining") Fees are something we are constantly striving to reduce/optimize.  In your specific example, XRP is actually a "synthetic" currency inside the app, meaning you are holding multisignature bitcoin on your phone.  Here's an overview of our synthetic currency model: 
Since your synthetic XRP is actually bitcoin “under the hood”, withdrawing it is actually a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Therefore, in many cases, the Network Fee incurred to withdraw funds will be higher than you would normally pay to perform a transaction with the non-synthetic (“native”) version of the cryptocurrency.  
We absolutely sympathize with the pain you're feeling around this (high mining fees hurt us, too).  As a side note, we generally opt to pay a relatively high fee to ensure our bitcoin transactions get confirmed quickly.  We intend to offer users a fee selection feature in the near future, hopefully Q3.  Let me know if I can clarify anything.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:14:03
Thank you!  I will try to push for a cannabis ETF...keep hearing this over and over.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:31:26
Shorts are not currently available, but are on our roadmap, hopefully later this year.  Stay tuned...
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:53:50
We do support dividends!  If you own a stock on the ex-dividend date, you will receive the equivalent dividend payment inside Abra a few days after the company pays dividends.  You'll receive USD for cash dividends, and more of the underlying equity for stock dividends.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:31:34
You should see us in the App Store or Play Store in India already - we've been live there for as long as I can remember.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:05:32
Sorry to hear that, but I'm afraid not - we simply do not have any access to your security phrase.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:43:41
I would just say that, over time, we will be adding stocks from around the world, so eventually we should have something of interest for you.  Would love to hear what you'd be looking for in terms of non-crypto asset classes.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:13:24
Ultimately that's up to you.  I personally am a big fan of diversifying, but as a US citizen that's pretty easy for me to do.  But there are people throughout the world who do not have easy access to US stocks.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:21:01
You'll receive cash dividends as USD, and stock dividends as more stock.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:23:15
I personally wasn't familiar with tZero, but it sounds interesting.  Perhaps not a direct competitor, though.  Do you view them as comparable to Abra?
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:29:49
We get a ton of requests to add cannabis-focused ETFs on Abra.  I think it's doable, but it's something we'd need to evaluate as a company.  
Part of our vision for the product is to really nail making investment opportunities accessible to people globally.  I believe that over time, this notion of decentralized investing will become mainstream and significant investor populations will come to realize that NOT taking advantage of decentralized investing applications means limiting oneself to the asset classes offered by the legacy financial system.  So, that said, we'll be adding more and more assets in the near future.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:14:34
This comes up a lot.  It boils down to the fact that not all of the assets in Abra are natively supported.  Anything that cannot be deposited into Abra is not yet natively supported in our wallet, meaning that it's actually a "synthetic" version of the asset enabled through multisig bitcoin.  Here's an explainer that I hope will help. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:55:18
I have top people working on 4D graphs right now.  ;)

We should have a solution for wiring money internationally in the near future.  Stay tuned.  If that's something you're interested in, by the way, we'd love to talk in more detail.  We conduct paid interviews with users.  If you're interested, contact us at research
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:57:40
Yes, po00on, serious :)
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:30:55
We have tellers in the Philippines only right now.  Having acted as an Abra Teller myself and performed transactions for multiple customers, it has a lot of challenges.  Everyone loves the concept, and perhaps it will come back in the future, but for now we're not able to run a business with it as a focus.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:23:37
That's great feedback, thank you!  Regarding fees, Willie mentioned this in an earlier comment: "For direct banking integration, we have several partnership discussions happening right now, but it will probably take 6-9 months due to various regulatory, licensing issues in the Euro zones before we have it in place."
Dollar cost averaging is one of my favorite strategies for investing.  I would definitely like to build this feature during 2019.  It's on our roadmap, so good to hear that it's something you want.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:00:50
This is a tough one and something I struggled with, as we're trying to define a format that is useful for people around the world.  Where we landed (for now) is that we give users the ability to export a .csv file of all transactions, broken down into "buys", "sells", "inbound" (think crypto deposit), and "outbound" (think crypto withdraw).  This should allow you to determine what you bought and sold, and the value of that transaction in terms of your local fiat currency, therefore allowing you to determine the cost basis and gains/losses.  If you'd like to discuss in detail I'd be happy to speak with you more.  You can mail research and reference this post.  In general, we do not provide any tax guidance, given the global nature of our business.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:19:42
Whoops, it looks like the bug I mentioned had prevented us from enabling it for non-employees.  It should be enabled later today or tomorrow.  Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:25:04
Hey, thanks for the feedback!  We are aiming to turn charts back on in the next couple weeks.  We had an issue with our data provider, and then we were heads down focused on our equities launch, but charts are coming back very soon.  Changing default currency is one of our top requests and I'm aiming to start development on that feature next week!
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:27:08
Abra is not offering anything that would be deemed a security swap to US persons at this time. We are in discussions with US regulators on a process for bringing our equity product to the US. Our first priority is to address issues of access and affordability to financial markets for those outside the US.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:04:48
The important thing to understand is that we offer access to all of these assets by utilizing multisignature bitcoin to create "synthetic" stocks, "synthetic" fiat currencies, etc.  
Link about our synthetic currency model built on bitcoin: 
This means that you'll get price exposure to your stocks/etfs in Abra, and you'll receive any cash/stock dividends, but you will not be able to transfer the underlying stocks/etfs out of Abra.  If you want to exit your position, currently you'll need to sell it for a cryptocurrency or fiat currency in order to withdraw your funds from the app.  Hope that helps.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:03:04
Hey, yes, we are bringing charts back for cryptos and introducing equity charts in the next few weeks.  Once those are live, we'll be considering how to improve charts to do things like compare different assets, or see how your Portfolio value has changed over time.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:57:35
Hey, we have a few already: SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (GSCI), and United States Oil Fund (USO).  
I'm sure we'll be adding more over the next couple months.  Let us know if there are specific ETFs you'd like to see.

Hi, official Abra account here.
Abra supports bitcoin as well as 50+ fiat currencies
Your screenshots indicate that your wallet was denominated in USD and that the dollar value of that wallet remained constant at $102.80.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:39:36
I can't offer specifics right now, but XRP is definitely one of our most popular assets.  I believe XRP has some nuances that make it less straightforward for us to support natively, specifically, account reserves.  I believe each XRP wallet must lock up 20 XRP indefinitely.  It's not impossible for us to support, but would require serious thought around user experience and technical implementation.
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:54:32
It's an intriguing idea...we're probably not ready to prioritize something of that magnitude currently, though.  Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:02:21
Would 4D suffice? :)
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:25:34
We'll add Touch ID first.  This hasn't been prioritized on our roadmap yet, but it's definitely a nice feature for iOS users.  So we'll add it this year, I imagine, once we can spend time thinking through any security and UX implications.  Face ID might follow.  Sorry I don't have a specific date at the moment.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:22:41
Definitely not a "flip the switch" type thing.  I think we're still trying to figure out how much to invest in offering additional "money-in" options through more cryptocurrencies, vs. through traditional finance rails like banks and credit cards.  The latter is necessary for broader adoption.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:05:39
Hi, you should already see ADA as a withdrawal option inside the app.  I know we just fixed a bug related to ADA address formats, but you should see it there now.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:44:56
Yes, we do plan to implement Segwit.  I can't provide a specific date right now, and I'm hesitant to say "near" future, but I don't think it's too far off.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:01:54
Yes, definitely, although I can't say for sure when.  The great thing about cryptocurrencies is that the ecosystem is vast, but it can be challenging to meet everyone's needs as far as coins to support natively.  TrueUSD stablecoin will be supported in the near future, but beyond that I can't offer a specific date, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:09:03
No timeline for UK bank support but we have Tellers live in the UK now. You can use cash to buy bitcoin from them. Select the "Use cash" option on the "Add money" screen to look for Abra Tellers on the map near you. If you're interested to try but can't find one let me know the city (PM is ok) and I will see if we can find one in our queue to match you up with.  
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:44:24
We do not provide legal advice to Abra Tellers and encourage any applicants who have questions to seek legal council who are familiar with local laws and regulations.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:22:10
Abra does not hold customer funds, our banking partners do. And once the funds settle, the bitcoin is held client-side in the customers' wallet.   
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:51:22
No. SynapsePay is the company that is holding your money while the bank transfer clears.

@_date: 2017-04-22 02:02:38
You could if you want to use a bitcoin exchange. But the service Abra offers to people is quite different from an exchange.   
Abra is designed to facilitate easy and fast p2p payments while obscuring the complexity of bitcoin. The fact that Abra uses bitcoin exchanges under the hood to facilitate depositing and withdrawing via bank is an implementation detail that non-bitcoiners don't have to see or appreciate to get value from using the app.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:20:48
Abra does not need licenses because Abra does not touch customer funds. Our partners are legal, regulated, licensed entities.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:08:18
There are a few differences:  
- Abra is a client-side bitcoin wallet, whereas Coinbase holds funds on their customers' behalf.  
- Abra supports holding, sending, and receiving over 50 different currencies. Coinbase only supports a small handful of currencies.  
- Abra supports buying and selling bitcoin (and other currencies) with cash via Abra Tellers.  
- Customers [have told us]( they like our customer service better, but this is subjective and I'm sure Coinbase support people are really nice too.  
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:15:11
It is the responsibility of each individual Abra Teller to understand and comply with any applicable laws and regulations. If you have any questions or concerns, we strongly suggest you seek legal council that is familiar with the local laws and regulations.  
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:45:01
Abra Tellers set their own fees. There is a percent-based fee and a minimum fee, the Tellers makes whatever is the greatest of the two.   
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:45:16
First I've heard that! Thanks for your honest feedback :)  
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:45:25
I said our customers have told us that (which they have) and I said it was subjective.  
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:23:47
That's a strange issue that I haven't seen come up before! Can you please try reaching out to support using the "Contact us" button in the menu of the app? They should be able to help you trouble-shoot what's going wrong here.

No volume numbers to share, though we may expose that data publicly in the future as LBTC and other exchanges do. What are your concerns exactly? If there aren't any tellers in your area that sounds like an opportunity to establish yourself as one of the first in the market - let me know if you're interested in this and I'll help you get started.  
-John 
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:17:30
Yes, that is required by our banking partner SynapsePay to process deposits and withdrawals. You can read about how they secure this information on their website:   
FWIW this information is not accessed by Abra as a company or stored on our servers.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:02:55
This is how I describe it:  
Bitcoin services exist on a spectrum of totally centralized (e.g. Bitstamp) and totally decentralized (e.g. Bitcoin Core).  
Abra is somewhere in the middle: on a good day, it works like a decentralized wallet, namely client-side control of private keys. So Abra can't move money on your behalf. On a bad (e.g. if Abra's servers go down), then it would work more like a centralized service, where you might lose the ability to move your funds until Abra is back online.  
Abra is continually pushing in the direction of being more decentralized and giving clients more control in case something happens to Abra. Security of our customers' funds is top priority, as is the freedom to move funds without permission from Abra. We'll have some important announcements coming out in a few months that will demonstrate our commitment to these principles.  
In the mean time, if we encourage our users to save their backup phrase and treat Abra like you would the wallet you keep in your pocket or purse: only keep daily spending money in it, don't use it to store your life savings. This will prevent or limit losses in the rare event that anything happens to your phone or to us.  
I'm a heavy user of fully decentralized bitcoin wallets myself but still find a lot of value in Abra as an on-ramp to bitcoin and a way to get new folks using bitcoin without a lot of the intimidating or complex aspects of bitcoin scaring them away.
Hope this help clarify things!  
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:38:30

Abra Tellers are not employees of Abra. Abra provides software that helps our customers buy and sell digital currency, we are not and cannot be responsible for how the software is used.

@_date: 2017-06-28 21:18:29
Unfortunately this is a side-effect of how insecure the legacy banking system is. Our banking partner doesn't give customers any additional information about why a transaction is canceled because they don't want to make it easier for fraudsters to game the system. We wish we could provide more information to our customers in these cases so they can understand what went wrong but in these cases it's not safe to do so.  
FWIW this is standard practice across the financial services industry.

Hi lamgineer. The reason the amount of bitcoin in your wallet changed is probably because the price of bitcoin changed from the time you deposited into your USD wallet and the time that you changed your wallet currency to BTC. The currency shown in your wallet is not just a "display" currency - that is actually the currency that your wallet balance is held in. If you want to hold BTC in your Abra wallet you need to make sure your wallet currency is set as BTC. Likewise, if you prefer to hold USD in your wallet then you need to make sure your wallet currency is set as USD. Hope this helps clarify what may have happened here!
