But is there a reasonably safe way to get them?

You also have some Bitcoin Gold that's worth about $250/coin right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:02:56
Yes.  Bitcoin Gold (BTG) as well as many others.  A few of them are listed [here](

At a high level, it shows that all the current integration tests between the main 3 different clients working on the LN have all succeeded, but it has been at that status since November 17th.
The point of this post is to display that not only have all 3 LN clients been making updates individually (different commit hashes), but also testing integration between the 3 is continually happening and continues to be 100% success as those updates are being made.
TL;DL - LN development is making progress.

Those coins are largely considered "lost".  If those coins move even on a fork (where satoshi would still have control of them), there's proof that they're actually not lost, and bitcoin will take a dip as well.  Not nearly as bad as if they were all dumped on the market, but it'd still cause a dip for btc.

Difficulty and remaining supply are not related.  The difficulty self-adjusts essentially based on hash rate of the network.  If difficulty at some point gets too high and it becomes unprofitable to mine, miners will quit mining bitcoin.  This, in turn, will decrease the difficulty and increase profitability again assuming the price stays the same throughout this exercise.  The miners also get paid via transaction fees.  The more transactions occurring, the more btc the miners make.

I think it would dip.  If they moved at all, it proves they're not lost.  Many would fear that they may have moved to an exchange to dump and would get out before the price potentially tanked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:42:06
Notice the spelling.

His statement means that the miners, in theory, could do what the miner in 2011 did and underpay themselves to the extent they pay themselves zero for the remainder of all blocks.  This, of course, will not happen.

I actually quite enjoyed that one.  I also have the LN integration test result website tagged for notifications on edits.  Can't come soon enough.

During signup, I noticed they ask for full SSN and stopped there. Are there any exchanges where I can trade BTC/USD without providing a full SSN?

Username checks out, but I have to agree with you at the same time.

Haha it's all good.  I got a little chuckle out of it.

Why not?  In addition to getting the block rewards until the year 2140, miners also get paid via transaction fees.  There will always be transactions (assuming bitcoin is alive and well), so the miners always get paid.
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:12:29
Agreed.  Amazing closing remarks all around.

1 Billion is 1 Thousand Million = 1,000,000,000.
1 Trillion is 1 Million Million = 1,000,000,000,000.
1 Billion / 1 Trillion = 1,000,000,000 / 1,000,000,000,000  = 1/1,000 = 0.001 = 0.1%

Why even bother recognizing them?  BTC will do its thing.  BCH will do theirs.  Move on.

Samesies.  Too bad I just found out my last VM hosting core was attacked (could simply be conincidence - no idea), and I had to delete it and create a new VM to get it up and running again.  Good thing I had the blockchain backed up so I didn't have to download that again.  Anyway, I've joined the 0.16.0 party with y'all.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:48:17
Not sure why others are taking you so seriously.  We may very well be morons haha.  Time will tell.  
For me anyway, I enjoy learning about the tech behind bitcoin and other cryptos the same as I enjoy playing video games, soccer, and hunting.  Just another hobby for me is all.

You can buy $20 worth (or even less) for shits and grins if you want to.  You don't have to buy hundreds or thousands of dollars worth.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:18:50
Ah I just read in other comments that you did in fact grab some.  Congrats on that, and I totally agree with the casino comparison.  Good luck, and be ready for a wild ride all over the place haha.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:53:18
Are quantum computers similar to CPUs and GPUs in regards to the ability to adapt and hash other algorithms?  I'm assuming yes, and if so, are they a legitimate concern to potentially overpower the rest of the network (for example all the home users interested in mining cryptos via CPU/GPU)?
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:53:34
Thanks, bud. You too.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:46:59
How expensive are we talking?  If there are, hypothetically speaking, multiple governments in on this, money is pretty much a non issue.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:01:31
I guess what I'm getting at is that I've heard in the past that Bitcoin is the leading crypto not because of its technologically superior code but because it's the most secure due to the largest mining pool.  If it's changed, then the mining pool effectively starts over from scratch.  At that point, what makes Bitcoin superior to other cryptos, and why should anyone continue to use it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:05:27
I'm not asking from a financial perspective. Just curious from a technological/usage standpoint is all.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:12:57
Is it possible to cut Bitcoin-only traffic?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:11:51
If the PoW is changed, isn't the security of the network reduced due to diminished hash power? At this point, what would make Bitcoin much different from a clone using another cryptography algorithm?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:46:44
1 BTC or any amount of BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:27:35
I'm assuming a change of this sort hasn't been tested nearly enough and wouldn't be available at short notice if an attacker did happen to pop up since I haven't heard any news about it.  
So an attack by a powerful, malicious actor would have the capability to disrupt Bitcoin for a decent amount of time in this scenario, right?  Are there any features that are being planned to integrate into Bitcoin anytime soon that would help prevent such a scenario?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:45:34
But wouldn't this also:
1. Piss off all the miners since all their hardware is now near worthless, and
2. Also drastically reduce the security of the network since there is now a significantly reduced mining hash rate thus allowing future 51% attacks to be performed even easier?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:03:15
That would be my understand as well.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:38:45
Have you ever actually used it or taken any time to look into it?  Please do your research before making blind claims.
