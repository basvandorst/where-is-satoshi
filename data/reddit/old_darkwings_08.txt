There's too much to dig up and link
Besides, the post is long enough as it is
Anybody who wants to see my previous words/predictions just needs to type 'Darkwings_08' in the search bar. You'll find everything there. All of my other usernames have '08' in them as well (since my original account and IP address got shadowbanned by the butthurt mods/censors in this place)

Hardfork, I actually agree with you on this point, but I think if you examine the math as a consequence of your claim, you'll find it plays out exactly how I say it will
In my above post I detail a zero sum game: $10k in, and $10k out
What changes is that one neckbeard miner grabs the $10k early for his mined Bitcoins which cost him peanuts at the time to mine, leaving the remaining people with nothing.

Butthurt you bought shitcoins at $1242 a piece?

Centralized power always corrupts
I draw this pattern after innumerable events

I don't predict the specific details, but I did predict that exchanges will be the 'weak points' of Bit coin and therefore its downfall. I also predicted that centralized entities, such as the Bitcoin foundation would end up corrupt (I.e. as with Shrem, Karpeles).
I also predicted nations would crackdown on Bitcoin, and that they can because of the exchanges, which not only act as bottleneck targets, but also hold personally identifiable information on its users (I.e. personal documents required to initiate account) and they could be demanded to hand over these documents or otherwise be raided/unknowingly hacked by government agencies.
I also predicted, as a matter of simple mathematics, that exchanges would run out of liquidity and that most buyers of Bitcoin won't be able to get their money back, probably not even a decent fraction of it in most cases.
So you see these aren't predictions of specific events, but they are detailed although they are abstract.
