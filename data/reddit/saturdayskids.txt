Sorry to hear about your loss. I'm willing to bet they had other problems going on in their life, too. If I lost all my money I wouldnt commit suicide, my death wouldn't be at anyones fault but my own.

I'm also a human that can't keep up with the news all the time, but I've read this document several times over on Reddit at this point and you havent seen it yet and you run a BTC newsfeed. That's bad.

This is really dumb. Sorry.

Well written article with a sensationalist headline.

Right, I have a good amount of money invested in BTC as well, but your argument just proved gold might be worth more. Come the apocalypse (obviously a ridiculous scenario) things that you can't hold in your hands will be worthless.

I understand, I just believe that it's going to ward of potential investors (and hopefully not induce a crash) if people start hearing things lke SaToShIs and BitCeNtaMiLLiOn CoIns.  It just sounds fucking silly and fad-ish.
I think .1btc or 100mBTC is way more easy to remember, and sounds more "real" and easy

I just bought some for $957 a couple minutes ago.

Going by your theory, apocalypse situation, would we have internet or be worried about digital things at all in order to give BTC any worth?

Nice run on sentence. I can tell by your unnecessarily long sentence and over abundance of commas that you're an expert on everything. You are the kind of immaturity that this subreddit needs to rid itself of.

Been dropping for the past several hours, I think you'll see a drop of a couple hundred in the next two days. (I'm clueless to all of this though)

Whatever, it's exciting to me and the majority of us.

Cool, a stock photo with bitcoins logo on it. Yeah this is going to start a revolution!
