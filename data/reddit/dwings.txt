Because as the hacker said, Satoshi is a fool who was too lazy to keep his identities separate
I got these images from a [pastebin]( linked by a mainstream article. 
The pastebin asks for donations to the same address posted by the Satoshi Nakamoto account on the P2Pfoundation website, so we know it's not an attempt to fake the identity of the hacker in order to gain money. 
However, the pastebin appears to been made ~2 hours after the P2Pfoundation post, so the email screenshots could be faked - but why go to the trouble, since there's no monetary reward?
Also one of the screenshots includes details of emails to people extant and publicly known in the Bitcoin community - they could easily verify or dismiss the veracity of these screenshots.

BTW, anyone good at deciphering text?
The hacker guy didn't conceal the name for the delivery address very well
The first letter is 'A', and the last 3 letters look like 'ery' to me
Some of the street letters also appear to be somewhat viewable
Could be worth having a look at
