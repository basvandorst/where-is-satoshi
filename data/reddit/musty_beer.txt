Clearly still an idiot, his opinion's are becoming more wrong, more often. The year 2027 when Jamie Dimon is 76 years old, there will be pictures of him on the side of the road with a cardboard paper, asking for handouts of whatever the mainstream decentralized uncontrolled currency is at that time.. And there will be Meme's, Meme's everywhere about it.

If you mean deflate- as in the common man's bitcoin savings decreasing in ''value'' as the rich are getting more bitcoin, than definitely, the answer is no. Ideally, in an economy where bitcoin is king, Financial IQ will be way more common. In a bitcoin drivin economy, personal finance and economics would likely be major subject's in elementary, middle and high schools, along with colleges. When it comes to a crypto-economic society, the consumer and the producer both benefit from the consumer having financial literacy, Therefor it will be more common to see people within this type of society to encourage "financially illiterate people" to take free online financial literacy courses. When the total 21 million bitcoin is all tapped and circulating, the common man in this economy will be far more equal to the 1% of the wealthiest in a bitcoin world than that of the common man in today's world, whose wealth is infinitesimal compared to the 1 percenter's of today. Furthermore, as bitcoin's are lost, which is inevitable, every single person's coin is worth a little more from those loss coins. It is quite literally a deflationary currency, unlike that of Fiat currency, which today is actually deflating the value out of the common man's savings and it has been hurting saver's for a long time. By the nature of your question, I recommend you dive deep into economics and financial literacy.
