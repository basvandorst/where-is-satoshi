Thanks for the links.

What the fuck are you on? I'm serious. I don't live on reddit. I posted what I experienced. If you don't like it then move the fuck on. Take your fucking break buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:40:21
Exactly, and me pointing this out a few days ago was spreading "FUD". The people on this sub is braindead.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:31:30
It's truly insane, these fees. Sure you gain $50, but if  you want to move your money to a safe place it's going to cost you half. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:29:13
I think btc is supposed to be used to encourage more people to join the community, but like I mentioned this will probably prevent usage. Not sure how much fud this is. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:52:05
So if I go with Electrum, put low fee, the transaction might take days to finish? Or will it just never complete. That's probably not worth the risk either.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:48:30
Is this the single wallet where you can set the fee? I'm getting annoyed with a lot of recommendations from people on here saying this wallet is good, that's good. I am losing a lot of my money to fees instead of getting to use it to buy things. At this point, I just keep hoarding my money because I'm afraid of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:16
How did I choose it? I wanted to pay the lowest fee,that  wasn't really an option. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:46:23
lol obviously you need to fuck off. You have some serious issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:50:30
I'm sensing exactly that, this is basically a fanboy type page where I shouldn't expect real info. smh.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:31
Thanks, I appreciate your explanation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:08:32
I used several wallets to check the fee, they're all the same even at the lowest fee setting. Electrum and Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:14:41
Because of the fees I experienced today (twice), I will likely just never use my money again. I had to pay 20% fee to move money from Coinbase to a wallet. That's just beyond nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:53:57
Never used GDAX before, but what are the steps I'm looking at to do this? Do I need to create an account with GDAX since I already have a Coinbase account?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:25:05
The wallet used  was mycelium, I set to lowest priority, was there another option to pay lower, I didn't see it. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:21:43
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:14:11
How do you determine if you have the BCH? For instance, I have my money stored in the phone wallet mycellium... does that mean I have BCH, I can't tell if there's any.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:44:26
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:23:36
I see some instructions, but I just don't trust it and myself because it's so new. I don't want to cost myself a lot of grief and money if I fuck up. I'll just be patient and hope mycelium supports it or just hang on to the BCH the way it is til whenever I feel comfortable to split them.

I don't know if I should be freaking out, I'm putting my address in there and it says 0. But it's the address in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:19:55
I can see my balance in my wallet, but yeah when trying to use the address, it's not showing anything on the blockchain. As far as I can see, that's the only address. That's what I really didn't want to do, took me a while to trust to put my money on this one, now I have to go and do some research on another and trust it with my coins. :( 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:52:55
Okay, I'm ready for $15,000. Can I text a friend instead for half of a lifeline?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:06
Wow, this came much sooner than many's prediction! Yippy.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:28:32
Again with the farking Chinese gov and BTC's price drop. Why don't we just ban them from participating.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:36:38
Awesome, maybe I can buy a snack or something when I visit. :D
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:17:56
Oh snap!
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:35:05
Signed on to upvote, this is so true. I've bought in for years and still can't wrap my head around all the wallets etc, etc, and just kept in coinbase despite all of the confusing suggestions...money still in vault.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:26:40
I just wish I can be those people and buy 1000 and just giggle right now. :(
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:12:15
I'm not sure the point is that people are blaming Bitcoin, however people are associating Bitcoin to malicious behavior. I even got an email at work today that mentioned Bitcoins and let's just say we don't talk about Bitcoin here. The only reason why it was mentioned was because it was being associated to this ransomware. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:42:15
Damn, I missed it. Good thing it's coming back. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:35:59
If only zero fees were the case now. T_T

Are you related to ...he just called you a dick... well even if not, he still called you a dick.

I suddenly forgot which subreddit I'm reading in...gosh the topics change rapidly.

Thanks! I was able to push my in limbo BTC by selling 100 Doge to BTC. 
+100 doge
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:20:58
Unreal, someone tipping more than 1¢ worth! :)
