@_date: 2015-01-05 11:33:15
better? ;)
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:54:30
thx! I am german, so my english is not perfect.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:54:11
this is a conversation. Should be readable!
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:38:14
better now?
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:55:25
sorry for that. I am from Germany and not a native speaker.

creating gold is not happening. Gold is created in a supernovae, when an old star implodes and under high pressure explodes. This will not be done by humans.
@_date: 2019-04-14 10:05:52
thanks buddy ... ya I agree... not catching a cold was one of the biggest challenges :)

I have fun challenging my boundaries... here I was literally for 10 days in a tunnel on a mission to make it. It was an experience, nothing else will be able to replace.

thanks for your feedback, but I disagree. If you'd like to know why, see here 
@_date: 2019-04-14 10:03:10
yep... what was not too efficient, was the Hotel scouting though *sweatsmile*
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:26:19
sorry, had posted the wrong tweet in my comment. Now it is the correct one.
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:50:30
...and in the meantime you can read the other stories of each day of Tour de Satoshi, if you fancy: 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:53:36
the 1 hour wait was worth it... more about it tomorrow morning in the day 1 summary :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:31:53
@_date: 2019-01-12 21:54:38
thx :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:26:19
jep... on it ;)
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:30:20
no worries. :)
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:58:11
agree. This is good stuff
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:07:00
I see. Right next to me then. That's funny! :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:44:26
didn't make it until Sassuolo today for several reasons that I will soon we'll te about. :/ Instead had to stop in Vergato
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:48:11
this was the beginning. ;)
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:46:58
thx. :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:31:44
that is a real confidence. Who were you? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:25:02
in a single room though with breakfast. ;)
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:25:13
on it :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:39:13
thx. Actually in this very moment I am sitting at the reception of the only Hotel if Vergato called Albergo Ca and waiting for the owner to arrive. 
For sure he'll be surprised when I'll try to tell him that I need to pay my night and dinner with bitcoin... :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:33:27
I'm not from Florence, but Munich. But I thought Florence (the birthplace of modern banking) is a good place to start this tour! :)
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:40:58
thank you very much... if only more people thought and acted like you... ;)
@_date: 2019-01-13 18:07:41
there will be a video too... but you'll need a bit of patience. :)
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:59:40
I believe my hosts will probably just be private homes. Most of those cities won't have a single restaurant that takes bitcoin.
... but will definitely keep u guys up to date. :)
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:37:44
well... honour to whom honor is due... I believe bitcoin and bringing awareness/ adoption forward is worth it. ;)
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:47:45
thx 
@_date: 2018-12-24 02:33:36
thanks. more info to be found here:
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:44:54
10 mins is quite long. I don't have anybody to cut the videos. You think every day a professionally cut video?
That's too much, no?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:43:50
I see, you don't know what tour I am talking about :) 
it's happening in a few days :)
detailed info here: 
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:09:37
there you go 
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:34:27
... just got super excited to having received my second btc donation. Especially because with the first donation it was somebody I know, but this time I have no clue. :)
here's the donation: 
thanks for the tip to whoever it was... 
oh and... by the 2nd version of the Tour de Satoshi it will hopefully be LN payments. :)
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:04:51
 :) Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:38:37
thanks for this video. :)
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:40:48
lol but agree ;D
@_date: 2018-12-23 02:19:56
next year will be another challenge. :)
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:23:04
yay! Excited :)
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:18:31
thank you so much. I will have a GoPro with me and take pictures. As well I will tell a little story about my day each day. 
so far nobody, but a few are considering starting later.
For sure... that is the plan. thanks for following and maybe spreading the word ;)
