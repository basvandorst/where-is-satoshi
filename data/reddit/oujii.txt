This actually means that the adoption is lower now than  previous weeks. At least to the point of being used a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:19:52
Wait until it reaches ATH again. I like when people are honest with themselves and admit BTC has scalability issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:22:41
You're lucky. In my country the BTC is also dipping, but right now it costs equivalent to $19,515.

There was guy that gave me something like US$75 worth of Bitcoin over a year ago. At that time, it was worth way less. There was a tool that you could simply donate to people via reddit. But unfortunately, I lost that wallet.

I mean, with enough support of the houses, it could become a law. I don't think it will gain so much traction though. At least not now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:08:40
You can actually do it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:59
Exactly. In my country, the best Universities are free and funded by the Gov, people like to say that taxation is theft, except that a lot of those, studies in those Univ.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:22:12
Well, you mean most people overall. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:24:20
But gold does have a practical use.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:22
There are, but none of them is as good as NH. There is Kryptex, WinMiner that are basically 1-click-to-run. Them there is Awesome Miner that you can set up pools and stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:22:32
Aka nothing
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:53
How come? Don't they need your ID to verify your account?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:38
A guy came to me yesterday asking if I could help him setup a spreadsheet that would monitor all major exchanges from my country.  
I also overheard him talk a lot about Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:27:48
Sure, why not? If we're fucked, better get some money for it.   
@_date: 2016-11-14 05:35:50
Yeah, me too.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:32:33
OBVIOUSLY.  
Thank you, sir.  
I'm sure the world will be generous somehow as you have been with all of us, stay safe!
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:46:45
It doesn't feel like he cares about privacy. His main concern appears to be paying 30% less.
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:34:38


  
  
I might try it! Thanks. How is that different from CoinMixer.se?  


  
  I don't have much space left for that, but I will keep in mind for the future.  


  
  Wow, I didn't realize that. I'm so dumb. Even though the rates are higher than in exchanges, paying no fees actually convert into more bitcoins, even at a higher rate.  
If I use Tor or a VPN to set up (and use) my LocalBitcoins account, only these IP will be logged and it will be harder to trace it back to me, right?  
**EDIT:** To expand on that, I created a test account and a lot of trades requires either for me to present my ID or to do an SMS verification. It kinds defeats the whole privacy purposes...


  
Yeah, I know. I've been told before that this is the case.  
Anyway, thanks for the advices!
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:17:04


  
I see, I might try it!  
  


 
I know, I mean LBTC will need that info. I don't think people would sell to a recently registered user with 0 reputation, but I might try.  
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:50:43
You're a good man, sir. I feel OP's pain, if the guy delivered, I was about to get my first bitcoin (or well, sorta of) ever. Well, *there aren't such thing as a free lunch*, right? That's what people keep telling me.
@_date: 2016-11-10 11:44:07
It was $7.50.  
You can create custom lists, he probably read my reply and created that entry just for it. Like you, I also searched in the website and couldn't find it.  
The guy is truly generous.
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:19:10
Like I said, when responding to some people advertisements to deposit in an ATM, it requires an ID or phone verification. I tried to create an ad myself and I noticed that when you are creating it, you have the option of locking the ad unless the buyer or seller fills one of both these requirements.
Yeah, I might try create a cash ad myself, but I'm willing to buy more than 0.5 BTC at the moment, since I'm new on this. But it might work.  
I will check out this one too!
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:52:19


  
How does that work?  
  


  
I see, thanks!  
  


  
I see, but the sellers asking for ID or Phone number confirmation kinda defeats the purpose. I will make some more research on that!  
  
Thanks again!

Why hodl and not hold? Serious question. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:59:05
Well, last year a random guy from this sub gave me like something worth of US$2-5 on BTC on that donation plataform for me. I moved it back to a Wallet that I lost afterwards because I didn't have a backup and I resetted my phone. It's not a lot, but now it's worth a little more than US$70. I'm so sad. Well, now I learned my lesson and I'm holding my coins in a safer way.

Your statement is not one hundred percent true, as some of the addicted don't care whether they're gonna be ripped off or tossed in jail, really. At least not I  third world countries, as long because the cops can't really do much about addicteds, at least here. If you know someone who sells pot or coca, you can pretty much buy anything else you want, whether he'll be the one selling it or someone he knows. Before exchanges joined the game, a lot of people that wanted to buy Btc didn't because they were scared or didn't know how to properly do it. If that becomes the pattern, the incentive and search for it will drop as well. Most people want it to be easy, not cheap. Nobody likes to pay more than it should for something, but they like even more to be able get that with ease. That's why in countries where drugs are legal, people are inclined to buy from legal places because it's easier, even though buying from dealers is cheaper. I think that with less accessibility, the interest will drop and the overall price will as well. And if the price drops, anyone that is here just for the easy money will bail out. But like I said in the other comment, I don't think that will happen anytime soon or that crypto are gonna die ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:03:52
That's a fair statement. I also think the freedom will win in the end, but it make take a long time, we can't know for sure. In the end, I don't even think the state will take such a move so soon in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:20:41
I also have the Google Now notifications set up. They're very, very reactionary to price increases and drops. I had a shit ton of news when it reached 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:46:13
None, tbh. I already had kinda an idea that it probably was a meme or something, just wanted to find out why. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:07:11
That's true, that's why I believe it won't really happen. All that I described above would apply IMHO if it happened really soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:00:45
Yeah, but that's how it's now. We're debating on a world where you can't really use any exchanges or buy legal stuff with it. Nowadays there's barely anything driving people away from Btc, except for the fear of it crashing. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:13:51
Drugs don't need any additional knowledge do be accessible. If they starting enforcing policies to make Bitcoin less and less accessible, the coins will be only used for those who really have an incentive to do so. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:29:40
While I agree with you, we know that right know, it is most speculative and the accessibility of it had a great part into being it becoming more valuable. I don't think it will ever stop existing or it will die, but I do think that in a global cooperation scenario, it will surely decease in price if the same happens with the availability.

That's not true. I'm still nervous, but I've lost half of my investment that I might as well lose it all. Or profit again.
