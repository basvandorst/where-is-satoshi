If you type in jaber21 on twitter you can see his old account from 2014 with a pic of his face and its also from the Detroit area so its definitely him.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:49:58
This dude has the same name on these different places. Fucking stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:37
 OP started with 6k...
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:01:02
Good for you but you can buy 100 of these fuckers if you play your cards right. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:28:11
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:31:01
�� I'm stupid af so I was confusing two completely different things. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:44:26
P is short for pounds, it's slang here in the UK. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:46:55
�� I could tell he was a bit salty he dismissed it at first and told me how is this even possible. So he's willing to learn about it now after I told him how the price went up so quickly. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:56:36
�� 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:57:01
I am uneducated I'm fairly new to crypto just wanted him to atleast read up on it but whatever. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:10:51
�� I don't really know. Ironically he posted a Fb status asking if anyone had any part time jobs for him despite saying he could get "p" anytime he wants. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:43:10
Why am I being down voted I kindly asked for a suggestion. This is a bitcoin subreddit Smh. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:43:15
�� The disrespect. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:50:03
Thank you so much man I really appreciate your long detailed response. 
~Just a kid trying to do something with his life. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:42:43
�� He isn't really this messed up he's a white boy from France who gets in his feelings whenever we're in a argument. He claims he's not angry. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:49:06
I don't get that. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:59:42
We're exactly in the same boat but I'm a year younger. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:23:24
Coinbase charges 1% that's the only one I have. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:57:38
This is his response word for word. 
That's why u won't be making any p anytime soon cos ur doing dumb shit like this , and i really don't care if there's other fat fucks behind their computer going on about "grinding" to make money who are mocking me ...it's acc sad
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:16:25
Yes, yes and yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:40:48
I'll check it out thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:45:17
Sorry �� 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:25:54
Thanks for the knowledge.

When we reach the moon. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:11:43
I've downloaded coinbase and I'm setting it up I'll buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:19:03
So essentially I just buy it and watch it grow. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:01:48
After a little research apparently coinbase has insane transaction fees 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:22:30
Seriously man thank you so much, one of the reasons I love reddit is that people like you go out of their way to help strangers. I'll be considering every thing you've said. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:23:41
Yo I'm from Bristol nice to see Bristol on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:18:43
What exchange would you recommend. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:40:39
staying "on the grind" means to work hard, always be hustling, or otherwise engaged in money-making. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:55:10
�� 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:23:43
So selling meth to someone which then leads to that person overdosing on it is less shameful than a 16 year old aiding game cheats. I'm confused. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:54:38
�� No I'm just a teen that's interested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:04:22
Would a paper wallet be the best option ❓ 
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:31:25
What wallet that I could download on my phone would you recommend. I plan to get a hardware wallet in the future but for the time being I'm having a hard time finding a good wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:50:11
Sadly no. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:34:35
Thanks for the detailed reply man I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:16:45
 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:04:31
Thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:56:57
I don't want him to eat his left ball. I just wanted a update on the dude. I'd personally rather have him eat some sort of animal testicle with hot sauce or something along those lines. I'm not evil. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:56:21
I don't plan to retire at 23. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:53:31
Sorry I haven't thoroughly went onto the sub today all I did was come to post. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:30:34
That's extremely baised. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:34:10
If I just bought btc and hodled I'd have a lot less btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:44:30
If you download the app there's a bitcoin cash and bitcoin section. It is deceiving and bad but not as bad as you think. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:00:14
Congrats on the gains. I'm just waiting to be accepted for a new job (I'm 16) so I can get in on some more gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:07:18
Credit goes to 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:29
I thought it'd get less upvotes if it was a link for some reason. Another person linked it and it got on r/all so I was wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:07:05
It Isn't a get rich quick scheme however I feel like 7 years is very doable. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:36:53
All of you shut the fuck up. Idgaf if you're male, female or a 10 foot alien. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:40:03
��You're joking right. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:47:04
And now it's back up to 10k :-)
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:34:43
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:15:22
Bitcoin isn't the only way to make money. There's lots of altcoins that have huge potential my hopes are on vert coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:04:40
I had to bring out the video for the special occasion. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:50:35
Yoo that's amazing. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:45:16
Sure mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:22:45
Why are there 133 comments but I only see a few of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:46:14
 on twitter was their first customer he bought 5
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:50:10
And now it's down to 9k again 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:51:57
I don't understand what you mean. Are you addressing me or the dude I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:03:37
That's what I plan to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:12:36
My focus isn't to retire by 23 I'd just work for myself. Doing nothing and just relaxing with a decent chunk of money will eventually get boring. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:08:08
Dubai isn't so bad compared to other countries in that area. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:26:48
Most of the population doesnt what kinda normie ass shit is this.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:28:10
My parents don't have a any idea what crypto currencies are. I'll just explain it to them in a simple way they'll understand. Hopefully they don't think it's a scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:16:42
I'm also 16 and want to buy some bitcoin. Where could I buy from that doesn't require ID. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:11:27
����Now I feel stupid 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:15:13
What I do is hodl alts and convert it back to btc. I don't trade and will never trade. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:17:47
English probably isn't OP's first language. People who criticise others English online are  morons. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:05:03
I'll try convince my parents to help me with it. I'd be using my own money so I don't think it'd be too bad. Thanks for the help. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:34:19
That's why I'm buying a g wagon 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:54:29
Screenshoting this and saving it in a file named open when btc reaches 100k. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:15:00
You could call your kid ash since ash ketchum is called satoshi in Japan. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:25:38
I'm from the UK and look at bitcoin in USD idk why but I've always done it. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:26:15
Remember this when it reaches 100k and you regret it. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:46:24
I own bitcoins baby RemindMe! 1 year 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:26:39
I'll have to buy with crazy fees since I'm under 18 and don't have any other choice. I'm optimistic I'll make 100% + my original investment so it might be worth it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:42:53
I'm 16 and finally about to buy bitcoin idgaf about the crazy bitcoin atm fees it's the only way I can buy it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:11:17
You legend I'll remember this. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:52:11
Did you do this presentation? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:45:25
His hands don't look too small to me �� 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:31:36
I got 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 bitcoins in my account. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:09:53
I'd buy $300 worth and put $100 into alt coins then convert it back to btc when the alt coins go up in price substantially.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:55:14
I'm in the UK sadly. I'm also under age (16) so a bitcoin atm is really one of my few choices. I can't use coin base if I'm under 18.
