Now. Never. March 11. May 26. 
Who knows. Throw a dart. Big one? Probably if the ETF gets smacked down, but that could be any time between now and the 11th. 
I'm bullish. Don't see it going below 1,100 as of now if the ETF doesn't get shot down.

Agree (I should've included that in my comment), though the comment I was replying to seemed to be insinuating that they assumed an official announcement was made. That's all I was referring to.

Interesting. I'm not seeing that anywhere myself but believe you. Doesn't affect my bank luckily, but hopefully you find something better going forward!

That's not to say it CAN'T go down. It definitely could swing on an unexpected event. The only thing in the news right now though is the ETF decision. Usually when PBoC does something there's a couple of day lead up and the last time they tried anything the price fell and then recovered within a week.

I liked BTC at 900's (where I first bought in) so a drop would suck, but I'd probably put in another $900-$1000 if it did so yea, an extra 3-4 coins on the cheap wouldn't be so bad.

After 5:00 on a US Government holiday? Not a chance. If this is ETF related AT ALL it's due to someone with reliable insider info.

Lol not where I live, but certainly in some places. Would definitely make my mortgage payments lower after a nice little refinance...that's for sure!

Coinbase is in SF. It's not international. Maybe it's a charge for the ACH transfer? I'm not sure I've ever heard of a bank charging for ACH though...
The big 3 touted here are Gemini, Kraken and Local...I can't speak to any of them though because I just stick with Coinbase for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:02:13
Should be in your emails anyway, but my guess is that Coinbase would/will offer necessary forms come tax season...same way your bank or stock broker does or would do.

I think the ETF decision going the wrong way is the only upcoming event (that could be predictable) that could cause a significant drop. Sure, we could see some minor pull backs day-to-day, but I'm not sure we drop below $1100. 
Now, if a few Whales come along between March 1 and March 10 and decides to take profits to avoid the ETF risk, that could change my theory...but I don't see anything else on the horizon that's easily predictable. In fact, the ETF decision may wind up predictable and built in if we see multiple days of down tend starting in March. 
Right now there's too much momentum and money flowing INTO bitcoin for it to pull back on no news. I'm more curious as to when it's going to slow its daily increases.

Pretty sure most of those people were looking for 1,000 or less valuation. If you're begging on an internet forum because 1,200 is too much, 1,100 isn't likely much better for you.

Mine was approved within 1-2 minutes. Just make sure you're in a well lit room where the picture is clear.

Completely different method of obtaining. Most US brokerages charge around 5 dollars per trade and its generally flat rate (1 share or 1000 shares)

Probably 4 notifications (replies, DMs, likes, RTs, new followers, etc.) on one twitter account.

I don't think Alts will fall on approval. At least not the ones that are in the top 5 or so of market cap. The assumption is that BTC's ETF approval will lead the way for other coins to get approved going forward. Maybe the shit ones will fall as they lose more legitimacy, but I think everything rises with an approval at least in the short-term.

Current price as in the current price when you initiated the purchase. Lately their purchases have taken a bit longer to complete, but my first BTC purchase cleared in 2-3 days. Wasn't that hard.

Wallet recommendation? Would like something accessible by mobile. Haven't seen anything that blew me away with their reviews yet. I'm on iOS.

Took 2 days for me earlier this week via ACH.

Means we’re guaranteed to win regardless of outcome.

I was hoping to move some BTC to VTC last night. Then BTC’s value started dropping so I figure I’ll just wait a little bit. Especially since VTC is pulling back. Wanted to buy in at $3.50 then Segwit2X cancelled and I got screwed on that.

Think this is the answer seeing how BCH is going inverse. 
Edit: didn’t realize how high BCH went during my sleep. Just saw it’s coming down as well. Damn.

We only get nothing if you have 0 BTC...

To my knowledge it’s only blood or legal relation. I think it goes as far as grandparents/grandchildren (I’ve seen a lot of notes that it’s just parent/children and spouses).

Maybe, maybe not. I know USAA isn’t available to everyone, but they have integration with coinbase on their my accounts page so obviously they don’t have any complaints about it...

To be honest, I just like the thrill of gambling and high risk. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:19:00
It’s funny, the past 2-3 weeks it feels like every time BTC spikes it’s on its own, and every time everything else goes up BTC is dipping.
