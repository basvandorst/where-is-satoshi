Ah OK, the rest of the article (byline etc) mentions swaps so I would guess it’s not the writer. Maybe the editor?
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:54:35
I’m not sure what you are referring to. The tweet says price return swaps based on Bitcoin price. I don’t see anything in the tweet about choices. All Bitcoin derivatives are not bitcoin but they move based on Bitcoin price which is useful for hedging etc. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:14:42
They are Bitcoin swaps not options

If you have a country where Western Union will do bank to bank transfers (like India) the fees are $1 or $0. Sending cash isn’t the same as sending Bitcoin. They have to convert to fiat on the other end which will take some time and $ if they use Localbitcoins.

Maybe the ETF approval is already priced in and its going to be a bear run?

Wasn't this just shorts getting liquidated?

They have already paid some people back. I assume you are unaware of this? Were you scammed?

Title is very inaccurate. Fed is saying not to reduce capital requirements for banks as it will destabilize the system, he is not warning banks. This in response to Trump looking to scale back post crisis reforms.










@_date: 2017-02-13 23:51:43
With Trump being pro business I don't think many of these arguments will hold up. They are talking about rolling back Dodd Frank but they won't allow Wall St to have Bitcoin ETFs? I don't think so

How can there be no interest rates? I can borrow for free?

If you need to come to an agreement with yourself you probably have a mental problem. You need two people to come to an agreement. Maybe you can check your english and see who is the tard here?

Anyone who deals with bitcoins can be regulated. Every law has people doing things under the table, but if they regulate the businesses the majority of people will be following whatever the regulation is.
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:26:14
This doesn't make sense can you explain the steps that you used. How would you sell Bitcoins to your bank account? Are you trying to transfer money from you bank account or you want to convert bitcoins to cash? Edit: also Coinbase support replied to you in the previous thread why are you starting a new thread?
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:35:20
If he has an american bank account, he has an american address so I think the problem is lack of understanding of english and the UI. Until he actually explained the steps that he took I had no idea what he was talking about. Its pretty clear the missing bitcoins are in his USD wallet, they aren't stolen. He hit deposit thinking it would deposit to his bank account when it actually withdraws. I think there is no actual problem. Edit: he admitted it as such in another post below.
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:46:43
Again what makes it competent? Is this a statement that I should just assume to be true and questioning such a thing makes me a heretic? Wouldn't that be the way religions work? Is Bitcoin a religion or is it ok to ask rational questions?
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:37:53
Regulated, I dont think outlawed
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:29:52
Such a convincing argument, is that the extent of your knowledge? Are these facts based on logic or faith?
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:03:50
So if I ask how its competent that makes me a Bitcoin hater? Can you actually provide some facts? 
Calling someone a hater is trash talk, that is what you are doing. Thank you for trash talking me for asking for details about the facts. This is exactly what a true hater would do.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:59:57
If they can regulate it why would it be outlawed?
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:33:04
I disagree with this lol. It should be let us agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:38:10
I was following what you are saying until the end. Can you post some screen shots with your bank details removed? 
If Coinbase is depositing funds that means they are depositing funds TO your Coinbase account FROM your bank account so it looks like you confused deposit to mean deposit to your bank. The DEPOSIT button will withdraw funds from your bank account and deposit it to your Coinbase account. Its a free transfer for your right? So just WITHDRAW the money you want to your bank account.
Edit: In terms of your missing bitcoin they are in your USD wallet. Please post a pic of the balances of your BTC wallet, USD wallet and BTC vault
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:24:28
You could keep it in a safe, no energy required. You can store bitcoin on paper (assuming someone didnt get your keys by compromising your system) you need the Bitcoin network to be running for them to be converted to fiat. 
Your logic is almost circular, what makes Bitcoin competent? You are assuming no hard forks, major security disasters, governments creating their own coin and disrupting Bitcoin from becoming more than an investment. There are no guarantees with Bitcoin. If you keep your money in a bank, the govt will guarantee the bank for some amount
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:52:00
I think its a user error, confusion over what deposit means and what the balance of his USD wallet is.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:29:56
And he has an American bank account, your point is?
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:01:33
I don't see any tasks (I am out of tasks), does everyone always have tasks?

I think the headline is an exaggeration, its mainly because of the tourists not because of the currency ban. You won't find this in non tourist areas. Edit: There are still many shops in India that don't accept credit cards or mobile wallets let alone Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:21:01
post at and see if anyone will do a trade. otherwise  or 
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:37:22
It depends on how you deposited the money to your Coinbase account. It may show up as BTC in your BTC wallet or as USD in your USD wallet depending on how you did the transaction. Just convert everything to your USD wallet and "WITHDRAW" it to your bank account you should be fine.
@_date: 2017-01-23 04:23:38
Yes I addressed your point, I don't know why you are saying this. Nothing can be regulated 100% but if you want to run a legitimate business then they will have to follow the laws.


@_date: 2017-01-21 11:03:22
Coinbase at the moment only allows your to withdraw to Paypal currently. In the future you may be able to buy using Paypal.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:31:13
I think mentioning Bitcoin would probably make them think you are laundering money and shut you down quicker. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:51:30
You can buy crack with cash as well, did you actually read what I wrote? At some point people will need to exchange cash for bitcoin and vice versa, businesses that want to do this will be regulated.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:27:49
Gold is physical and doesn't need an infrastructure once you have it locked away. Bitcoin is the ultimate fiat, it's nothing and backed by nothing.

I think this is "clickbait." They care in that they want to sell more newspapers/ads and so they write hyperbolic headlines. I think the journalist writes the article and the editor writes the title, the clickbaitier the better for them. [Example headlines rewritten as clickbait](

I believe Japanese law is that they receive Yen. They already tried to get the profit.
