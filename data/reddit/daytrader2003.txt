This is not surprising. People are hoarding and anyone who studies economics knows hoarding is bad news for any currency. I won't be surprised if Bitcoin goes to zero within 6 months.

This is Google we're talking about. If they have no problems forcing Google+ on people, I'm sure they would have no trouble successfully promoting a new cryptocurrency.

Yes, Bitcoin will fail. It seems the only people promoting Bitcoin are heavily invested into it. Look, Bitcoin has all the classic symptoms of a ponzi scheme. The early adopters are the only ones that make any money, and everyone else is a fool, a sucker. 
It seems more and more businesses are accepting Bitcoin, but are they really? If you dig deeper you will find out that businesses like Overstock rely on exchange services like Coinbase to exchange the Bitcoins into USD for them. So really Overstock isn't accepting Bitcoin at all, Coinbase is the one accepting Bitcoins for them.
Bitcoin is similar to the tulip craze the Dutch had in the 1600's. In fact if you superimpose the graph of tulips and Bitcoin you will see striking similarities. What should we take away from this? I advise people not to touch Bitcoin with a 10 foot pole. It is headed to zero, and fast.

This was exactly my first thought, why wouldn't Google just make their own coin? I'm sure one of their development teams could crank out a better cryptocurrency in less than a day.
