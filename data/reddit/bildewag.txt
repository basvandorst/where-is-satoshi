I will inform you guys tomorrow when the Bitcoin Core is downloaded over the night. Couldn't get my head around Electrum. Its 5am and time for me to go to sleep. As soon as i wake up i let you guys know. Thank you for your help and support. It made me happier than million bitcoins ever would :) (well not quite)
