Haha true! Don't mean to Sound paranoid but can somebody tell me what happens to the crypto sent to the wrong address? Do they sell it? LOL
Seeing as someone asked me to produce a BCH address for recovery and I've never heard anything back from them and the address is gone on the page.

They were pretty fast at getting back to us at the start and for the last four months they just ignored every message. That's not bad, that's non existent. I also understand that in the beginning they were understaffed cause everyone was jumping in on btc. 
And yea, poor kraken, they don't want all these customers, its a hard life. And they are obviously not making lots of money to employ more people, poor.

Yeah, I know. but it is frustrating to know that you can pay other exchanges to recover crypto, but Kraken can just ignore it. it would help if somebody was held accountable. How can crypto become mainstream if nobody offers support? Stuff like this helps to support the argument that crypto is a dark web, cowboy, lawless industry.

Well yeah.. It was def my mistake. But other sites recover it for a fee or for free so I don't get Kraken's problem

Well, they do not and that's fine. But maybe if they were under their jurisdiction, there would be better customer Service.

Thanks, i used the link to expedite the ticket.

And I am not saying they should be under their jurisdiction, but he should not come out and call other People disrespectful when that sums up his whole business in one word. Or maybe he is just not aware of his customer support.

If someone had 10k of your Money and didn't Reply to you, how would you feel? i am talking about the fact that Kraken has outstandingly awful Reviews everywhere and now they are DENYING transparency. A bank can't ignore you as a customer, why can Kraken? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:44:16
Thanks for the input. how is your german?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:27:51
Thanks. Yea, its a pretty high amount in the thousands so it's hard to let go of. But kraken has replied, so hopefully it will work out.

my god. fuck that!! I have no idea what their procedure is but their support was VERY quick to make me create a BCH address, which then disappeared and since then I haven't heard from them. And we are not alone, I've had a bunch of people contact me with the same issues. how is this feasable????
