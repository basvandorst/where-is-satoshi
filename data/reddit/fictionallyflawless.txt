I'm in the IT field. I still don't have a desire to audit entire codebase of Jaxx, for example. Assuming Jaxx has its code as open source. If I can't do it or don't want to do it, I have to trust people on the internet to have done it. Again, need to trust something or someone else. But crypto is supposed to be trustless. It cannot be logically. 
With cash, I don't fucking have to trust my wallet. It can be literally falling apart but as long as its in my possession, I don't have to trust it. All I have to do is trust human greed that they want to transact with me with the cash. And that ain't stopping anytime soon. As for credit/debit, I trust the bank because the wide boot of the law is going to kick them on their ass. 
The conclusion: need trust at some point with crypto and cash. Cash is just more convenient except for sending it physically.

But if they take your $1000 from your card, you can get it back. And if you are using cash, you can simply hand him over a $10 bill or hand over $100 at most when you spent $10. You are right there physically. You are going to get your $90 back. Not so with bitcoin. You have to trust your wallet software. So much for being trustless. Lol. Crypto is stupid. But I'm okay making money from "greater fools".

Usually those ATM are in seedy neighborhood and in seedy gas station that also reeks of something. Yeah. Bitcoin ain't getting much adoption or any at all. What you are getting is destitute youngsters with little experience getting in on the speculation market of things. That's why it's always hodl this and hodl that until greater fools can come along. Ain't nobody gonna become rich with measely little Bitcoin. They only way to do it with crypto is to scam people or run some sort of custodian services like coinbase.com.

That's one of the stupid thing about crypto. You have $1000 but you want to spend $10? Handover the $1000, and maybe you will get $990 back or not. Don't have to do that with credit or cash.

You are foolish for saying "the greatest fools are still in fiat". 
Internet/computer aren't the same thing as cryptocurrency. Internet and computer actually are physical things and have millions of different usage. Crypto not so much. It's basically a virtual currency that you can gamble with now. You buy in the hopes that someday someone else would want to buy from you for a higher value. And those buyers hope someone else will buy from them at a higher value. And thus the cycle of greater fool continues.

Fiat it scam? Boy, your entire life and your entire existence has been made possible by fiat? Your fucking crypto, it wouldn't have existed if fiat didn't facilitate trade over the last centuries which eventually lead to creation of digital processors, computers, and eventually internet. Opinions like yours are reason why casual crypto users and mainstream thinks you are all delusion. You have zero understanding of trade, finance, money, fiat, value, wealth, etc. And despite trying your fucking hardest to make crypto into a replacement for fiat, you denigrate the very thing you want to turning your neck-beard project into. 
Keep doing that and keep dreaming about your lambo. You ain't going no where. If crypto is ever to become replacement for fiat and fiat, then you fools need to understand what it is that you are trying to do. Either way, it doesn't matter to me. I got both fiat and crypto. I am waiting for greater fools like you.

My forefathers defeated Nazis and tyranny. We will defeated them again and again. If we need to ban bitcoin to do it, so be it.  I don't understand why you think we would sit idly by to let Nazis dominate the world through bitcoin (if that's happening). We won't. We will defeat you. Again and again. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:46:55
There are literally billions of differing views than me. You don't see me calling them Nazi for having differing views. I am not going to and calling them Nazis. They have different views than I do. I'm not going to and calling them Nazi. They too have different views than I do. So your statement that I'm calling people Nazi for having different views than me is not based in fact. I am calling out literal racist Nazis as being what they really are and in many cases, they call themselves Nazis and identify with Nazi ideology and symbol.  
You might be complicit and sympathetic to Nazis. I am not. I won't stop voicing my opposition against racism. I am a minority. If I stop, these people will literally come to kill me and my family. And that is no hyperbole. I will not sit quietly while people who want to kill me and my kind. For you to even remotely suggest that I should just accept his is very, very wrong.

Thank you for banning gab, Coinbase.com. These Nazi anti-immigrant white-supremecist have no right to do business in your platform. Their freedom should be severely restricted if not completely eliminated. These evil group of people have no reason to be part of our human society.  Coinbase, you suck at many things but not in this regard. I will continue to be ur customer as long as you keep banning the likes of gab and Jordan perterson and other Nazis.
@_date: 2019-01-09 18:19:08
If Nazis start using Bitcoin to avoid being persecuted and eradicated I fully support banning Bitcoin. I will lose some money but my freedom as non-white is far more important than living under the tyranny of Nazis. Fuck Gab. Fuck Nazi. Fuck alt-right. Fuck hate. Fuck racism.

Bitcoin won't deflate in value forever and nor will all btc exist anymore. And if it's divided more and more, then it's basically inflation. Bitcoin will forever remain a cyper punk project. And nations will create their own digital Fiat that will replace paper Fiat. And they will add to digital Fiat just like they add today. That's how the world worked for thosamds of years. And it will be so for centuries to come. 
What we must remove is corruption. And bitocin doesn't magically remove corruption. In fact it ads to it even. That's why criminals outfits like Russia, Roger Ver, AltRight, Peterson, Nazis like Bitcoin. They want to do corrupt and criminal things and be no hindered. They are hindered by Fiat and crwidt and banks now. 
Down vote me all you want because u disaree with me but this is the truth.

It's true that I don't know anyone who sells drugs. I don't do do drugs. So I have no need to find such people. You missed the point from my you can't by LSD from Walmart. I know there are some dilapidated cities where Walmart is the ground zero of drug dealers and drug buyers. What I meant is that you cannot buy LSD from Walmart-the company. It's illegal. So a legal entity  like Walmart cannot sell it. Should we make bitcoin illegal, Walmart won't sell bitcoin either. Not hat Walmart sells bitcoin now. We are talking in hypothetical here. 


Since I don't do anything illegal, I have no reason to live scared.
Many countries have already made bitcoin illegal. Why do you think it's delusion to think that one more country cannot make it illegal? Seems like you are the one with delusion.  
Agreed with you on the part where bitcoin can be made illegal but it cannot be easily stopped. I even provided example to support your points. Drugs are illegal. But they are still being traded and used. You should thank me for arguing on your behalf. 
I then went on to say how US government has backdoor into softwares and hardwares. That's fact. If the full might of the government wanted to stop bitcoin (not just make it illegal), it's possible. US has crippled nuclear power-plants through software. There are some about 7000 bitcoin nodes and mining in centralized among few very well known companies. Should US want to stop bitcoin, it can. It's technically possible. Botnets can infect hundreds of millions of computers and these botnets are written by amateur so to speak. So do you think it's impossible for a nation with billions of dollars can't create botnets to infect 7000 ish bitcoin nodes?  This is entirely technically possible. 
To summarize: Nazi, racism =bad

You sound like a lunatic on street corner soothsaying global doom. And anyone who says DYOR usually has an invalid point. He burders his audience to get their own proof rather than provide it hisself--because he has none. 
Blockchain only works for Bitcoin and bitcoin only works for blockchain. I'm any other scenario, blockchain is a shit database system. You'd be better off using SQLlite or even Excel.
@_date: 2019-01-10 02:57:55
It's possible. All we have to do is pass a law making usage of bitcoin illegal. Lots of countries have made it illegal. 
 [ 
You can however still use it illegally. Just don't get caught. If you do, you will go to jail. If the bitcoin is illegal. 
As I said, if we the civil society see bitcoin is being used by criminals like Russia, Gab, Nazi, Jordan Peterson, we will lobby out government to ban it and make usage of it illegal. But then again legal fiat is being used by Russia, Gab, Jordan, and Nazis. We can't solve the problem by banning fiat. So banning bitcoin won't work. But our nation states have more power to regulate fiat than they do btc. That's a plus for bitcoin but minus for global rules/regulations. For this reason, there might come a time to make usage of bitcoin illegal. Should that time come, I will fully support this. As I said, I love my life. I love my freedom. I don't want to live under Nazism. To stop that, I'm fully okay with total banning of bitcoin. No amount of money is worth an iota of my freedom.

If we make bitcoin illegal, you can't use it. If you use it and get caught, you will go to jail. It's kind of like drugs. We have banned it. The selling and usage of it is illegal. But still some societal degenerates use and trade it. But they are a small, small minority. You can't go to you local Walmart and buy LSD. Why? Because it's illegal. Banning bitcoin would be the same. Sure you can still use it but you'd be doing something illegal. You'd be looking around when you use it. Because again you'd be doing something illegal. 
I hope bitcoin continues to be a viable store of value and even a pseudo useful currency. The blockchain makes all transactions public. This coupled with KYC/AML/anti-terror laws and stringent application of laws and regulations will ensure illicit groups like Nazis cannot use it for nefarious purposes. 
If t came down to it, bitcoin can be shutdown also. All that's required is the might of a wealthy nations such as America. This nations have crippled nuclear power plants through code. I'm sure crippling 9000 or so Raspberry Pis  and the like is technically possible. Most OS and chips have backdoor built it for US government and government of other nations. As I said, if it came down to it. Bitcoin can be stopped by a modern government.

Because you dumb, op. You can send for much less few. There are services that can send money for half as much fee and if you are willing to work a bit more, you can send for free.
