I was thinking the same thing as I saw the LTC post also.  Possible fishing for good citizen award donations. .

And 50k will most likely occur, as has 1k, 5k and 10k etc.

Probably both but more greater fool until a large percentage of people adopt.

Why is you being broke anyones problem and why do people feel they have to buy a whole bitcoin? Prices are relevant to the return on investment gain. A 100% gain on $10,000 is $20,000. Wether it is in 200 litecoins at $100/coin or 2 Bitcoins at $10,000/coin. It’s all relevant.

I agree with you. 
Who pays? 
People who actually work for a living? 
People who actually risk their capital on investments? 
People who have every right to heir there wealth to there next of kin? 
So what happens when you eventually run out of other peoples money?
 UBI, terrible idea.

Your 16.67% invested vs 10% ownership on any given amount of money is a 6.67% loss or free money given away by you to your investing partner regardless of the ROI. 
  You should probably stick to buying and holding your own personal investment. Unless you’re actually serious and in that case, wanna be my partner? 10/90, Deal???

Total dollars invested divided by total amount of btc would be your cost basis.

Not a problem, my accomplice will be in the other room hodling your family at gun point.

Well at least their portfolios are worth less than half if they bought in December.

Just imagine no banks. There wouldn’t be capitalism that created business that created tech that allowed crypto to emerge. Looks to be a love/hate relationship. Wouldn’t have the one without the other.  Almost like hating your parents for being too strict or not fair enough to your liking, then wishing they didn’t exist. Oh wait, I wouldn’t be here either then...

I’m invested and believe in blockchain has its purpose and place in the future, but let’s be realistic, banks are not going away and never will. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:13:32
Like the tech explosion in N Korea, Africa, or any other third world shithole without any reputable core banking institutions

Are you still diversifying in alts minus trading and trying to time the market or just staying strictly BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:53:06
I’m new to all this and I’m hearing a lot of either switching all from BTC to alt or vise versa, why not invest in both and diversify? Am I missing a bigger part of the equation?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:55:18
I gotcha, taking advantage of a good buying opportunity.

The OP is stating the information he got from the support site. He’s seeking clarification.

How much cheaper are the fees?

So because it retraced up by five percent everyone comfortably assumes the correction is in? As if it can’t just reverse and drop to new weekly lows at any point?

And for the guy who bought and held them without touching them? Recycle his fortune?
