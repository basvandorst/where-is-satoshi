some perspective, as these arguments generally are laughably full of holes even for BTC enthusiasts, and then they surface up to CNBC and such and make the community look bad:
BRK lifetime growth, 1964\-2018: 154,342,632&amp;
\-Annualized return: 28k&amp;
\-Math: \(\(273000 \- 19\)/19\)\*100, that's current price of about 273k, starting price in '64 of $19.
Now, that math is a little tricky in showing a complete picture, bc a lot of that growth was probably the early years of BRK, but the starting stock price and the today price are what they are.
If you can tell me BTC's 55 year return, or even an expected annual return, then ok. But we can't. So this is a close to nonsense cherry\-picked timeline for comparing BRK v. BTC. If my math is wrong or I'm missing something, definitely open to debate.
edit: grammar and such
Edit edit: in summation, there are a lot of ways to compare investments, comparing the 3 (or really any amount not in Big N territory) year return of two wildly different assets and asset classes is the most moronic of the ways

you seem to be infinitely unaware of what sample sizes are, and generally what I just laid out, in that I'm not taking about indicators from 60 years ago, but 60 years OF indicators. Let's dive into that! 
The data of 60 years of performance is immeasurably more valuable of an investment or any stat metric than the data of 3 years. Law of large numbers and such. That definite, more or less universally agreed upon math concept within the bounds of the type of data we are looking at right now aside....
Given this meme is arguing 3 year time frames to make  a point, let's do a thought experiment: If i was to plan an investment based on, say, equities, then I'd be in for a pretty rude awakening if I used, like you say, 'recent investment indicators.'
Lets say I planned off the past 5 years of equities, that's pretty recent, \(21&amp; 12&amp; 2&amp; 13&amp; and wow 32&amp; My average is a pretty healthy 16&amp; Let's use that! When I'm hit with a real average 7&amp; and markedly miss any goals I had for investing, or even when Mr. 2008 \-32&amp; return rolls around, I'll learn the value of large data sets. If I use 3 years? That's even more inaccurate. But that's just investing.
But then maybe you're talking about trading, i.e. BTC is a better trade that BRK due to the past 3 years of returns. I'm going to point you to a little disclaimer on quite literally every financial document that reads along the lines of 'past performance is not an indicator nor a guarantee of future performance." There are way too many reddit posts to make here to explain the backing of that and why it's true. BUT, that aside, two things: Going back to our equity trader in the previous paragraph, you bet your ass any reputable T1 trader is planning for that 7&amp; i.e. making hedges to not expose himself to the wild swings of prices that generate that 7&amp; on average. Do you know where that market know\-how comes from? 100 years of available data, not 3. Moving from there, a little thought experiment: tell what BTC will be tomorrow. Or next minute. That's right, you can't. You can't even accurately tell me with a data driven argument that BTC won't return 0.1&amp; until 2020.  I can't either, and that's ok because I know I can't.
But then maybe you're talking about vol. Yup, vol in BTC is much easier to determine and loosely predict based on trading volumes and such, and in that case, the vol is what is pulling a lot of traders in. And yes an entirely speculative asset like BTC is a good bet to have more vol than a 60 y/o company, minus any acts of god \(but wait, those happen all the time, let's go back to "past returns do not....", but that aside\). But you didn't say vol, you said 3 years of return performance being a better indicator than 60 years of data, which again, makes zero sense.

Intense reading the posting again.
Makes me remember what a nightmare 2008 was and what btc stands for in that regard, I always viewed it as the real Occupy.
As long as bulge bracket banks exist that can legally intermingle with commercial banking, mortgages/student loans/etc don't stay with the lender of origin thus incentivizing irresponsible lending, btc needs to exist. The current financial system is structured like a water utility company but with the ability to gamble with global water supplies and profit regardless of the outcome.
It's not a perfect solution (yet), but bitcoin is the first viable alternative to that status quo which caused that total life collapse we all collectively experienced.
At the very least, a viable alternative presents the ability to negotiate for reforms without the risk of being laughed out the room. At the best, it presents a way out of this mess.

I hear this a lot, and in theory any currency is wildly manipulatable, so that’s not really the proper comment.  A central bank, a large holder, or a enterprising trader (see Soros 80’s), can really do whatever the hell it wants to a currency. So, you are actually talking about volatility.  “No currency this volatile can work.”
To that, I point you to the intense volatility of the dollar, especially in the early years of the USD as adoption was slow, it wasn’t a global currency, central bank wasn’t really stood up. This equally applies at one point or another to most of the world’s major currencies. What stopped it’s volatility? Global usage, central bank responsibility, “on-boarding of users,” spending it, regulatory backing, etc. 
So then, it’s not the volatility that stops it from being a future currency, but it’s a question of will on-boarding, regulatory support, global usage, spending volumes, increase enough to smooth the vol?

i posted somewhere else here, but generally, work on understanding the tech as best as you can. if you get the tech, then a lot of stuff falls into place as far as being relatively stress-free.

prob true the guy's sells fed into the bear market, but i don't think it "proves" $19k to $9k. 
So there are about 17mil bitcoins in circulation. That number has to be massaged for lost/hodl'd etc., but since those 200k were also part of a hodl, i think it's a somewhat apples-apples comparison, so it works. 
200,000/17,000,000, is about 1% of bitcoins in existence. I have a hard time believing 1% of the total bitcoin supply was the primary cause of a almost 50% selloff in 3 months

this is great news. The idea that only bitmain or whoever can produce competent mining tech is nonsense. Nvidia is one example, but the moment an established, F500-type decides to get into mining, EX or DEX, or any non-trading, protocol-based aspect of crypto, this will start taking off in a big way. (edit) As in, R&amp;D from these types putting its time and effort toward btc is a really exciting/scary thought. If that means they have the wherewithal via funding/computing power to successfully launch a 51%, etc. then btc will adapt, or we can realize this was all a fun experiment but won't work. But, if these types can contribute and the game theory plays out as satoshi original argued it would..... then that's massive

so, this falls under null data? Can that be reversed via a BIP? no idea what to do about past data though
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:12:54
Good discussion for sure.
With your comments about managing risk, issue is that "risk management" is all CAPM math, i.e. black-scholes, etc. Which, to really simplify it, but still true, is based on the ability to value the asset. That does not yet exist in crypto, for the very simple reason a core foundation of CAPM is that the 90 years of market data is good data to build valuations, beta, rm, rf, etc off. BTC has 9 years, rest of crypto has like 2 and under.
However, if they structured themselves to survive on the 2%, then yes they could still be in business. BUT, that would only work if they had some serious locks on their AUM, bc the 2/20 play off each other. If returns don't occur to justify the 20%, investors pull out, so that 2% rapidly shrinks. Given the past 4 months, I don't think they'd survive on that 2% unless funds in there were locked for say 1-2 years at least. 
To your second point- I was more addressing that HFs short bc it opens up both sides of the market, generally- HFs short, it's pretty common. Seemed like you didn't think it was common.
What does occur though, and what I'm referring to/asking about, isn't HFs short/long the same security, it's if they rode the high up to $19k and sold, and then started shorting from $19 to $15, $15 to $X, etc. Bc that is a totally valid short-sale strategy 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:46:02
the mtgox time sales link is interesting, but pretty meaningless w/o total btc sale volume (coin, not price of coin) on each of those selloffs. A 40,000 btc sell off if only 50,000 btc were sold is a lot more conclusive than 40k btc out of 200000000btc (using totally made up volumes)

yes, 2/20, familiar with the concept. So first by extension, they capture a vast majority of profits from that 20% of returns, not the 2% of AUM. So HFs get hammered by bear markets, unless...
They short v. only selling on the way down bc selling only captures previous profits, and makes only 1/2 of the market profitable- bull runs. Vast majority of HFs short to actually "hedge," and then also to profit from bear markets. 
Selling outright is cheaper and simpler, however shorting is vastly more profitable, and what HFs do.

The schiff-prophet stuff is beyond annoying. Efficient market hypothesis aside, the reasoning behind that is as follows: yes, he discovered an incredible Arb opportunity. Smart people, using publicly available information, as was the case with the housing bubble, can and do discover those sorts of opportunities. However, a success of that magnitude (bc of a market screwup of that magnitude) is often a once in a lifetime experience. Think of all the big names in markets (not corp raiding like Ichan, which is a different ballgame), and check if they've had similar  home runs  before or since '08 (John Paulson, schiff, the basses, soros, eisman). They haven't. Maybe they will again, but discovering an arb does not mean market prophet

Depends what your savings goals and required rate of return are, like any other personal financial decision. 
Is your goal a safety net and for whatever reason you have it in stocks? Prob should move it to a MMF or AAA bond fund. 
Is your goal just to park it/invest it for the heck of it, and you’re ok with losing all of it (as 10 years of data is not at all enough to determine what the “crypto return” actually is), than yeah throw it into crypto, why not.

Two pieces of conflicting information here...
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:35:10
To both, wrong on several fronts
-the continued existence of oil, and any number of commodities that also have cash settled futures, is a strong case against ruining btc. Worst case is smoothing vol, or maybe tail wags dog. 
-the govt printing fiat to suppress btc, over every other priority they have, is laughable. If you actually believe that, you prob should be in monero bc btc lost its libertarian credibility a while ago 
- the guys that will buy futures will never buy btc, just like the guys that buy/sell spot contracts (I.e. farmers) are not the guys who buy futures (although they do sell it). That’s like saying people who will buy wheat won’t buy wheat anymore bc they can buy the futures. There’s some overlap, but different markets.

Yeah it can be a steep learning curve. That’s an interesting question, I’m unsure. Initial thoughts: 
1) I think Coinbase could get pissy and drop/lock your account IF you managed to reverse the debit transfer in time, which isn’t ideal bc having a workable and responsive Coinbase account is a great asset for new users. 
2) if you take that route, be very upfront with how you explain it to your bank, I.e. exactly this Reddit post. Banks seem to have a tenuous relationship with crypto exchanges and look for reasons to lock bank accounts that interact with exchanges, so sort of like renters insurance: you use it once, great, but you’re now uninsurable. Second, I’d be worried about fraud charges on you from the bank’s end: there’s a difference between someone stealing your debit card and you reporting it as fraud, and you doing something that you now regret/was a scam and reporting it as fraud. I don’t know how/If banks differentiate between the two, and also if they do, is the latter just a bank no-no or actually illegal. 
Future advice: get your stuff off Coinbase/exchanges and into an actual crypto wallet where you can control the keys. Also, all of those posts are scams obviously

If I may, is this accurate, using 1btc in trezor 
1)  pre fork: have 1btc in trezor
2) post fork (although I'm unclear how trezor will display this): with my 1 priv key in trezor, I have claim on 1btcA and 1btcB. 
3) using that priv key, send a transaction over the chain for BTCA, to a location I control, ideally back to trezor but idk what they'll do. Do the same over BTCB chain with original key , to a different address I also control. Get "confirmed" for both. 
4) wait for things to settle down, but if both chains continue to exist, I've successfully split? And can swap if I so choose.

No, def not disagreeing with him being very intelligent- the smart guy who spotted the trade  out of the many smart didn't spot '08. 
My point goes beyond '08: these type of dudes are frequently 1 hit wonders bc simply, those types of opportunities, those trades of a lifetime, are so so rare. So, one home run (or two in his case with '01), out of a lifetime of par for the course trades, makes him a prophet not. Survivorship bias if you will.
Briefly to my point, after the massive successes in '08, with new theories sold on the thesis they had the "magic eye,"
Paulson: Paulson advantage fund, down 18% in '16. Paulson partners, down 22%.
Eisman: follow up fund shuttered a few years post '08 
Soros (post Bank of England): not much 
 
To be fair, there's a lot going on there- "hot hand" risk of getting too much capital and not enough opportunities, etc.

I agree at best it’s not worth paying attention, at worst it’s completely out of line with the values here. The SECs blessing on it means nothing of value for bitcoin. 
But, “pegged to fiat,” that’s not really how an ETF works, especially a currency one. It will track the underlying value of bitcoin, and allows investors to buy it, vs buy bitcoin. Just because gold has an etf, doesn’t peg the physical gold bars to USD much in anyway, meaning peg as in the gold bars start fluctuating due to ETF performance, than the other way around. 
Why is that? Well buyers simply won’t buy an overvalued ETF for $8000, when they could just buy the underlying bitcoin for $7900. Think of the ETF just as another buyer of bitcoin. 
What it might legitimately bring though is regs to crypto exchanges, bc SEC is not ok with an etf based on a physical product that can be so easily manipulated, by extension manipulating the etf.

I think risk is limited to standard digital wallet risk, bc given the difficulty/friction in this whole process I don't think nor expect the hardware ones to adapt immediately.

Highly doubt a regular CME trader will hold any spot. This is like saying a flow desk will purchase spot oil as part of its hedges. Majority of inst. traders deal strictly in futures. This isn’t even really a topic of debate 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:06:29
With these  guys it’s not 1x or 2x. 
Let’s be real, it’s the $6k btc that’s attracting CME and everyone else, not the more technically efficient. The more inst money bodies that latch onto btc 1x, the more dead any other btc fork will be fortunately/unfortunately.

Sure. Most of these errors become really easy to spot once you get familiar with the mechanics of the spending processes and such 
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:19:09
Is it really green-for 2x and red-against? That seems massively lopsided, aside from what I assume is outsized capital control of the greens + influencer opinion, how is 2x still a thing

Answer is I believe, factoring in replay or no replay protection, put coins into wallet throughout the HF. See what happens, use coins on one chain or the other (you have claim to both), and forex swap one for the other if you want to. 
If you leave them in an exchange during it, depends on what the exchange decides to do. Wallet move seems like a no brainer though

In short no, sent is sent. Trade off for not having Visa in the middle to stop fraud payments is absolutely certainty that when you spend something you’ve spent it.

It’s a bummer for sure. 
On a positive note since it sounds like you’re new, here’s some great reading that’ll keep you busy for a while and also help avoid these types of scams in the future,  All sorts of bitcoin owners new/old have done something stupid with their bitcoin at one point, don’t sweat it. Always more to learn!

-Possible inputs into market prices are nearly impossible to fully account for. 
-logic: if there was an accurate prediction that the price on Monday will $100, then the price will become $100 the Friday before as investors bid up to that in preparation 
-the model is built on past price moves, using it as prediction for future. By extension, remembering the previous point, if folks are rational, they’d use that rationality to use past data points to predict the future, this pricing out that prediction (Nobel prize for Econ awarded for this last point)
-in short, can’t model prices at all accurately. Random events blow all price models out of the water eventually, either in a good or bad way. Best thing you can do is assess the fundamentals (I.e. does bitcoin work as a protocol), re-evaluate consistently to see if those fundamentals still hold, and don’t put yourself in a position to be blown up by a price move

Yeah it’s dumb. Dude pulled off a killer trade, is politically active and wealthy since, but great thing about modern markets and economies is no one swings enough volume to really “conspiratorially manipulate” them 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:56:58
I think that’s a pretty glaring false dichotomy

 Yes indeed. I am a moron

very very true. efficient market theory whether strong/semi/weak is the only "market predictor theory" that has any data-based weight behind it. the TA model that works Date 1 to Date 2 will fail when given the exact same preconditions and pattern but with Date 4 to date 7. There is just so. much. data. and. research. from. over. 40. years. since. TA. came. out. that. summarily. disproves. TA. over. and. over.

Generally (using ACH as a stand in, could use Zelle, etc.)
-Dex links two users
-Users swap ACH account 
-Users agree to send x-BTC one way or the other
-User ACHs to the other
-BTCs agreed upon are put in a mult-sig if I recall correctly
-multi-sig gets unlocked once ACH completes
-Exchange exists to settle arbitration 
-A lot of exchanges have exchange-tokens largely used to incentivize development, and bond arbitrators

Yeah that’s the better way to look at it, than nothing else will exist

Ah, so that's starting up again. An unfortunately bullish signal
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:37:58
further reading: on basically all 4 bullets 
further further reading on the last bullet, and the actual explanation of "black swan" that is starting to show up in crypto but totally incorrectly used  
you could also dig into efficient market hypothesis.
also, if you're into technical analysis/charts, this could shake your views a little but it's good to be challenged 
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:58:12
Well price discovery would exist but in terms of goods services, which I suppose you could measure as a bitcoin CPI of sorts. Even if it’s “deflationary-traited” there will be natural inf/def as supply in circ changes. But yes price discovery as per fiat would decrease as a factor. I don’t think global currency means no other currencies though

\-folks will vote with their dollars, and if we're confident in BTC over BCH, this will sort itself out. Outside of the mindless $20 investor\-types, they will realize there's a discrepancy when they see a Bitcoin \(btc\) and Bitcoin \(BCH\), naturally dig into it, and stumble on this stuff, and then decide for themselves. 
\-A very deliberate effort is obviously being made, but if one has to constantly argue that 'their vision/change is the right one, no it's not what you actually think, *change narrative etc. etc.,'* then it starts to reek of something or someone desperately needing to prove they're right. Facts always win out. If BTC is 'right,' in that it has the right tech, right set up, right protocol, then long term that'll reflect on hash power, etc. Let Ver do this nonsense 
\-The new securities law discussions popping up lend an interesting angle to it. SEC and co. are definitely trying to slap some framework on this. If you don't believe the two previous 'market will win out' approaches, then try legal i suppose. Good case  get SEC to take Ver to court for misleading investors, file a criminal complaint, let BCH experience the downside of having a currency with a visible leader. There's no trademark/patent case I'd think, but there's an argument here that Ver left Home Depot, built a new Home Depot, and called it Home Depot, and is deliberately misleading investors. Ang

doesn't seem to be saying anything crazy... basically track a utxo's path, see if it's linked to a shipping address, build  a profile on the likely user, throw IP data into it as well. 
1/2 of that is fixed-ish with a VPN, the other, idk, only really applies to buying stuff online. Maybe 2 wallets used, 1 for online shopping, 1 for in-person spending?
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:01:35
yeah id think you'd have to be very disciplined and keep two wallets that never overlap. All btc that comes in from a forex tx goes right into "spending wallet" or "online wallet." But the article talks about using that online wallet chain of utxo's to see if a shipping address ever pops up. not sure how to defend against that
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:18:13
pretty interesting. There are all sorts of 1980's-like arb and price movements, traditional traders like these folks could prob make a killing

not to be a total twat but that a 8-10 year bear market + recession is not a black swan event. not even close. It's mildly infuriating how "black swan event" is working its way into crypto and bitcoin but in completely the wrong manner, and it makes the community sound like they have no idea what they are talking about.
Black swan events = "The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. "
For further fun: 
Not a black swan event: stock market crash of the 8-10 year predictable type, and btc going on a run as investors search for yield. 
A black swan event: bitcoin invention, as in BGP and all the other issues that crippled every other attempt at digital cash getting solved.

That’s predicated on Coinbase/etc both running a node and then building a trading api that process “LN trades,” yes? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:04:39
Welcoming alternate viewpoints, but doesn’t LN inherently keep btc out of the exchanges and therefore, despite an increase in daily use, there’s much less trading volume  and therefore less trading action and price? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:45:48
Yeah that’s the read I get. LN taking off
will be great for monetary velocity and maybe tacking some real value into btc
To price it off of, but that’s a really indirect bull run or at least
Won’t look at all like the last speculative ones
