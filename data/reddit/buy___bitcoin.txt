In less than 14 days, Bitcoin's hashrate has passed from 56.77 EH/s   to   64.85 EH/s. That is an 8 EH/s increase. Roger Ver's shitcoin BCH (bitcoin cash) has a total hashrate of 2 EH/s.

A device only used to store Bitcoin keys has much higher chances of being backdoored than a normal computer running on Linux. Stating otherwise is ridiculous. A malicious worker for Trezor could make millions by swapping 100 devices. Trezor and Ledger could be the next MtGox. Bitcoin is all about "don't trust, verify".

I have 5 backups. All devices are encrypted with a strong passphrase. A person that finds my USB on the ground: it's just a random USB key. I wouldnt say the same with a trezor. Computer that runs the USB never connects the web. I generate and sign the txids on that airgapped device. Then I broadcast on another hot computer. I use a QR code to make the jump from the safe computer to unsafe one. I double check the signed txid before broadcasting it.
Trezor user: how are you sure that someone at the factory had not put a different bootloader on your device? Or still, just different hardware that look the same.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:56:05
The only *small* risk I see here is the 1M BTC mined by Satoshi. His public key is known so if the current encryption is cracked using  quantum computers, his stash could be available. 
It's 1M out of a 18M supply. Not great, not terrible I would say.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:29:47
How can we be sure that someone working at the ledger or trezor factory is not tampering some of the devices' bootloader. Don't trust, verify.

Just buy and "get hacked" (tell them you dropped your seed paper on the ground or something). Don't use your BTC to buy stuff that are linked directly to your name (cars, boats, houses). For the rest, enjoy.

My seeds are stored on multiple encrypted USB sticks (and on the cloud, encrypted too). 
I have set up a strong passphrase.
One close family member has a USB stick with the seeds in them (different encryption than mine). 
One other close family member has the passphrase for the USB stick. 
They don't know who the other holder of the missing element is. And they are told to talk about it only when if I die. They are also told to let me know if they lose the USB stick or the passphrase.

These are the magic 12 words that you need to write down when you create an Electrum wallet. It's your backup in case of lost device. All hardware wallets offer that kind of security. For my part, I have multiple encrypted USB flash drives so I ain't scared of losing my USB sticks. Also, someone finding a linux flash drive on the ground won't try to bruteforce/crack it. The opposite is true for Ledger, Trezor, etc.

Those kind of vague and illogical guidances from the IRS are good news. People will just not bother reporting their crypto assets and, if asked, tell the IRS they lost their seed words on the ground.

Do you realize how impossible it is to buy every bitcoin at 9080$?
Even if you bought 'only' 100 000 BTC (0.5% of total max supply of 21M), your average price would be more than 11k. Supply and demand. If demand grows, so does the price (especially true for Bitcoin since the supply is fixed).

I agree with that statement. Bitcoin isn't a company with profits where you can tell if the stock is over or undervalued. The price is just a pure reflection of supply and demand.

They can't sell something they don't have. To short a position, they first need to borrow that same position from someone else. There is not 100 000 bitcoin to borrow on the market. They would need to offer astronomical fund rates to Bitcoin lenders which could easily cost them dozens of percents per day. Impossible. You remember the saying: not your keys not your bitcoin? Any whale would never risk 10 000 Bitcoin by lending it on an exchange.
The only possible way for them to drive the price down using the market is to buy a shitload of Bitcoin and selling them. Sadly, they would just create a giant Bart Simpsons and lose a lot of money because of slippage. And also, every news outlet in the world would talk about Bitcoin rising from 8k to 80k in 2 days. Good luck CIA.

I agree with you. What I am saying is that my fixed DCA amount is what I am willing to lose (never invest more than that in BTC). That fixed weekly amount gets me a bigger share if the price goes down, which is good IMO.

Regardless of what the Fed does they are guaranteeing that Fiat will go down. FTFY.
Gold, Bitcoin, Real estate, ..., are just alternatives to Fiat and none of them is guaranteed of success. If we ever find a 1 million ton gold mine somewhere, gold would crash. The only guarantee: Fiat will lose value over time due to monetary inflation.

If you sell without KYC-AML for cash money (no wire deposit), they can't know. But don't try to deposit those bank notes at the ATM. Use that cash for daily expenses until it is gone. For 10k, it's easy. But if you sell for 50k-100k, it can take years until your   undeclared money is washed in groceries, restaurants, etc.

Theoretically, half of the current Bitcoin buyers could disappear overnight and the price would remain stable overtime.

Supply and demand, halving reduces supply which raises scarcity and thus, the price of the asset.

Traded volume is irrelevant if it is just bought back and sold. The only important volume is the amount of new fiat entering the ecosystem and the BTC being sold permanently for Fiat (people leaving and never buying back). The rest is just noise.

When BTC mining reward will be at 0 in 2140, no "new" money will be needed to keep the price stable if there is no "old" money exiting the ecosystem (people selling for Fiat and not buying back). The trading volume is irrelevant because if I Buy 100 000BTC then sell 100 000BTC, i haven't changed anything on the overall supply or demand. Yet I have raised the trading volume by 200 000 BTC. Traders are just making short term price movements. The only people that have long term effects on the price are those who HODL and people leaving the market for good.
