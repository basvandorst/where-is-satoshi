What OP just posted seems like an important matter which at least should be revised, and not "trolling" at all. I didn't know anything about all this until now.

If the money is his, why is he and some of you guys charging a monthly fee for holding the coins?
And just so you know, is one of the guys who was/is holding the coins, 750 BTC to be precise.


Theymos said the money was "for the creation of good forum software".
