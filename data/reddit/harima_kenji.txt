Being 16 years old, you're probably doing better than the majority of people on this sub who have 15 year old understanding of world.

Even the "hollowed white paper" was not given study, no peer review. It is after all a white paper and not an actual scientific paper.

This is good for bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:14:38
Yes. Let me contribute to the world by buying bitcoin now and sitting on my ass purposefully doing nothing with it, while others efforts and production and speculation on how much I'm sitting on go towards making me immense gains. I took the risk on this volatile life changing asset, I deserve all the reward that a currency-investment-non-economy produces. Thank you.
Seriously, if you cared, you'd look at what criticisms people have, find a solution to them, and then make your money by actually contributing to human progress. "Investing" in bitcoin is literally the most counter intuitive thing in the world. Dont invest in bitcoin, invest in bitcoin companies. Invest in something that actually does something. Heck, invest in gold, because we use gold for things, real things. Dont buy bitcoin. Work for bitcoin. But wait. You wont, because you're a rational player and the mechanics of bitcoin to begin with weren't set up for that. Perhaps we'll learn from this why papers should go through a rigorous peer review process, you know, science.

I'm kinda of the opinion that arguments like yours are subject to the fallacy in thinking that a white paper is a scientific peer reviewed paper. White papers are really nothing more than a product proposal. A little bit of actual peer review before everyone dumped money on it would have made the conditions for bitcoin to succeed at its stated goals much better, unless of course those were never really the goals to begin with... But to quote a white paper product proposal as some sort of truth and not admit those who try to deal a bit of peer review (critics) is really not much better than quoting a late night infomercial for the "new revolutionary back scratcher and toenail clipper! 3 easy papers of 29.99! beats all competitors! no contest!"

Sounds like you would be more benefited by talking to an actual forex trader. They would likely tell you the differences here.

Its all made up. Speculation.

In BitcoinLand of course it does! My reading of articles on reddit is the equivalent of hundreds of day labors in India who I tip pennys at--- but I am doing the world good because they will be worth a fortune to those people someday, all I have to do is keep reading on reddit to drive up the price! Didnt you take a real economics in school?
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:54:04
the only problem with that is there aren't that many people actually spending bitcoin. While the investment in bitcoin is pretty large, the spending of bitcoin is almost negligible to a business right now...

There are alot of independent covert double agents from both sides in both and You'll know the real buttcoiners if you follow the money, as we're getting paid to shill.

yes, my apologies. **Counter Productive** is a much better term.

Funny, thats the same sentiment I have towards the supposed software engineer satoshi who thought he was a financial/economic expert....

HAIL BITCOIN!
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:13:41
He would probably also say something like "Be smart to begin with", which is why he doesn't see bitcoin as an investment. 
And it shouldnt be. It cant be both a currency and an investment at the same time.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:56:40
you seem to be confusing anger with laughter.

But also referencing block chain bloat/size.
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:00:06
i would interpret what he's saying as "there's a difference between investment, and currency: one is in finance the other in economics. While very closely related, they are still different." But I dont want to put words in his mouth.
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:39:40
If only there was some sort of trustless system to transfer value between 2 parties... convenient paper form, easily divisible, accepted by everyone... a bitcoin company should try making that, we could call it the *rollad.*
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:05:37
solution: dont prevent it, call it a feature.

You kinda just described a whole lot of people who are into crypto currency...
