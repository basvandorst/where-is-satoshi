How much should a city vote count though?
0.95?  0.8 of a regular vote? You don't need an electoral college to do that, just make each vote count less after how many other people they have in their near geography. 
Also, why not reduce vote wight based on distance from Washington and state capitols as well?
That WOULD make rural problems better listened to and understood by lawmakers and leaders. 
Exhibit A is how well Trump tarriffs did repay the favor to rural America big time, if he'd won the popular vote, too he'd have confidence enough to make that move in year 1.

I can agree with everything but the "then bitcoin is unnecessary" part. 
Unless greeks want to take a month-long holiday while thia plays out, they're having a hard time using all that cash for payment over the internet (or even payment-at-a-distance) this means, for most greeks, they won't be able to withdraw cash mostly, and they'll be severely limited in what they can do with them. Bitcoin can fix one of those.

Yep, but most companies don't have an "official" public key, yet. When business registers start keeping track of these, in addition to official business address, CEO and board members.

You can either have a 10-minute-to-2-hours waiting period, when buying coffee over the counter using plain bitcoin payment OR you could be using Coinbase or BitPay carrying a balance with them in advance, where they guarantee the validity of transaction at less-than-0-conf time, or you could open a payment channel in advance, where you pre-approve a certain amount with the merchant, and get your change back from the merchant, after the payment is deducted (decentralized and no 3rd party).

Merchant with some 0-conf experience, here. If this happens I see either adding a 10-minute-to-2-hours wait period for the first confirmation, when buying coffee over the counter using plain bitcoin payment OR somehow previously making the bitcoins un-doublespendable by the customer some time in advance of the transaction.
You could be using Coinbase or BitPay carrying a balance with them in advance, where they guarantee the validity of transaction at less-than-0-conf time, or you could open a payment channel in advance, where you pre-approve a certain amount with the merchant, and get your change back from the merchant, after the payment is deducted (decentralized and no 3rd party). The last is a bit like opening a tab with a bar, and paying after the last purchase is made.
Add in strong ID verification, and some credit overhead, and you might even carry a balance with your payment provider, much like using a credit card today.
0-conf today isn't exactly broken, but it's a non-trivial risk, and not a very good way of doing business.

I prefer bitpay (also: competition is good), and doing bitcoin right requires showing a qr code with a totally vendor-agnostic bitcoin address. (Freedom!)
As for keeping track of taxes..  would be to check with your existimg POS&amp;accounting solutions if they support bitcoin (you could get a surprise, or be put on a mailing list ti be notified when they add in support. 
If you go for a stand-alone solution of accepting btc to a phone or tab, (we really need to come up with a nice web-based payment for retail that requires no extraneous hardware ).
For the amounts of money btc may bring in to begin with, I'd suggest treating it as a cash sale and to begin with so a mobile wallet payment and have a procedure of tallying and adding to the books ny hand, and then spring money for a pro solution once you clear the doubts that it'll be well worth the money&amp;time to make the effort.
Not familiar with what would be the best solution, but a professional pos provider that supports btc would be my guess.

Most wallet software can send dollar amounts listed on the reciept, so the only thing that would be needed is a pool of recieving addresses, and a way to check those for incoming payments, and then mark as paid by cash (currency BTC) in the POS software. Weak, but not impossible integration with existing systems. Actually. Making a separate printer that prints an unique wallet address, and terms of payment directly on a slip of thermo paper would actually be incredibly easy.

Where is it? Have anyone else had access to hardware it's been stored or generated at? If the answer is yes, there *is* a possibility.

If it's a priority to get the network stronger, and help boost p2p pool rates, cloud mining is reasonable  (might not be *profitable*, but hey).
From what you say you don't want much hassle doing legwork of setting up a mining operation yourself. 
My suggestion would be to get a bit dated miner for next-to-nothing on ebay, set it up and dip your toes into actual mining. It's a reason people recommend that, if you're thinking about doing mining, running the operation will get you insight that'll will be useful for deciding to get a bigger rig.

You've looked into the cost structure of running an exchange? It's cheaper than running a credit card infrastructure unless there's some drastic changes. Interfacing with banks for fiat money will still not be free, but it's cheaper for the banks to do one local bank transfer, than moving a similar amount as a credit card payment.
Mainstreaming should bring the fees *down*, if anything. 
Compare 2-3% cc fees with 0.2% to 0.05% fees on kraken.com, and you should still be able do interface with banks, being about an order of magnitude cheaper than credit cards. that's a broad-based incentive(nobody likes throwing "free money" away) for doing bitcoins, and that's not including the time and money lost to buying credit card hardware, maintaining business relations with merchant service provider and handling chargebacks and fraud.
With bitcoin a payment is a payment, and the rest of the job is providing customer satisfaction.

It's important to remember that coins flowing through exchanges as well as merchant solutions (POS and accounting systems) will mature the system, and make it more ready for prime time. (technically speaking, and in people's eyes).
In addition you have the thing most people focus on;  actual merchants are exposed to the upside of offering bitcoin, hopefully offering it as a visible alternative, for other customers as well.

I'd like to have a rule that you should not have more than a day's pay on a phone as spending money. Anything more than a week's pay and you should at least consider backup, and more than one month of pay, and that stuff should be in cold storage.
I hope this works out for you, but consider this a learning experience.

Quickest way to find out what NS support and not of payment , is to *ask* them (google search came up empty, but it could possibly be right around the corner).
This has the added benefit of making bitcoin a priority of theirs to look into. As for your business.. I see bitpay supports 22 ecomnerce providers. Just for the exercise, look into the price, usability and other features of the other solitions than the one you currently use. You could come out head if lots of variables changed for the better, even if it's a lot of work.
Ask your current provider and bitpay first of all.

I would seriously consider editing away a bunch of text and stick to the hard-hitting points. Being a CEO, would give him a very keen interest in how botcoin can run your company in a better &amp; more efficient way.
No idea how your business is run, but setting up bitpay account and pseudo-accepting bitcoin (no guarantees much business comes from it, but wikipedia came around after about year and a half of seeing actual business happen, even if they did not totally buy into it at first).
Big points: 
- zero trusted intermediaries (get all the benefits of international money transfers and none of the drawbacks associated with traditional banking). This is huge and disruptive
- Extremely easy to set up and test actual market response. If you do it with bitpay, your boss gets to handle dollars in the back end, but he's been quick on the ball, supporting new technology. Getting with the times with minimal efforts is good, if this works for your area of business, you can go on using the added benefits of cash flow 2.0 as a competitive advantage, when the company is comfortable understanding the technology.
- ask employees wether they'd be interested in picking up bitcoin bonuses or salary supplements? If you want to put your money where your mouth is, tell him you're interested in getting this year's christmas bonus in btc at a 5% discount compared to rest of the team.
Any more bullet points and it can get messy.

Automating accounting &amp; internal cash flow may be more interesting in the long run for small-time merchants, than the Whole payment thing.

I'd suggest getting a sufficiently backed up and secure cold storage wallet. And then a separate account to get some spending coins on. If you're not familiar with the product,  it's hard to puy proper value on it.

Keeping an eye on this sub over time will answer most questions, but I'll pick a few. 
The value of bitcoin will be decided EVERY time a trade is done, and can be observed real-time at places like [bitcoinwisdom]( 
You put in a buy order for a number of coins, and then someone else has to put in a matching order selling the same amount of coins. This is a trade. What changes the price point People are willing pay for bitcoin over time is a great mystery, and most people are trying to understand that, at all times. [r/bitcoinmarkets]( could be useful for for price discussion.
Adoption and transaction count seems to be rising all the time, but not at a terribly steep pace atm... (implementation and customer adoption takes time).
Investing in bitcoin is tricky. I'd say a necessary step should be to try to read the Bitcoin whitepaper (a bitcoin rite of passage), and from that, do a qualified guess on the potential of this idea.. buying coins to hold over some time seems to be favored over short-term trading (entertaining, but a pretty good way to lose money).
Unless you want to time the market, I'd say dollar cost averaging (buying a fixed amount every x days), is something that will get your money into bitcoin safely, with the highest probability of success.. Mind you, selling at 550 and buying at 495, will be the same Growth as the [DJIA]( have experienced since May '13..
Tipping, I've got only doge on me right now, but it's pretty neat to be able to just reach out, and touch someone, by firing off a tip, and the other person recieving access to the funds, instantly. Pretty gratifying add-on to social platforms, like reddit, and my guess, it's been getting popular due to lack of real-life places to otherwise use the coins. The easiest way to get familiar with this, is seeing &amp; believing:  +5000 doge
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:15:57
You have people sign up to get the device, (or sign up to enable capability in a already-bought-device). Now, if you now are convinced bitcoins have utility and value? Are you going to sign up with another service, or do you want to just send money to someone you've already signed up with?
Step 3, in which chip manufacturers are adding their cirquits for free, means 21inc will pay zero electricity and zero per device produced, but I'm guessing the real money isn't in the mining.

I feel like the key to understand crypto security, are understanding adresses and private keys.
Throw a dice 60 times it's practically impossible to guess the resulting string of numbers before the sun is cold and lifeless.. This is the foundation and the thing people trust. Math and math alone.  
It also explains the decentralized nature of it. All you need are 256-bits of decent randomness. No ID, no opening hours, or branch office you have to stop by. Everyone's invited.
This is the fundamentals to grasp. All the technicalities of the bitcoin network are just a clever design to incentivize donation of the technical resources the network have been launched on. No governments, corporate owners or anything shady.
Once people get their head around the facts of how it operates, do a quick mention on how how using a private key to authorize a transaction before the network can confirm it,  and then a quick recap on price movement during the timespan the court's concerned with.. 
This is the Moolah case, isn't it?

Keeping money on an exchange is risky. Audits to prove the funds are there remove one risk factor.
Making a seal of approval, that indicates that the exchange DOES audit stuff easier for the end-user to make informed decisions, and provide competitive edge for exchanges doing things right.

You're pretty much right, but until you get a microtransaction sidechain up&amp;running it's a better solution than 0-feeing bitcoin transactions. There's been a lot of thought put into current fee structure and just wishing fo the standard fee to be lowered, for general purposes won't change a thing.

The learning experience will get you very familiar with bitcoin, and as such should have real value to you, down the road. As for hobby-level mining, get something used for less than $100, and toy around. Resell after use and it should be reasonably priced self-education.

Love your project, still. 
Just thinking a bit..
Is it possible to do some sort of proof-of-purchase? I'm all for covering your costs (and even encourage tipping to make it worth your time over the long haul). Making people feel good about what the money they gift are being spent at will most likely quench scepticism, and increase money donated.
Stats! How about running a lifetime stats thing? X days of full nodes provisioned, lifetime achievement. If people feel like they nudge a number that are being permanently recored, the right way, they're more likely to contribute. 
More stats/reminders! How about recording a bunch of stats off a node before it's powered down? X requests, y gb of data, z data about geographic and temporal dispersion of the traffic. Nothing fancy (there exist nodes with special purpose diagnostic features, but leave that for later. Then, if people opt for getting that statistic, send them a nice summary of how much their contribution have helped the network during the 30 days their node's been active. If you set up this, consider sending a thanks for pitching in e-mail when the node they "paid for", are getting spun up(for people donating less than $1 it's nice to see proof their bits are put to work. Maybe recurring contributions will get a little boost from that. High scores are also a possibility, but may require moderation. (Too much effort)
Consider adding more resources about full nodes over time (content based marketing, may drive traffic outside of reddit mentons, or paid advertisement).
Speaking of which. How about setting up a similar donatebutton for paid reddit ads. "Next ad wil be live in x bits." Actually funding reddit whilst spreading awareness (long haul) would be an easy sell. Ask reddit about paying for ads with bitpay/coinbase.
Consider selling coinbase/bitpay an ad, in the form of x full node months?
Linode or digitalocean takes bitcoin yet? Ask them if they care to give a sweetheart deal. "Every third or fourth month activates a free bonus month" they make less money, but support the idea. Every x purchases free logic causes people to be a bit more loyal, and entices spending if it's close to achieving a "bonus month". Evem if they're donating stuff.

If the key is deposited somewhere safe, you can the bitcoin network to move funds, at once when you broadcast a transaction, ownership of those funds follow that key, and is absolute.

Make one that keep pulling a fee for 36 months for $49, and one that keep sending you the same fee until infinity that you sell for $19?

Changetip for wikipedia? Start a balance, and give 1/10 cent to Wikimedia per page visited. They get funds transferred every hour, from people donating, and whenever you like, you can have your remaining balance returned, no risk of losing money (proof of reserve and all that).

Think of your private key as a car key. You have to use the key to sign a transaction, to be able to start the car, to drive it to another parking spot (address). 
The problem is that your car moves at the speed of light, and the private key is like a very long PIN code. If the bad guys have access to that key, your car will stay, for only as long as it takes the bad guys to punch that pin code and drive off to a new address (10 minutes, tops).
This means, online wallets are only as safe as their competency in keeping hackers at bay, and the level of trustworthiness of those running it. The good thing is, you can choose to generate a fresh address (with its own secret key), do this on a secure computer (or dedicated hardware), and you should be golden.
"If you do not control the keys yourself, the coins really aren't yours." is a saying with some degree of truth to it.

If you do not have a wallet (yet), offering a pay-through service to top up parking balance with a legacy means of payment.

Unless you're in an extreme hurry, don't do that. Pull the coins off the exchange, and to a (backed up) mobile wallet.
The workflow will then be somerhing like 
1. Have funds on mobile wallet. 
2. Scan the qr code.
3. Press 'send' on the wallet app.
4. There is no step 4. 
If anything should go pear-shaped with the payment, or BitPay should otherwise choose to return the funds, they will show up at a wallet you control, and YOU know where the funds come from. If Bitpay should return coins to an exchange's wallet, your work is just getting started. 
Don't use the online wallet like that.

Same thing with crypto. It's early on and it's trustless so interacting with shitty exchanges and leaving big funds there is *at the moment* a gamble.

And when bitcoin goes 10x once more? A very simple rule is to never discuss specific NUMBERS about your own coins, ever. Talk percentages and gains of the coins, but before you know it, that christmas bonus of a measly 1k coins back in 2012 isn't too small to be safe to share with anyone. Never discuss specific numbers like owned coins, gains or how long you've been into the coin.

I paid $2.000 for the priviglege of accepting money last year and I hardly even DO business, thing is, unless there's a very very unlikely improvement in the services normal banking provides there's a very real market for just that, improving on regular banking services.
This, combined with the hype cycles of bitcoin (you see them as repeated tulip cycles on the historic price graph), means that last time bitcoin hit the very unrealistic price of $20k it was a very different product, due to the very tangible technical improvements that habe happened in the down period since.

@_date: 2015-07-06 04:33:39
Focus on the functional parts of it, and not so much the theory. You're focussed on everyday bitcoin use, and not blockchain 101, right?
If anything, compare it to another utility they know, already. Electric grid; everybody's hooked up to the same network, but are producing electric power in thousands of different places. This means that *nobody can tell the network what to do*, without taking down the whole network (and by now the track record begins to look pretty solid. You own your own money, and nobody can tell you any different.
Now; for transactions this is the part they get to deal with on a regular basis. First you need to use protection, and be somewhat safe. Phone wallet is good for small change, live CD-booted paper wallet or Trezor-made wallet seed is good enough for long-term savings. Make sure they understand and respect safety basics, much like gun safety. (Don't show your private key to someone you're not prepared to give all of your money, Don't have a big wallet with no backup unless you can bear having a ferrari in your driveway, but no key etc.).
Have them understand what a wallet, and a bitcoin address is, and how you first make the address available for the paying customer, then wait for him to broadcast the payment to the payment utility network (and then wait for the bitcoin payment cogs to turn), usually 10 minutes wait, but in situations much like an electric grid brown-out (remember this is a complex technology and getting very popular, much like electricity in India), you could experience wait times up to a couple of hours. Mention the thing about fees, and how to understand a blockchain example of a transaction. At this point in time you should show them what it looks like to move a dollar from address A, to address B, and point out what an insufficient fee looks like.
Consider recommending Mycelium wallet for their 0 confirmation "probability that the transaction is OK" indicator.

No idea why people don't understand your question, might be night in some time zones... But yeah, your hunch is right. Accepting 100% bitcoin should still work like a charm. You don't even need to go through the hassle of getting a verified merchant account if it is a regular customer, and all you need is money transferred, but creating, and then getting an invoice paid through BitPay is a bit more official (merchant cannot deny recieving funds) than using pure blockchain.

What Bitcoin doesn't do: 
1. Capacity. Bitcoin doesn't solve that currently. See also: Lightning network (it's beautiful). For now, it is plenty of room for OP's business connection in Greece to shoot one, or thousands of transactions back and forth. Just don't expect them to clear the same block.
2. Widespread availability. Paypal operates in more local currencies than BitPay. OP seemed to either have customers with funds or easy access to funds(anywhere with functioning SEPA access), and a Greek business perfectly prepared to accept bitcoin as payment due to bank run on the local fiat currency.
3. 100% integration. Most business systems are not supporting bitcoin natively, just yet. Euro are better supported, but somehow no longer available locally. 
What bitcoin CAN do: 
1. Permissionless signup. Try to sign up all employees to Paypal accounts with no bank account. Also, funds CAN be seized or frozen if for some reason something "undesirable" happens in vincinity of the money. Bitcoin does not need permission, but entropy to make sure that all parts to a transaction are able to accept, AND safely keep their money. No frozen funds, beyond the occasional soft-fork.
2. Pimping. The first sign a nation is giving up on itself in desperation is selling off it's women. Expect a desperste wave of cam-working women with zero Euros, but pretty immediate need for material goods and services obtainable with cash. Breaking terms of agreement(adult services) can result in a freeze of Paypal funds. The only thing you can do witg bitcoin is broadcasting an invalid transction, that the miners won't accept, but otherwise it's game on.
3. Easy conversion back and forth between currencies. If for some reason you NEED cash, people are going to be reluctant to trade cold hard euros with Paypal promises (think fraud allegations and reverted payments after a trade). Bitcoin is as liquid as the nearest buyer, and in Greece the conditions on the ground should be higly favorable for this.


I'm not, and I'm not. The main topic here was OP asking a question, and getting a good answer. Did not realize I stepped on the troll-tail of a highly respected member of the diverse community that is r/bitcoin. I would have rephrased some of what I've answered earlier, but the message remains.
Since we're on the topic of sidestepping hard questions; care to share more information on how Paypal is better suited than Bitcoin for OP's use case? If all you argue is that Bitcoin is equally useless, I'll give you a nod of agreement, but I'll tell you that you're wrong and to tell me otherwise you're welcome to explain it, instead of attacking ideas that do not perfectly match your own.

Hmm.. still.. it's a bit weird. Checked out your site, and it's pretty slick with transitions. The only thing i was thinking, is that "other payments" should maybe have been below the credit card input field. Also. The bitcoin accepted here button looks a bit out of place. It's also of no use in dragging people in, since this is at the absolute last stage of the ordering process.. (Tiny logo in the footer might advertise bitcoin option to highly interested individuals).
Consider swapping the button with a green button similar to the 'return to cc payment' button, or do a "give me additional payment options" button, adding one more option per click. This should keep people from feeling crowded while presenting options in order of popularity, plus, you get additional data, figuring out what happens in the customers heads.. 
Figuring this out would be a seriously big deal for bitcoin going forward, and a might interesting read, now that you got me curious..

I'm totally from overseas, so I won't personally shop with you guys, but implement the payment options, and it's at practically no cost a nice way to eke out extra percentage points of revenue from a new class of customers.

Now you can buy the promise of one bitcoin from a trusted third party in a regulated environment. 
It is welcome to the party for the financial world's most conservative operations (i.e. most of them).
This availability, in addition to news like [this]( leave a lot of people exited for bitcoin's "safe haven potential" as an investment. 
The general idea is that once this gets rolling there's going to be a spike in price, and an increased respect from legacy financial institutions.

No. It's called VAT prepayment fee, I'm guessing they have *SOME* losses and some cost of administering the invoice, but it's insanely overpriced servicr provided to a captive audience...
All you need for this to work is a government portal to verify if a tracking # have VAT prepaid, that the shipping companies query, before making that invoice, and the customers should show up by themselves.
A competing service, would experience zero fraud risk with bitcoin as a payment option.

Dude. I feel the need to point out that as a longtime customer of bter, they have never delivered anything less than a reliable service. Even when getting hacked. No access to my coins for a couple of weeks while they do a re-evaluation, that sucks but are not worse than comparable exchanges, but smoothly able to withdraw my money less than 5 minutes after reading this post.
If you want to claim this is a shady operation, please cite sources, because the allegations you level, are serious, and need serious proof. Your brand of all-out attack can easily be confused with something a lesser competitor of bter would write, to capitalize on them being in a tough spot, risking further harm to them and their customers.

Pay first deliver later = free money for the business! In addition it's possible to take some positions in volatility with this money, and earn a percent or more over 5 days.. Look up 'negative float'.

Not the VAT, but the VAT prepayment surcharge. 
I order and pay for goods. Anything less than ~$50 is VAT exempt. The item is then shipped from wherever, often with free shipping from the vendor. When the item has crossed the final set of borders, then UPS in this example calculate how much VAT is due on this item, and pays up to the correct government agency bank account. 
Then, after a couple of weeks, I get an invoice with the VAT amount, AND the $19 fee, for the privilege of having UPS paying the VAT for me. This must be the most expensive money transfer in the world. Paying $19 on as little as $10 of VAT

Also. Go ahead and get paranoid about security right away.
If you talked to someone back in the day that you had a couple of thousand btc when they were worth &lt;$1, no big deal. But as the value up, that information could very well become dangerous in the wrong hands.
Never discuss numbers or specific security routines. Plan on buying and staying long term. Have a plan for when you want to rebalance your portfolio and how you want to track value for taxes. 
Most important, get your hands ona small amount of coin so you have a decent motivation to get through with the reading and into it before we hit another ATH and the media frenzy make you buy low and sell high. 
There's a lot to be said for dollar cost averaging as well. Less entertaining but not as big chance of shrinking your stake as the value swings.

It's a pretty long list and most of them are one hit wonders with one or more problems and an early price spike that later runs out of steam as the hype dies down. 
If you absolutely, positively have to diversify, consider picking ones that share a lot of the traits of with bitcoin in having a fair launch (litecoin &amp; doge) or has some sort of technical feature that you understand and deliberately want (Proof of Stake, possibly). But then again this is r/bitcoin so the short answer is learn up all you need on bitcoin first, and *then* see if you feel the need for other coins.

Also; it's pretty neat when selling second-hand stuff..  it's kind of reverse endowment effect. You have an item you want to get rid of. Giving $40 off feels like less of an forsakement, than actually paying $40 extra for something  new, even if the end result is the same.
I.E., it's easier to give a rebate, on something you want to get rid off, than it is to flat out giving away money, even if the net effect is the same.
