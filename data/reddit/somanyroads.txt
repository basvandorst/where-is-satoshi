So they bought the company that made AoE 1, 2, 3 and Age of Mythology (Ensemble Studios), killed that company off (after they made AoE 3, which was a very beautiful-looking game), and now want to make a sequel over a decade later, with a different developer? We'll see about that...feels like RTS games are out of vogue, but maybe not?

Most people simply don't know what open-source means...I was pushing over a decade ago for Linux adoption. The best we could get was Android, but most users have no clue that it's just a front-end for a Linux mobile device. It's a damn shame: they say we need better education in the US, but the system doesn't change to fit the needs of a 21st century life. People are ignorant about so many aspects of technology, yet increasing are reliant on it. It's a recipe for disaster...and rampant exploitation from those "in the know" against those who are ignorant (even willfully so)

Lol...are you me? I had a dream 2-3 days about GDAX hovering back near 19k-20k again. I'm looking forward to that dream being realized this year, and soon :-) this is the year that cryptos will begin the full "early adopter" process. The end of the beginning. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:27:24
Trust? Have you met any of them? It's not truth if you don't have evidence to back up that truth...it's just faith. I have trust that the hundreds of billions of dollars of investor's money will continue to be properly capitalized: that means proper innovation on the block chain to make it WORK. Right now, it's barely working, and most transactions under 100 sat/byte (which should be more than enough for a reasonable transaction) are going nowhere, continuously.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:13:58
The last month has been one of BTC's most stable in a few years, I would wager (hovered between 13k and 19k for the last month, on GDAX open/closes for each day). Odd stuff...the volatility hasn't been the problem, it's been transaction fees, but a large company like Microsoft shouldn't have any problems grouping orders together into 1, large blockchain transaction.

"Past performance is no guarantee of future results"
The market is constantly changing. More money will continue to pour into cryptos this year, more than ever before. How much of that goes directly into BTC is a total mystery. I was expecting 20k once the derivative exchanges went up in December, but the blockchain has been stalling on capitalization for most of the past month. No boom/bust, just stagnation. BTC has been through this before, however, it's just a question of when/how we pull out of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:02:18
Looking over today, I'm simply getting the impression it's simply not a very bright group (or they're intellectually crippled by political tribalism, which is common). LN is going to be amazing, and be a crucial evolutionary step for cryptos in general. This will help connect the entire ecosystem together, and reduce the need of exchanges to work between currencies. Very good stuff. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:02:27
Not sure why you're downvoted: the crypto market tends to rise together, from what I've seen. Sure, each crypto moves along its own rhythms, but looking over the past year, most have appreciated in value since the beginning of 2017. You can make bad investments in crypto in the short (even medium) term, but in the long run (barring major scandals or outright fraud), the entire market will likely increase in value. "A high tide lifts all boats", even poorly-built ones ;-). 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:42:10
Are you having fun making a bunch of pointless, troll comments? You are adding nothing of value to the cryto ecosphere: you think you're so smart (I read your earlier comments: most long-term BTC hodlers have been in the game longer than either the length of your reddit account OR your initial investments of Ethereum, which has been a late-comer in comparison to BTC), but you don't care to grasp the entire picture. You'd rather just beat your drum for "anti-BTC" (whatever that is). Tiresome, no wonder these comments are usually deleted.

Well that doesn't make a damn bit of sense...because bitcoin has sat for many years without much movement. If there was some "grand conspiracy" (which is almost always bogus, anyhow), we would have seen a lot more action in the first year. The fact is, bitcoin simply wasn't traded in any meaningful way in 2009...it was just a bit of code on the internet. Nobody was predicting it would take over the world (except, perhaps, Hal Finney).

The twitter handle has been mixing it up: I see memes directly from on there, and a lot of equivocation too ("whether BTC or BCH...") and also some rather bland statements about cryptos in general. Not so great, but that's the consequence of a lack of regulation: nobody control the bitcoin brand, so anyone can speak about it, and propagandize freely.
I will say, however, that this one stings:
My hope for cryptos continues to be that it will free people across the world from having to interact with corrupted actors (particularly those of corrupt governments). BTC simply cannot meet that challenge in this moment, and that's very sad. It doesn't kill adoption, but it most certainly slows it down...we have to get a grip on fees, this year. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:08:44
P2P exchanges for general trading, coinbase or another centralized exchange to cash-out altcoins, back into bitcoin. Easy. Just don't keep them stored on any exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:54:33
Bitcoin has never been totally anonymous...and that wasn't a big selling point (except for early on, when it certainly beat most non-cash methods online for privacy). Still, none of us wants to see BTC get centralized, in any meaningful way. Keep up the fight, OP :-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:25:18
You're just regurgitating BitchCoin's (BCH) propoganda...have any points of your own creation? Number of dev teams doesn't mean jack shit as long as there's consensus on the block chain. In fact, too many devs will likely lead to more hard forks.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:42:59
And coming from Vitalik, it's pretty ironic: Ethereum appears to scale just fine. If you're going to diversify, ETH is a good start. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:39:00
Segwit was a "soft fork" in that it allowed the existing system to continue, with or without Segwit. Directly changing the blocksize will require a hard fork, which means consensus will be needed to avoid another split of BTC. It will likely happen, either way, it's just a question of how many people jump on board.

@_date: 2018-01-09 13:51:21


Good lord...nobody knows how bitcoin works. That continues to be a roadblock: lack of education on cryptos. Lack of miners doesn't negatively affect the price of bitcoin: it's the lack of buyers (and and an abundance of sellers) which slows down adoption of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:37:32
I think we have more than enough consensus at this point to move from 1MB up to 4MB. It's just a matter of someone starting the fork. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:31:48
That being said, it's pretty damn easy to hit that block size limit when the system can only run 3 transactions or so every few seconds. Trying to fit an entire world's transactional needs into 1MB block size (smaller than a 3.5 inch floppy...if anyone still remembers those things), every 10 minutes, is clearly not sustainable. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:28:27
I think there would be a lot more people wanting to get into the game...even a small block size increase would likely be a big boost to the ecosystem at this point. It can wait, as long as LN is released in a timely manner (i.e. before the end of this coming summer). Otherwise, expect investors to move on...Bitcoin's brand can only hold appeal for so long, before it gets tarred with the "dinosaur" label. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:07:48
Simply that Bitcoin Cash is an attempt at stealing the Bitcoin brand. It's like a private actor attempting to seize a companies board of directors through a stock takeover. It's ruthless and uncivil, regardless of the politics. This system exists through consensus: Roger is the antithesis of that, along with his shitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:42:02
BTC would need a pretty large increase to deal with the congestion we have right now, like 4x or 8x bigger. Off-chain solutions will be better, in the long run, but development has been very slow, considering how much buzz there is in the financial industry over cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:15:44


Alright mods, this is getting rediculous: I've been a reddit user for 6 years and this is utter nonsense. The option is GONE. I just logged into my Microsoft account (which I never use, except with my xbox 360), and there is NO option for bitcoin, in any way. The screenshot circulating of the current screen is accurate.

I can't imagine why miners wouldn't want to clear as many transactions as possible: there's a lot of money being left in the mempool right now, in fees. Sure, they're getting the highest-value transactions, but I'm sure there's plenty of OCD miners who are frustrated by the endlessly-unconfirmed swarm of data...it's been stuck for over a month now.

@_date: 2018-01-09 13:29:19
It was always a mistake to emphasize block size over other innovations (like off-chain scaling, which is most certainly the future-proofing method). It was ALWAYS going to be a mix of block size increases and off-chain scaling, it's just a question of how/when. BCH jumped the gun, and over-emphasizes block size. That's the fundamental disagreement. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:30:35
The BCH crowd have been fools for trying to undermine BTC...if BTC crashes, it will take BCH with it. The technology is the same: it will cast doubt on the fungibility of both coins if the elephant falls before the donkey (BTC vs. BCH). Stupid game, @_date: 2018-01-04 17:57:13
That's all that Bcash has ever been: an attempt at diluting then finally taking over the bitcoin brand. It will fail. Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Core, and it's not Bitcoin cash. BTC is bitcoin...bitcoin is BTC. It's a currency that is primarily used as a store of value, for now. It will mature in time. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:21:31
Blockstream clearly feels comfortable playing the long game...but I don't think this PR and nobody who is hodling should. Microsoft dropping support just looks bad, and whether it makes you conspiratorial or not (Bill Gates was touting Bitcoin not that long ago...why is his company sinking it now, all of a sudden?), it's not a pretty picture. Not a wonderful start of the year for bitcoin, but it's flown very high over the last year. Now, we're dealing with some serious gridlock, and we need solutions this year, in the first half of the year, at that.

...and then they find out that bitcoin is the original, and that it has risen and fallen many times, and still has "risen again". I'm comfortable standing behind BTC and bitcoin :-) but I can no longer say "you can use it just like paypal", because that's obviously not true with the mempool endlessly flooded with transactions that the blockchain is unable to process, while 5 sat/byte transactions fall off the radar completely. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:41:40


And that's exactly what happened with bcash: enough users of BTC became convinced that the block size the end-all, be-all of scaling, and now we have a divided community. One thing I've learned about humans, over time: we endlessly want to divide. It's deeply biological.

No BTC is exchanged: futures use cash, fiat. Expect investors to put money in directly to hedge their bets. It's going to get big, fast, unless the volatility throws futures out of whack (they stop taking bets when Bitcoin moves 7% up or down in 24 hours...which happens regularly so far) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:09
Yep...you're right. Obviously, the people within Coinbase were aware of the intro much sooner than outside investors. Then again, they are more regulated than any previous BTC exchanges...I wouldn't make such a claim without any evidence. Hopefully the regulators responsible for watching over these exchanges is keeping an eye on investments within these companies.

I see you being an unknowledgable idiot, yes. Try studying the technology on a neutral platform, not just the biased crap that spews out. Intermediaries in the LN DO NOT CONTROL THE VALUE TRANSFERRED. All they can do is act as a blind intermediary, and receive a tiny part of the exchange in "node fees". If the fees get too high, other nodes will form to compete. It's not the same fee system as mining.

Meh...some competition is good, it gives the whole market a better edge, and pushes coins to improve themselves more to stay strong (and invested into).

There's always enough miners...the difficulty of "solving" blocks adjusts based on how long previous blocks take to process. It averages to around 10 minutes per block, regardless of the amount of hashing power (subject to a delay).

It's popular and well-regulated. That means it's heavily centralized, which goes against the idea behind Bitcoin tech, yet exchanges are almost inevitably centralized (someone has to have plenty of liquidity to process buys/sells instantly). Its a general distrust in centralized actors. 
Also, Coinbase was one of the exchanges that supported the Segwit2x "fork", which attempted to seize control of the blockchain for BTC (and utterly failed, both technically and politically). I would trust them as much as I can buy/sell bitcoin and move it to my own (privately owned) wallets.

He just said..."from the inside". That would include scaling issues, if they affect the market's ability to buy effectively. Sure, for now small buyers are shut out, but these fees will continue to not bother large traders. Of course, that also means they will, in turn, have a greater incentive to spread the technology further...which willl require scaling. At some point: the pressure will be there, it's just not as present as the whiners over at thick it is. The perception of failure is overwrought, at best, and propaganda and FUD at its worst.

He's definitely right: I suspect almost nobody in this subreddit understands the cryptography that goes into bitcoin security. And that just one of the dozen concepts that makes up the bitcoin blockchain network.

Yeah...I wouldn't go that far personally (i've been involved in bitcoin too long to project its going out of orbit, out of the solar system...in 3 years), but some of their theory is strong: all it takes is major hedge funds and retirement savings accounts to put a small % (less than 5) of their portfolio into bitcoin.

I think people coming into bitcoin today just don't realize how much of an unknown the tech was 5 years ago...it was mainly for anonymous transactions over the internet (over the tor network). It's utility was very narrow at the time, and thus the userbase had a pretty narrow dialog (look back in this forum 5 years ago: it's mostly about tor transactions and whatnot, very few memes lol).

The problem is people view Bitcoin incorrectly. Its not a stock: its the core foundation that various infrastructure will plug into. It can't be a bubble because it's not a conventional asset: its a platform  for a whole new class of assets (digital storage of value).

Crytos are still largely unregulated, and I think Japan (where Ver is located) has been pretty hands-off, and encouraging bitcoin adoption. He's likely in legally safe waters...but we're all free to dream about Ver behind bars. There's a lot of people on Wall Street that also should be behind bars, but apparently when you work with enough money, all the time, you become immune to prosecution (unless you steal from rich people, like Madoff did).

Haha...how many more musicians and actors have to blow their brains out before you realize that's almost certainly not true? Money alone doesn't create wealth: it's an attitude.

Yeah, looking the breakdown you get when hovering over the graph, I can see that 5+ sat/byte (there's no breakdown for 0-5, that I can see) is getting 1,000 or 2,000 txs knocked down every block or so. Just seems like 0-10 has been growing more recently, compared to early last month. 
Edit: I'm parading my ignorance of the details of bitcoin here, but I think what I'm trying to get at is how come there exists ANY transactions that NEVER get confirmed? Why aren't (or can't) full nodes (no mining) verifying these transactions in a less timely (but more than "never") manner?

At this point if you invested a month ago, the value would have to drop by 60%, just to get back to parity, much less going down to 1/5th of that already-tanked value. And of course...when do you "sell high"?. Drops are impossible to predict with bitcoin, short of major exchanges closing (for now).

Well that was retarded...napkin math, posted like a researched article. Bitcoin is not scaling in the manner the author described at all: the base layer will be leveraged via the lightning network (and other second, third layer solutions) and small block size increases. Also when Bitcoin "goes big", it will not be with current hardware, technology, and (most importantly) paradigms. Its a whole new world, that will supplant current roadblocks. It will do this or it will fall flat on its face as a store of value.

This does not compute...have we forgotten the last decade already? We just went through the largest housing bubble in U.S. history, less than 10 years ago. Have you forgotten? In the short term, it's pretty obvious bitcoin is in a bubble: it totally lacks the infrastructure to transact small units of value (like buying a few items in a grocery store) without paying disproportionate fees. The value in bitcoin is more theoretical and "in the future" for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:57:31


This is not true at all, and in fact LN will rely on gradual increases in block size in order to allow layer 2 and 3 solutions to continue to scale, as well. Its the difference between 1.5-3 MB blocks vs 8-20MB...the later will take a lot of full nodes out of commission, the former allows the building of a huge amount of cheap infrastructure for the bitcoin network. If LN works well, it will greatly improve the value of the blockchain.

One point he did have that was fair: supply of bitcoin is INCREDIBLY limited, and that is frustrating for people trying to invest a lot. It's very easy to move the market if you're coming in with hedge funds that have billions of dollars at stake. We'll never have 21 million bitcoins...1/4 of those are probably gone forever, already. For a currancy, that's a rediculously low amount of units, it's clear that bitcoin has to move beyond the "BTC" large coin measurement, into mBTC and even satoshis (which is tricky, since its  nomenclature is so far removed from "BTC")

Coinbase treats transfers out of one's wallet (regardless of destination) off the platform as a cash-out. Thus, taxable. However, if you are buying on the platform and moving it off immediately, there shouldn't be enough capital gains difference to trigger any additional taxes (beyond what you already paid on the original income). That will depend on your annual income before bitcoin gains...good time to research this stuff!
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:58
It's funny to have American analysts talk about this stuff, because it really does speak to a very large phenomenon we can't fully understand yet: the introduction of an international exchange of value. And it's not happening in the West...this is primarily a phenomenon in Korea and Japan. We're seeing the West get outpaced on this front HARD. I'm just glad to be slightly more aware of it than the average American...but hardly much more informed than probably the average bitcoin user in Hong Kong.

True, but there's nothing to stop bitcoin from going to 1 million, 5 million or even 10 million per coin. If bitcoin becomes the dominant store of value online (over 50% adoption globally), going to the moon will be a quaint memory: we're out of the solar system at that point.

The buyers and sellers own bitcoin, along with the network itself (the system that transact the value). Neither miners nor programmers own the network...users of the network decide the value.

What is normal about an asset increasing by millions of percent in 5-6 years, without any correction to it's 'true' value (which is largely a mystery)? Bitcoin isn't business as usual, get use to it.

CNBC rarely gets its facts straight...it's Ms. Woods who has it correct. Good luck getting the dummies who actually are achoring the programs on that network to figure it out. Yes, being a deflationary currancy, on its face (and being limited to 21m coins) will make any crypto with that description hard, if not impossible, to use for any sort of low-range transations, in the long run. The system simply can't scale to the level of VISA...it wasn't designed to do that, ever. Off-chain solutions can improve the process, but the 21m limit will still rear its head, in time. A national (or global) currency, will need to inflate gradually over time to be an effective transactional currency.

Seriously folks...if you're going to recommend Coinbase to grandma, give them your phone number instead of Coinbase's (not that they have one, that I know of).

@_date: 2017-12-06 09:38:18
Coinbase records it as a sale, that's why you move it off the exchanges quickly after buying, so that the value between when you bought and then "cashed out" (to another bitcoin wallet) will be minimal. After that, once it's in a privately- held wallet, it's your responsibility to report any capital gains on your bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-05 12:35:49
It's much deeper than that with bitcoin...it's not just about being peer-to-peer. Bitcoin is also a deflationary currency, which is the opposite of how all national currencies work. Bitcoin increases in value per coin...fiat loses value, slowly (or more quickly, in the case of a less stable government). And of course, the government decides how much money is needed, which means they have a lot of control over the base-level of the economy, a long with central banks. So it ends up being an issue of control more than anything else.
Nevertheless, there will be bitcoin services that act like banks in "securing" your coins. There are always people willing to sacrifice privacy for security.

And they will do it better, and faster than the lightning network can hope to do...so whats the game plan, here? If centralized money can get those transactions times down to the same speed as bitcoin, why would people bother moving over to cryptos? People don't care about the politics...they want to transfer value quickly, and they want that value to hold (or possibly improve somewhat over time).

The number of accounts matter less than the liquidity in the exchange. Coinbase can't function without liquidity from GDAX...if people with plenty of liquidity leave Coinbase, the exchange is fucked. Don't think so small...if enough hodlers move on (and we probably should...we owe NOTHING to any exchange, they are simply a medium to trade between fiat and crypto, nothing more), the exchange will collapse.

It's just the world robbing the fake money that nations have been creating for decades...you'd be surprised how much value can be pulled from a system that is mostly printing money in an automated fashion (thanks to workers being cut out of productivity gains since the 1970s).

Bullshit: of course it counts. Investors have to put heat on these providers to actually provide for their customers. Paying massive fees to move coins from a custodial wallet (such as those found on exchanges) to a private wallet (such as those found with a hardware wallet solution, or desktop storage software) should be enough of an outrage to make it happen. The fact that it isn't happening only speaks to how new and young this market really is: there's not enough angry, middle aged housewives grinding Coinbase's telephone lines to a halt, bitching about their money being tied up on "this blockchain thing" for hours, or days, at a time. It will come in time...we're just not there yet.

Only put in what you can afford to lose. Investing early last month, it's pretty crazy right now (the price has doubled, from 7k). Don't go nuts...make small investments to start, don't plan to see/use that money for awhile.

See, this pisses me off. We're all in a bit of a dour mood right now (with LN having no release date, which is very frustrating), but you have zero evidence that the 1MB blocksize is "killing the coin". Serious...not a fucking shred. There is NO other way to measure the success of a coin other than its value: value implies adoption rate, that's how deflationary, network-effect-enabled currencies work. What possible evidence could you think you have that bitcoin is being killed by 1MB block sizes? What size would clear the blockchain of unprocessed transactions, over a 24 hour period? How long would that last, before it was full again? Why should we allow the system to become centralized at a time when it's most vulnerable? (i.e. when governments and Wall Streets are just taking serious notice).

Absolutely: do not divest, OP: take out student loans, even if they have to be unsubsidized (i.e. you pay the interest accumulated while in college, rather than the government does with subsidized). It is a MUCH better method of financing higher education than eliminating your long-term investment in bitcoin. Bitcoin will continue to grow in value, while college loans do the opposite (they tend to fall in "value" i.e. the inflation-adjusted cost declines). Time is on your side with bitcoin...and with the usage of student loans. Do not hesitate to pay for your college education with scholarships, grants, and even loans. Just make sure you get them subsidized, if you can, and also direct (i.e. from government lending services, rather than private lenders, which will charge higher interests rates).

I would expect volatility would have to decrease significantly before Bitcoin was used as a common, everyday transactional currency. Also, we need a scaling solution that allows for that many transactions (similar to the number that visa processes everyday) to be processed quickly and cheaply.

Just because he was wrong on the price, doesn't mean it's total FUD: blocks are full (they were not so full early last year, he was exaggerating). Fees are too high and confirmation times for reasonable fee (less than 5 bucks) is also too high for quick payments. LN will help alleviate this process but fees still have to come down: super hubs will come quick because most people won't want to release a LN channel if they have to pay 20 dollars to do so.

Frankly, it smacks of laziness to me: those same companies that wanted to blow up the block size (such as coinbase) via NYA have failed to implement Segwit in the first place. They want the block chain to do the work for them, and simply take on larger and larger blocks, thereby eliminating more and more nodes from the confirmation process. No nodes, no decentralization, and eventually no anti-censorship (doesn't matter much about the blockchain itself being censorship-resistant if you can only "redeem" bitcoin through exchanges, heavily regulated).
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:49:19
But for now, it's good to have these other coins to move value around: when LTC struggles with the same problems as BTC has now with scaling, there will be another LiteCoin to replace LTC's current use. This is a rapidly developing ecosystem: nothing is set in stone.

I think you missed a detail there: the above comments were referencing the idea of manipulating the market to trigger your shorts on the futures exchanges. Futures, however, will hold no BTC: they are merely betting on how the market will move independently. To manipulate the price downward, you would need to create pressure to sell, ex. putting up a large sell wall that is well below current market price. As bitcoin's market cap increases, these manipulations will become less effective (even as they continue to grow in size).

The housing bubble was engineered by the government, wittingly or otherwise. Easy loans with lack of verification (since they're backed by a government that poorly regulated derivatives made from these loans) turns to poisonous CDOs. The government doesn't control the supply of bitcoin: it controls the loaning of fiat, as well as the production of it.

ETH and (yes...) BCH both are handling transactions efficiently and almost-instantly. When the pressure grows too great, expect money to move to cryptos such as those. BTC is lousy for low-level transactions right now, no denying that, but to pretend that's a dire problem for cryptos is just nonsense: this is a totally free market and there's plenty of other cryptos in the sea. I would transact with ethereum, if I needed to. Bitcoin is an investment for now...not for buying coffee or beans.

@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:09


Well...that's an off way to look at it. That just means they out priced you from being confirmed in the next block.

Have you ever heard of the "Eternal September" effect? That's what bitcoin is going to be like, from now until...the end of human history, now.
So, although I've been taking a similar angle as you (which is wearing thin...bitcoin is now up 66% from last month, and it was as low as 20-30% up a few hours ago), most people jumping in have far less than a year's experience with bitcoin (which is probably the average on this subreddit)...and less than a month. They don't "feel" the long term implications of cryptos, they just see the swings of the daily market, and it's scary as shit right now, from that perspective.

And yet ipv6 is still not widely used...2 decades after implementation. There are many ways to scale, and different cryptos will try different things. Without a doubt, bitcoin is not scaling at the moment: it's hit a hard limit and will continue to do so until we get larger blocks, off-chain transactions, and other scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:30:58

He's mainly referring to MtGox, which was the original (and for a long stretch of time, the only) exchange for Bitcoin. It was badly managed, hacked, and many users lost their bitcoins. They were likely stolen, and many people believe the owner has something to do with it.
Exchanges like Coinbase are more regulated and secured: I suspect less drama from newer exchanges on that front. Nevertheless: unless you own the private keys to your wallet (effectively the "key to the safety deposit box"), and have them secured offline ("cold storage"), your bitcoins always present a risk of "disappearing". This is an issue with decentralized, poorly-regulated markets: higher volatility, more "funny business". Be safe!

Yeah, I understand, at this point: the fees are reaching 20 bucks for fast transfers. That's just nuts...it's not reasonable to expect the average user to pay those kinds of fees for something they barely understand, has no physical backing (or the backing of "trusted sources" like government and central banking).
That being said, the infrastructure around bitcoin (especially the exchanges) have not done their part to help curb the traffic issues. Segwit has been ready for months, and is still not implemented: these companies that operate exchanges make money regardless of the block size, so they don't seem to have enough incentives to help improve the system.

@_date: 2017-12-14 10:34:57
As long as they recognize it's a gamble,  it an investment. You don't invest with massive debt: sure, get some leverage, but only what you can pay back in an emergency (i.e. if bitcoin goes to 0).

I want my computer to last a long time...I suspect mining would ruin it: quickly and for little profit. Why would I invest 3k into a totally new rig if I could just put that money into bitcoin directly? That's a very expensive space heater you are recommending, OP: the mining profits are in China, not in the West...our electricity isn't cheap enough at the residential level.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:13:53
I can ship packages for cheaper than I've had miners try to charge for moving bits across the internet, lately...let's not ignore the elephant in the room, folks. Fees are too damn high for transmitting small amounts of value across the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:48:58
Yeah, because interest in bitcoin continues to grow, much more than frustration over its slow speed. Its not like a letter taking a couple extra days to get sent to your home: there is no one to complain to right now about bitcoin troubles who actually can do much of anything about it (except the programmers of Blockstream)
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:48:44
The shit is really scary...and kinda overwhelms even revolutions like bitcoin. Are we even going to have minds to process the idea of crytocurrancies soon? If we're trapped in these "domamine-drip" systems, we won't have the time nor attention (thanks to the expectation of constant feedback, stimulation, and instant-gratification) to react to the world around us adequately. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:58:26

ETH is also down from 24 hours ago...so there's clearly some nonsense going on. ETH is great, like you said, and the tech is certainly better than BCH. Tech is secondary to human investment psychology, however...humans move the market, not the tech.

I'm noticing a lot of misreporting on this case. Most coinbase users will be unaffected by this decision, even going back to 2013. If you moved more than 20k, you may be affected. Everyone else is off the hook: report your income, folks
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:46:24
This is a murky area...coinbase (and the company behind that product and GDAX) is not an "insider" per se, any more than anyone else in this subreddit is an insider. Nobody owns the bitcoin blockchain or has direct control over it's value. There's no accountants cooking the books or withholding an important media release that will affect the price of bitcoin. Sure, the mere act of introducing additional coins will likely have positive, upward pressure on the new coins, but is that enough to be considered insider trading? New laws will have to form around this ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:52:15
Hence the massive rush to cryptos �� I trust my computer more than the government...it lasts longer than 4-8 years of bullshit.

The problem with the "bubble" talk is that it ignores the many "pops" in bitcoins history. Each one has had a strong recovery, albeit not always a quick one. We could have another long lull (many months, maybe even a year or two), or this could be the beginning of a huge rally that will continue into the next decade. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:07
Or you could simply have lost the coins...kinda hard to prove a negative on the IRS's part (not that I would recommend playing games with paying your taxes...just do it)
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:11:17
But we can never stop the spamming...its an online phenomenon that never seems to die. Fees help to prevent spam.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:27:53
It would be perfectly sustainable without FOMO blowing up the market. Its demand for bitcoin that is hurting it's "ecofriendliness": miners are attracted to the high price.

The concern, obviously, will be that by the time LN is implemented (without at least some block size improvements), fees will be too high to stimulate regular users to form nodes. Who is going to want to pay 50 dollars to open a channel? I don't think the average investor would do such a thing, especially if there isn't a large system of already-present nodes to make such a cost reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:49:38
I mean...he's wrong right out of the gate. Of course you can link up (via exchanges) your real ID with your public wallet ID's. That's how the IRS is levying taxes on Coinbase users who made over 20k between 2013 and 2015.
Bitcoin is more of a Rorschach test than anything else at the moment: how it's perceived says more about the speaker than the object.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:53:10
Well, but there is confidence (real confidence) in putting faith and value in a *process* (such as how the blockchain works in an automated fashion to verify transactions that follow the rules of the concurrency)  rather than in *people* (which is how central banking works, essentially: we trust the people of the Fed and other large banking groups to manage the currency prudently). It's the evolution of money, more than the end of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:50:40
I'm working on it! Takes several days of downloading (on a shitty, non-fiber cable line) the entire blockchain to become a full node, not to mention the bandwidth requirements every day to keep the system verified. Nevertheless, very happy to be a part of the process.

If you're sincere about this statement, then invest now. Its a very good time to do so.
Coinbase is a good place to buy Bitcoin, but don't invest it there: move it to "cold storage" (a Bitcoin wallet stored offline, away from direct usage) and hold tight, it's going to be a crazy ride.

I guess they're hoping if enough people keep repeating "bitcoin bad, blockchain good!", consumers will back away and go back to mindlessly spending fiat.
Seriously, I hope they're right about a big bubble: I will never afford a whole bitcoin (in addition to the partial coin I hodl) of the price keeps rising like it has in the past year. A large crash would give great buying opportunities, and scare off the "get rich quick" types.

Yeah, it's just anecdotes for now, but we want to keep it that way. When cryptos are just a game of craps, the system isn't valued for its potential to liberate people from centralized money, and that will gravely harm the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:17:45
I'm slightly crazy...this could be both bigger than I realize but also different than I can imagine.

It will likely change everything, and I'm very hopeful, for the better.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:09:07
The company can't own BTC directly, but the investors buying/selling futures certainly can, on their own. The business functions as a clearinghouse and thus must remain financially detached from the process, legally.

Seriously...you don't rush the future infrastructure of our financial system. People are not taking cryptos seriously yet, and this deadly impatience over innovation is a perfect example of that. You wouldn't pressure the construction company to build your home "ASAP", without also specifying that you don't want the damn thing to collapse on your head after living in it for 6 months. People are being idiots. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:44:01
The problem is that it's hard to gauge that point. Personally, it looks to me like moving to 2MB now is a given, just a small boost to keep the system somewhat humming along (200k+ unconfirmed transactions sitting in the mempool for 48 hours is too long).
The price keeps going up...that bodes well for adoption (more people and more money at stake), but in and of itself, I don't think it's enough to gauge when users are OK with the system. You have to look at the state of exchanges: they're working (with delays and high fees), but under a lot of stress.

Of course, there will be newbies (and there should be a separate forum for them...wtf is up with that? as are more organized than the crypto community) who will find all this very crazy and hard to understand. But every time bitcoin drops, it's not helpful to whine about lightning network: It's an open source project. If you expertise in software engineering, by all means: lend a hand. Otherwise, you're just creating noise that we don't need here. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:06:04
Just hand-waving: bitcoin will increase in value as adoption increases. Its a major gateway to crypto adoption, so most new users will try to use it first, before other coins. That's enough to sustain a bubble for a long time, with occassional corrections.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:54:46
This is why these comments get removed: this is political bullshit and you know it. Cut the crap and go talk nonsense elsewhere. If BCH is so fucking good, it will rise on its own merits. Then it can have its OWN problems with rapid growth: you think simply changing the block size will fix volume issues? BTC developers arents that thick: there's more to scaling that just larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:38

Yeah...I think we all reach a price point where it feels "too good to be true" but when the market collectively feels that, I could get very ugly for awhile.

Not really...he says near the 5 minute mark that "we can't afford 2 proof of work system" (or something to that effect).

What dip? Bitcoin has been increasing for 2 months straight, which is how long I've been hodling. The upward trend is MUCH MUCH stronger than the downward trend. Buy when you have extra money (which is uncommon this time of year) and don't look back: HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:47:14

This should be obvious: a lot of people are feeling bad blood about the motives behind BCH and don't want to invest in a crypto that was borne out of misinformation and fear-mongering (the fear that scaling wouldn't succeed and the crypto would collapse due to misuse). Thus, it becomes a kind of phony zero-sum game, where the people investing in BCH feel like a win for BTC (in terms of value, adoption) is a loss for big blocks, like BCH. It's typical tribal, political bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:29:53

Simple enough: it's people selling the value of bitcoin they own to buy another currency or asset (like fiat or real estate). Enough people doing that in any given span of time will put pressure on the market to sell for lower prices, in order to compete with the rush of other sell orders.

When you zoom out overall, it looks like bitcoin is clearly going parabolic. Sure, it could lead to a "tulip explosion" (where it drops back down to pre-silk road level, single digits), but every other crash bitcoin has experienced has lead to larger and larger plateaus: the network continues to find more value. To say I'm bullish on bitcoin would be putting it mildly: it could be the future of the internet as we know it, and totally transform civilization in the face of automation.
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:04:05
Determining the difference between an addict and someone who is "right thinking" is tough though, and whose job would that be? Certainly not the government. Addiction is a complicated problem, and occurs on a variety of fronts, not just with drugs (video games, for instance...or reddit!).
I don't believe it's the government to moralize. Of course punish people for theft, graft, assault, etc. in the pursuit of drugs, but possession itself should never have been criminalized.
You identified acts that are and should be illegal (robberty, fraud) but possession of legitimately obtained (paid for with your own cash) is not a crime, yet is still illegal.

I would probably start with 10% (hypothetically, since savings are kind of a pipe dream at the minimum wage) and move up to 30-50% as the value of bitcoin rises within my portfolio, and start moving assets away from bitcoin when it reaches over 50% of my portfolio value. For now...simply hodling ��

Bitcoins "printing" isn't controlled by humans...it's the first time we've let machines completely take over a fundamental structure of humanity. This could be the seed that leads to the rise of the machines...is be scared too, if I was thinking that far ahead ��

That's enough for life in prison...but they didn't convict him on any of those assassinations, and they never went through with them, anyhow. That information definitely tainted the jury if they knew about those messeages: he was convicted on those contract killings "in absentia" of actual charges.

That's where I would have been particularly hostile. He didn't inject the guy with too much heroin, he didn't push a kid off a two story building. We love to talk about personal responsibility in this country until drugs are involved...then suddenly the dealer is a murderer. Fuck those parents who say their kid would be alive without silk road: if they wanted drugs, they can find drugs offline just as well. The sales from SR pale in comparison to the level of business done on the streets.

I've never seen such an unjust sentence in my life...I could throw my phone at this judge's face right now.
This man set up a website for users to buy/sell drugs. Who was harmed? Drug users have a RIGHT to harm themselves, they have a right to overconsume, and they have a right to put whatever they want in their body.
This is Dred Scott level injustice, but there won't be blood in the streets of New York. This man has lost his life, and the former users of SR got away scot-free (I'm one of them).
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:52:01

It means thinking "big picture", and not letting the drama of dailies get to you. If you can't understand that point, then you are very much one of the "piggies". Sure, it's an asshole thing to say, but "pain is prescriptive": some people have to get hurt to learn not to do the things that hurt them in the future (and that sounds even MORE fucked up...but those are life lessons we all have to learn, in our own time, or die in the process of learning them).

No dumb, just easily scared by sudden change. Bitcoin has lost 90% of its value in the past, and it hasn't always recovered quickly either. Go beyond 1 year...2015 was tough for bitcoin: price went from 315$/BTC at the end of 2014 to $430/BTC at the end of 2015. Not exactly burning down the house. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:44:36

Wow...I'm not so sure about this, honestly. We know bitcoin is strong as a medium to long-term proposition, but short-term volatality remains quite high. That could be very painful for senior trying to draw on their pensions, but I'm not familiar enough with that process to be sure that BTC volatility could have an effect on payments. That being said, a small (1-5%) investment as part of a broad-based (and conservative, otherwise) portfolio wouldn't be a bad idea, at this point. Bitcoin has been around long enough to show it has staying power.

All you need to know: people worrying about price changes that are less than a year out are just being silly. If you're investing in bitcoin, you should be in it for at least a year, if not longer. That is how you avoid paying income-tax rates on your capital gains...it's just basic-level intelligence with investing.

This is the problem with forks, too...I would never submit my private keys onto a website, even with SSL. Even if the company is well-intentioned, they could be easily hacked and then that money is gone (unless you, wisely, move your money to different wallets).

It's pretty convenient to use online, but you're right about the value, if people are paying attention to that. On the whole, however, I think a lot of people online simply aren't, and those that want to make purchases with bitcoin will do so. It's not increasing in value so fast that you would delay buying that toaster that's on sale on Amazon.

Fees will be 25% of what they are today when Segwit is adopted...there's no excuse. That is one of the perks of Segwit: a transaction now takes up 1/4 as much space as it did before. Same satoshis/byte, 1/4th as much to spend to get the transaction confirmed. They are making more money in bitcoin (via fees) by not adopting Segwit.

I think his point is that you didn't see bitcoin as a good investment of your time or money in the long term, as did I (when you could get a bitcoin for 8-10 bucks a piece). And that was perfectly rational, by my estimation: it was virtually unknown until 2012 outside of tech circles. Even now, I doubt even a majority (outside of perhaps Western Millenials or younger generations) of any major country are familiar with bitcoin, if they've even heard of it. We're still at the beginning, without a doubt.

You're looking at it wrong: you're seeing the total value of online currencies themselves. That is effectively how bitcoin is priced. It will continue to be volatile and rise in value at the same time. The system wasn't designed at its foundation to be practical: it was designed to be a trustless, secure way of exchanging value over online systems. Other systems will need to run alongside bitcoin to allow easy, quick, and small transfers of value.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:36:28

It's more likely that "superior" cryptos will exist alongside BTC, not kill it off entirely. There's a huge amount of value not realized yet through the intetnet, so there's plenty of storage needed in the future. We'll likely need more than one crypto for wide adoption.

That was a lot of gibberish just to say "fees are too damn high". We get it...fees are high.

That's true, in most circumstances, but when you're dealing with a rapidly-growing asset like bitcoin, there's plenty of profit to be made just from the transaction event itself. The extra fees from Coinbase is just icing on the cake: don't tell me you think GDAX would cease to exist if Coinbase lost its revenue stream. They would really suck at investing their money if they couldn't turn a profit from this bull market, especially with the amount of liquidity they play with every day. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:45:10
You wouldn't do that if it was a real bubble, where the asset was overvalued (intrinsically) and was about to drop significantly lower to its "real value". If you don't think bitcoin will go to 100k or higher in the next 5 years, then you believe bitcoin is a bubble. Otherwise, it's just a temporary fluctuation for a new asset class, which is NOT a bubble in typical market terms.

Nah, they're buying on Coinbase, in all likelihood (most visible exchange in the US, by far), so there's only 3 options right now, besides fiat: BTC, ETH, and LTC. BTC will be the obvious "bitcoin" of the bunch. No doubt, though: we need more exchanges with more options for different types of traders. Eventually, there will likely be more centralized services (for the non-geeks) that will handle the buying/selling of fiat for bitcoin investments. This is totally new territory for our modern economy though: this is post-modern stuff, really, far beyond the current day-to-day of the general marketplace (which is not located in any particular city). 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:54:48
Not while electricity costs money: why would you waste electricity costs on a transaction that will gain you no value? Just to help an internet stranger out? That's silly, especially with bitcoins transactions being so heavily limited (relative to its use today): there's always going to be transactions with fees that are more palpable.

@_date: 2017-11-16 11:17:29
You need to do your own research, then: nobody on this subreddit should be able to assure you of any long term prospects of BTC but yourself. I've traded with it for 5 years, but not to invest...I've seen how it works and how long it takes to transfer. Its a remarkable store of value, unmoored to government decrees. Nobody can predict the future though: bitcoin will be as unpredictable as the internet. That makes it forever risky.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:59:11
I made the same mistake early in the month, buying at 7200. Overdraw my account by hundreds �� borrowed from family and got it balanced again, and decided to only transfer part of the "extra withdrawal" back to fiat...very bullish on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:28:07
Well it's bad because if they all coordinate at once to pull money out of the bitcoin ecosystem, it makes the asset look forever volatile and a poor measure of consistent value. Mostly a PR problem, but a potentially large one in the hands of "bad actors".

Yeah, at that point, you really do have to have a plan for what your goals are with the money: it can't be magic ("put 1 dollar in, get 1000!!!"). How high will it go before you start to divest, and how long will you wait before you pull out entirely (If ever)?

This is getting pretty damn serious...we still should expect (and need, frankly) another correction, but 10k by the end of the year is looking very clear. Past week was just a momentary lull, apparently. To be having moving flowing in during the Black Friday shopping weekend is inexplicable to me: clearly this is beyond US investments. Bitcoin is certainly international, and that's huge.

Buy and get off, quick.

I mean...you saw the charts in retrospect, right? It was a long climb to get above 1k per coin. Seriously: Nov 2013 was the "big bubble" (at the time) that got bitcoin to 1.1k. Next time we reached about that ATH? End of February, this year: 3 years and 3 months. That's decades in internet time. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:26:46
Editor's Pick, however: this is definitely "Forbes certified". Serious business: the inefficiency of the blockchain will most certainly be sorted, and no coercion of the ecosystem (i.e. such as the failed Segwit2x) will be necessary. The pain of these days with high fees will spur progress towards off-chain solutions, which is what we really need now. Block size increases will be gradual. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:07:33


Fair enough, but then the asset goes down to its "true value", which is going to still be above 5k at the present moment. It's very hard to determine bitcoin's "true value" at any given time, but it's real: there's machines mining this stuff and the electricity and bits being processed have value and costs associated with them. It's not make-believe: it's the "shininess" of the internet (much as gold is merely a shiny metal we have arbitrarily prescribe extra value to, as opposed to copper, which is common-place and less-valued, but still quiet shiny), effectively. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:02:23


I appreciate the honesty, too bad Dimon couldn't just say that and leave it alone. It's not the kind of products big banks ever would invest in. Trustless, totally decentralized, total limit of quantities (no endless printing of "value"). Totally alien to NASDAQ types.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:01:43
Yep, massive adoption by large companies will remove this confusion in short order, especially since more and more users will not be interacting with bitcoin directly: they will use apps and other software to interface with the system. Using bitcoin wallets directly will be unusual, and likely pretty geeky (but obviously more private, not to mention being your own bank)

What do you expect will be the price by then?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:04:50
The the things: we have two different ideas of what bitcoin is, too. It's either a solid, stable store of value (which could be true in the future, but not now, because the volatility is way too high for a store of value) or it's a transnational currency. The infrastructure can be built in either direction but, at its base, bitcoin is a store of value and BTC has remained true to that concept more than its ability to make transactions quick and cheap. The later concept will need extra layers added to bitcoin, in order to process bulk transactions (made up of many individual orders) easily and quickly. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:58:49


Like most bitcoin enthusiasts :-P welcome to @_date: 2017-11-18 17:48:19

Lol: "we don't know the value of bitcoin, but we do know the price". Great analysis there, John Madden ��.
We have some sense of the value...just look at gold market cap. That's a fair guess of where cryptocurrency in general will start at in value, as it reaches wide adoption. From there, it's off to mars.

Yeah...reminds me when they were charging up the housing market. Bad vibes, from that angle, but it's fun to see Kramer getting all jazzed up today, go the whole panel asking for a primer on bitcoin (amazes me hosts of CNBC could still be so clueless about the basics of cryptocurrency...it's like not being familiar with the internet...in 2004, in NYC). It's funny how when something goes from being essentially worthless to worth more per coin than an ounce of gold, suddenly it's all electric. These kind of investors have permanent ADHD.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:50:03
Gambling on the further emergence of the internet as the basic governing structure of the 21st century. You wouldn't make that bet? I don't think bitcoin is a simple currency: it's a way of sharing value online, and that's huge. Much bigger than any competition with USD or any other currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:10:10

I think it's just pathetic that they've decided to worship block size instead of working within the current community to fix bitcoin problems in more novel ways. Block size increases are the "sledgehammer" approach to addressing the transaction-processing issues we're currently facing with bitcoin: we can do better (in addition to gradual block-size increases). 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:16:25
Good Lord...more liquidity needed!
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:06:18
A Wall Street futures market for bitcoin would be proceeded by a huge influx of investor money: very big whales. Bitcoin's value rises the more people are participating in the system, and large, sudden investments would be about large spikes (which would then be subject to large market corrections, as well, when the large traffic spikes receded). 
70k is an insane prediction, however: I don't think the transaction speed of bitcoin is even allowing such a large spike right now. These investors will need to do a lot of business off-chain to keep the system fluid, because the blockchain itself is very sporadic with processing transactions, even with large fees. These traders are use to near-instant results, with brokers speeding up the process. 
Edit: After watching some of the video, I think he was just speaking hypothetically. Futures markets usually (apparently, I'm totally unfamiliar with stock trading, although I tried to learn a few times) have an upper limit on how high a product can move in a particular frame of time. He is essentially pointing out that the volatility of bitcoin is well outside the scope of the current futures market, and thus bitcoin futures should be traded in their own "crypto futures" market, away from the regular futures pool. It's pretty esoteric stuff for a laymen. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:51:50
That's why BCH won't go away anytime soon: if it can become a strong transactional currency, it will occupy its own space in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin just isn't cutting it for small purchases right now, and while LN might help to reduce some of the pain, BTC is still going to be slower than BCH. It's also far more valuable, however, and will likely remain so. It seems very likely to me that we will have different cryptocurrencies for different needs: BTC feels like an investment to me, not just a place to change fiat over to "digital money". It's not working like that, and people who want it to work like that (i.e. coffee drinkers and other drug users) will move on to other methods, over time. BTC continues to be widely followed, however. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:24:50


Is this just a coincidence that this journalist used the same word as Stiglitz did recently? (saying that bitcoin should be "outlawed"). This is suspicious shit..."fake news" perhaps?  
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:39:01
For a new asset class: absolutely. If bitcoin is truly "digital gold" then it's valuation is currently WAY off. Greater adoption will continue to propel value forward: most bitcoins have already been mined, so the value can only explode with increased adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:27:54
Good description: underlying value keeps moving up steadily, while this explosion of speculation (which is all that it is at the moment) will ebb and flow and bull markets tend to do.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:37:57
Yeah, just classic shilling: we get some of that here, too, but we tend to have more pushback. I see warnings here ALL THE TIME, that bitcoin could always go to zero: nobody investing today should ever think that bitcoin as permanent store of value for the internet is a done deal. It could totally get out-competed within the next few years: there's no cryptocurrency that currency comes close to the "brand awareness" of bitcoin, but once businesses form the infrastructure to service cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, that same infrastructure can easily go towards servicing their own "pet" altcoins. It's just a question of who wins the marketing war...interesting stuff, in the long term.

Too late before the next large correction?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:22:39
The block size needs to be increased gradually, and we need a mechanism in place to allow that process to occur in discrete steps that everyone will be aware of in advance. Growing a new asset class from nothing is hard, even with the leverage of the internet. Everyone wants "in on the action", so the negatives of overgrowth will continue to affect the blockchain until we can process more transactions in a more efficient manner. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:06:44

@_date: 2017-11-16 13:05:06
Thanks for your insight. I do believe bitcoin has already been testing from many angles, and this will be yet another one, the psychological aspect of large markets with a lot of mechanical (i.e. bots buying and selling) elements that bitcoin hasn't dealt with much as of yet. Still, we've had massive exchange fraud, darknet closings (which was the original front for bitcoin usage, now deprecated), and 90% swings in bitcoins value. It's already been a crazy ride, and we've barely started. 
Also, it's very important to point out: bitcoin is most certainly not a company stock. Even when bitcoin is commodified into the futures market, it's still a different entity than the usual stuff traded on the NYSE: how it will react to this new kind of speculation will be subject to the usual nonsense of human psychology, but bitcoin has consistently shown a push towards greater value, even in the midst of chaos surrounding the currency.

We're seeing a sudden overhaul of world markets, with potentially a single currency (not a fiat, nation-state-owned one) to govern it all. A lot of changes to come.

When you're investing thousands of dollars, that's some seriously lost profits (in the future). Fees are much cheaper with bank transfers (around 1.5%). Also, you're buying at the same price point regardless: the price is locked at the time of purchase, not delivery. Unless you're day trading (or otherwise plan to use bitcoin right away, as oppose to hodling), the wait makes no difference on the value of your investment, excepting the fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:37:21


We can't...we're not that coordinated. Bitcoin has crashed before, and came back, when it was much less known and much less tested. There's nothing special about bitcoin in this regard: it's just as hostage to human psychology as any market.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:27:36
Yeah, I always have to tell people: in 2012, there was very little talk about bitcoin as a long-term investment. The conversation simply wasn't there, or if it was it was happening offline (or not on this subreddit). The conversation was very current and focused on bitcoin adoption and improvements. Not to mention, there was very slow or no growth for a number of years (2014-2016, really). People need to keep that in mind: there was years where nothing was really happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:17:11

It seems pretty obvious now that additional layers will have to be built around bitcoin to facilitate cheap and quick transactions, among other features (including security for wallets, which is sorely lacking as an "industry standard"). Bitcoin can continue to greatly increase in value while other layers like LN can help facilitate the exchanging of value, safely. The pressure is too immense, otherwise, with futures now coming to the crypto market (via BTC) next month. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:56:42

My risk profile is "1s and 0s" in that case ;-) crypto, all the way. Bitcoin is a measure of value: that makes its intrinsic value huge, with adoption. It either approaches 100% value (as the world grows more meshed with the internet) or it peters off towards 0%. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:59:27
I wouldn't laugh at that, at all, except at the foolishness of the people who maintain BCH, but it hurts the ecosystem, without a doubt. Why is it so damn hard to implement replay protection?

They're trying to mimic what I think the US has already claimed: that bitcoin is an asset that can be used for making transactions (online and offline).

Yep, if you accept that bitcoin is a new asset class, it's valuation could only be compared to assets that are similar in how they are used. Bitcoin is kinda odd, though: it's been called "digital gold" but it's also a transactional currency (which gold ceased to be a long time ago, as bullion).
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:07:55
LN working well and enabling easy transfer of payments without direct usage of the blockchain puts bitcoin well above 100k valuation: we're nowhere near there right now. 10k only looks "big" compared to where we were a year or 3 years ago, but it's a tiny drop in a very large asset bucket.

I mean...bitcoin is the "internet of money" and it's on the internet. Don't we want to first get the techno folks all onboard? I think even that community isn't fully immersed in bitcoin, we're too early for Super Bowl ads I think. The average person that watches the Super Bowl and invests in bitcoin right now (if/when they could figure out how to) would very likely lose their shit pretty quickly, either literally (from an insecure wallet, which is easy to do) or from selling quickly (adding further volatility to bitcoin). I say "slow and steady", because bitcoin already has been moving fast: we've got tons of Wall Street investments coming onboard, and that's going to be a huge strain on the system.

Because of stocks...everyone seems to be thinking that bitcoin is a stock, and you have to buy at least 1 share of a stock to have ownership.

Bottom line? Not enough data to extrapolate 3+ years out. Bitcoin simply isn't that stable, and adoption has been anything but linear (or exponential). There has been fluctuations, and there will continue to be, for years to come. Most people on this planet (even among those invested!) don't understand or know what bitcoin even means.

The TL;DR synopsis, if you will. And yeah, this will be a problem if the technology is used maliciously from the start. In all likelihood, however, there will be further improvements to encryption technology in the future that will improve upon the current security model. Bitcoin isn't a static technology, just like computers.

Yep, massive adoption by large companies will remove this confusion in short order, especially since more and more users will not be interacting with bitcoin directly: they will use apps and other software to interface with the system. Using bitcoin wallets directly will be unusual, and likely pretty geeky (but obviously more private, not to mention being your own bank)

Yep, it's the most basic argument of them all: decentralization vs. centralization.

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:48:44
You weren't in line with this community, for sure: we say "hodl" for a reasons. That means you buy on an exchange, then transfer to your own, private wallets for cold storage. The fees will be high then, but then that's it: you can leave those coins alone until you're ready to cash out (which should be at least a year later, to avoid paying income taxes on the capital gains, if following US tax laws). If you're transacting on a daily or even weekly basis with bitcoin right now, you're doing it wrong: it's value is growing mostly on speculation for now, and very big speculation moving forward (which will further slow down the current blockchain infrastructure). Easy money still comes with important considerations: these high fees are a part of that, for now.

Unless you're doing all your bitcoin purchases offline (and off-exchanges), the IRS will certainly have tools to locate your bitcoin (the public key for your wallets, at least) and thus will be able to conduct an audit on your account, which you definitely don't want to happen.

1995? More like 1985, I would say. Bitcoin is VERY young, and very much in the dark, still. Blockchain technology with definitely extend far beyond just currencies and transactions of value. I've seen experts on bitcoin (whose name escapes me now) speak about being able to use the technology for such ideas like "micro-metering", where you can pay for services by the minute or even by the second ("streaming payments"), which allows for far more control over said services. That's just one idea, and there will undoubtedly be more to come. Bitcoin is just the big ship in the middle of a very large ocean, full of life.

It was rated low because it is not a "Bitcoin Wallet" app. It's primarily for Bitcoin Cash, and the features indicate that. Thus, the app should be named appropriately (and use the Bitcoin Cash logo, which tilts to the left). It's just an attempt to steal a brand, not necessarily a "scam", but dishonest nevertheless.

It's decentralized fiat...there you go.

@_date: 2017-11-10 09:53:03
That's only true for those who don't understand the technology. The value is in the work done and the limit of currency production.

@_date: 2017-11-26 01:04:09
That's true, but it somewhat disquieting, as well, because it makes me wonder about the consequences of bitcoin truly becoming dominant. Of course, it's nowhere near toppling any major currencies in the world right now, but at 100k per coin? 200k? Definitely could start happening, and at a million per coin, even the US will be affected. But wtf does that even mean? It seems bad, given past info, but we're in seriously uncharted territory: the internet has never existed in history, and we've never had a fully-digital currency before. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:24:34

It really isn't...it's a new kind of asset, wholly digital and stored on digital ledgers between decentralized nodes over the internet. Stocks are shares that buy one partial ownership of a company.

Hehe, yeah that's why I'm not so sure that a Mt. Gox revival wouldn't be somewhat successful. It's insane nowadays to think there was really only one big exchange for bitcoin, for quite a length of time. I used them successfully fairly often, until 2013 (when Coinbase out-competed Mt. Gox). A lot of money had left the Mt. Gox system before it collapsed, thank goodness: the harm could have been even worse to the crypto ecosystem. I would feel less threatened by a "Mt.

That's irrelevant: there will be tools that companies will invent to work with bitcoin in an efficient value. It's ability to be a electronic store of value has already been well-established and tested, over and over. The details of transactions are just that: details. They do not affect the larger scheme of things, which is increasing adoption. More tools will need to be created along the way to facilitate that adoption, but pressure will be strong, and continue to rise.

So dramatic:


Sure...until you check the 5 year charts. Year after year: growth. Volatile, yes, but growing continuously, much like a telecom would grow in value as more connections come on line. We do rely partially on merchants to help bring visibility to bitcoin, but word of mouth can do just as well: all you need is an internet connection and the basic ability to open what behaves like a bank account. It's not necessary to understand the underlying tech to recognize the value of an easily-transferable online currency.

He worked in government (and advised Reagan) so he was by necessity very practical. He knew the Fed wasn't going away of its own power, he merely proposed making it a more passive organization, which didn't engage in "inflation targeting" or the like. Fixing the amount of money being printed regularly would being more integrity to the system, but also open up more opportunities for deflation, which is generally not preferred by large businesses (but I only know the contours of that rationale...do your own research, don't have my, or any one else's, words alone)

That should be obvious: because you need to. Not even country has easy access to credit cards or even a secure fiat. We take that for granted in the western world...they don't in Zimbabwe or Venezuela. Its what is happening outside the western world that will propel bitcoin to the moon. What's going on inside is just large efforts to build infrastructure around bitcoin, which can only further improve its value. There's no "there, there" with regards to your hypothetical fears: we either move towards digital currencies (which is a given in a digital age) or we stay stuck with fiat. I don't see how the later is sustainable in an ever-globalizing ecpnomy...it's just too expensive to have so many fiat currencies with so many different structures needed to transfer funds.

@_date: 2017-10-26 19:51:24
Yeah, but you would have had to guess (out of the blue, with no prior knowledge) that bitcoin would become something of high value. At 1 dollar a coin, it was a total novelty: I would say it wasn't really taken serious by even the techno-logic community until well after 100$ per coin. There was a big crash from 1100 to 230 or so not too longer after that, which shook a lot of people, for sure. We might be in store for another similar crash, although I think recovery would be far more robust this time, since bitcoin's value over time has been far more established now vs. 2012. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:33:37
Just the best. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:52:55
Or were too busy spending it on the darknet...as was my case in 2012. I don't regret my purchases, I just wish I hadn't been so greedy and short-sighted: I had the opportunity to purchase bitcoin when it was 8-12 dollars per coin. This was only 5 years ago, for crying out loud QQ. Nevertheless, the currency remains very young: I would't expect the same returns from 2012-2017 over the next 5 years (where the value went up by about 700-fold), but I would still expect some really crazy increases, far beyond the realm of most investments. However, bitcoin certainly always carries the risk of going to 0, or near there, unlike commodities, which always have a base value. Seems highly unlikely (just based on the short history we both have), but not outside the realm of possibility.

Bitcoin has already experienced bubbles (the crash from 1100 down to the low 200s was a big one): they will happen and the currency will recover. The internet isn't going anywhere, and bitcoin will remain useful as long as being online and purchasing online is valuable.

Best case scenario going that far back is that you bought 10 BTC or whatever for less than 50 bucks (which I'm sure the value of BTC was below that in 2010...I remember it was 8 bucks in the summer of 2012, when I first started buying online with bitcoin), and then forgot about it on a secure computer somewhere, only to recover it in 2020 out of shear luck lol.

It's a shame though: his political leanings are strong, but I wouldn't take is financial advice personally. Gold is a shiny piece of metal that will be a mockery by the end of this century...that fact that we still invest in precious metals as a species like it's the second coming of Christ is really strange. Bitcoin has value because it works through the internet, which itself has ENORMOUS value, and that is not illsury...it's a communication media that has revolutionized our ability to interact with one another. Gold makes pretty objects and bricks...you can talk about it, but you can't talk TO it: that's why bitcoin is amazing. We're interacting with total strangers in a very trusting manner through the blockchain (and, to a lesser extent, through our beloved social media: reddit). Cryptocurrencies will be dominant within a generation or two. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:55:10
It's fine...it's just frustrating. It's like someone arguing that the Facebook of 2005 was "untested, unproven, unstable!". Sure, but we had previous techs (like myspace) that paved the way. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum: it was influenced by many other concepts (like PGP encryption, the basic idea of a public/private key system) that form a powerful cohesion. The "social media" aspect of bitcoin is real, and very powerful: the idea of cryptocurrencies will not go away, it will continue to rise dramatically. 
The only question is if bitcoin will be the specific currency: that is a complete unknown, but to argue that the most capitalized cryptocurrency over the past 5 years is a uncertainly going forward is total sophistry. It's beyond the "past performance" warning: bitcoin is being battle-tested every day. Politics and even outright fraud/graft (MtGox losing hundreds of millions of bitcoin user's funds) hasn't stopped the adoption process. The idea is sound.

How about a counter-question: what percentage value would give you confidence that bitcoin wasn't just a speculative-asset bubble (wholly, i.e. back to 5 cents a coin), i.e. that it was actually a useful, global currency? Is there such a percentage? Also, why does Metcalfe's Law not hold? Isn't there, perhaps, intrinsic value to simply having more users on the system? It doesn't matter what % of fax machines are currently sending/receiving faxes: the mere fact that they are (or were) highly popular was enough to make them worth purchasing.

It is effectively treated like a stock for the purposes of tax levies in the US: increased value at the time of sale is taxed as a capital gains (which varies depending on how long you hold bitcoin before selling).

It helps a lot to actually use it for transactions, online and offline. Learning how it works requires some hands-on experience. I wouldn't trust bitcoin one bit (even after looking at the charts) if I hadn't transacted with it online...the utility is remarkable, it's a very different paradigm from the way we use currency at the moment. The idea that the internet itself could hold monetary value, in a single instrument, is truly remarkable: I'm still getting my head around it, in wondering if such a thing can really "blow up" to highly-popularized global level. Perhaps its inevitable, with more people coming online across the world?
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:58:30
It's a lousy phrase, "indicative" should be replaced with "predictive". Patterns are real, and bitcoin has had quiet a few of them: many swings, both up and down. Huge crashes, then slow recoveries, or stagnation, even. It shows signs of being a very young system of value: we've never been able to literally watch a currency being formed before, in real time. It's like nothing else that came before it, not with this kind of GUI, that is.

How about a counter-question: what percentage value would give you confidence that bitcoin wasn't just a speculative-asset bubble (wholly, i.e. back to 5 cents a coin), i.e. that it was actually a useful, global currency? Is there such a percentage? Also, why does Metcalfe's Law not hold? Isn't there, perhaps, intrinsic value to simply having more users on the system? It doesn't matter what % of fax machines are currently sending/receiving faxes: the mere fact that they are (or were) highly popular was enough to make them worth purchasing. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:44:42
It's already regulated: you have to pay capital gains taxes :-). That's our government in a nutshell: money from nothing, while we (the people) do all the work, they skim off the top. For roads and bridges, of course (and massive tax breaks for their friends).

Higher fee generally = faster transaction fees. Similar to shipping a physical package: if you want the post office to deliver across the country by the next day, it's going to be much more expensive (10x more, perhaps) than First Class mail (which could take a week, or longer).

I'm far more concerned with B2X, because apparently they won't just advertise that it's "actually just bitcoin" but won't even use a different currency symbol (i.e. the one above", but attempt to masqurade as BTC. A lot of people will be confused by such misuse of terminology.

It's a beautiful thing to see...B2X can't survive if it is known as "B2X". The whole point was to steal the BTC brand away from the community and begin the centralization process. Centralization is inevitable as the value of bitcoin goes up, but the NYA attempting to speed up this process, against the community's will, is clearly working against this phony hard fork (masquerading as an upgrade to bitcoin). Good riddance. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:44:21
I was going to say...there was more than just darknet reasons (i.e. blowing it all on drugs) for not having bitcoin today: we've had exchanges just outright fail. I considered MtGox to be a "bitcoin bank" effectively. I had no idea at the time they were so poorly run: looks can be deceiving.

If the market holds, it'll be enough to buy a good, new car in 5 years. You're window of investment is too small, my friend :-) Also, if you live in the US, you should NEVER divest bitcoin less than a year after buying: you have to pay regular income (federal and state) taxes on those capital gains. Wait a year, then capital gains is 0% up to 70k of your income (gains + whatever you make from work) and 15% from 70k-400k.

The only positive I see (from a reactive perspective, unfortunately) is that at least these transactions will be fully "on the books" and easily-viewable in a court of law, in a private setting by the relevant authorities. That is to say, if something were to go awry in the trading process (fraud, theft, mismanagement), it might be easily to get relief through the justice system. There were no IOUs for MtGox, at least none that could be enforced in any realistic way. ETFs will be heavily regulated, and thus backed/protected by large governmental forces, which include courts of law.

I think that's why I finally decided to invest, rather than just spend. I started trading bitcoin in 2012 as well, but it wasn't until after 2015 that's feel the currancy proved its ability to weather a large variety of external events. The price was stagnant in 2015 and you are right for early adoption in particular: stagnation for too long will lead to slow abandonment of the currency. Escalating values built into the implementations of bitcoin: if it is not realized over a 2-3 year period (ongoing), things are not well in the ecosystem. So far, bitcoin has weathered those stagnant times and continues to explode after the fact: the charts are very very promises on a long term basis (5+ years). 100k by 2021 doesn't seem like fantasy to me, in this moment. It will either continue to increase rapidly or stagnant and slowly drop to 0. The later case simply looks highly implausible right now: adoption is increasing and looks to be getting huge very soon, with larger players. Forks will happen all over the place, but the real market cap of "regular old" bitcoin will continue to assert itself for years to come.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:15:07
Bottom line is that the most financially astute nations (like Sweden and, yes, the US) are showing clear signs of interest in the new technology of bitcoin ("the blockchain") and short of shuttering up the internet (or seriously limiting/controlling the data going in/out), the currency isn't going away as a digital exchange of value. I don't know what the FUD is for, besides cynical attempts at monetizing on the confusion of new users. If you have your private keys...you are winning.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:16:15
Does anyone but interested parties believe in taxes? At some point, its fair to argue that not even revenue stream on the GD planet should be subject to taxation. When the government adds value to a proposition, taxes are applicable. What value is any government adding to bitcoin? Its value intrinsic to the process itself. I already paid taxes on my computer purchase...that is what is doing the work that bitcoin produces. Of course I'll pay my capital gains (as they hopefully come in) but I'll always ask why these taxes exist. All responsible citizens should.

It's actually 15% up to 418K for single taxpayers (on total income for the year, not just the gains). You also get to pay an extra 3.8% on all investment income once you make above 200k.
This is the kind of stuff that breed Republicans, because Democrats tax policy is "more complicated, and more of it". The government has no authority to take money from capital gains...it's authority by a gun and jail sentence. The worst kind of "authority by fiat"

Definitions are important: can you define "better alternative"? Of course technology can improve and bitcoin can benefit from that to some extent. It's also true that a wholly better way of transacting digital currency could emerge (better tech, better security, more infrastructure) but they will still be playing catch up to more established tech, with bitcoin at the forefront. Is the USD better than the Euro? Circumstances may change, but inertia is a very powerful force in economics.

Same in US, but only up to something like 70k per year (that's your taxable income+ capital gains for the year, so any wages/salary is included) then it's taxed at 15% from 70k up to 400k. OP will likely fall into the 15% bracket, it maxes out at 20%, above 400k total total taxable income.

That is a very vague and constantly-shifting criteria. There's always other options when you live in the Western world, we have it easy. Not so easy in Venezuela or Zimbabwe, for example. Americans might not be using bitcoin to buy their Starbucks coffee everyday yet, but it won't take long for merchants to catch on and incentivize the use of bitcoin (which has lower transaction fees than most credit cards and other non-cash forms of payment), which will stimulate transactional (rather than investment) demand.

Wasn't targeting you, personally: I was talking about "Ver and company" attempting to undermine the Core team, and logic behind keeping the blockchain as stable and unmolested as possible (i.e. no unnecessary block chain increases, for example). 


To make money? That the fundamental "end" of the world. I think you seriously overreacted to what I wrote: I was simply expressing quiet confidence in the mechanization of bitcoin. I can't speak for the politics: it's all nonsense to me (as politics generally is). I just have a disrespect for individuals who spread fear and confusion, as a rule. That's not on you, but I do feel that your writing expresses a lack of understanding in how the blockchain works: it's really subject to brute-force hacking...in fact, that's how it's designed to run, effectively. It's the brute-force attempts to find the correct hash values that will allow the miners to gain blockchain BTC rewards that keeps the system running and transaction properly verified. It's certainly safer than gold bars in a bank. It is, however, subject to the restraints of the infrastructure surrounding it (i.e. the internet, cyber-security, exchanges). The underlying tech is sound as fuck.  


You would need to outline how such an event could occur in a regulatory environment...I don't see banks getting shuttered, and they profited from massive fraud over the past decade. As long as exchanges "play by the rules", I don't see how they could all be shut down. Bad actors will continue to be punished, and so will non-compliant ones. You're right in that regard: it's a new ecosystem, and regulators are always extremely slow to catch on to new concepts. The government barely grasps the implications of the internet itself, and that's been around for 40+ years now!  
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:25:45
Sounds about right: I would place bets on that (and I would DEFINITELY invest when it "crashed")
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:39:04
Seems like a good test to me, but of course nobody likes unnecessary uncertainty (well, not reasonable people who don't like to fly by the seat of their pants), but we also don't want BTC coddled: if it's to be a true currency for potentially the entirely of a nation's citizens, it needs to be able to handle serious competition, on multiple levels, including centralization attempts (which is effectively what SW2X appears to be, to me, at least). They will not be successful in the long run, but they could get a good pump for awhile, especially with the majority hashing power. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:41:31
I don't know about his predictions, but I sure hope he puts plenty of investment into security: I think he's on the nose there. Crypto currency is a scary concept for the average fiat-holder. Assurance that someone can't nab a wallet right under your nose will greatly help increase adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:49:45

The man died in 2003, 4 years before the economic crisis. Lets not put words in his mouth...pretty fucking disrespectful:


That was NOT the problem during the housing crisis...totally different situation. It was a speculative bubble on one kind of asset (real estate). Japan attempted to "solve" their over-speculation problems by curtailing the money supply: actually allowing it to have negative growth, which is bad monetary policy for a growing civilization. It halted growth for over a decade. All QE did was prevent proper market corrections: it allowed bad actors to continue bad practices, back by the full faith of the US (and other western) government. An illusion, but grounded in our high capital investment, as a nation.

Not so pretty, really, on a year-to-year basis, really. Look at 2015: pretty damn flat for most of the year.

Forget the hodl camp...I'm in the "retirement fund" camp, for the most part. This money will likely be at its highest value the closer I am to needing it to leave the workforce. That might be too bullish (after all, there's still nukes in the world), but I haven't seen any sign of the currency letting up steam, and it's still largely unknown in the developed world (and it looks like the "second world" i.e. South America, particularly Venezuela, might get clued in quicker than Americans or the like) which can only further increase the potential for value. Wild stuff.

@_date: 2017-10-26 03:28:11
Yeah, it's not as easy as people today think it was, back in 2012 or 2013. MtGox was dominant in the bitcoin business (much like Coinbase today) and was horribly managed, and the users didn't find that out until the money was gone, over $400 million dollars worth, in bitcoins. There wasn't as much talk about staying off exchanges and (frankly) most users that I was aware of were spending their bitcoins freely on the darknet, so the idea of "hodling" was virtually nonexistent: the currency was too unstable to ever think it could become 5k in value per coin. That was an insane thing to suggest in 2012, even 2013 (when the great bubble began to form). The internet moves fast..and that can create a lot of uncertainty. Bitcoin is still cutting-edge today, so in 2012 it was bleeding-bone-edge :-P

Even communist societies have a price on property, it's just hidden by governmental forces. Someone gets paid.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:47:37
Rarely works: people will hide whatever they can and it's pretty easy when everything is digital. When taxes get that high, infrastructure will spring up everywhere to allow people to smartly keep their money off of the government's hand. They know this, that's why we don't tax income anywhere near those levels anymore (but the UK has nearly tried it, for millionaires and the like...people will leave the country over that shit).

They want to control the process, that's all. Regular bitcoin is out of the hands of big banks because they don't control bitcoin's "government" (like they control the Fed). Its a peer-to-peer computer network: no central authority to "chat" with.

So you're a social conservative...yet don't approve of Weld endorsing Mitt in 2012? I have no idea where you're coming from: you're complaining from all angles about Johnson but not really aiming very well. I've never seen Johnson frame his views like you've stated them: the foundation of all of this is "don't tread on me". It's non-interventionism in the largest sense. 


And now you reveal you're definitely not libertarian...that's some serious aggression there, buddy. You are talking about hypothetical people you don't know, and likely don't care to know, and creating whole judgments and opinions based off of...their skin color? That's just racist. Affirmative action recognizes that 100s of years of institutionalized slavery greatly affected the black community...and it simply makes allowances for that. You're not entitled to anything, and neither is anyone of color. We all still have to earn our stripes, and you sure as hell don't get to point at someone who doesn't look, act, talk, or sound like you and say "they're lazy and only are successful because of their minority status". Just...no

Irl, banning will prevent future adoption for "average users". Short of economic collapse of the world economy, I don't see a national ban being ignored by the masses.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:35:45
But, of course, that's likely some violation of some law. Cryptocurrencies aren't against the law (at least, not yet), and thus banks that attempt to curb their use will quickly find themselves supplanted by banks willing to accept new digital currencies.

Coinbase is great, and if you make a transaction, wait 30 days, and verify your account, you can make instant purchases. Obviously a lot of hoops to go through, but then you have the fastest (and cheapest) bitcoin service on the web I've found.

Dwolla lost a lot of usefulness for me after they stopped allowing transfers to Mt. Gox in the usual way (sending it through Mt. Gox's Dwolla account). This is ridiculous, though: what's the point of an online bank system not accepting as many currencies as possible?

It was vague, but in a non medical state you could certainly get pot for a good price, nothing crazy-cheap (a la the prices for medical in states like colorado) but very good, especially considering the quality, which almost always beats local quality (again assuming you're in a non-medical state)

I think it helps that SR wasn't the only site of its kind available, before or after. It likely bounced back becsause people switched over quite quickly. This shutdown has been remarkably ineffective at quelling demand (which I thought was the goal of the "War on Drugs" at some point...)

Yeah...I only just realized this, it certainly bears comparison to Napster, which was far too centralized. The "next SR" will need to follow the pirate bay's model, where there are servers everywhere and they're easily copyable. Obviously, it has to be somewhat different, but there's some applications there.

It's down about 15-18% from when I bought a fraction of a BTC a week and a half ago. Very unstable compared to a year ago.
