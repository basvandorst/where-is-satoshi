Redditors love up votes and giving gold, why not bitcoin tips? A tip of the cap...something like that.

So that's what I did and...it's gone. 
After wallet synchronization my balance shows .022 BTC ~ $5. This number has nothing to do with anything, so I'm confused and at a total loss as to what happened.
EDIT: Well, I don't know what happened, but I reset the transactions a second time and now everything is back where it should be. 
No new transactions are listed in multibit 0.5.9...
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:15:30
I think I was sending different coins. I had a balance of about $130. I sent $5 in a confirmed transaction. Then I sent the remaining $125 with no luck. 
I did manually set the transaction fee to $.03, instead of using the typical .00001 BTC, or whatever, that is default for the client.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:44:39
Not sure if I should do this...here's a quote from the link:
"Occasionally you get transactions that never seem to confirm. If you have a transaction that has not confirmed for several hours *but you know it is definitely on the block chain (because you visited Blockchain.info or Blockexplorer.com and checked the transaction ID)* then you can reset your block chain."
The transaction is not found on the blockchain.

You raise a very good point. I don't see how cryto currency won't (quickly) crash third world currencies and take away a lot of power from some cruel dictators. 
It reminds me of how cell-phones took hold in countries without adequate telephone lines. The countries leaped the intermediate analog technology, and leaped right to the digital one.

That's right! Litecoin missed the boat. But its launch was much more fair than Bitcoin. 
At least we know the creator of litecoin, and he didn't make a killing off the launch. Who knows where Satoshi is.

Finally! I'm happy to provide some insight into a bitcoin discussion as an English major! 
Bitcoin is very similar to language. There is no inherent value in English. There is nothing backing English. 
There is only the social agreement that the sound K---AAAHHHH---TTTTTT, refers to a four-legged Reditor Predator. 
And the U.S. government and Webster do not count as a backers. The both agree on the definition of english post-hoc based on common usage. 
The only truly defining aspect of English is the grammar. Here, English grammar = Bitcoin protocol!
English is valuable (most commonly learned second language) because it is WIDELY ACCEPTED and AGREED UPON. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:51:08
I get it. Bitcoin may be a fantastic investment. I might invest just because of that. 
I'm just saying the other reason, essentially creating a libertarian utopia, is not as attractive through bit coin as it first seems.

That is awesome. Thanks for getting me started. I'll see if I can get into my wallet.

I've been waiting on a $250 deposit w/ BitInstant for 2 weeks. Maybe I didn't do everything right on my side. It was supposed to be my first BitCoin purchase. But I filled out the form and did everything they asked of me as far as I know. 
If you do use them, be prepared to be kept in the dark if something goes wrong.

Her recommendation to the legislature:
tl;dr - values regulation over innovation: doesn't understand that bitcoin is a commodity and a currency. Is trying to fit BC into old definitions.
5. Ignore the claims that  a. additional regulation of virtual currencies will halt innovations,  b. innovators deserve freedom from regulations that apply to other payments systems and their providers, and  c. virtual currencies deserve a single federal licensure system that preempts State prudential regulation and licensure.  
6. Monitor the development of virtual currency providers in case they transform their products into commodities or securities and, if this happens, then decide whether regulating their products under the applicable regulations makes more sense. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:11:13
These are my worries exactly. I think bit coin holders will eventually spend their money. What else can you do with it. Maybe in 50 years or so it will be more equally distributed. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:04:00
She also understands that bitcoin was conceived to intentionally destabilize gov. currency
"The emergence of a large digital “currency” unconnected to a sovereign threatens a sovereign right recognized back to Renaissance times."
"Proponents of virtual currencies often seek to end sovereign “monopolies” over legal tender, fiat currencies."

No mention of the black market from any of those guys. I'm counting on illegal international commerce, money laundering and tax evasion holding up the value of bitcoin for quite some time. 
Also third world countries, and other nations with currency even more inflationary than ours.

This is terrible news, but I think the Chinese market will remain strong. The Chinese traded several billion in QQ coins back in 2008-2009 before the gov shut it down. The people know what it means to trade digital currency.
But QQ was centralized and easy to eliminate. Bitcoin is different. Individuals can still buy and use bitcoin, which allows for two key aspects of value in china:
1. The chinese gov is keeping the yuan afloat. It should be sinking because of so many big purchases of us dollars. So bitcoin offers a hedge against the overvaluation. 
2. China has strict capital controls that prevent money from leaving the country. This is easily circumvented with bitcoin.
The Chinese gov could attack bitcoin nodes within the country to prevent communication with the global network. But that would open the door to a china only cryptocurrency that would still be out of control of the government.

Bitcoin itself is just a protocol. It is very good at keeping track of Bitcoins, but is not good at making them user friendly. 
Millions of dollars are being spent on Bitcoin start-ups which will add an actual User Interface that will make using Bitcoins practical for everyday people, instead of just day traders, international transfers, and criminals.

Sure. A global currency that everyone owns would be awesome, but that's my point. Bit coin isn't global. Its highly concentrated in the hands of a few people. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:39:16
You're partially right about the computer geeks thing. But the argument is essentially that a few people own most of the bit coins, and because half of them are already out, those few people will probably always be very wealthy in the bit coin universe. Why would I want to support those anonymous individuals instead of a government?
Also, the other people who have been buying bit coins are those involved in illegal activity. Isn't it worrisome that the other early investors are Russian Mobsters and similar ilk? Why would I want to support them instead of a government?

That sucks. So bitpay purchases are actually deflating the currency?
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:43:37
Because there are (likely) a very few people who control most of the currency. So the more powerful bit coin becomes, the more powerful they become, and we don't know who they are. Only that they are likely computer geeks or mobsters.

Your teacher is an idiot. 
That may be a tough pill to swallow, as it is comforting for youths to believe that their elders will always be smarter than they. 
Not all, but a lot of school teachers are looking for a steady paycheck without much intellectual hustle. This is the unfortunate truth in America where teachers are poorly paid and not well respected. Contrast this with Japan where every school teacher is called Sensei, the highest form of respect. It would be like calling your 8th grade teacher "Doctor". 
Suffice to say the profession sometimes attracts people without much upside. Try this little exercise. Picture your classmates with 1) average intelligence 2) who get all assignments done 3) but only do what is necessary and 4) rarely enjoy it. These are the students who will consider becoming teachers. And, sadly, they will continue these student habits all throughout college, graduate school, and their careers.
It is time to start picking and choosing who you look up to, my friend. There will be some teachers with a genuine passion for teaching. Generally, good teachers will embrace thoughtful questions, complexity, novelty, imagination, disagreement and surprise. The lazy will avoid these things. The lazy and authoritative will squash them altogether. Your thoughtful project has been squashed by a lazy, authoritative teacher. It is sad and funny and unjust. 
Aside from choosing good intellectual role models, there isn't much you can do. You can study the morass that is our educational system, and find out why it leads to lackluster instruction. Or you can wait for an opportune time to catch your teacher in the act of laziness and embarrass her in front of the class. But I think you would be better off just forgetting that it happened, accepting it as a sour piece of life, and moving on. 
In fact, that's what the bitcoin protocol would do. It would just move on. It didn't care when China warned against its volatility. It doesn't care when pundits say its worth 100000 or 0. It won't care if governments site its dangers and ban it from use. It will just keep doing its thing. So you should just keep doing your thing, and reject lazy teachers the way the blockchain rejects false ledgers.
