Here is a good guide on how to safely store your bitcoins yourself.

A great investment is to educate yourself about bitcoin, and understand what you are investing in, and don't put all your bitcoin-eggs in one basket. Here is my 5 Satoshis:

Any update on the progress?
I find it difficult to recommend a mobile wallet for iPhone when people ask me. If you implement segwit it will be a no-brainer!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:23:57
Please include a list of wallets that have NOT implemented segwit yet as well. Like Mycelium and Breadwallet. They should be hanged out also. Thanks for doing a great job!

Nice that you have made an updated regression to my 6 month old R^2 = 0.84 bitcoin price trend regression! I completely agree that we will see a S-curve, but I also believe that we are early in the exponential phase still, as I also argued then.

1st case, sentenced to 4 years prison - the police found a USB flash drive with a unencrypted word document containing the private keys to bitcoins used in drug purchases. 
2nd case, sentenced to 8 years prison - no details about how he was tied to owning bitcoins involved in drug purchases.

Larken Rose would have been a better choice IMO. Here is his Anarchapulco speech which was really good. The sound is crap first 3 minutes and then becomes crystal clear.

This is a brilliant speech! 
So what if she is not a "Bitcoin expert".  
"Institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society" 
"For the first time we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone"
"Blockchains lower uncertainty and therefore they promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways"
"Using the blockchain we can create a shared reality across non-trusting entities" 
"The very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust. So rather than all our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, or governments, or corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open"

Mike Tyson is no dummy!
He clearly has a functional brain and his skills for reasoning intact despite all blows to the head during his career as one of the worlds greatest boxers.
"I’m grateful to be a part of the bitcoin revolution and hoping that my participation in this space will lead to more conversations and help increase knowledge and awareness. In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting and I’m intrigued with the possibilities.”

Triple Entry Accounting - Ian Grigg - 2005 
"Abstract: The digitally signed receipt, an innovation from financial cryptography, presents a challenge to classical double entry bookkeeping. Rather than compete, the two melded together form a stronger system. Expanding the usage of accounting into the wider domain of digital cash gives 3 local entries for each of 3 roles, the result of which I call triple entry accounting.
This system creates bullet proof accounting systems for aggressive uses and users. It not only lowers costs by delivering reliable and supported accounting, it makes much stronger governance possible in a way that positively impacts on the future needs of corporate and public accounting."

Fantastic interview addressing many of the most pressing and contentious issues in the scaling debate. Today I discovered Future Gravy and his great videos on his Youtube channel, thanks to this post. Great stuff!

It's so amazing to listen to economists who are not full of shit!
Not exact quote - but this is the gist of what he said:
"Any banking system that is well run and stable is regulated somehow.
The question is weather market mechanisms can provide the necessary regulation.
In the free banking systems of the past in Scotland and Canada - before central banking. The main mechanism of regulation was the scarcity of gold under the gold standard, and the second most important mechanism of regulation was competition.
There is no natural way to regulate the supply of a fiat-money, it has to be artificially regulated...
If we want to keep a fiat-money system, we could have either a central bank, who's only function is to regulate the money supply, or we could have some kind of a computer that regulates the money supply...."

Of course I realize that it is impossible to predict the future. This is only a ”What if it continues on the same trend picture”. I expect the bitcoin price to follow a sigmoid curve like all successful new technologies. But I do believe we are very early on the curve. Where exactly is of course impossible to say.
