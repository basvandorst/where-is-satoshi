It’s because they are basically a bank, and by not allowing you to transfer bitcoins in and out is the only way they could get approval and not get shut out by the rest ok the banking industry.
Will change in time

shady anarchic world of bitcoin, haha 
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:38:38
Not really. So far banks have been avoiding bitcoin. 
If bitcoin is going to become mainstream then such collaborations are going to become increasingly common. So this is good news hopefully safello will be back in the UK with faster payments soon!

Imagine if someone said to you in 2013 that in a couple of years Barcalys will have a VP of Blockchain. 
Even Bill Gates is realising he's missed something
'After Gates dismisses Bitcoin because of its anonymity, Casares pops back at the Microsoft founder, telling him that his programmes in developing countries should be using the free transfer that Bitcoin offers rather than ones that charge a fee. “You are spending billions to make poor people poorer,” Casares says to Gates.
Moments later, the conversation ends with Gates saying to Casares: “You know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a great mistake. We are going to call you.” '

Did that and got mine a few weeks later here in the UK

just lol
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:22:43
Probably missing something but am i right in saying that i could create a private key with a 16-sided hexadecimal dice, and from that create a public key etc and essentially have a bitcoin wallet?
And they plan to regulate that?

HUGE amount of fiat incoming?

Just been down my local store here in the UK and used one of these ingenico terminals, could be big!
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:25:35
Coinbase have today said that there integration with braintree will be pull based, so that clears that up
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:19:30

haha no sorry, just didn't expect to see one of these terminals
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:37:13
Then maybe the guy from twitter was right about the ETF??

Updates to give everyone a better idea of its progression is whats expected
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:53:16
Sorry the first part was kinda a joke, im confident they probably will at some point given the fact its been talked about for ages, and been in coinbase presentations, but this isn't really that significant seemingly. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:58:53
Its going to be the partnership with Braintree/Paypal, with companies such as uber accepting bitcoin.
However they will only be accepting bitcoin through Coinbase as will be based on a pull payment 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:45:19

@_date: 2015-01-22 13:28:03
i started a thread last week with the question, Is Uber about to accept bitcoin?
Soon after this guy tweeted that he had learnt that uber will soon accept bitcoin. Hmmmmm
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:28:38
However bitcoin is really less anonymous than cash. As the infrastructure grows this caveat will increasingly diminish 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:06:41
Just that he said uber (Check braintree's homepage UBER is on there) was shortly going to accept bitcoin last week.
So the fact this has been announced means his info maybe legit, at least more so than what i thought originally.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:22:37
Was it me or did they just try and give other cryptocurrencies a bad name after you defended bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:15:09
Impressed, looking forward to the etf even more now!

I will it was the first payment option i added, just most of my customers wont pay in bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-06-06 03:23:24
Tbh i had completely forgot about this risk before asking, and if i do it myself I could just have a buffer period of time before members receive bitcoin or have % fiat held back to cover any future expected chargebacks. 
Membership numbers wont surpass 1000+ anytime soon so risk should be manageable.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:35:27
I know this is simple but ...
Maybe the msigna wallet your checking isnt the same one you sent it to. Could you have created more than one while setting it up?
I did this on breadwallet, while creating a wallet screenshoted the back up phrase which reset the wallet, didnt realise and sent it to the first one. Not quite sure how i did it now thinking about it.

Maruska B: Hello my name is Maruska, can you explain in detail how I can help you today?
You: hello there, can i say people can pay with bitcoin in my ad now?
Maruska B: Yes, if you would like to get paid in bitcoin you can state this in your ad.
You: was i mistaken before thought you said it wasnt allowed?
Maruska B: No, you were not mistaken, it was something that we were misinformed about, and we would have told you that it is not allowed.
Maruska B: I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused in this case.
You: thats ok just wanted to include it!

made it clear i was accepting bitcoin as payment for tickets from the off so doubt it 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:35:59
I think the idea is that nobody wants to be near someone with ebola because of the risks it poses , banks don't want to go near bitcoin because it is portrayed as drug money etc
Also its not so much the case that bitcoin needs banking, but that banking needs to embrace bitcoin or be left behind and die!

"We are working with some charity clients in a proof of concept to understand how Bitcoin payments might help with their fund raising and fund disbursement needs"
In reality it seems like Barclays are enabling charities to accept bitcoin through a third party exchange. And they are saying they are doing it to understand the benefits of bitcoin, rather than they are now starting to accept it.
Then what? Its only heading in one direction
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:21:29

Speaking to New York Business Journal, Barclays chief design and innovation officer Derek White called the deals with Chainalysis and Wave a "game-changer" for the bank.
Barclays indicated it would partner with Chainalysis to allow its financial crime and transaction monitoring teams to obtain the necessary information to transact with bitcoin companies.
Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin said this would position Barclays as one of the first mainstream financial institutions to provide services to bitcoin firms, many of whom struggle with access to basic banking.
Levin told CoinDesk:
"This is the first time a top-tier bank has integrated a compliance solution that would enable them to bank bitcoin and blockchain companies."

This happened to me last year and they admitted afterwards they were misinformed! See:
I posted a thread on here and someone went on live chat and showed them the thread. We both spoke to the same guy and then eventually he seemed to realise that it was allowed.

Was very impressed with yous but only made one purchase and then faster payments were taken away! 
Would be particularly interested in what's happening and going to be happening in the UK? Seems quite important. Was the bitcoin buy volume increase from december basically because of this?
May I ask how come you's have chosen to get investment through this means? What advantages does it provide other others that may have been available? Were others available?
Feels like something you would do if you struggle to find investment elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:52:36
Can the titans compete with bitcoin is the better question. A trustless and permissionless system can innovate at a rate thats incomprehensible to a closed system. 
Banks are going to create there own permissioned system which will be better then what they have now. The fact they have control will seem an advantage over bitcoin in the short term but once bitcoin gets to a stage in its evolution, bitcoin will be much more advantageous
