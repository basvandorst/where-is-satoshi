We haven't released the film yet, just the trailer. The music and sound are getting finished up and the full movie will be out in July. We don't have an exact date yet. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:51:34
I'm really hoping so! It would be awesome to have part of my paycheck in BTC and part in USD
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:50:51
Aww! Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:50:24
Will do! We are so excited to share it!
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:16:04
A first cut is almost complete now, and we're looking to submit to film festivals to get the widest distribution we can. Its very close to being ready for private screenings and film festivals, but releasing it will require a distribution partner and we don't know when that deal will come. Austin and I just did some voice over for it last week and stuff like motion graphics and music composition are underway.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:29:15
Congratulations to the film makers! We know first hand what its like to try to keep up with Bitcoin and make a movie! I wish them the best, this is HUGE NEWS!!
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:02:48
We weren't scripted as we were being filmed, and we really wanted the doc to have as much of our genuine reactions as possible, so I can't think of any bloopers. There are definitely some funny moments in the movie, though. If we find footage of us tripping or burping on camera maybe we'll compile a reel.
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:00:00
Oh very cool! I hadn't heard of this. We're looking into it. Maybe this would be a cool way to broadcast the film, and we could do a live Q&amp;A afterwards
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:55:50
Yeah someone told me about that when we first launched the kickstarter project. The bitcoin community is awesome!
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:16:07
great idea! I'd also love to find some VOD services and or movie theaters that don't currently take bitcoin, but would start accepting when they stream or show the movie
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:51:00
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:44:08
very cool
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:56:22
Well I'm not going to tell you how much money I have, but I will say that we still have and use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:52:51
Well thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:52:22
We know! Its been a long time coming. We've been anxious to get the film out to everyone, and could not forsee how much time it would take to put everything together. Our production company, The Good Line, worked so tirelessly to get the 200+ hours of footage whittled down to 90 minutes, and had other projects they were working on simultaneously. 
It was everyones first go at a feature length movie, and we underestimated what it would take. We wanted every detail to be great, including the interviews we got, the music we used, the coloring, etc. It just takes times!
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:42:04
We're first time feature filmmakers, all of us. And this was the first time this whole team had worked together. Many of us were doing this as a passion project, not getting paid. It definitely took longer than we wanted it to.
It boiled down to budget and time. We filmed over 200 hours of footage, and whittling that down to the best stuff, editing it together, finding the story, getting music composed, finding great people to interview... it all added up to much more time and money than we had originally budgeted for and anticipated.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:56:29
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:03:30
During filming, there were time when it became VERY inconvenient to only be spending BTC. In Chicago, for example, we walked around the city all day, and couldn't find restaurants that would accept bitcoin, so we just ended up being hungry a lot. I also got to the point where I was so tired of asking people about bitcoin for any and every purchase that I just did without. It was easier.
Now, every time I buy something online I wish I was doing it with BTC. If your internet connection is reliable, its fast and safe and really convenient. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:53:29
Oh thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:55:20
We're so glad you're looking forward to the film. It did feel like we were racing to keep up with BTC, even while we were living on it and filming. Bitcoin is still so young, and since it hasn't gained wide adoption yet, our experience still could feel fairly representative. That being said, when we started, 1 bitcoin was $70.
I do think living on bitcoin would be much easier today than it was in July 2013, when we started.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:12:43
First, thank you so much for backing the project. Second, yes we are absolutely still planning on all of the rewards. If your sponsorship reward wasn't fulfilled, PM me and we'll get to the bottom of it. We're so excited to send the film out to our backers!
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:58:54
Hey awesome! We worked with some really talented people for music and sound sweetening, so I think we are good. I really appreciate the offer, though!
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:47:00
We set up a donation wallet on our site to take BTC. We met our kickstarter goal all with USD, and all of that went to the production company that followed us around filming the doc, and later edited.
The bitcoin we raised on our site went to other production costs, like bringing our film crew with us as we traveled around the world, meeting all kinds of amazing bitcoiners along the way.
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:53:39
Hi. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:50:30
Just to clarify: our honeymoon was definitely funded by us. I've got the receipts to prove it. The kickstarter was to fund a documentary about Austin and I living on Bitcoin (our own Bitcoin) when we got home from our honeymoon. Austin posted an update on the film very recently in this thread. We'll both be checking back here to answer any questions so fire away!
@_date: 2013-09-24 14:03:30
Hey can I jump in on this? I just wanted to add that I own a business called The Beehive Bazaar. It's a twice-yearly craft show and for our show in December we WILL be taking bitcoin. So reality is about the opposite of OP's statement. Thanks for the support, you guys!!
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:11:29
I am not stopping my full time job. My employer is on board with the project, but expect me to remain committed to my obligations with my company. My fiance works freelance, so he has more time to dedicate to the project. The kickstarter project will not fund our lives.
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:20:17
Hey I'm Beccy from life on bitcoin. We just met with our production company today. They are projecting that the film will be done late April or early May. You can PM me with any questions you have. I'll try to answer them as best I can. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:37:20
Me too!
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:13:36
I'm not familiar but I will check it out! That is our plan, too! In fact, the plan is for our wallets and cell phones to be taken from us when we get off the plane from our honeymoon.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:51:46
Hey that's us! Marcin was so awesome. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:15:30
the $70K is for the documentary. We are taking bitcoin donations at lifeonbitcoin.com, but my employer will be paying me in bitcoin, which we will be using for our expenses.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:14:59
Awesome thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:07:34
We met up with a guy named Josh who was awesome and also met with as many bitcoin taking shop owners as we could. Met the infamous Joerg from room 77 too!
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:46:23
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:45:37
We are creating a set of rules for ourselves and for the documentary project but the general idea is we want to see how directly we can spend bitcoin. We're aware of the intermediaries but we want to see if we can educate a person or business enough to get them to take bitcoin directly from us. 
I agree that living on bitcoin won't be especially hard... all of our necessities can be bought one way or another using bitcoin, but we want to push it and see how close to normal we can live.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:30:29
try [here](
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:04:07
This is my project! And yes, we are taking donations in bitcoin. Thanks for donating!!
@_date: 2013-09-20 19:07:39
Oh that reminds me, I need to buy some of your stuff!
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:47:21
one of many celebrities that my fiance has been compared to!
@_date: 2013-06-10 17:21:32
Haha! I think I posted that when this whole project was very much in the planning stages.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:15:16
thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:18:56
I totally do. Our plan is to be completely transparant through the whole thing. Hopefully we can do so in a way that satisfies the donors.
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:51:17
sorry I could have been more clear. Exchange for anything. Gas, food (at grocery stores or restaurants), a car, furniture, etc. We are aware of the intermediary options available to us (though I'm sure not all of them) but we'll use them only as a final straw. I'm hoping to engage one on one with businesses, talking them through bitcoin and getting them to a place where they accept it.
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:33:50
We have long term goals of pushing this for distribution on netflix/hulu and the like, as well as submitting it to film festivals. Kickstarter backers will also get a digital download of the final film.
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:55:14
great idea. we'll definitely be doing so.
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:41:51
Thanks so much! Its really fun when people catch the vision of bitcoin and go for it. And those kids are so incredible, really. They were a fun family to hang out with. Also seriously those honey roasted almonds.
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:57:25
To clarify, the project will be taking place after our honeymoon, which I am paying for with my income. Also, the kickstarter project is funding the making of the documentary, not our lives.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:12:32
Did you order the honey roasted almonds? BECAUSE OH MY
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:44:42
We'll be roadtripping across the country, from Provo to New York, in October!
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:14:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:09:11
Hi! This is my project, and I'd love to answer any questions you might have. The kickstarter project is for the documentary, not for us. We won't be using any of the 70K to live on. That money is going straight to the production company.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:53:18
Are you in Berlin? We would have loved to meet up! Berlin was amazing and we really want to go back. Next time?
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:53:29
You are right! They don't. Our lives will be funded by our jobs, either converted to bitcoin after we're paid, or, hopefully, getting paid in bitcoin. The kickstarter project is to fund a great production company producing a documentary about the process.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:16:33
I'd love to do an AMA. Should I do one now or when we've been living off of bitcoin for a while?
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:49:32
Yeah as long as its not vulgar then great! Use whatever name you'd like :)
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:55:35
The production company we are working with is The Good Line. We talk about them in our video and have some samples of what they've done on the kickstarter page. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:39:37
I'm Beccy from the Life-On-Bitcoin project. [Here's my post about the project]( A lot of people think this is a scam, which bums me out because I like to think of myself as an honest person. I've tried to answer as many questions as I can on some of the other Life On Bitcoin threads, but I'm happy to do it here as well. [The Good Line]( (our production crew) is also on Reddit so maybe I can get them to jump on and answer some questions.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:14:47
awesome thanks! It's so great to get input from everyone on tools and resources that are available to us. One of the reasons why reddit is so great!
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:30:20
I feel like living on bitcoin for 90 days is a little more involved than doing so for 1 week. For instance, we have to pay rent, car insurance, etc. Can't avoid those expenses.
My goal here is to see how we can talk to people about bitcoin and educate so they will even be willing to exchange. We'll limit our use of intermediaries, we'll travel away from our safety net, and really push the limits of what has already been done.
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:32:40
pm me if you do it! I'd love to exchange tips and tricks!
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:29:57
We share wifi with our downstairs neighbors so we plan on working it out with them. Whenever possible, we'll be pushing for a "bitcoin-for-service" direct transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:25:33
right now we both have iPhones but haven't found many options for bitcoin apps... so hopefully we can find some way to buy an android phone with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:08:24
Yes we will try, but only the bitcoin our income generates. Any bitcoins donated on our website we will not tithe. The church has been accepting other donations (land, chickens, produce, stock) for years now, so we plan on approaching our church leaders to see if they would also accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:49:36
awesome! I may be in contact during filming to get specifics from you. Thanks for reaching out to help!
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:16:14
I think that's great feedback. Thanks.
I will say that I don't intend on this being all sunshine and rainbows. It will be hard. Sometimes it will be frustrating. I imagine also sometimes it will be easy. The documentary is about us living within this restriction. We'll be pushing bitcoin because it is a documentary about us living on bitcoin. The word bitcoin will be used a lot, probably, though not always accompanied by a thumbs up.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:10:08
I understand where your concerns are coming from. We plan on being fully transparent with our transactions and budgets, and will not use any of our kickstarter funds for our personal travels.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:22:25
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:45:39
The kickstarter campaign is funding the costs of the documentary.
@_date: 2013-06-10 16:14:33
thank you! We will definitely be using this!
