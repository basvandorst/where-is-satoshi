Thank you, I guess I got it. I am not caring about my losses anymore and I'm now wondering a lot about this, about the crypto billionary market cap movement and, above all, about Tether.

Because in order to do that they need to fill someone else's orders. I really don't know though.

Or you can post this to people set bid orders and you dump hard on them.

I agree, I want to see all those people who doesn't know or doesn't believe in the gift Satoshi Nakamoto quitting. The main problem now: these people joined hard on in the last few months.

Sorry, in my native language we write "cripto" instead of "crypto" and I looked like I big bear but I just wanted to bring attention to those points, because I believe they could cause a trend reversal like it was in the end 2013/beginning of 2014. I'm taking the risk of BTC going down (bringing alt coins down) and I'm holding IOTA, but watching the market (and this triangle correction) carefully. Either way, cryptos are awesome.

If you think the trend is bearish, sell and buy lower.
If you think the trend is bullish, buy and sell higher.

This is a falling knife, be careful if you are trying to catch it, maybe I'll try but I already lost too many money.

I don't like Warren, but technology is riskier than stocks for example - though better than gold and silver (if treated like a commodity). I think bitcoin needs a bigger correction, for me it is looking end of 2013/beginning of 2014 all over again. I want to bring attention to this:
* 1) Bitcoin had parabolic growth from 2016 to now.
* 2) Unpractical bitcoin uses because of transaction and electricity limitation and costs. Bad scalability.
* 3) Tether may be pumping the price up, and this affects altcoins more than Bitcoin itself.
* 4) Most of alt coins are speculative jokes, and probably will not grow until bitcoin looks healthy (even the good ones).
* 5) We are in a BIG sideway Elliott correction wave 2 for Bitcoin. And sure, it could shoot up in the end of it, but I don't think the correction is over yet (because of all I said above.)
Well, looks like I am a bear on criptos for now.

Misleading title, bitcoin is great - one of the greatest gifts to the world. And you are right, Tether is very dangerous, but people can't just get rid of them if the major exchanges are using Tether as pair for cryptotrading.

Idk, it was $800 something by the beginning of the year.

Just another egocentric jerk in the world. One of the worst people on cryptoland.
