You're going to divest your bitcoin and put it back into a bank to earn interest that most likely won't outpace inflation?  I thought getting away from fiat was part of the reason for bitcoins' appreciation. Seems backward to me.

Agreed on the selling part, but i am sure we'd all keep some BTC because by the time it hits a price high enough it will be a completely valid and respected asset class. As far as interest bearing savings, I'd be concerned with the solvency of the banks or the institution behind the instrument paying the interest and outpacing inflation. I would invest in income producing real estate, and perhaps a few local businesses.

When did Coinbase become FDIC insured?  There's no way.

Are you still looking for help with this?

Is your password for sure in that xxx-xxx-xxx. Etc format?  If so I have a suggestion for you

Do you have a wallet.dat file or is it something else?  The wallet I have is actually from the Wagerr WGR project and is a .dat file.

Did you check thegrideon?

I apologize, I got called into a meeting. Please check “bitcoin password” by the grideon software. You will have to purchase it. I have gotten good at entering the various parameters for it to test thousands of pws that match the format you mentioned.   It’s at thegrideon.com. 
Let me know if you get it and we go from there. I am certain if you know the ow format we can get it.

I lost the key to a wallet and got really good at using the software needed to crack it. I unfortunately didn’t crack mine yet but that’s mostly because I don’t remember the password at all. Since you kind of know the format you have a better chance.  Can you send me an email at eaglethree and we can communicate in the morning. I have all my software and info there. I’ll help you out, like I said, I’ve gotten good at setting up the parameters.
