Ontario is right next to San Bernardino. Either way the point is that airports can ban Uber so a city can do it. I don't see why it matters what airport it is

Yea but in a third world country ppl really don't GAF versus say, London

They can. You can block areas where you can't pick people up on Uber, like some airports that already do this

Just google it "Ontario airport Uber". I can tell you from personal experience that was exactly the case and we had to use a yellow cab

Because the app won't allow you to request a ride if you're in certain areas. How would you possibly get an Uber driver without the app?

The Uber's were all aware they weren't allowed into the airport without a special permit, they told me about it. I doubt they'd endanger their job for a single fare

At an old joke thats in every bitcoin thread?

I didn't provide sources cause I assumed you knew how to google. Literally google "San Bernardino airport uber" and the third result is talking about how the ban was just lifted

Airport bans Uber, so Uber complies and doesn't allow pickup from the airport and blocks it off on their map, see the San Bernardino airport

By having the app not work in London. That already happens in tons of no Uber areas

I found sources that it was unbanned July 5th of this year. When I went it was banned and the map was greyed out, also it's called Ontario airport

That's not compensation
