I never said a banking cartel. 
You are implying I believe in conspiracy theories to discredit my opinions.
I was referring to Blockstream who are actually funded by banking and insurance companies. Its public record.
You have no technical or historical arguments so you are reverting to character assassination of individuals to try and reduce the legitimacy of the whole project.
Ever wonder why there are very few of the pre-2014 Bitcoin advocates and devs who are still vocal?
I think the only one left is Andreas, and he doesn't do any of the old demonstrations he used to.
The on chain scaling works and is not the only scaling method Bitcoin Cash will use. It is just what is being used now until other tech is developed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:52:17
Why, there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoins' governance and direction had been captured by a corporation with ties to banking and insurance. It strayed so far from the original underlying ideas and goals behind its creation that the only way to fix it was a fork.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin as it was intended to be.
Fast, cheap, usable and scalable.

It is a Distributed Denial of Service attack usually performed by flooding a target with requests from multiple sources. (Bots, compromised servers and zombied PC's) It prevents the target from being reachable by legitimate users. The target becomes unable to receive or send data packets.  It can also cause target servers to fail by pushing the servers workload beyond its hardware's limitations eg: memory
EDIT: The DDOS is probably in retaliation for Coinbases recent support for BIP101

Except it isn't scarce.
The network could survive just as securely on 10% of the miners currently functioning.
 Difficulty is only so high because we have Peta-hashes of power. Miners racing for a greater share with more processing power have screwed themselves into limited profitability.
Less miners would actually mean lower fees and quicker confirmations. That doesn't sound right until you consider that a few miners are currently not including some transactions (fee paying transactions) just so they can publish a block quicker.
The rules for POW need to be revamped to account for this and the 51% issue.

They buy it at ~$250 to cancel the BTC debt they owe, the purchase at this price moves a customer to the cash side cheaply.
Many people believe they don't have enough BTC inventory to cover withdrawals.  The alternative is aquire BTC when it is at $700 or higher to cover any BTC shortfall on their books.
This solves that cheaply, and could turn a profit but burns their clients.... not that Gox cares about its clients.

@_date: 2014-03-16 07:41:46
It is a global network. 
Do a comparison with the current fiat system which requires accumulation of physical resources for note production and maintenance . Like miners it requires task specific tools to be run and produced. (printing presses, note scanners, storage bags) Physical fiat requires storage space, transport and a whole underlying security system from Armored vehicles to alarm systems. 
I suspect Bitcoin, in the long term, would work out cheaper both in carbon and monetary expenditure.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:46:46
It is a trapped market. The debt is being reduced artificially prior to the markets re-open. 
If I `hold` your 1BTC worth $1000 and you ask for it then I need to aquire that bitcoin at market cost.
If you sell it to me for $250 I have saved $750 , I no longer owe you BTC so the bitcoin debit is cleared. I do however owe you $250.
I reduce my BTC shortfall and my cash liability.

You won't get any interest on your coin.    
Exchanges, wallet services, large retailers and casinos will hold a lot of coin, they will get all the coin and power.
POS is a bad choice, you can see this from observing the alt currency exchanges. 
Those exchanges list POS coins quickly when a new one pops up and don't de-list them when appropriate.     
This is because the exchange profits by holding the coins of all accounts    . They receive the POS reward and sell it for BTC quickly.
 Proof of stake centralizes resources with large BTC holders and services providing them with incentive to do shady things. POS is the system that would give control to those who have control of the current fiat system.
If you want to introduce the corruption of central banks and to encourage rent seeking behavior support POS.

I think changing the algo is necessary to maintain bitcoin as a major economic tool. It will hurt the asic miners because they are task specific but will have no detrimental effect on the network.

**Hoard vs Save**    
Hoard is used as a descriptor by economists, politicians and the media because of the negative connotations.
I save in bitcoins.    
Where I am there is nearly no local bitcoin economy so spending on every day items is difficult.    
Due to past negative experiences I don't like or trust banks so I use BTC and the blockchain as a savings account.
It has worked out well so far. I don't have a lot but I feel that what I do have is safe. The blockchain can't charge me monthly  or annual fees, can't block my payments and can't freeze my account.

There needs to be a minimum percentage of included backlogged transactions requirement for miners to claim their reward, especially during the period that the network is providing  a block reward . (25BTC)
This percentage requirement should decrease as the mining reward is reduced in order to keep balance.
Miners screwing around with bullshit optimizations at the expense of the network will be the reason bitcoin fails if it does.
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:55:22
The proof won't likely be there in 5-10 years due to future blockchain optimizations and pruning. 
I understand how it works and how it is stored, a merge mined chain is a better solution for everybody. 
The idea behind proofofexistence.com is one most people who understand bitcoin have had at some point, it isn't unique. You could use it for registering ownership, licenses , rights management... the list goes on,  but this implementation is flawed and lazy.


Using your methods sending an SMS or MMS standard message has a data cost of $732,950.00 per GB.

@_date: 2014-06-14 08:11:23
Don't worry, think of it this way:
Everyone in this sub is an early adopter or becoming well enough informed to make the choice to become one.
Those comments indicate bitcoin doesn't yet have mass appeal or adoption. The vast majority of the public doesn't understand how or why it works. The general public will follow the big services and retailers.
Every month, despite the problems, intrigues and dramas we see in bitcoin, we also see more services and investment from big players. 
As soon as a large mainstream business endorses or integrates BTC the public will slowly start to trickle in. Once one large company adopts it others will follow or lose market share.
Yahoo Finance listed BTC and within 24 hours [Google]( and [DuckDuck Go]( released similar services.
If Ebay or Amazon integrates BTC  the other should follow. 
For people like me who have been around for a while but have only been able to accumulate small amounts it means we have more time to reach our goals.
Hopefully we still have 18 months to 2 years.... hopefully.
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:49:16
This method used by proofofexistence.com is a lazy implementation that may be affected by future optimizations and block chain pruning.
It shouldn't be encouraged.
Instead of bloating the blockchain ideas like this should be implemented on their own chain that can be merge mined in a similar manner to Namecoin. This allows for both chains to be mined simultaneously at the same rate that they would mine just one.
Merge mining consumes no more resources and still **protects the data from future bitcoin optimizations such as pruning.** Forwarding a BTC fee to miners would ensure the merge mined chain was maintained.

GST on Bitcoin is only a problem if you use a Bitcoin reseller like Coinjar.
Using a real exchange like BTCmarkets:
* Deposits and withdrawals from exchanges are typically free.
* GST is only charged on the service. 
* Exchange fees are usually 0.1%
So for transfering $100 that's a 10 cent fee, the exchange will charge 1 cent GST.

The fix is an algo modification, probably a scrypt integration. It would screw over all asic miners as they are task specific chips. 
Good luck getting the big miners to adopt that or others to take their place. They would fork the chain first unless you could get enough alt miners to jump on board.
My view has long been that the miners themselves are the biggest threat to bitcoin. Due to their hardware investment it is in their best interests to stifle innovation in the bitcoin core.

There is a difference between profit seeking and destructive greed.
The block reward is there to offset the small number of fees while the network grows. Eventually the network will be totally/mostly fee supported, hopefully by a huge network paying very small fees.
At the moment miners are under no obligation to include ANY transactions even though that is what the block reward is rewarding them for. 
I see that as a problem that can be fixed by changing the way blocks are propagated. It can be done without hurting the miners.
Some greed and profit seeking is legitimate or understandable , some is destructive.

If you are outside of the US the currency exchange rate used is also set by PayPal.
This can be considered a hidden fee in itself. 
Many Americans were not aware that when the Canadian and Australian dollars were worth more on the open market than the US dollar ,  PayPal's exchange rates quite often didn't reflect this.

We should encourage all users to seek out a domestic exchange platform and trade in and against their own currency. 
To make Bitcoin truly international and easily exchangeable the community needs to move away from MtGox and also the default BTC/USD trading model. 
If BTC is to become a more useful for international online sales and money transfer we all need to support each of our domestic BTC economies.
* It encourages domestic Bitcoin growth and adoption.
* It increases the usability for international funds transfer if the individuals you are sending BTC to can more easily exchange it for their domestic currency
* This in turn helps the portion of the retail market who accept Bitcoin  allowing them, their market and Bitcoin to expand.
* It reduces bank transfer fees. (no international deposit fee)
* It reduces bank transfer times.
Some examples 
* [localbitcoins]( not really an exchange but allows for local conversion
* [BTC markets](  for Australia
* [CoinJar](  for Australia
* [Kraken]( for Europe 
* [Bitstamp]( for Europe
* [bitcoin.de]( for Europe (more European languages available than any other)  - suggested by boldra below
* [bitcurex]( for Europe (especially Poland) - suggested by boldra below.

I don't get why these alts need to be bought or traded prior to assigning real value . By assigning value I mean being used to represent a contract or asset. 
The alt itself should have no value without it being specifically assigned.

The representation being validated by BTC fees and their value by the underlying asset or contract cost between individuals in BTC.

Why rightly?
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:41:37
Yes, you can see the tools emerging or people trying to introduce them already. You can see examples of it too . 
We can prevent most of it by only supporting 100% reserve services, ones that don't hold our keys or at least integrate multisig.
Off chain transactions can and probably will result in fractional reserves within some bitcoin services. It will allow for derivative financial products and possibly rehypothecation (a fancy way of saying that you use client assets as your own, even selling or loaning them).
Green addresses, this is basically like reintroducing banks or clearing houses. That isn't what was intended but that will be the end result. PayPal would love this, I am surprised they are not offering millions for dev support.
EG : Ebay may only accept BTC payment through the PayPal green address, which you will eventually have to load or pay 2% for... 
Those shared funds will be counted as a PayPal asset. They  will offer different services and credit based on your BTC. Because the excess fees always end up with the buyer and they are a big well known entity others will use the service. They will control the exchange rates and fees.
Remember MTGox. They , as do all exchanges , used off chain transactions between their customers. The evidence so far indicates they did not maintain 100% reserves.

Yes it does.
You use your private key to sign the response to the log in challenge for a site or service. This means you can associate a public key with your profile on that service.
The upside is you can accept payments , tips etc directly on what ever sites and services implement it as a log in option. No need for third party tipping integration.
People who don't even use bitcoin can use empty wallets for log ins, it would spur adoption.

The login becomes a single click response to a server request that is signed by a users private key.

 &gt;they're not a transfer of value unless you're selling them.
They are not being sold , but they are being paid for. They are paying a per kb fee just like any other transaction.
The transfer of value is always blockchain inclusion exchanged for a fee.
 Like any other transaction they are not paying for the amount of bitcoin sent or the value of bitcoin sent. They are paying for verification and blockchain inclusion via a fee based on transaction size in kb. The number of inputs doesn't really factor into it other than how it affects the size of the transaction being processed.
 You know this , your a "bitcoin expert". 
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:29:58
The fees are the value. 
The fees are the transfer of value.
All other considerations are not relevant.
A Bitcoin transfer of 0.001 BTC is equal to a  100000 BTC transaction as long as the appropriate per kb fee is included, and if miners determine they want to include 0 fee transactions, then they are legitimate too.
I personally consider votes to also have value.

Your personal situation is irrelevant. 
These decisions prevent user growth at the expense of maintaining a small number of nodes like yours that may have trouble with increased resource requirements.

This isn't organic growth of the user base and economy, it is just a price rally due to speculation. It seems like you are only interested in price and not the underlying economy.


 
 Yeah the conditions are constrained which hinders actual economic growth of any real world use for goods and services. This leads to...
 


The price rally is due solely to speculative trading and safe haven investment.
There is little to no increase in brick and mortar use, remittance payments or online commerce. Your own mempool data indicates this.
To build up the underlying foundation of the bitcoin economy we are going to need to make room at some point.

* The OP said that the current conditions are constrained.
* The price has increased , however...
* There has actually been a huge **decrease** of mempool transactions.
Mempool transactions are a pretty decent metric for economic activity.
If an organic increase in adoption and economic usage of bitcoin were to occur it is likely that mempool transactions would increase. This would be due to the increased number of users and activity. This is obviously not taking into account off chain scaling solutions and activity.

I am, in the future some miners will drop out, some will start up, eventually it will stabilise. There will be enough fees for those who are left.
The number and size of miners should be determined by fees, not the other way around.
2 billion people doing 3 transactions a day with 1 cent fees means the block reward is potentially 1.04 million dollars worth of fees per block. That's just over 54 Billion per year in fees. I think that could incentivise some forward thinking businesses.
With the addition of the block reward the fees at present are too high because there are more miners than we require for the current network size.
If we maintain the same fees when adoption reaches the above scenario of 2 billion people doing 3 transactions a day then the annual fees alone would be $37,800,000,000,000.  
That is 37 trillion. 
The fees are too high.

People wanted BTC, Gox was one of the easier accounts to setup with money transfers etc .
Cashing out was unreliable and withdrawals could take weeks. As time went on it got worse, reports of withdrawal problems became  more frequent. You just couldn't rely on withdrawals from Gox to a bank.
I used Gox myself to buy BTC then transferred it immediately out.
At the time (from my country) it was the only exchange I could actually deposit funds into and cashing out wasn't an option unless you trusted Gox to fix its issues.... I didn't.

Please detail the sacrifices/changes it makes. Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original Bitcoin reference client than the current Blockstream implementation is. The larger blocks have not increased centralisation at all, that is just spreading FUD.

When people talk about digital gold I think of Monero. 
It has features that are most similar to golds properties. At present it is kind of hard for noobies to store or move, but it is getting better. 
With the first semi light wallet, Monerujo, there has already been some decent progress.
It is also really undervalued at present, especially when you compare its price to Zcash and Dash etc.
When there are more wallet options, the price stabilises a bit (probably around $300)  and there are more available open nodes it will be a good store of value.

Your summary is correct.
However regarding Coinjar:


I and many others disagree that the current ruling is unfair. 
* They sell bitcoin in the same way  an electronic store sells a TV or a grocer sells a carton of milk, they are a retail store for bitcoin , not a market. 
* Coinjar sets the buy and sell price, taking profit from both ends of a transaction. 
* They also charge fees. (or did in the past when I used them)
Bitcoin is almost treated the same way as any other currency in Australia (no GST on trades and no capital gains tax). However if you sell it as a commodity it is taxable at the point of sale as one, the same is true for collectible coins.
The only thing with more freedom of trade in Australia is gold. (no retail GST , no capital gains tax)

Or just push for a base block size increase.
8Mb blocks would see all current transactions cleared in 10 hours.
The average web page size in 2017 is 2.3Mb
Increasing the base block size would have little to no detrimental effect on the network. 
If you can't relay 4 - 8Mb blocks in 2017 you probably shouldn't be running a node, you probably shouldn't be browsing web pages with more than 2 or three  tabs open either.
The transactions in stream now are non-segwit transactions so activating segwit would do nothing for the current back log.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:41:51
 Not really unless you are a specific type of business.
Trading has never incurred GST in Australia, this change doesn't affect most people, certainly not those who use exchanges.
The article specifically states "purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST"
This affects businesses like Coinjar who sell bitcoin in the same way an electronic store sells a TV or a grocer sells a carton of milk, they are a retail store for bitcoin , not a market.
These sort of businesses set the buy and sell price, taking profit from both ends of a transaction. It is a retail market so under the old rules they needed to also apply GST. 
This is why Coinjar kicked up a stink, they couldn't compete domestically with an actual exchange. Exchanges only need to apply GST to the trading fee, (the service fee).
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:43:02
Thank you for the reply but I believe your interpretation is wrong.


Nope, the actual problem isn't about block size.
The amount of data we have to actually process grows quadratically based on the size of the transaction not the size of the block. You can craft special transactions so that a 1MB block, containing 1 or 2 transactions could end up hashing about 20000 times.
Bigger blocks do not result in larger transactions which means bigger blocks will not cause quadratic slowdowns.
There are already other fixes to this problem available. 
So back to the original pint of this thread.


To address your concerns we could increase the block size and apply a fix to quadratic hashing simulteniously. 
We could ignore overly large transactions , use parralell validation or we could just increase the block size with Bitcoin Classic.
It uses Flexible Transactions and doesn't suffer from the quadratic hashing problem. Bitcoin Unlimited is also compatible with Classic's EC and has indicated flextrans is probably going to be implemented with them too.


No it isnt, Segwit doesn't fix quadratic hashing for legacy addresses.

For those that dont know:


It is a problem because most brick and mortar stores as well as many online businesses accept 0-conf transactions for small values because of speed /customer service/ease of use. 
With replace by fee you can just walk outside and resend the transaction to your own wallet effectively ripping them off.
**Once they damage the existing bitcoin economy by implementing replace by fee they have a solution standing by.**
The solution being pushed by some individuals is off chain trusted clearing houses run by centralised services like GreenAddress.
You will find that some of those who are seeking this course of development are being paid as consultants by interested parties.
GreenAddress and others may offer this service for free now but may in the future charge fees just like ATMs and banks do now.

Possibly. That's the best answer you will get.
The RSK VM is fully compatible with Ethereum VM. 
Future versions of the RSK Platform will include improvements to Ethereum VM which might require minor changes to the smart contracts in order to use the new functionalities. 
It can do most or all of what Ethereum can, but Ethereum has gained a lot of ground and backing. We will just have wait and see if RSK combined with Bitcoin security/network effect can co-exist peacefully with Ethereum or just makes it a redundant technology.

With LN you lock your money in a payment channel. It  may devolve into a revenue stream for large payment channel operators because multiple payments from various sources will need to be closed out simultaneously. 
With Rootstock you won't give up any control or require any third party trust. (If core or classic integrates a required op code) 
* It is merge mined with bitcoin.
* It provides bitcoin incentives for miners. (fees)
* Allows for smart contracts.
* It has a 1 to 1 peg , freely interchangeable between itself and the parent bitcoin chain. I believe it is currently federated but the federation wont be necessary if core or classic integrates a required op code via a hard or soft fork.
* 10 second block interval.
* already has plugins to enable merge mining.
* already tested to 300 transactions per second. PayPal currently does 110.
* Eliminates selfish mining and latency issues via the use of the DECOR + GHOST protocols.

There is a fundamental problem with bidding to get a transaction into a block.
At the core of it your primary objective is to make a purchase or transfer value, not use bitcoin. 
Bitcoin has become a system that requires you to assess the fee with each transaction you make. This is a problem particularly for new users.
You rarely need to consider this for PayPal, bank transfers, EFTPOS, cash transactions or any other monetary exchange. The fees are set, they are known.

* DPR creates a wallet , it isn't initially encrypted.
* He upgrades his client changing save locations, moves the wallet file himself, changes the file name or backs it up somewhere. **The main point is that somehow at some point the physical area of disk that the unencrypted wallet is written to is changed or duplicated**.
* Later instead of creating a new encrypted wallet and moving the funds he just encrypts the old wallet and continues to use it.
* The unencrypted wallet or its backup are still present in their original location, even if deleted, as long as those sectors of disk are not overwritten.
* Forensic software is used to recover the deleted unencrypted keys giving access to funds.

Over the last 4 years we have seen the price rise from zero. 
If it was a company and the IPO was 4 months ago no-one would call it a bubble. 
Google Facebook etc all had IPO's after the initial growth and adoption period. The initial price rise from zero was behind the scenes. No-one saw the first 4-5 year rise from zero so no-one cried bubble. 
BTC is a currency and a technology so adoption rates influence it. 
Increased adoption means rising prices for BTC as it is a currency/asset as well as a technology. See microwave ovens, cell phone and internet adoption rates, you will see a common pattern.


Bitcoin has less use for middlemen than the standard banking system. While middlemen may fuck some things up they are likely to destroy themselves or their business first.  It is also global so regulators in one region can only screw it up for that region, and then not completely. EG: The domestic US market is slow and burdened, a lot of people trade BTC in USD but the exchanges are in Japan and Europe. (The US has only 2% of exchange volume in actual domestic business, it is all handled outside its borders.)
The 1% fee mentioned is lower than most other fees levied by the banking industry (1.5 -5%) plus fiddling with the exchange rates like PayPal does.(if you are in the US you may be unaware of the PayPal exchange rate issue)
In Fairness the middleman problems are related to the next point.


It is only as anonymous as a cash transaction and only as secure as you are willing to make it. 
If you are lazy about either .... The brutal reality is it is money. No-one is going protect you from yourself or hold your hand for free. 
Banks don't but you are used to the banks rules (don't share your pin etc) in time we will all get used to the new bitcoin rules.
Bitcoin , at present , is for those who want to take personal responsibility for their money. This extends to personal responsibility for digital security.
If your relative always asks you to remove viruses and malware because he/she doesn't  listen or want to learn about security (no matter how often you show them) Then they are not ready for bitcoin. 
Attitudes change however when money is involved.

Instead of bloating the blockchain ideas like this should be implemented on their own chain that can be merge mined in a similar manner to Namecoin. This allows for both chains to be mined simultaneously at the same rate that they would mine just one.
Merge mining consumes no more resources and still **protects the data from future bitcoin optimizations such as pruning.** Forwarding a BTC fee to miners would ensure the merge mined chain was maintained.
 Maybe bitcoin itself will one day have an integrated  merge mined infochain

Nope, inflation isn't needed. Above you should substitute value with cost.  The value of commodities and services remain relatively stable, the cost changes. 
We only use an inflationary economic system because it is what we (the average Joe) are stuck with because those who benefit control the system.
With an inflationary currency the banks, central banks, and Governments create the money. They get to use the money first. 
Those who have early access to newly created funds benefit the most. They buy a commodity or service, fractional bank deposits and loans occur based on that transaction which influences its price for the next individual or company.
By the time the new money makes it to you the inflation decreases your buying power and the cost goes up. It is a feedback loop to keep the Banks etc in profit, it isn't required.
 **Look into why LIBOR was a scandal**
Built in deflation is good for the consumer but bad for the banks and short term speculators who want to "get out"
Over time your buying power increases, you use less currency to buy the same thing.
It promotes saving over loans, this isn't bad.
Consider a $100000 mortgage:
* A loan curtails my spending.  It limits excess income because I must make that monthly repayment. My excess income (if my wages stay the same) decreases over time. I have less to spend on goods and services. Additionally my money buys less due to inflation. I am less likely to spend it on an Xbox or iPhone because I don't feel I can afford it .
* If I save and the value of my currency increases, the cost of the house in the deflationary currency falls, I have an increasing amount of excess income while saving. Additionally my money buys more due to deflation. I am actually more likely to spend it on an Xbox or iPhone because I feel I can afford it.

We don't.
I like most of Max's stuff, but he doesn't seem to quite get Bitcoin. 
Leverage, traditional loans, shorting, naked shorting and big players using financial instruments to mitigate risk (or defer it onto others) is much harder and probably detrimental in the Bitcoin economy. 
A lot of people are trying hard to introduce a system like gold pricing, where paper instruments dictate the physical price and allows obvious manipulation... that's good for no-one except a select few.
Bitcoin was designed as a currency for people. I and many others view Bitcoin as an end user currency, not a middle mans tool to extract profit by shuffling funds.
Bitcoin is a new currency and a new system. Why repeat, recreate and propagate the problems and faults of nearly every other currency?
Traditional economist will defend the usual economic practices because it is all they have ever known and they know how to profit from it, but that system is broken.
