A kind gesture, but UBI is being used as a buzzword here. This in no way supports UBI or provides useful data for it.

with no power costs this is $4.50/year. Would the metagame of mining in 2018 be seeing how many fake new accounts we can make for the farm?

are you using AMD cards on catalyst drivers? I thing 16.04 is when support stops and that'll stop working (did you mean 16.10 in your post?)

this isn't the worst idea actually

okay then you're more-than-likely mining on amdgpu-pro drivers so you'll be fine there.

[The dude never even "DID" anything]( he's a fulltime student who went right into teaching it seems.
I want a track record before someone calls BTC a ponzi scheme.

I can't get a read on Cuban
- shills random brands he buys like that failed messenger app he was all about
- shills the non-progressive side of liberal politics which seems to go completely against his branding
- shills for... bitcoin?
Can't he just be the badass on Shark Tank? I wanna love the guy.

i wouldn't advise getting in at this time unless you already own some mining equipment
that doesn't myean you should ignore crypto's though. Do research, invest, convert some money to always hold some BTC, etc...
