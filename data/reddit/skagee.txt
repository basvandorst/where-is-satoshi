You are clueless man... Current/Market price, limit orders, stop-limit orders, trailing stop-limit orders, market orders, the bid, the ask - learn how to trade. Again, you're implying something waaaaaay out there like "here's $100, just give me some Bitcoins."

I should have checked others. Poloniex doesn't have a USD deposit option. They pretty much only do transfers to/from addresses but not USD. Didn't look at Bittrex or Bitfinex yet. Just assumed they'd be the same.
**Edit:** You can't deposit USD into Bitfinex either. I'm not wasting my time checking the other half/way decent volume exchanges. And you cannot just deposit USD in Poloniex. GDAX is Coinbase (fuck that). And Bitstamp... Yeah no.

You know how you buy any Alts with BTC? Well I want to do the same thing but buy BTC with USD. That's all. Hence the "directly buy."
Someone already helped me out in this thread anyway. I thought GDAX ONLY went through Coinbase, but I learned I can deposit USD at no cost or fee and then trade and BUY BTC AT MARKET WITH USD VIA LIMIT ORDERS! Lol! Keep digging!

Thank you.

Come on man... Of course there's a Market Price... The Bid/Ask is a given, but that doesn't mean you buy on the Ask and sell on the Bid, which is what you're implying. Think in terms of Limit Orders. Trading 101...
You're also implying using Market Orders which execute at any price to fill your order. No flipping way. NO trader does that... And if you do, then you shouldn't be trading...

Haven't you heard about the new ICO?
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:18:07
Go look at it right now. It's disabled. Since when/for how long who knows...

I will check out Bitwala.
Not giving Bitstamp my SSN, photo ID, etc. Plus you can't deposit USD so why would I use just another exchange with almost the same BTC/USD volume (typically less) than Poloniex?

Wow man I'm sorry to hear. I just transferred some BTC to another account last night. Cryptoland it's unregulated and so many horror stories. 
I will say I've never had to communicate with them. Just transfer in and out and let Coinigy (soon just CrypTrader) do the rest.

Eh... Credit cards...

Actually quite happy with Poloniex plus they have the most volume for most coins in the US market: Coin/BTC.
