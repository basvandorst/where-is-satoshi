**Real-time analysis of the 2018 Crypto Crash — PART 5**
**2018 Cryptocurrency Crash (Elliott Wave): April Fools’ Rally**
The Easter Ebb saw Bitcoin markets sell-off 30% from the Equinox 21-MAR-2018 high, to the lows of April Fools’ on 01-APR-2018.
Declines of such magnitude have been tracked as Minor degree Elliott Waves; and the following are previous such examples which have occurred so far, since the crypto bear market began on 17-DEC-2017:
    21% — 06-JAN-2018 to 11-JAN-2018
    38% — 13-JAN-2018 to 17-JAN-2018
    24% — 20-JAN-2018 to 23-JAN-2018
    50% — 28-JAN-2018 to 06-FEB-2018
    28% — 05-MAR-2018 to 09-MAR-2018
    26% — 12-MAR-2018 to 18-MAR-2018
    30% — 21-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018
Given the aforementioned wave percentages, it suggests the decline of Minor degree waves in the Bitcoin bear market are approx 31% on average. 
An April Fools’ rally since 01-APR-2018 is currently underway, which is expected to retrace between a Fibonacci 38.2% to 50% of the 21-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline:
     Fibonacci 38.2% retrace of the 21-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline.
     Fibonacci 50% retrace of the 21-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline.
     Fibonacci 61.8% retrace of the entire Bitcoin market.
The average of the three aforementioned Fibonacci levels is 7626 (Bitfinex quoted prices).
Given the market has now already retraced a Fibonacci 38.2% of the 21-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline, and barring any wave subdivisions, it could suggest the April Fools’ rally is complete.
Upon completion of the April Fools’ rally, another 30%-40% sell-off leg is expected to target approx 4257, which represents the Fibonacci 78.6% retrace of the entire Bitcoin market.

Short interest in Bitcoin has now broken above the highs of Oct 2017, and marking new all-time highs.
Oct/Nov 2017 is when the third Elliott Wave ended, and fourth wave pullback began in Bitcoin.
Shortly afterwards, Bitcoin began its final fifth wave, where price exponentially accelerated in a parabolic curve to commence the 'mania' phase from $5400 to $19891.
The 'mania' phase is typically when public interest takes hold driven by media attention, enthusiasm, greed and delusion.
Since Jan 2018, the parabolic price curve has collapsed and retraced 95% of the fifth wave 'mania' phase. 
With short interest in Bitcoin now breaking the highs of Oct 2017, it appears the public are now beginning to capitulate and offloading HODL positions driven by margin calls; and the reality of the bubble bursting is only now being grasped as the 'blow-off' phase gains momentum.

Rising price has now reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the 03-APR to 06-APR decline.
In addition, price appears to be creating negative divergence with declining RSI on the hourly.
Was expecting a run-up towards +7500; however, weakening technicals are suggesting the rally is losing momentum.
The following additional short position has been ordered:
BTCUSD (BITFINEX)
OPEN: 7100
CLOSE: 4257 (&amp; open-ended, 1000?)
STOP: 7510
RISK: 5.8%
REWARD: 40%
Quite the spike up this morning in Bitcoin, and quite unexpected!
From the 6440 (Bitfinex) low set on April Fools’ 01-APR-2018, the Bitcoin market rallied 17% and then gave up 13% of those gains before trading sideways in a choppy 10-day affair. Today, the market broke out of that range and has thus far rallied 20%.
The April Fools’ rally from 6440 was expected to be in the range of approx 20%. However, with today’s spike, the rally peaked at almost 26% thus far.
Doesn’t appear to be a news driven price spike which is quite unusual. However, with waning sentiment and short interest at all-time highs; it appears the price spike has been exacerbated by a short-covering rally squeezing out bearish positions. 
Despite the magnitude of the rally, the price action from the lows of 01-APR-2018 are still within the parameters of an ongoing b-wave with no structural change to the Elliott Wave model thus far.
Currently expecting any additional upside to be contained within approx 8132 which represents the Fibonacci 61.8% retracement of the entire decline from 21-MAR to 01-APR.
7600 represents the Fibonacci 61.8% retracement level of the entire Bitcoin market; and so, taking out that price point on the daily close would be an initial sign to suggest fading bullish momentum. 
Bitcoin remains overall bearish until 9200 is taken out to the upside.
Speculative and guesswork Elliott Wave model indicative of price and structure not time, as follows:
Since the April Fool’s low of 6245 (Bitfinex), the Bitcoin market has rallied 30% thus far. 
The upward price spike on 12-APR saw a 20% gain in a single day. The rapid move caught the bulls by surprise with the majority not participating as indicated by the BTCUSDLONGS index, which declined on the day instead of surging upwards to correlate with price action. It appears the price spike has been exacerbated by a short-covering rally squeezing out bearish positions as indicated by the BTCUSDSHORTS index which collapsed 40%.
Quite an April Fool’s which has fooled both the bulls &amp; bears. As of yet, there still doesn’t appear to be any news correlation as a driver for the price spike which is quite unusual.
It was initially assumed that the rally from the 01-APR low was retracing the decline from 21-MAR, and the magnitude of such a wave limited to circa 20%. However, the magnitude of the rally has thus far exceeded the mid-March rally which saw price appreciate 27%. Consequently, it appears the current rally is actually retracing the entire decline from 05-MAR to 01-APR; and subsequently, a degree adjustment to the Elliott Wave model is required.
From the 6245 low set on 01-APR, the Bitcoin market rallied 17% and then gave up 13% of those gains before trading sideways in a choppy 10-day affair. On 12-APR, the market broke out of that range and has thus far rallied 25%. A net gain of approx 30% so far. The meandering price action prior to the breakout price spike has been identified as a Symmetrical Triangle pattern where consolidating and tightening price would give way to a breakout.
The following are Fibonacci retracements of the 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline of where the current rally may terminate:
Lower Range
 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
 50% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
Upper Range
 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
 50% Fibonacci retracement of entire Bitcoin market.
At this stage, the rally is expected to complete within the aforementioned Lower Range targets, where the average is 8752. Currently, taking out 8064 would indicate weakening upside momentum.
Speculative guesswork Elliott Wave model indicative of price and structure not time:
Rally losing momentum?
—Price has reached the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the decline from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
—Rising price action is creating negative divergence against declining overbought RSI on the 4-hr.
