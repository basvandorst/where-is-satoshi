I blame the January altfest for this to be honest.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:55:34
I hope you weren't shaken out. Look at that beautiful one hour green dildo.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:57:36
Easier said than done.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:45:39
You'll be fine. Spread buys out next time if you can afford it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:56:20
You'll regret if you sell. Speaking from a bit of experience. You need to ride it out and buy if you have the fiat.

Reflections and everything. 11/10
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:30
I trade the market with a bit of my stack for fun, but it's always so hard to get right hah.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:42:10
I hope you lads and lassies have the $12k memes ready.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:22:48
I mean... you still bought at $24 so just think about that rather than the negative.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:12:04
Everyone back in the "flippening" in November severely regrets it, but good luck...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:48
Very unimpressed with Coinbase. Some serious insider trading going on today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:55
A very quick announcement preceded by a bcash pump in the hours before hmm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:06
He was very stupid. I was just being nice.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:23:02
if it goes under about $5.9k it'll crash hard until the mid to low $5ks. wait for it to level a bit. but it will bounce back hard.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:59:32
That's why I put it in quotations, but a lot of chat seemed to be about that. Plus a lot of exchanges were going to cover it themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:36:41
Yo I would buy now. There was a slight dip and it's now a steadying period. It's going to go up again before the fork.
Edit: Told you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:32:53
It might fall, but it might not fall lower than the current value considering it has 2 weeks of possible growth to go.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:14:46
You shouldn't be buying off a credit card... unless it's an interest free and you can realistically pay the sum back over time.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:07:38
I initially bought in a big chunk of what I could afford to lose and now continue to buy in over time.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:53:49
Ah yes good point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:26:16
It's fucking insane. We're going to need to start making landmarks every $5k at this rate.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:42:31
It's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:34:46
Yes, but by the time the west was using the modern smartphone they were stuck by a growing redundant old school keitai. Like everyone below, I was referring to the modern touchscreen smartphone. Japanese tech peaked in the 90's/early 00's for most things.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:01
It might go down further, but just remember THIS IS THE DIP. It's easy to look back after it and go "oh should have bought then damn".
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:41:51
for less than 12 hours
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:35:12
I can't help but feel there is a dip coming, but there is no dip. I want to buy more too.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:36:21
You should be in a Bitcoin documentary or something. That's class.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:53:30
Use gdax man.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:18
I mean it was down -20% and there is currently very little FUD. It's all good news on the horizon.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:43:09
it's gonna be 10k by end of the year mate
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:40
Mate that 0.45 is going to worth a fortune. You did all you could.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:13:19
It's a very uncertain time to buy right at the moment, so I would probably pursue your cost averaging and perhaps buy a bigger chunk or two when things have settled/your happy with it. I think the market is bullish and will be up at $8-9k minimum by end of year, but there could be a correction soon towards $6k. You need to think the long term hold though and don't invest more than you could lose forever in a day.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:39:58
It's been some ride.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:46:49
It is quite surprising that it's popular in Japan.
For example, fax machines and Internet Explorer are still incredibly popular there.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:44:45
They're generally quite bad at picking up new tech although they do hold on to it with love as you mention.
They were also late to smartphones, but the iPhone now rules supreme. They're also quite poor at start-ups etc. The robots/camera/car industries have maintained, but things like shinkansen are from the 60's!
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:22:34
It will need a big(ish) correction at some stage anyway and I think a lot of long term holders might decide to cash out a fair chunk at $10k. People are strange and it's a big barrier. I fully expect to keep going up though in the long run. Who knows what it will be at in 12 months. It moves fast.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:35:19
Mate I have no fucking idea and nobody does. I would buy half now to satisfy your fear of missing out if you don't have any. And then buy the other half around the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:43:57
Really doubt it'll go under 5k ever again and if it does it'll be dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:12:41
Holy shit
So are we crashing due to the recent rally being for "free coins" or taking off towards $10k?
Edit: It just burst through $7500 like it was coming out of John Hurt's chest.
Edit2: Nosedive back to $7500 argh.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:09:08
10k by Jan at latest.
Although I think we'll see a bigger correction around that psychological milestone rather than now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:26:35
I follow that account out of interest, but the other day someone replied with proof that $20 million of recent Tether was from a genuine big buyer and they just ignored it. Who knows who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:38:16
Bounce from x2 competition failing. 
I don't have much faith in it myself. It's all mostly being pumped in Korea.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:15:08
It's interesting, but Bitcoin isn't a standard stock to invest in. You could also say that graph already happened back in 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:02:49
Bought in more at $6.3k earlier. Will buy more if it cracks $6 (but will wait to plateau as it will crash hard).
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:29:56
I'm ready and waiting like a hawk. I bought more last Mon/Tue when it was a wee dip, but only got paid yesterday. I might even hold off until the fork just to sell. If it keeps going up then that's all good as I've bought enough early on. It's all a bit mad.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:54:00
Hi. I moved to Japan in 2007 and used the "feature phone" for about 2 years and they were not even close to the first iPhone I got in 2008/2009. That's just my opinion, but I experienced it first hand.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:10
I bought a top of the range keitai from AU in 2007. It wasn't a modern smartphone equivalent. The first iPhone only came out in the US in summer 2007 I think.

There can only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Banks can just print some faces on paper as much as they want.
