I don't call BTC "responsible" good hedge either. You can still easily get funds stolen without great lawful backup, price can swing like hell, such big gox matter isn't yet settled and the protocol is still quite in "beta" stage from software development perspective.

Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox which collapsed in February announced on 20th that they have found they're still in possession of the 200,000 BTC out of the 850,000 BTC that was reported to be lost.
According to the lawyer, they found them on the 7th of this month by searching through a storage on the internet called a "wallet" which was being used by MtGox up until June 2011.
MtGox has reported that they have lost almost all of the 850,000 BTC owned while filing for bankruptcy protection on February 28th.

Which person is from okcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:44:26
I think it is the opposite. Gox has earned something over 200k BTC in the last 3 years from fees and I'm not sure what they had to spend them for.
On the other hand, since Gox has been usually higher in price, people do not actually buy at gox, meaning people will deposit on other exchanges, use gox to withdraw. So, gox will just get BTC sent and have fiat withdrawn without new deposits.
I really hope Gox can keep their price low after all these panic or they will run out of BTC if all they're doing is suppress their BTC price by selling them on their exchange trying to attract depositers.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:08:08
They won't reflect all of our balances if they open up a new exchange. That would be the end on day 1.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:40:57




Not sure what you are disagreeing with. People send BTC to an exchange with higher price and cash out, simple. That exchange will have higher BTC balance, less fiat balance.
Why do you blindly believe gox does not ever get involved in trading? At least we've seen evidence of insider trading.
I'm basically not really panicking and believe withdrawal matters will calm down in weeks.

I don't understand how you feel 'soon'. Salaries are paid in fiat and are typically stored in bank accounts where cc are linked to but to use Bitcoin that is 1 extra step you need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin, even when we do get plenty of exchanges/ATM worldwide within the next decade, that extra step is not going away soon at all until main transactions are done in crypto currencies. It will only be as good as rechargeable prepaid cards.

Yes, but only if it gives enough reason for them to adopt. Too bad I can't find too much good reason for average citizens to dive into it. Merchants can benefit greatly as credit cards charge 10% off sales, which is a big deal for them and sometimes that 10% is actually thrown onto the customers which is against the rule.

I think you're over complicating the matter. Once average citizens have a good reason to use, it can flourish. But Japanese citizens usually do not go adventurous on newest consumer technology, partly due to language barrier unless invented inside.

Hold on a second... I'm a Japanese and lived in here for most of my life but I do not see people avoiding credit cards at all. People use it all over the place from shopping in the streets (yes I see average moms use it for $30 level shopping) and buying stuff online. People rather use cash for large purchases as credit card monthly pay limit is rather small these days by default (like $1k).
In my opinion, real reason behind Japanese lagging is based on 2 factors.
For one, Japanese yen is good enough, people never expect it would devalue to the point for them to avoid it and alternative way of storing value does not come into mind unless for investment reasons.
(Yen declining in value is rather welcomed here right now, it had been too strong for exporters to take hits, and it is not uncontrollably falling. So, it won't be the driving force for people to start using Bitcoin.)
For two, we don't do English (shame but truth) and anything that's foreign to them, they avoid unless they're presented in native language and makes sense to their life. Bitcoin right now sounds nifty and feels handy to pass around to others but we're such a closed country, we rarely want to send cash abroad, so I think the benefits of Bitcoin is largely shadowed along the uncertainty involved in a new system and people do not have enough reason to take the chances.
The media is slowly taking attention on Bitcoin as "revolutionary internet currency with risks" and some people are starting to notice on introductory level but there's probably got to be some domestic service accepting or some famous figure starting a campaign for the people to realize and start doing something with it. Japanese are pretty influential by the media especially when famous people start advertising but that's not going to happen unless Bitcoin can serve good purpose for Japanese.
As a Japanese citizen, I feel Bitcoin is handy to use if it is accepted for shopping around or on the internet but people are generally having hard time finding a good reason to adopt it. Perhaps, someone can give me good reason how Bitcoin is beneficial in such a society and I'll try to pass the words around.

Only a handful of people doing arbitrage is enough for bunch of bots to move the same, before arbitrage takes full effect.
It's quite possible that it's Huobi users (bots) just doing its work trying to gain their little % on every move than somehow Huobi itself is monitoring Gox...
This post is not conclusive at all, you only wanted to set the conclusion without enough evidence. To prove, site's orderbook and API trade history needs to be compared because the site's orderbook cannot list coins that don't exist but trade history can or think how you would fake if you were on the side who wants to fake it without people noticing.

No shit, the Bitcoin believers' money is being sucked out by the insiders.
Besides, if you can be so sure the market will move as you predict at the time you expect, you might as well 20x leverage, see 5% movement turn into double your holding in no time.
Let's see how that turns out to be when they've done that about 5 times now.
They must be so spoiled about the opportunity.

Hi Gavin. I'm late but hopefully you can answer these.
Lately, people have left the Bitcoin foundation mentioning various problems and it is being blamed about its board members for various accusations but what do you think about the current state of the foundation from someone inside?
Secondly, this is more of a political question but as Bitcoin gets traction worldwide, do you think some countries would refuse to fully accept its use when some of the Bitcoin shares are already distributed in the U.S and other early adopting countries and making random people even 100x richer than already is by pooling their own money? Do you think that some countries would rather take their own alt or at one point will there be an official restart for everyone to start fair as beyond experiment or do you think Bitcoin can be taken to a global standard, assuming no disaster happens?
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:16:00

For one, 0 fee trading does not account for valid trade volume, for two that is wishful thinking. I live in Japan but I don't think anybody is eager to swap their yen to BTC when cashless system is well laid out.

@_date: 2017-02-21 00:46:32
Everyone talks about the price movement past the point of the decision but if it does get approved, Bitcoin development needs to be more responsible as well.
And by that I mean, we can't have DAO class mess when much larger amount of money and people are involved and let the discussion become into some cyber war.
The discussion for hard fork would be totally more complicated as so many more people from outside tech field and money get involved and some could simply voice out of financial return of tomorrow only or buy people to be on their side.

You're right from an ideological point of view but the world consists of not just the tech and heart but people with money who don't want to lose the investment overnight (who would be responsible for their employees etc), especially when they have been fair to the very community that is trying to destroy the current PoW.

Why would exchanges vote using people's coins that they don't own?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:17:13
Exchanges have declared to treat them as alt, buggy as who knows what could happen under production, many voice that we do not seek Chinese centralized coin and at worst PoW may be changed to make the hostile fork silent once and for all makes one feel almost confident about the situation.
But if it goes through PoW route, it will certainly cause dump following a lot of negative news crushing many business on the way.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:42:57
The Core has Implementations off the spec and you have to figure the deviations from the source code which isn't the easiest code to read followed by countless hours of testing to match the behavior and I guess that makes it hard to come up with any wide spread alternate implementation.

If the media writes it as if miners taking fees is somewhat evil, I'd be damned. They're the one securing the network from some random miners. Now that whether they're securing the Bitcoin network is becoming questionable.

@_date: 2017-03-26 14:51:32
But if you think about it, if people need to intervene on these occasions to tell who is right and wrong, then it seems to deviate from what Bitcoin is. The ideal trust less nature of Bitcoin can go so far in the real world.
I'm not disagreeing about the need to decentralize the current flock of mining power in 1 country but it means we have to trust the distributed-ness of the miners apart from the mathematical logics.

Demand was before the split to get the free BCH.
Can't grasp what kind of supply and demand you're talking about.

- Ask him if he's ready to lose it all in the worst case. If yes, go next. (I got goxxed)
- Set when to exit, for both low and high if this is a short term investment (like within a year. You said long term but writing it anyway, it would semi apply to long term.) Because otherwise the only time you'll exit will be when things go crap beyond your recognition. (Like when it becomes quarter the value of today's and I've had it happen to myself before but it did recover in the long run.) If this is a long term (like 3+ years hoping Bitcoin gets more mainstream adoption and aims for larger return, go next.
- HODL (like I do and don't panic when you see a red waterfall on the chart. Noob trading is the easiest way to lose balance.) But do remember Bitcoin is experimental and as such if it fails at some point or the exchange you keep Bitcoin on gets corrupted or you lose key to your own wallet etc, it could become worthless but your dad knows that by the time you read here.)
- And finally, make sure you set him up a reliable wallet, so you don't lose it. (Whether some online service or in your own wallet, make sure to take time and learn what's best for you.)

Couldn't they have come up with a better adjustment method instead of having have to let all miners coordinate by turning their mining on and off so that the difficulty goes down faster?
This is making it so difficult for people who wants to send and hope that their multiple confirmations won't take until the next day. They made 4 confirmations in 2 hours, 0 for the next 10 hours and they have to do this weird cycle for a while.

If you can think that say 10000 BTC never moved, there's no way to know the key is lost or the owner is a serious hodler. So, no.

Because if you had traded BCH for BTC, the price of BCH can plummet but it doesn't necessarily mean that the price of BTC will go up. In fact, people get free BTC and they might sell that for fiat or alt.

If you've been monitoring, it was mining at a speed of 50 blocks an hour, followed by a 7 hour gap, then a 3 hour gap between blocks and later on, it increases back to 30 blocks an hour, all because the difficulty keeps bouncing back and forth with that 12 hour adjustment rule and once the regular difficulty adjustment arrives way too soon, as in 3 to 4 days instead of 14 days, miners just go back to mine BTC, leaving the chain with high difficulty and low hash rate and who knows how many more of these cycles do they have to do to stay in a normal block time. Currently, no services can ever hope to use it with such varying confirmation times.

There are 2 BCH flows minus the BCH holders.
- The ones who sold BCH for BTC. These never increased BTC price but some are bound to sell BTC.
- The ones who sold BCH for fiat. Some of them can buy BTC to raise BTC value. (But if that was the plan, they may have gone directly to BTC.)
No idea about the ratio but not sure if this pushes BTC price significantly.

This post is very irresponsible.
Why do you even assume newbies handling of their phone is always safer than exchanges?
You may advice people that exchanges can sometimes get hacked but "newbies" can easily reset/lose phones/credentials to their wallet and... wow, insta gone too.
I would suggest writing the risk of holding your coins to yourself than just shouting mindlessly. You don't want to take responsibility of "newbies" losing coins by blindly following the advice without knowing what it takes to keep them securely privately.
And if you're more serious than being a loudspeaker, you might as well put some track record of exchanges losing people's coins which can trigger newbies more easily.
And also note where to choose reliable wallets from. I've heard scam wallets appeared on app stores but you don't mention a bit about it.

Use seems real easy. 
Getting it, probably isn't but the reason Bic Camera adopted for every store country wide was due to overwhelming demand when it was only testing in 1 store.
You talked as if Japan is some kind of African village where people don't use credit card and don't know what ATM is...
The reason Japan doesn't need Bitcoin that much as a form of payment is we already have plenty of methods as digital payment and Bitcoin doesn't suddenly give much convenience over traditional methods, which must be same for any well developed cities around the world.
I see no basis on your assumptions really.

If I get it right, the limit is supposed to suppress DoS'ing the blockchain filling blocks with unneccesary transactions and thus if you set an automatic rule which Satoshi could've easily placed it there if it's the right solution, could just keep inflating block sizes for no good reason with malicious intents. So I think this is a balance between transaction volume demands and limiting the volume to make sure our technology can keep up with it.

@_date: 2017-09-26 19:56:52
Because they think they're "Bitcoin"? And asking the core devs to rather put RP on...
Which is funny because there will be Core and Core+RP both in existence after hard fork and I wonder which core devs would even want to cause further unnecessary confusion like that...
In such a case, there will be people supporting both of the Cores... Exchanges are going to cry out loud how the scene is a complete mess once again. But I'm pretty certain core devs have no interest messing up the community for s2x like that.
It will be a snow ball effect once businesses leave s2x as Core will not likely to put RP for themselves and no one wants to deal with RP less fork.

I wouldn't say so, as pretty much every cryptocurrency is built, at least on the idea of Bitcoin and it's more like TCP protocol of the Internet and not one of an early commercial competitor and we need Bitcoin to keep proving this model works. It's too early for anything to replace it.

GS prediction was by a person who predicted BTC tops at $3800 and later "fixed" it at $4800. Let's see when she "fixes" again when it doesn't look like it will reach $2200. You people are so sensitive about the word "Goldman Sachs".

Not only there is no urgent need, it was just 1 segment of the entire community of miners, services, users and developers who even signed it.
And I'm even more worried that there's limited developer resources on 2x. You can't just hire top notch blockchain devs just because you have money like a designer. They're rather scarce and 1 big mistake and the chain loses credibility.

@_date: 2017-10-12 13:20:35
You don't...
Say, you have $1,000 in cash and buy 0.2 BTC. If BTC goes up by $100, you get $20 return, which is 2% return.
But on leveraged margin trading, say, 5x, you borrow $5,000 by putting your $1,000 as collateral and buy 1 BTC, so if BTC goes up by $100, you get $100 return, which would be 10% return but at the same time if BTC goes down by $100, you lose $100, which would be 10% loss, despite the market only moving 2%. And in most places, if your collateral cuts below 50%, you're forced to sell your positions, meaning if BTC goes down by $500, you will be losing $500 and your collateral would be worth $500, which is 50% of what you provided and you've effectively lost 50% of your fund by seeing the market move by 10%.
It just makes the swings more volatile and that's how you can lose 90% even if the market only moved like 30% or so, which was dumb part on me as a newb trader.
This is not an investment advice, you shouldn't do high risk high return, if you don't know what you're into like the parent poster. Only do if you can screw up 90% like I did.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:47:31
Say, you got a $1m to begin with and the price was at 28600 CNY ($4400) on Chinese market,
1. Short with leverage and sell with 3x your fund, that would be about 680 BTC you owe.
2. (Announce China bans bitcoin)
3. Shit goes down by 5800 CNY ($900 which it did) and closing the position gives you $610k.
4. You go long with $1.61m with 3x your fund again, which would be about 1380 BTC.
5. (Announce China didn't intend to ban Bitcoin entirely)
6. Shit goes back up by $700 (theoretically), you get $966k.

For someone that insightful, is 10% gain that interesting? It's only interesting to people who think about converting back to fiat soon.
I'm not too excited until it reaches something like $2k which means the world has gotten over the gox fiasco and is going forward.

I doubt this is the case.
I don't know what he thinks about Litecoin but Litecoin was pretty much useless as price showed as $4 back then where many others had some sort of invention on top of Bitcoin.
But when SegWit was placed on it before Bitcoin, suddenly Litecoin had its use as a good real world test bed for anything too new for Bitcoin to take it in a rush and while SegWit is a way forward for Bitcoin, that wasn't exactly the reason how Litecoin rallied hard, so I wouldn't bet too big for Bitcoin to go that much just because of Segwit.
Besides, we will still have those miners wanting to hard fork away making current Bitcoin likely to lose tremendous amount of hash power and the 2x's path isn't still clear as well, so, this is a temporary rally that will end before hitting the next road block.
I feel he was too happy to see his kid become 10x its worth.

Should keep the amount quiet. People can know how much you will have.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:40:34
It does feel similar when it hit $100 and people thought it has broken into a new level and sometime later it just kept going up like there's no tomorrow up to $266 followed by some serious crash.
Back then it had a good reason of Cyprus crisis but not even sure what the driving force is now. It's about time people get nervous following the 1/10 price point history of the past.
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:26:07
If you observe, this is only steadily climbing up, instead of the usual sharp rise followed by a small sell off and repeating that a few times.
That's what I (and perhaps OP) feels weird about.

If you're a noob trader like me , it's usually better to just HODL. Don't want to tell how much I lost by trading been swung around but maybe about 40%. Still net positive thanks to the rallies but oh boy.

Price will not go down just because there was a scaling debate...
Bubbles do pop you know. It went 3 times the price in just a few months, so much sell power was reserved at the top and it just happened and new comers seem to panic sell more than long time traders.

Earliest news is after 20 more blocks are signaled in the next 35 blocks (should roughly take 23 more blocks considering slush/f2 joined at perhaps around 0am UTC) claiming that BIP91 locked in and there will be no split on the 1st.
The rest of activation process should already be priced in at this moment.

About time they learnt HODL works better.

Depends how important 5 BTC is to you. If you don't care, you might as well aim for alts for bigger risk/return but if it matters why not wait until the uncertainty has settled?
It's possible that some exchange, possibly smaller ones, without enough technical expertise may go bankrupt overnight for picking the wrong chain.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:29:46
Hard to say. If they sell their coins and then stopped signaling but before the price tanks, if another pool joins the signaling and the price goes up, they would get ruined.

If Vinnik only laundered and passed the coins away, then he may not be accounted for all the gox theft to return from whatever he/btc-e has but if he kept them, it may be easy to just confiscate whatever he has.

He got his private keys stolen and didn't do anything until 650k BTC left. It's more likely that he leaked it as a twist.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:23:02
Having private keys stolen as a negligence and failed to report the situation to customers and let customers deposit till the last minute does not really change his place even if he really was robbed. And then of course, I hope he wasn't part of the theft.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:26:48
I know, I live in Japan.
Nothing was illegal about Bitcoin. The big difference was the dropping of the consumer tax but that was after the rally onJuly 1st and somehow the price never changed on any of the large Japanese exchanges on the day.
GMO starting a new exchange may have had an impact but we already had enough exchanges to cover demand.
I'd say those points weren't as big as you mentioned but I see bitFlyer having pretty large volume on their FX trading though it has no fees.

@_date: 2017-07-20 15:41:21
Why not take BitcoinCash and 2x part of SegWit2x into account? Those will certainly cause some uncertainty especially if BCC takes a lot of the hash power away. Of course, if the Jihan and friends leave to BCC, it can certainly rally well later.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:23:15

- You have no idea if it rallied like this from a few years ago since the debate has been active.
- The number 3000 only came out of one's hopeful assumption with 0 study.

What backup? A $40 bil industry cannot have a backup with some clone coin on a completely different blockchain.
Absolutely, this "backup" aspect was what made litecoin sit at $4, that does not serve as any backup.
IF, Bitcoin fails, Litecoin is not going to do any good with it, as it has nothing new. Either same people with same politics flock into it, or its over, although IOTA or something could take the spot light then.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:53:32

China and Korea seems to have a tight regulation moving money out. Japan doesn't seem so, but still higher by about 3% than US/EU but watch Japanese price fall by 8% on July 1st when it becomes consumer tax free, in fact there will be some dump before then. Not sure if the rest of the world follows the movement as it's just a local cause though.

Can you explain what that "demand" is? Or are you just talking out of the result that there must have been a demand more than the rest of the world?
China and Korea seems to have a tight control over moving capital out of their nations and thus arbitrage cannot just happen as smooth and seems to be stuck without getting averaged.

Just mean you are counting down for CNY to rise above and stay over 20k as USD is only getting dragged up along with it and USD 3k is just coincidentally close to CNY 20k.

Since there is no de facto cryptocurrency, everyone spreads all over the next possible standard currency.

Activating segwit alone does not suddenly resolve the scaling problem entirely until that next 2MB is dealt with and isn't the segwit pump already priced in? The alts were pumped as they were not expected to activate it first.

@_date: 2017-06-10 17:56:23
Fix what?
It was a flaw in the protocol that jamming the block will give more incentive to the miners.
To resolve such a conflict of interest, either one side has to bleed or find a middle ground and apparently no one wants to bleed.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:57:17
Perhaps, spend 10 to invest for yourself now,  and if you want to play safe, sell about 30 and keep as cash (unless you live in a country with quick devaluing currency) and if  you believe in Bitcoin's future, keep the rest as Bitcoin.
Investing in yourself means, spend on anything you are interested on. Hobby, study, gears, relationship, trip and anything.
Experience is important in life and you have a chance to take some without the financial limit most of your friends have.
Gain is nothing unless you spend.
I figured I should've spent some when I had 200+ on gox during China run up to $1000+.
You can spend only until something happens.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:48:53
Banks and miners are so different... You just group people who are rich and make them your enemy. Please, this is caused by Bitcoin protocol that you love but was an overlooked flaw that gives miners an incentive against the users.
Someone has to bleed to fix this and I'm leaned toward UASF on this to budge through the conflict.

Just by looking at the charts it was clear it was the Chinese who pulled the market today. What's with the analysis?
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:01:35
Really, check the price of the leading currency. Other currency numbers are just a byproduct of the arbitrage.
I've been seeing how Chinese yuan is being smacked down as soon as it enters 20k and finally making like 3rd attempt to get above it which may coincidentally take USD above 3000 soon too.

One word, business.
Private holders may not care much as they are supposedly putting in the amount they can lose but business owners have responsibilities of others and duty to protect their investments... But of course teens only put $100 and yell however they like.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:13:26
Actually, they can because they can just become the next miners that exchanges support and old chain miners have no choice but join them.
Mining time goes through the roof only if the old chain miners don't want to join the new one but that will be unlikely, even if that's vague to you.

@_date: 2017-06-10 17:42:14
Actually not entirely true. Miners cannot survive without users (exchanges as a way to convert to fiat) and obviously exchanges' interests lie among the users where they get their money from.
Longer chain is stronger in the protocol but it could be manually ignored (as in UASF)

This is a pretty obvious move by the government. I treat it as a positive news and it can't be better than this for the moment and I'm glad China isn't trying to obliterate‎ Bitcoin just because.
If people, for once, calm the Bitcoin enthusiasm and pretend they run a country from government's perspective, you don't want to put your own entire country's fate on a single piece of software...
One reason that people are skeptical about Bitcoin adoption is, thinking about, does it actually work? without cheating? my money suddenly won't vaporize one day due to bug in Bitcoin logic?
It has been years and no one thus far found any critical bug to have Bitcoin die out but why would a government put its entire country on risk by letting it run on banks and everything unregulated and depend its fate on a piece of software? We know software can have bugs, even if it looked safe for years.
China did a brilliant move by saving its own country (quite obvious that they have that interest) but did not unnecessarily shoot down an invention just because it felt noisy about it.

What's on 1st?
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:07:00
Weird it said the 5 times increase in price (10 times up and then halved) was due to FRB taking positive impression on Bitcoin and never ever mentioned about Chinese entering the market. Wonder if that was intentional due to political stress or just dumb mistake of not checking the facts or maybe just wrapped the entire boost that started from that hearing.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:10:53
Not so good. I live in Japan but simply put, no one knows about Bitcoin, not even people I work with in the IT field. Recently, some of them had started to know about it but seems still some way ahead until certain amount of people start trading let alone be able to use much in the country.
There was once a mentioning of only 1% of Mt.Gox accounts are actually from Japan... That speaks it all.

If this was all about bots trading against bots inside an exchange to artificially pump the price as early as October when prices started to rocket, this is very scary.
This impact is worse than just okcoin itself being accused because we are now in doubt of other exchanges as well. (At least the exchanges that used to lead market prices.)
If it turns out to be the price of BTC and LTC were never supposed to be 50% of the peak and with all these Chinese regulation tightening things up, it won't give good impact on market prices for the time being.
Below is just a nonsense theory, but if Chinese government is tightening things up as they found this out themselves, it sounds all screwed up.
