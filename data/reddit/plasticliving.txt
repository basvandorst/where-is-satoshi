Bittorrent has never been banned, because it's not feasible to ban a completely p2p network.  Although they have banned (or crippled) bittorrent's predecessors (napster, kazaa, limewire, etc) much like they banned bitcoin's predecessors (e-gold, liberty dollar, etc.).  Some governments have even gone after or tried to block major bittorent trackers (like the pirate bay) with limited success.
The bottom line is they would love to ban bittorent just as much as they will eventually love to ban bitcoin.  Easier said than done tough.

A good intro video can be found [here](
To get bitcoins you can either 'mine' them (crunch some numbers on your computer until you find a solution) or buy them.
Mining isn't really profitable any more unless you really know what your doing.  You can buy them from many exchanges, the largest being [mtgox](  What country are you in?  The easiest way to buy bitcoins varies by country.

I don't think you've really addressed the argument.


I thought the argument was that fiat currencies have value because they are backed by the force of the state, and require people to pay taxes in that currency?
Also, the "Empirical Evidence" section is pretty weak. It was an 'empiric fact' that Enron was a good investment for a while.  It was an 'empiric fact' that investing with Bernie Madoff was a good idea.  Time proved these things wrong.
I don't think bitcoin is monopoly money or a ponzi scheme, but I don't think this addresses the strongest version of our opponents argument.

The tragedy of the commons can be applied to any public good.


No, it's a [public good](  A [good]( is anything "that is intended to satisfy some wants or needs of a consumer and thus has economic utility."  I'm sure we can both agree that Bitcoin has economic utility, yes?
It's a *public* good because it is *non-excludable* (nobody can stop you from using bitcoin) and *non-rivalrous* (my use of the secured blockchain ledger does not affect your use of the same.. at least until we hit a block size limit)


Yes, I agree that it's unclear that this is even an issue and that transactions fees will probably be enough incentive, but the whole premise of this discussion is "what happens if or when block rewards (reward+fees) aren't a large enough incentive to secure the blockchain?"

I currently have one wallet that is a mix of bitcoins I've received from various exchanges, friends for whom I've bought beer, and bitcoins I've bought off of people face-to-face.  I've used a new address for every incoming batch of bitcoins.
Does any client out there allow fine-grained control over outgoing transactions, such that I can determine which addresses in my wallet are used? Ie, if I wanted to make a risqué transaction, I could select only addresses from btc acquired from face-to-face cash transactions?

My thoughts on the matter:
1) Any attempts to 'glorify' Bitcoin, while possibly appealing to current users, would probably just invite ridicule from the wider population.  *Branding* Bitcoin is one thing, and if we want to do that we should look at successful/powerful brands (think apple: sleek, simple, elegant) and the target demographic (see  but creating an entire complex mythology around Bitcoin makes it look cheap and us like kids playing D&amp;D.
2) The words "magic the gathering" should **never** be used when trying to convince others of the benefits of Bitcoin (and this is coming from a former MtG player)
3) The "empty throne" icon, to me, seems like a libertarian-themed one.  Bitcoin is already an easy sell to anyone with a libertarian/free-market anarchist bent.  Chances are these people have already heard of it, and if they are not already convinced of its merits, they likely will be once Bitcoin becomes useful to them personally.  Therefore the brand should appeal to others who might not be convinced *for idealogical reasons* that bitcoin is a good idea.  For example your average young, hip, savvy liberal.  We should be branding for them, using concepts of "openness", "diversity", "accessibility" and "empowerment" (like the way Ubuntu is branded) rather than concepts of "no authority" or "no hierarchy".

Well the entities creating Africoin could mine privately for an arbitrary amount of time before publishing the blockchain a la solidcoin.
But even if they didn't, then at least these early adopters would be working *for* Africoin instead of the other way around.  And Africa wouldn't have to initially give up resources for the privilege of using Bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Bitcoin.  But I don't see any state adopting it.  They have absolutely nothing to gain and everything to lose (startup costs, control over inflation targets).  Sure, *individual* Africans could see enormous benefits, and I'd be excited about a grassroots charity/effort devoted to that end.  But Bitcoin isn't going to hit the mainstream via state endorsement.


Well, at the end of this year, mining payout is scheduled to drop to 25btc/block.  If 51% of the miners were to say "screw that, lets keep paying ourselves 50btc" then that's what will happen.

Ok so disclaimer up front: I love bitcoin and do not think it's a ponzi scheme.


By this definition, then bitcoin *is* a ponzi scheme.  Here's my reasoning: 
Assuming bitcoins are only exchanged for USD, then for bitcoin to have a stable value, the equilibrium:
incoming USD = incoming BTC * USD/BTC exchange rate
Must be satisfied.  
7200 bitcoins are created everyday. If we assume the exchange rate has stabilized (like many around here claim, I remain cautiously optimistic) then we're at an equilibrium, and we can work out how much money is entering the bictoin economy everyday (7200BTC * ~5BTC/USD = 36000 USD)
Obviously, there will be more terms on each side of the equation to satisfy other currencies in use, but this illustrates the idea.
If there is no new incoming money then the value of a bitcoin would keep declining in order to satisfy the equilibrium (and would eventually fall to zero, as long as new bitcoins are being created)
@_date: 2012-08-24 00:24:26
I love the idea! 
The tl;dr is Figure 2 on page 5.  The 'marker address' is your trusted identity.
..but what does the loop accomplish?  Wouldn't it be simpler just to include a 0.01BTC input directly from the marker address?  Is the 0.01 BTC output address somehow important in a way I'm missing?

Looking at blockchain stats is tricky because it's hard to tell what is actual use, what is speculation and what is general messing around because the friction is so low.

EDIT: So I'm wrong (see genjix's post below).  These BIPs  aren't about implementing m-of-n transactions.  I guess it's about shortening m-of-n transactions so that they can fit into QR codes...
I'll give it a go, but my understanding is fuzzy at best...
Basically, they are two proposals for supporting m-of-n transactions.  An m-of-n transaction is one where you have n parties, and any m of those parties are required to be in agreement to spend the bitcoins.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around all the cool things you could do with such a transaction, but I think the easiest and most useful would be to implement escrow.
Example: You want to but a widget of btcwidgets.com for 1 BTC.  You don't particularly trust btcwidgets.com, but you both trust trustworthy.com.  So you set up a m-of-n transcation where n is 3: Yourself, btcwidgets.com and trustworthy.com.  You set m to 2, meaning any 2 of you can agree to spend those bitcoins.  You set the transaction amount to 1 BTC.  btcwidgets.com sees that you've created this transaction and sends you the widget in the mail.
Now assuming to get the widget in the mail, and everything is fine, you and btcwidgets.com can agree to send the 1 BTC via a regular transaction to btcwidgets.com.  If you get a defective widget in the mail, you send proof to trustworthy.com and you and trustowrthy.com agree to send the 1 BTC back to yourself.  If you are trying to scam btcwidgets.com, btcwidgets.com and trustworthy.com agree to send the 1 BTC to btcwidgets.com.
The proposals are different ways to implement this.  The concerns are 1) this will induce bugs, 2) this will bloat the blockchain and 3) this will open bitcoin up to potential denial-of-service attacks against bitcoin.
If anyone can expand/correct me on this, please do!

Miners embed a string into the blocks they discover.  If they want to vote for BIP0016, they use the string '/P2SH/'.  If they want to vote for BIP0017, they use the string 'p2sh/CHV'.  On Feb 1st, if 55% of blocks (I'm not clear on what blocks exactly they are looking at, just the blocks generated on Feb 1st?) contain the string '/P2SH/', BIP0016 passes.  If 55% contain the string 'p2sh/CHV', BIP0017 passes.
The likely outcome is neither will pass as the owner of deepet has stated he's not voting for either.

Of the explanations I've seen tossed around here, this is the only one (other than 'speculators-be-speculatin') that comes close to explaining the sudden change.  
The other explanations (new methods of exchange, growing economy, euro crisis, fiat is bad, etc) can't explain these massive walls we're seeing.  The butterfly labs explanation might explain it, but it still might be a stretch.

But it has an objective cost of being stored and transmitted.
Inflation would mean alot of badass infrastructure but probably be bad for the value of the currency.
An interesting model for a p2p charity though.  You could subsidize the storage and transmission of secure data for the everyone by holding this currency, and buying it up when the values falls due to infrastructure improvements.

When I first decided to throw money at bitcoin, they were going for around $1.70 USD.
I decided back then mining was the 'sucker bet' and simply bought a whole lot of coins.  I've never mined a cent and don't plan on starting.  Here's my reasoning:
1) My motto has always been "You don't get rich doing whatever everyone else is doing."  Everyone seemed to be trying to make money mining, so I went the other way.
2) I *hate* messing with hardware, configs, etc.  I do it (more than) fulltime IRL, so the last thing I wanted to do was come home and mess with computers.  I would have been a shitty miner.  Buying is totally hands-off and I'm not sure if people factor in 'time tinkering with their rigs' into their profit calculations.
3) I had a big move planned within the next couple of months and was getting rid of stuff, not acquiring stuff.
4) I was convinced that by now, GPU mining would not payoff at all.  I thought the adoption of ASIC/FPGA rigs would have come sooner.  Bitcoin mining will eventually be out of reach of the casual hobbiest and I've spent alot of time pondering what will happen to the BTC economy when this happens.
On the other hand, one advantage to mining is if bitcoin ever completely tanks, you at least have some value in the the hardware you've purchased (don't sell right away though, the market will be flooded for a while).

The way I interpret it, nobody is currently doing that (at least on the website linked above)
Some people are bidding (mostly on calls: the right to buy bitcoins at a later date for a determined amount) but it looks like currently nobody is offering (either calls or puts) to sell.
But the mechanism is there.  In the interest of making the bitcoin market more resilient, hopefully this catches on.

Naive explanation, because my understanding is naive:
Think of a 100x100 grid of logic gates.  Now think of being able to program these gates: change what each gate was (AND/OR/NOT, etc) and link the outputs from some to the inputs of others.
You program the Bitcoin hash function on that, crank the clock rate as high as you possibly can, and submerge the whole thing in liquid nitrogen....

The answer: 
1) Encode the key across the co-efficients of a (m-1)^th -order [polynomial]( (or (m-1)-d [hyperplane](
2) Generate n points on the polynomial and distribute one to each party.
3) Any m points can reconstruct the polynomial, and therefore the key.
1) Take a polynomial of order z = m-1 .  (A 1st-oder polynomial is a line, 2nd a parabola, etc.)  a polynomial of order m is: 
- Ax^z + Bx^(z-1) + ... + Qx^0
2) Distribute the keys amongst the co-efficients.  Create the functions:
- poly = f(key, z):      encode the key into z+1 (m) co-efficients (z+1 due to the constant x^0 )
- key = f_inv(poly):   gather the co-efficients and reconstruct the key
3) Now generate n points on the polynomial
- pts = p(poly, n)
4) Distribute one point to each person.  Any z+1 points can reconstruct a z^th order polynomial (think: 2 points is enough to fix a line, 3 to fix a parabola, etc)
- poly = p_inv(pts)
- key = f_inv(poly)

Remember, when you send bitcoins to someone.  Now only do you send your coins to them.  You send the *remainder* of your coins to a new address (for anonymity purposes).
I'm not sure if "Bitcoins sent" includes this or not...
@_date: 2011-06-07 05:10:54
Yes, you will still receive payments if your client isn't running.
What wallet.dat stores are a set of private keys that allows you access to the blocks where your bitcoins are stored.
There is one caveat:  wallet.dat stores something like 100 keys.  When you make a transaction, some funds are randomly transfered to a new key to obfuscate things.  It's possible that if you make a lot of transactions, all your money will no longer be linked to the keys in the wallet.dat file you backed up, making it useless.
To be certain this doesn't happen this is what I do:
1) Make a new user on my os, install a fresh bitcoin client
2) Transfer the amount I'd like to backup to this address
3) Backup this new wallet.dat file
4) Never use that client again.
Another option is to backup after every transaction.

I think there might be some confusion.
The stamp is generated on a webserver under lock and key and broadcasted, in the form of a QR code for convenience.  I take a picture of something (baseball card, Vancouver's mountains, etc.) with the QR code in the frame (encoding the broadcasted timestamp -- a modern version taking a picture of today's newspaper like people do in movies) to prove recency.  
There's no GPS, no software (other than on the one server who generates and broadcasts the stamps).
I give you the picture, and you can independently verify the timestamp, and therefore the recency of the photo.
You cannot create a timestamp in the future without the secret key (I think...)

Bitcoin has many unique properties that are appealing to ancaps, and I would love to see added to the subreddit (I'd also like to see over there, but that subreddit seems dead).  Bitcoin has serious potential to undermine the power of the state by:
* Not being able to monitor transactions.
* Not being able to freeze assets of parties it disagrees with.
* Not being able to levy taxes on transactions it can't see.
And, the higher the demand for Bitcoins, the lower the demand for traditional fiat currencies, which also undermines the capital base of states.

1. As long as the price increases with the mining difficulty, mining will remain as profitable as it is now.  If the price increases faster than the difficulty, it will become more profitable.  If not, less profitable.  I suspect GPU miners will be eventually pushed out of the market by FPGA miners (like the GPUs pushed out the CPUs)
2. The price of a bitcoin is determined by how useful they are (and how useful they are perceived to be in the future)  This will depend on many things: liquidity, ease of use/exchange, desire to shelter assets from ruthless leaders, legality, etc.  I doubt the demand across the globe will be homogeneous.  The US might run a successful smear campaign that makes bitcoin illegal as scares off most users, but I suspect demand will remain high in communist/dictatorial regimes.
3. Yes.

My explanation:  It pays to be first.
Bitcoin is a radical technology that requires mass adoption to succeed.  If there was no incentive to move first, nobody would.  And Bitcoin would fail.
Radical technologies also usually involve high risk.  A lot of people think bitcoin is in a bubble.  These people can cash out now and likely make a nice gain.  But they don't deserve any future earnings.
And it might be a bubble, and it might fail, and then these few holding 19% will be singing the blues that they didn't cash out for millions when they could.  
Is there an equitable solution for this loss imbalance?  Then why would you expect one for a gains imbalance?
Bitcoin requires people to throw down their hard earned capital to succeed.  These people are the ones incurring the risk.  These are the ones deserving of the gains.
@_date: 2011-06-07 04:55:56

Yes!  It's called [arbitrage]( and people do it all the time.

I've been watching this for a while, still not sure what to make of it.
What I find interesting is the search volume has [gone down]( this past month... (see [here]( too)
Could be a blip or could be something more significant.  
If it's not a blip, I'd expect the price to decrease, but who knows, right?

Agreed.  I bet they'd have more use for it than the rest of us!

Wouldn't all exchanges have to co-ordinate to accomplish this?  Bitcoin was designed to make such co-ordination difficult (that's a feature, we don't want anybody asserting control over it).
Also, every individual exchange would have a huge incentive to defect.

For the bid side, the (X,Y) coordinates read as:
 
"If I had Y bitcoins, I could sell them all *instantly* and the new bitcoin price would be X" (probably more because of dark pools, but no less)
The money you get would be the area under the curve
For the ask side:
"If I had Y USD, and I used it all to buy BTC *instantly* the new BTC price would be X (probably less because of dark pools)"

If you think your bitcoins are worthless, you're free to sent them here! :)
It makes sense the value is increasing so quickly.  Nobody has heard of it yet!  What's the typical response you get when you say "Hey!  Ever heard of bitcoin?".
[So as awareness of bitcoin is increasing exponentially]( it's reasonable to assume the value (driven only by demand, since supply is predictable) will also increase.  Once the google trend data levels off, I expect the BTC value to as well (or *that* would be a bubble)
@_date: 2011-05-25 07:32:46
It asserts recency not age.
Shopping the code is a viable attack.  So the upper limit on the trust is the cost to do so effectively I guess....

That's a shit incentive.  It could just as easily cut the other way -- the rest of the market sees overwhelming confidence in your position and jumps on the bandwagon.
If I can't calculate payout when I place it, it's a horrible bet.

@_date: 2011-06-15 19:28:37
Exactly!  
Selling 8000btc would drop the price to ~17.50/btc
Buying 8000btc would raise the price to ~23.5/btc
Then the day-traders would descend like mad and the price would stabilize in a few hours.

To those who would call the bitcoin market 'volatile':
We just had a security compromise in which ~4% of the volume was traded in a matter of minutes.  The price swung wildly, [but still manged to stabilize around 12 in about an hour](

One thing I've been thinking of for a while which would be killer:
Open source software for Bitcoin + Mesh Networking
You add your router to the mesh, and get paid based on some function of uptime/traffic.  Much like you have miners today, you could have:
1) broadcasters: people who put up antennas in optimal places.
2) connectors: people bridging traffic between the mesh and their ISP connection
The result is bad ass mesh networking that blankets cities...

If so, people could use your site to set up all sorts of creative hedges.  As it stands, there's no way to know what the payout will be, nor is there any incentive to move first (and every incentive to move last)

Wait, what?  
That's not how I interpret that.  If a 2013 USD is worth 1.01% of a 2011 USD, then Bitcoin only needs to go up in value 2% (assuming everything else is flat)
If everything is flat or goes down, and BTC goes up even slightly, you win, no?  Is that not what he's saying?
Not that I agree with him, there's no what BTC with outperform gold and silver over the next 2 years.  But saying 'BTC is 10 USD now, so it has to be 1000 USD in 2 years' is not how I interpret this...

It's my understanding that namecoins were designed to enable a decentralized DNS system that wouldn't immediately get taken over by squatters by requiring a proof of work.  That's their purpose.  They were never meant as a store of value.

It's an interesting idea, and very compelling.  I see two major challenges.
The first one is validation, which the author touches on.  He proposes using biometric information to make impostering impossible.  It's not clear to me why this would work.  Why couldn't I permute my biometric information to get a new biometric ID?  An entity which validates this sort of thing implies an authority, centralization, etc.
The second problem is bootstrapping.  If you had a global government to *impose* this currency on everyone then it might work, but otherwise it would require some philanthropic entity to prop up the value of the currency.  Bitcoin didn't have this problem because its deflationary nature gave people an incentive to move first and buy in.  There's no such incentive here.
All in all, I think ripple is a better way to get to where the author is trying to go..
@_date: 2011-08-30 18:10:11


The threats wont necessarily come from the feds.  There will be alot of powerful entities with strong incentives to undermine the system.  Also, the more prevalent bitcoin becomes, the more script-kiddies looking for an easy payday it will attract.
Protect yourself.  Some suggestions:
1) [Encrypt your wallet.dat file](  Never leave an unencrypted copy lying around.
2) Assume every site accepting bitcoins is correlating BTC and IP addresses to either exploit, or to sell the data later.  Best case scenario these sites are juicy targets for crackers.  Use a [VPN]( to mask your IP address.  Pay people indirectly (ie: through mtgox or instawallet -- does instawallet payout from a different address than you pay into?  I've been meaning to check this) to mask your BTC address(es)
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:28:02

Really?  Just curious, who do you consider to be the most capitalist economists?
For me, it's the Austrian school.  [Here's their take on deflation](


Bitcoin is generating money quickly now, yes.  But it's increasingly approaching the Austrian's view of 'sound money'

I think this is a great idea!
Although when pitching it to reddit, I would sell them on Bitcoin as an intermediary, ie: people pay in BTC (at the going rate) and it's automatically exchanged and reddit gets USD.
This would still result in the desired exposure, but is a *much* easier sell IMO...
@_date: 2011-05-25 06:08:15
Interesting!  I thought my setup was doctor proof.  How would you doctor a code?
Edit:  And yes, it doesn't help here.  But it could be used to easily establish the recency of a photo.  Thats some trust, but yes it might not be very useful...
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:58:00
If the deflationary nature of bitcoin is a concern, can't people just deal in another currency, but use BTC as the medium?
Or, can't people just create bitcoin-2, which is inflationary?
Actually, that's an experiment I'd love to see!  Which one would be used more (my guess: the deflationary one)

I can commit the encryption key to memory (you don't write yours down do you?), not so much the wallet.dat file.
Everything else that *does* need to be stored can be stored in the cloud.  Nothing about bitcoin really needs to be stored locally, which would presumably make it more secure...

Yes, a good reason: because paypal can reverse transactions up to 30 (or 60?) days later.  
So I buy your bitcoins, wait till I get many confirmations, then reverse the charge.  Bitcoin may have solved the double spending problem, but paypal has not.
[Bitcoin-otc]( might be your best bet.  [This quickstart guide]( I wrote may help too.

I've always thought that a major use of bitcoin would be for immigrants from 3rd world countries to send money back to their families... without outrageous fees, or outrageous governments interfering.

Well, it doesn't use bitcoins per se, but I was thinking about how to establish trust between strangers (to make people more comfortable with bitcoin) and I was thinking time verification would be fairly simple, pretty nifty and hopefully useful.
And if you're considering establishing an authority anyway, I think a time-authority would be a simple add-on and useful to the bitcoin community...

It's possible, but the incentive to defect would be huge.  Imagine: I convince hundreds to stop mining so the difficulty lowers, but I keep mining myself!

Upvote for useful discussion about how this reddit should evolve.
Even though I think these forks are silly, I think posts like this are good.  Being familiar with all the douchy things people are doing with bitcoin is a pre-requisite to being familiar with bitcoin, IMO.
Doesn't mean I won't downvote tho! :)
I also think a world with many, many competing crypto-currencies is inevitable.  There'll have to be some really good reasons and/or some really big names behind the successful forks though (think: major open source forks)

Up until a few weeks ago, I agreed with all of that.

Wow! bounty is up to 9 BTC!
This is alot of fun!  And *exactly* why bitcoin is so awesome!
Suggestion: we have a weekly bounty where interested ppl chip in 0.5 BTC each (if we're doing it weekly, lets keep the cost down, and we seem to have enough interest to keep the bounties worthwhile) and decide on some task.
If we do this regularly (weekly) we can broadcast far and wide, get lots of attention to the reddit (and bitcoin!) and do some amazing things!
@_date: 2011-05-18 17:39:20


If we're operating on that assumption, then not only is bitcoin fatally flawed, but markets in general.
I understand you might believe that, but I'm not sure how relevant this is to a discussion of "bitcoin vs other currencies."
@_date: 2011-05-18 17:31:04


The rich will always have access to investment strategies that are cost prohibitive to the poor.  No, Bitcoin doesn't solve this problem.
What it does do though, is gives the poor a currency that will naturally increase in value, unlike the ones they have now.
This is a good thing!  The rich never hold cash anyway, because they know it will devalue.  Now the poor can do the same.

Nothing!  I agree: The cat is out of the bag, and a future with multiple crypto-currencies is inevitable.
When this will happen and why is interesting to ponder, but anybody's guess...
[Could the value of bitcoins fragment based on a majority moral opinion](  What if everyone decided to boycott the bitcoins from the mtgox theft?  Could a new currency fork off due to a moral divide much like open source codebases do?  Will communities with strong social bonds (religious, political, racial) create their own crypto-currency with specifically tailored rules? [Can you embed karma/ratings into a currency](  [Can we make our currency our trust in one another](
Would it be possible to make the proof-of-work useful? Instead of computing hashes, is it feasible to change that to something that could contribute to the general public good?  (protein folding? finding prime numbers? the search space would have to be huge and unpredictable..) Could we somehow make removing carbon from the atmosphere unforgeable?  Then we could trade carbon-sink tokens...
The possibilities are endless...

Ok, cool.  Thanks for the clarification. 
It'll be interesting to see if exchanges implement this, and what the demand for it will be.

I suggest you research the politics behind bitcoin, and/or perhaps the [cypherpunk]( culture.

This currency is an *infant*!  It's (effectively) less than a year old, and there's no central authority to prop it up/smooth out the bumps.  The fact that it's working at all *still* blows my mind!
I'm loving the price decline.  It's filtering out all the people who don't care about the ideals and were only interested in making a quick buck.
And the rest of us can pick up BTC on the cheap! ;)
