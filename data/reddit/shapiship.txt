You might want to chain these together, coinjoin with wasabi then deposit into a casino's shared wallet, then withdraw different amounts spread in time.
I haven't seen a casino with KYC, but many have CAPTCHAs that doesn't work with Tor.

Works now! (with JS enabled)

Tor is blocked on the website even with JS enabled the page is empty.

You just saved me from this crap wallet, I just made a wallet yesterday, will move my funds right now.

Did you verify it's titanium and not for example aluminium?

How would you verify the seed was really generated based on your entropy?
Because using that verification method you could generate your own seed and just restore it on the hardware wallet.

It might be obvious that the coins you are paying with were mixed with Wasabi, but the source of the coins won't be known.
I'm also concerned by getting involved in an investigation just because I mixed with let's say a terrorist, LE just follows up on every UTXO and subpoenas every exchange or websites where the coins from that mix lands.

considering they just gave out a thousand of those boards and opensourced the whole thing they just got a nice alibi because if the board get traced back to them it will be easy to claim that anyone can have a board like that.

I think your point might be still valid because we will see how fast these companies respond to threats that are already out in the wild. Opposed to a responsible disclosure deadline, where the vuln hasn't been cought in the wild yet.

Now that you say I think that's still the default input option (pc keyboard).
But at least it's possible to choose seed entry on the wallet itself. Passphrase entry on the device is not possible at all on model T.

Just as an FYI, Trezor T and the newer model, Trezor One both allow you to input the seed directly without touching a phone/computer keyboard., which is needed for the passphrase input on Trezor T, but not on the newer One.
