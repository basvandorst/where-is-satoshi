I agree with the "don't invest recklessly" message. Strongly disagree with the comparisons to lottery tickets or roulette. And a lot else in here.
I find a lot of issue with you offering baseless valuations for future prices. "If btc were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely falling apart. Based on what?
"On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13."
Yeah, I'd hate to be the dumbass that bought at $1163. Yes, it's volatile, no one would disagree. Yes, you should only invest what you can afford to lose. But to compare it to casino gambling (provably, mathematically -EV) is disingenuous at best.

Anytime you put in more than you're willing to lose, it's a risk. I agree with this. 
I also agree that bitcoin is MORE RISKY than a generic diversified portfolio. No argument there. 
The problem is comparing it to casino gambling (provably -EV) or saying that "if it hits (100k or 250k) then our entire government's financial system will collapse." That's extremely negligent analysis based on zero evidence. These arbitrary psychological barriers are what cause panic sells.
Yes it is a big problem if people are investing so much that their lives are ruined if the price goes down. But again, if you got into bitcoin to "make a quick buck" then you shouldn't be in to begin with IMO. From a macro perspective, those "crashes" look silly (eg $1163 to $152), because the long term growth pattern has been up.

I am raising funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. My team, "bitcoin for good" has raised more than $10,000.  
About 50% of the sales of this T-shirt will support my team. If you'd prefer to make a bitcoin donation, send to:
18cAYS4jY59QXv4Sp9EpDLpbgyB7LRbCFe 
I will convert to cash and make the donation in your name (if you'd like) with cash equivalent at time of receipt, or time of conversion, whichever is higher.

My team "Bitcoin for Good" is supporting 2017 Muscle Walk Columbus, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Yes, I am shamelessly asking for your donations for this great cause. One reason?
It's tax deductible. And I know all of you pay your taxes...
But really, I personally know dozens of kids and adults who will benefit from these funds. Research, equipment, doctor visits, and a lot more.
We've already raised $10,000 (which is only like, 3 bitcoins!). Tenths and even hundredths of bitcoins will make a big difference. 
Feel free to contact me and I will share with you more about why I am raising money for this cause - and how I hope to generate some positive publicity for bitcoin, along with helping some great families!
Donate here: 
If you prefer to donate btc/eth but not cash (I'm still working on getting the org. to use Bitpay...) contact me and we can work it out, so the donation is still in your name.

My team "Bitcoin for Good" is raising money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. We just cleared $10,000 and I want to keep going! If you support this campaign I'll be happy to reimburse you the shipping costs in its bitcoin equivalent, just email me your receipt (proof of purchase) and bitcoin address. In a few weeks, that $5 of bitcoin will pay for the shirt anyway, right?!
I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the amazing work the Muscular Dystrophy Association does. Not only do they fund research that helps kids live longer, more independent lives, they fund weeklong Summer Camps that provide memories and friendships that last a lifetime.

Shout out to whoever donated btc! Address is 18cAYS4jY59QXv4Sp9EpDLpbgyB7LRbCFe 
I will convert to cash and donate (in your name, if you'd like)- at time of receipt or time of conversion whichever is higher.

No one else has donated yet, true, but if you've ever asked someone to help you raise money, you know it takes time.  
And I'm not asking for people to donate BTC necessarily, I'm asking for people who have been fortunate to do well during the Crypto booms to donate. Not asking for thousands, either. The fact that it's tax deductible means something to some people, too.
I thought some crypto/btc enthusiasts would think it was cool, I guess? Donating money to a good cause and raising some awareness and generating some positive publicity? 
"Bitcoin is a super volatile asset. Even That 10k will worth 25k in 5 months"
That's not what volatile means...
"how is it counting.."
I just posted on social media today. It's not like I've been at this for months and gotten one donation...I've personally pledged up to $500 to match the next $500 in donations my team receives.

That's fair. Definitely on the con side...plus mining difficulty (I've read) consumes more and more electricity such that at some point it would be unfeasible. 
Do you think the inconvenience/speed of it can be rectified, that some other coin will take over, or that cryptocurrencies in general do not serve a useful purpose?

People have been saying "bitcoin is in a bubble" since 2012/2013. The price hit $266, crashed to like $120, "I told ya so, I told ya so, beginning of the end for bitcoin!!"  
I'd hate to be the idiot that bought at $266.
At what point do you ask yourself: are the people who keep saying it's a bubble actually know what they're talking about? In my experience, no one who says "bitcoin is a bubble" can actually explain the merits of bitcoin and blockchain tech. Some very high-level people have said it, yet they don't have anything to back it up. There are pros and cons, no doubt, but to claim bitcoin is useless/valueless is objectively wrong.

Motivations are irrelevant to being scammed.
That being said, the site had been around since 2013 and I had about 140% ROI in that time. 
The "bets" were actually just prediction markets with plenty of inefficiency. At any given time I had as much as 40btc on there. Thankfully I wasn't scammed for that much, but the site seemed pretty reliable since they had handled such an enormous volume.
Fwiw, if they had been planning an exit scam they could've had about 200 more btc (iirc) if they had run before the election, which they paid out.
This doesn't seem like it was a scam planned until very recently, if that the case.

Didn't seem like the solution would be an exit scam...what's going on? 502 for several days now.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:02:28
Yep. See the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:03:29
Thanks. Not sure what the deal is. I feel like if they were going to cut and run it'd have been before the large Trump Clinton bet settled
@_date: 2017-04-08 22:10:59
Yep looking like a cut and run
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:09:14
What's going on w the site?
