Some, maybe most, of the potential big drivers of bitcoin are not disobedience or censorship related (eg ETF/asset/savings, international remittances). Guns can be used for disobedience but that's not how they are promoted. 
If you want to get up and promote bitcoin's censorship/civil disobedience properties - as you see them - to the world's thought leaders go right ahead, but don't come down so heavy on everyone who may rightly use bitcoin differently to yourself. It's hard enough to be [accepted as an attendee at TED]( let alone speak there, give the man some credit.

I believe it was originally a pejorative term 'coined' by the ethereum marketing dept during the HF debate to denounce anyone questioning the  HF. Any hint of anti-HF rationale, reason, or sentiment was enough to label you a bitcoin maximalist. It was lke an islamist war cry.

Just want to point out tho that 'BTC only' is almost impossible; the ones who chose it probably did so in spirit rather than definition.
Any bitcoin hodler is automatically also an alt hodler because of airdrops and forks, or is that extremely rare person who can figure out how to safely dump them as soon as they are issued, in order to remain BTC only. I've probably got alts I don't even know about.

First came the geeks, and then came the criminals. Now it is the turn of the speculators. And if the price of bitcoin, which this week traded above $11,000, is anything to go on, the hedge funds and big City money could be next.
Invented only eight years ago, bitcoin, a so-called cryptocurrency that is “mined” using sophisticated computer equipment, could be on the cusp of mass adoption. At least, that is what those who are betting on it believe.
Bitcoin may be a tiddler in the grand scheme of global financial markets but this is changing rapidly. Taken together, the total stock of the digital currency is worth just under $170 billion (£126 billion), less than a quarter of the market value of Apple. This is ten times where it was at the start of this year, however, and many believe this is only the beginning.
If you had put £5,000 into bitcoin back at the start of 2011 you would now be sitting on a digital fortune of about £50 million. And one man who did is Barry MacMahon, an Irish software developer who spent years studying the potential for a decentralised currency before finding bitcoin six years ago.
“I was quite sceptical for some time but I just couldn’t find a flaw that I thought could take it down so I started to buy a couple of hundred pounds of it and at some point I was putting all of my spare funds into it. I thought, if this succeeds it’s going to go very high,” said Mr MacMahon, 39, who declined to say how much his bitcoin hoard was worth.
Another early convert was John Coats, a 66-year-old addiction counsellor, who was persuaded to invest £16,000 in bitcoin in 2013 and has now made so much he can retire. “It never occurred to me that it would increase in value so much. The world seems to have gone bitcoin mad,” he said.
Behind the optimism for bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, is the growing belief that they are no flash in the pan, but are here to stay. This view was giving more credence yesterday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world’s largest financial markets, agreed to allow the trading of bitcoin contracts for the first time, a major sign of the currency’s growing acceptance.
The news that the US regulator had approved three exchanges to offer futures trading in bitcoin sent its price rebounding to more than $11,000, after it fell by 20 per cent earlier in the week.
At least one major London hedge fund is understood to have taken steps in recent days to begin trading bitcoins, something that would have seemed unthinkable only months ago.
UK officialdom remains cautious and, while the authorities are keen to play up Britain’s role at the centre of the financial technology revolution, companies that trade bitcoin or that are involved in developing its underlying technology are effectively barred from the mainstream banking system.
BlockEx, a London-based developer of financial technology and a bitcoin trader, had to move its banking to Gibraltar recently after it was dumped by its banks.
Even personal current accounts that receive payments from bitcoin sales or that are used to buy digital currencies are likely to attract suspicion from lenders and can lead to customers being ordered to take their business elsewhere.
Lloyds Banking Group, Britain’s largest retail bank, said that it was “prudently monitoring” developments in virtual currencies. “Customers who transact or trade in virtual currencies may be subject, on a case-by-case basis, to additional customer due diligence checks,” a spokesman said.
Banks’ reticence to expose themselves to bitcoin is driven by the widespread perception that digital currencies remain a hotbed of criminality, with drug dealers and hackers taking advantage of the anonymity afforded to move their money around the world beyond the prying eyes of the police.
Virtual currency experts say that the distrust shown by mainstream finance is misplaced and point out that cash provides far more anonymity than bitcoin. Aleks Nowak at BlockEx said: “You can track the movement of a bitcoin from the moment it was created to its present owner. Cash offers nothing like that kind of traceability.”
James Butterfill, a former fund manager at Coutts and amateur bitcoin miner, suggested that the current valuation could be too high given that the cost of mining new units was about $4,300, or roughly $6,000 less than where the virtual currency was trading. “It’s very difficult to time when a bubble will burst. We haven’t really experienced anything like this since the Dutch tulip mania more than 400 years ago.”
How are bitcoins created? 
A bitcoin is created by supercomputers that solve complex puzzles and receive coins as a “reward” in a process called bitcoin “mining”.
Who created bitcoin? 
The original computer code behind the currency was released in 2009 by “Satoshi Nakamoto”, who has yet to be identified.
What can you buy with them? 
Though they are a long way from everyday acceptance this is changing quickly. Last week, Autotrader confirmed a Rolls-Royce listed on its website was the first car with a seller explicitly requesting payment in bitcoins.
Bitcoin debit cards are already on offer that allow users to spend their virtual currency on the high street.

A few other points not yet mentioned:
-  Many funds are mandated to invest only in regulated securities, that is, they are simply not yet allowed to buy bitcoin.
- It will be simpler for retirement and other tax efficient vehicles to invest in Bitcoin.
- Individuals may treat Bitcoin more seriously as an investable asset.
- As a new regulated asset class bitcoin becomes may become a variable in portfolio management.
Edit: increased demand is likely to cause price to go higher since supply is limited. Personally, I'd expect nothing short of 10x over the next 2 years.

Walmart's customers are people looking for the lowest prices, an ideal fundamental to Bitcoin.
A pilot project could be setup to test the waters without requiring a full scale roll out. 
All customers could be offered wallets and awarded free bits (aka loyalty/award points). With good design, UI/UX, they need not even have to see or understand the terms 'crypto' or 'bitcoin'.
Longer term Walmart could become a key player in the crypto space, offering escrow and various other novel crypto/financial services, and wherever the potential to disrupt existing financial/professional services exists, Walmart could be there.
Walmart could transcend from being a chain store, to becoming a blockchain store (Walsmart?), with a global footprint, disrupting existing fee takers, offering wholly new innovative crypto services,  and addressing billions of new customers.

The suggestion is:
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits
1 bit = 100 satoshi
So 1 bitcoin still has 8 zeroes after it, reformatted as: 1,000,000.00
Say someone wants to buy a $2.50 coffee, it's 0.005106 bitcoin which can be displayed as 5,106 bits (or mews or whatever you might call it).
The base unit remains the same as far as the back-end is concerned. The amount is simply displayed in a more user friendly format. This will become more and more relevant as bitcoin increases in value.

"In my view, the big difference between investment and speculation is the mindset. Suppose you buy in a stock share or a cryptocurrency but the price keeps falling after that, if you are an investor, you will be delighted at the stumble for it means good time to buy more in; on the contrary, if you keep complaining of the slowdown, no offense but I think you are actually a speculator.

Digital currencies offer the potential prize of **cheaper and faster payments for many consumers and organizations, including many poorly served by existing options**. From the perspective of law enforcement and regulators, successfully addressing the Know Your Counterparty issue would mean digital currencies offer **a stronger basis for both preventing and identifying money laundering than most, if not all, existing payment networks**. The industry and consumers will only realize these benefits, however, if digital-currency firms prioritize AML and other important public-policy challenges posed by digital currencies. This will require hard work, leadership, and ingenuity from the industry and regulatory authorities alike.

Well [this study]( by Muro and Noseworthy (2012) for example found that most people do give a shit. (I'll snip a few quotes since it's a long article)
"participants given a crisp $20 bill spent an average of $3.68 but those given the old one spent an average of $8.35."
"A new bill proved a way more tempting prize than an old soiled one, with 80% of participants willing to gamble away an old one to get a new one, compared with only 23% willing to gamble a new one to get an old one. It seems crazy because the amount of money on offer was exactly the same."
"This suggests that the physical appearance of money matters more than traditionally thought, and like most things in life, it too is inextricably linked to the social context. The results suggest that money may be less fungible than people think."
Ok. Look I respect you as a teacher, the most noble profession in my books, I'm not being condescending or trying to be tricky or anything. My point is to show that people are irrational, the economatons of Econ text books don't exist, psychology matters a lot more than you yet realise. There have of course been no studies on bitcoin redenominations, so you can call it bullshit if you want, and declare "the label is irrelevant", however a rose by any other name would not smell so sweet.

PART 2
First, a few facts about Bitcoin:
The total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist is limited to 21 million. Let's be as clear as possible about this: there can never be more than 21,000,000 Bitcoins in this universe.
There are currently around 10 million Bitcoins in circulation. These are Bitcoins that have been "mined," and are "outstanding" - meaning they're available to be acquired or spent. ("Mining" is the term used for bringing Bitcoins into existence. If you want to know more about the process, it's worth a Google or two.)
Bitcoins can be (and have been) lost. This occurs when people inadvertently overwrite them on their computers, or simply lose the media on which they are stored (like a crashed hard drive, for instance). There is no way to calculate how many unrecoverable Bitcoins there are, but suffice it to say, when all 21 million have been mined, there will be fewer than 21 million in circulation. For our calculations, however, we will stick with 21 million.
And that brings us to our final point: we are using the total number of eventual Bitcoins because it's more conservative and dilutive. We want to account for the valuation that will likely occur as new Bitcoins appear. We could use complex calculus to predict the rate at which the supply of Bitcoins will change, relative to the price of gold. Likewise, this article could become a book. For brevity, we are going to go with the simpler approach.
According to credible estimates, the total market value of gold today is approximately $8.5 trillion. More precisely, that is $8,500,000,000,000.
Next, we should determine the total market value of Bitcoins. Using 21,000,000 as the number of (eventual) Bitcoins in the world, and assuming a market price of $450, that gives us a total market value of $9,450,000,000 - or $9.45 Billion.
Please take note of the difference between billions and trillions in the values above!
What does all this mean? Simply, all the gold in the world is currently worth $8.5 trillion. And all the (existing and eventual) Bitcoins in the world are currently worth $9.45 billion.
Let's break it down. If the theory is correct, and Bitcoins possess all of the positive aspects of gold, plus all the positive aspects of sovereign fiat currencies, we could make a strong argument that Bitcoin will attract a significant amount of capital away from sovereign currencies. But for the sake of simplicity, let's just assume that won't happen. Let's just assume that all the capital flowing into Bitcoins will only come from gold - and no other source. This sounds absurd, but it is also extremely conservative, and should give you some idea of how undervalued Bitcoin really is at this moment.
Back to our equations:
All the gold in the world: $8.5 trillion
All the Bitcoins in the world: $9.45 billion
At what price would Bitcoin be at par value with gold? Essentially, Bitcoin would have to go from its current total market value of $9.45 billion ($450 per Bitcoin) to a market value of $8.5 trillion. So how much would each Bitcoin be worth if that were to happen? Divide $8.5 trillion by the total number of Bitcoins outstanding (21 million).
That gives you a price of $404,762, per Bitcoin.
Our assumption is that Bitcoins will at least attract some of the capital currently residing in gold. How much? Above, we calculated a 1:1 ratio, which is probably unrealistic - it's doubtful that anything approaching 100% of the capital in gold would flow to Bitcoins... at least not today. And yet it is realistic to think that, as Bitcoin establishes itself, it could attract a great deal of wealth away from gold. But again, how much?
It stands to reason that Bitcoin's ease of storage and portability would attract a huge amount of capital away from gold. But let's maintain our conservative posture - let's assume Bitcoin will only take 20% of the capital currently being held in gold around the world.
$404,762 X .20 = $80,952 (per Bitcoin)
And That's Just Gold. Try To Imagine Everything Else
We should again mention that this does not take into account capital flows from other assets - such as sovereign currencies, oil, real estate, or stocks. We are simply speculating on what the price of Bitcoin might be if it attracted just 20% of the wealth currently held in gold.
For a moment, try to imagine what could happen to the price of a single Bitcoin if we were to consider capital flows away from every other asset class in the world? Such an influx could have staggering ramifications on its value.
So, when we talk about Bitcoin vs Gold - considering their current market values - do you really think Bitcoin is a bubble?

You're going to rather absurd extremes to try to prove your point; I never mentioned any of those things.


Care to prove that? And I don't mean just your school system. Bitcoin is global. Just how common do you believe this SI knowledge is at the micro and nano level?




No, but you aren't looking at it through the eyes of the man in the street, whether that street be in Rio, Lagos, Bangkok, or Paris. He He thinks in whole numbers, 10's, 100's, millions. He's not going to switch to microbitcoin.


I guess you don't use any financial software. The general default is to 2 decimal places, apart from forex trading. Being compatible is not the same as being shackled.


SI doesn't fix it at all. Humans can be quite irrational, particularly when it comes to money. Giving  100 microbitcoins is psychologically different than giving 100 bits, to name just one example. 
Pragmatic means "dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations." Yes in theory everyone would be well-educated, the reality is very different. For bitcoin to cross the chasm it needs to talk to these people, not confuse them with obscure terminology; it needs to appear familiar and desirable, not strange and complicated.

Thanks for pointing that out. I had a look at that poll:


The discussion here is very different. The idea is to avoid having to think about sub fractions, possibly by moving the decimal point to the right so there at at maximum 2 decimal places as in 1 btc = 1,000,000.00 (or even perhaps just go all the way to satoshi's).
So for example that coffee will be 20,000 bits.
The purpose is to aid in mainstream adoption. Bitcoin is an amazing tech but far too geeky for the average person (think your aunty, not your room mate doing Comp Science) and this is a step in the right direction.

I like it, and not to criticise but to add, it's actually quite hard to write by hand.

there's no way to know the actual distribution of bitcoin. many of the larger wallets might be owned by many people, possibly 100,000's eg an exchange wallet; many of the earlier big parcels of coins may be lost. we don't even know if satoshi's keys are lost, or even if satoshi is a govt organisation, in which case the population of that nation own the coins.

Has Bitcoin finally made it?

He poses the technology’s potential thusly: “Bitcoin advocates who benefit from Bitcoin appreciation argue strongly for its role as an asset, but the transactions technology is generic and efficient and less complicated than introducing an intermediate currency (Bitcoin) to facilitate USD to USD or USD to EUR transactions.”

Maybe, very rarely, (and definitely not in the mass media, not even close) but far more common to see mBTC and uBTC, but again, look at it in the context of future mass adoption and general usage when there might be 100's of millions of users. 
Also, again, people who are numerate enough to deal with milli or micro sized fractions will have no difficulty switching to an easy to understand, whole number system.
I think you're still looking at it in terms of last years discussion about a friendlier name for tiny sub-fractions, which was/is a very worthwhile step. But again, we have moved on and are now talking about a different thing, that is, switching to whole large numbers, an easy to use currency format, more like $'s and cents.

The general consensus is to change to:

You agreed with palehorse, who incorrectly asserted the plan was "turning "bits" into a base-10 unit of measure, or denomination" wheres in fact (it's in the dictionary), bits was already used as a small unit of money long before its binary digit meaning. 
The argument that bit already has multiple meanings so therefore can't be used  has been debunked many times. The word has [dozens of meanings]( and anyone of even average intelligence is unlikely to get confused. Look at 'run' - over 600 meanings!

Wow, just read some of his tweets, can't believe the nonsense he has written, this is the ramblings of a madman, and to think I used to have a lot of respect for him.


I shouldn't be writing this, they'll be knocking on my door any minute now....


Absolute, utter nonsense, totally, completely wrong. The tax avoidance industry is massive, $10's of trillions at least, as is the underground economy. These are already institutionalised sectors, look at the big banks for example, all domiciled in tax havens. It's just silly to even suggest that's bitcoin's purpose.


Since you seem to have forgotten what currency is, may I suggest a refresher in basics? 
C'mon Nouriel, you know what a ponzi scheme is surely?? 
A conduit? But not a currency or means of payment? 
criminal/illegal activities goes for all currencies, and of course mostly in USD and Yuan


What is 'little wealth'? $8billion not enough? Let us know when it gets big enough for you to call real.


So to be a means of payment there is some threshold number of transactions that need to be made before it is real?
*All* who accept it? False. 


There's a number of assets and services priced in bitcoin, such as bitcoin securities at Havelock.
'nor it ever will' - fail, besides it already happening, you can't rule out that future possibility
   


it's less anonymous than that other base, cash.
it's a payment system, a system used to make payments, how can you say otherwise??
Conclusion: Nouriel's twittter account has been hacked by a total moron.

It's probably obvious to most, but keep in mind that one of the merchant's goals is to minimise the cancellation rate, thus they want the customers to have as little interaction as possible beyond a quick and easy initial setup, such that the customers don't feel any ongoing pain; ie no prompt that a bill needs to be approved and paid, just a receipt or even a line on a statement that it has been paid.

Bitcoin Vs. Gold

    Bitcoin's controversy has raged, but many people say it is poised to replace gold.
    Bitcoin and gold: how do they stack up storing value and as a medium of exchange?
    What should Bitcoin's price be, relative to gold?
Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin's controversy has raged. Its libertarian proponents see the digital currency as the killer of central banks everywhere. Its detractors have labeled it a binary bubble - calling it the most elaborate Ponzi scheme of all time. Most often, the latter arguments center on the misplaced belief that anything of value must be "backed" by something else - whether a stream of earnings, a commodity (like gold or oil), or the full faith and credit of a government.
Regardless of which camp you subscribe to, if you are reading this article, you too are undoubtedly curious about this question: what does make a digital currency (or anything else for that matter) valuable? And how does the "bitcoin vs. gold" analysis stack up?
Typically, when we value any asset or going concern (like a company's stock, or a piece of revenue-generating real estate), we observe the rate at which it creates cash flow, and we then discount that value to its appropriate present form. This helps us estimate what the company might be worth now - based on what it will earn in the future. But when you think of things like commodities - especially commodities like diamonds or silver, which have relatively little industrial or practical use - there is no way to evaluate a revenue stream. They don't have one!
Then of course, we come back to Bitcoin, which doesn't even enjoy physical status in the universe! A Bitcoin is merely digital ones and zeros! What sort of rational human being would invest cold hard cash into a currency you can't even touch and feel? From whence does it derive its value?
The logical answer to that question is to point out that many things of value in this world cannot be physically held. Bank account balances cannot be physically held, nor can credit transactions. Services, in general, have no tangible physical qualities, per se. So, let us dispense early with the notion that value must be derived physically.
Bitcoin Vs Gold
Nonetheless, to address the question of Bitcoin's value, we must go deeper. To do that, we must visit some simple economic concepts - namely scarcity, supply, and demand. For this article, we are going to use gold as a metric - mainly because everyone is familiar with gold. But before we get started, let's revisit the notion that gold is just one example of many commodities which serve as a store of value - commodities like copper, rubies, and palladium. We could use any of them for this investigation, but gold is simply the oldest, most universal, and most popular. Its value is also less bound to industrial and consumptive application than other commodities (like oil, wheat, or corn, for instance), which makes it more useful as a model.
Since the dawn of time, gold's value has remained almost exclusively defined by its status as a store of wealth and a medium of exchange. It does not, on its own, generate any form or revenue, or profit (earnings). It is merely valuable because it is scarce, and because human beings place value on that scarcity.
Gold is a finite, rare resource, whose supply is not likely to increase unpredictably. And because supply is relatively fixed, it is somewhat easy, over the long-term, for markets to gauge how much supply can, and should react to demand - relative to other assets (the most obvious of which are currencies). In other words, when we speak of gold, we usually speak of it in terms of yen, dollars, francs, or euros, because it is easy to follow in those terms.
Of course, prices are often imprecise, being driven by the whimsical notions of collective human "wisdom." But over long periods of time, markets tend to represent a reasonably accurate view of the supply and demand of a given good or service. This is why many investors, economists, and even philosophers agree that gold's long term movements are probably reasonable representations of the growth or destruction of other relative values - again, like currencies.
Gold is Heavy. Everyone Wants to Steal It...
No doubt, gold has been a major factor in the development of human history, and yet for all its grandeur and status, gold has become inefficient. Many of its previous uses have been abandoned in recent centuries. As a means of exchange, gold has almost universally been supplanted by fiat currencies - money created and issued by governments, and backed by decree.
There are good reasons not to use gold as an every day currency: it is difficult (and expensive) to store, transport, and protect. As metals go, it is exceedingly heavy; it is much easier to carry cash, checks, or credit and debit cards around in a wallet than it is to carry gold, for example. So, for the most part, gold now sits in government and institutional coffers, guarded by the only entities who can effectively stand to bear the expense associated with its storage and protection.
Please don't misunderstand: the purpose of this article is not to imply that gold is going to lose its appeal any time soon. As long as human beings exist, gold will be coveted because of all the positive qualities mentioned above. But that doesn't preclude it from being extremely inefficient when it comes to portability, nor does it relieve the impracticality of using gold as a means of exchange. It simply doesn't make sense to carry and spend gold.
Governments switched to fiat, for two primary reasons. The first was a response to a clear demand for flexible, more divisible, and lighter methods of exchange. The second was that, by issuing fiat, governments could control the supply of money - and by extension economies. By creating a moderate amount of inflation (printing money), governments could convince users that the assets they purchased were increasing in value.
This was an elaborate illusion, but most people accepted it, and since there were no legal or viable competitors - other than other sovereign currencies - the illusion was allowed to stand, facilitated by the collaboration of governments, themselves. If everyone agrees to be the only game in town, you wind up with a global oligopoly. That can be very profitable for the central banks who control the money supply.
The New Kid
In 2009, a new experiment appeared - Bitcoin. For the first time in history, the world has a currency that is not controlled by any single entity. Here is a store of value that has all the same advantages as gold, but also has the advantages of fiat money! At the same time, it carries none of the disadvantages that have plagued both. Bitcoin has a limited supply, which makes it scarce. It is driven by supply and demand. It is as portable as any sovereign currency. It costs almost nothing to store.
What could be better? It seems like the digital age has finally created the perfect form of wealth storage and transfer! But there is only one problem: nobody seems to be able to agree on how it should be valued!
That brings us to the crux of this article - namely that if you're going to try to value something like Bitcoin, why not look first at its tried and true grandfather... gold? Since they share so many of the same qualities, wouldn't that be the best place to start?

An index ETF gives you a stake in all the companies in that index, like say the S&amp;P 500, or the Dow. Vanguard charges very low fees.

Each to his own though, if you'd rather try your hand at stock picking good luck, but remember you can love a company but it may not make much money for various reasons.

Yes people in general are comfortable with large integers like $1,000's, $100,000's, and $millions, even $billions, which is another reason why bits is so much better as a denomination. I've seen nothing to suggest much support for mbtc.

It looks to me like currently 50.9% of miners have signalled support for 1 of 3 options:
  26.5%
Bitcoin Unlimited
  16.6%
8 MB Blocks
    7.8%  
and many miners I presume simply haven't formed a solid opinion yet. But if you have anything that indicates that at this point the majority of miners don't want to do anything, I'd be curious to see the data, and entertain your rationale.
 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:38:21

I'd suggest you buy into bitcoin first and branch out from there if you feel so inclined after learning more about bitcoin, the alts, and the wider crypto world in general. You may find there are more interesting alts than doge or lite, eg next, proto, bitshares, dark, etc. I'm not close to it but the doge meme seems to be burning out.

Would it be possible to propose something like the Hong Kong agreement but more 'official' or public, more widely agreed upon (not a closed door meeting), in which a SegWit soft fork is stage 1, and if certain parameters or issues develop (I don't know exactly what these would be ) within - I dunno - say 3 - 5yrs(?) after SW, with no more elegant solution forthcoming, then a hard fork block size increase will be triggered. So it's kind of a compromise, but contingent upon agreed factors.

Yes don't buy Qantas, they were lucky the price of fuel dropped when it did. JB's will be facing Amazon so I can't see them being a good long term play. Snapchat - dunno. I suspect you're better off in a Vanguard index ETF in addition to your Apple, (which I presume you don't want to sell now), and BTC.   
As for when to buy BTC, who knows? but probably the sooner the better. If COIN is approved the price appreciation will be way more than the fall if it isn't imo, so it's a risk-adjusted strong buy in my book.

I suggest he refer to Goldman Sachs report indicating Bitcoin could offer over $200 Billion in economic value per year.


He drifts into a childish (and incorrect) rant the very sort of which he appears to accuse bitcoiners of.
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:59:21
50.9% was just coincidence, I didn't dig that up to disprove you! But I do want to  just point out that the miners who have not yet signalled cannot be said to be against any of the options, simply that they have not made their choice yet, and they have plenty of time to do so. So jury is out on the assertion that miners will stall in order to prolong the fee bonanza, but doing so would jeopardise their long term revenue.
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:25:33
Nice. Shame about lack of mining rep though.
Just to nitpick:

The window of opportunity for WU is shutting fast if not already closed. Bitcoin adoption will not follow 'normal' consumer tech adoption patterns; this is money in peoples pockets, not luxury items, the adoption rate will be spectacular and WU rather than being in the drivers seat will be caught in the headlights. Overstock showed them what to do - throw a team in a room and make it happen.

No one is saying a HF should never be done.  
In fact I'm sure most of us would expect a HF at some point in the future if and when we face some existential crisis, or some superior  desirable functionality requires it, or whatever.  
However I'm sure if someone could make a convincing (technical) argument for a HF and get consensus for it, there'd be no stopping it, but it looks like the prevailing wisdom, at least amongst the 400-odd developers, is that a SF is the least risky option currently available.
@_date: 2014-05-04 10:55:28
It has been suggested to use
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits
and 
1 bit = 100 satoshi
so for eg a coffee might cost 2,500 bits rather than 0.00025 btc
it's about usability and the psychological implications of dealing with whole units of money rather than small fractional amounts, and the terminology that goes with it, with an eye to the future and mass adoption.

@_date: 2014-05-12 14:02:39
Going forward I think the issue will resolve strongly in bitcoin's favor and the legacy finance industry will be seen as the big polluters:
1. The latest ascis use &lt; 1W/Ghash, far lower power requirements than gpu's/cpu's.
2. Large mining farms are being setup where power is renewable (eg hydro) cheap and abundant ie no need to build coal power plants; or in liquid-immersion containers (high density - low power).
Compared to say Western Union alone which has "[over 500,000 agent locations]( with many associated sources of pollution/power consumption, such as customer and staff transport to and from the branch; cost of running and maintaining the branch, etc.

@_date: 2017-02-25 07:51:21
The consensus of Bitcoin programmers/contributors (100's vs very few opposed - I don't have the numbers) deem a blocksize HF too risky while there is a better alternative soft fork option, tested and ready to implement. 
If you are technically superior to their collective knowledge, tell me more, but please no conspiracy theories (eg the devs are all controlled by 1 person) - otherwise the discussion goes from technical, objective, and rational, to politics, ego, and nonsense.

If paying in bitcoin yes it can fluctuate, say from 0.0032051 to 0.0032056. It's not going to stop you enjoying your coffee.
Same thing can happen if you're in a foreign country, and go to a money changer for cash for your next coffee, the rate will have changed slightly from your previous exchange. Or even if you pay by credit card the exchange rate you get may have changed.

Wealth, especially when quickly thrust upon you, can have a damaging and often corrupting influence.

Yes it could be more pronounced but no one knows for sure. Personally I wouldn't be surprised if some of the top addresses are controlled by big exchanges, and cold storage service providers and the like, thus representing maybe 10,000's or even millions of people, but I'd only be guessing.  Maybe some programmer generated millions of addresses and dusted them all? The wealth distribution is an interesting question, and the fact that it will remain a mystery is for me at least one of Bitcoin's alluring charms.

SegWit offers up to 3.7MB and that's good enough for now. BU don't have a working solution so not an option.

LN isn't the only second layer solution, just one of several proposals, and I don't think I've ever seen anyone suggest 'permanent 1MB' - do you have a source for that? However your basic premise is correct regardless: what if there is some catastrophic bug? Well that's something we all have to live with. Bitcoin is experimental. You could have Plan B, C, D, E, etc and still have catastrophic bugs. It's how you react and deal with it that matters. Freezing progress is not the way.

Segwit opens the door to billions of daily transactions which miners can take a cut of. Plus the magnitudes higher network effects will make the block reward highly treasured in its own right.

Your chance of being a winning trader in a volatile situation is very low - market orders may not get filled, etc.
How far do you think the price will drop? Let's say $300 (plug in your own number - how important do you think the etf is in the overall scheme of things? even the last china panic wasn't that bad). 
Let's say you miss the bottom by $150 (same amount you missed the top). You stand to benefit short term by around $150/btc.
However if etf is approved you're fucked. Not worth the risk.

Let's use facts to try and help you see the truth of the situation:
Fact 1. (google) "AXA is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services." ~100Billion euro annual revenues.
 no mention of banking.
Fact 2. "AXA Bank Europe as a fully focused Belgian retail bank, serving almost one million clients and operating jointly with AXA Insurance in Belgium”, said Jef Van In, Chief Executive Officer of AXA Bank Europe. ~0.3Billion euro annual revenues. (ie a pimple on an elephants arse)
Fact 3. Unrelated to them except by name, AXA Strategic Ventures (invested in Blockstream) "invests in startups that are shaping the future of insurance and asset management."  no mention of banking.
To characterise this as "blockstream ...investors are largely banks" is pure and utter bullshit, adding to divisiveness in the community, and undermining the entire project. C'mon we all want to see Bitcoin reach its potential, let's try to agree on something. Have a great weekend!

2. There already exist short instruments (eg selling futures) for skeptics so it's not like their first chance to short if they really wanted to.
3. As a nod to legitimacy ETF approval should weaken their skepticism, not embolden it.

There's pros and cons. One problem with a HF is that it would be contentious and lead to an alt coin. Is that acceptable?

@_date: 2017-03-01 11:54:11
I disagree. The funding did not come from banks. The VC's that funded Blockstream are very different to banks. VCs can simply be just wealthy individuals. It's an important distinction because Ver premises his entire philosophy on being true to Satoshi's vision which in large part means anti-bank, and using this outright lie again and again is contemptible imo.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:39:41

@_date: 2017-03-04 07:01:45
It doesn't really matter, it's simply wrong to characterise btc ownership based on address. You can say "1% of addresses own 90% bitcoin" but it's not related to wealth distribution.

You're alleging core devs are funded by banks, offering no evidence of same.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:33:31
The improvement to block size depends on the type of transactions. There are min and max edge cases. You have pointed out the min. The max is "just under 4 MB" though being an edge case this is unlikely to occur.
SegWit is a thoroughly tested, open-source, peer reviewed solution ready to activate; it can get us over the immediate full block/high fees issue without a contentious hard fork. BU is a closed shop with no working solution and is unlikely to ever have one.
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:15:37
Some miners seem to think that once invested it's incumbent on the Bitcoin ecosystem to keep them profitable. Well sorry but if you make the business decision to invest (gamble) million$ in a mining farm, that's your choice, no one owes you a living, much less a highly lucrative one.

Appreciate you posting, and I hope I'm not being pedantic here, as I'm sure your friend meant this, but an uncorrelated asset should just do it's own thing, not zig when something else zags as that would imply a correlation. We would rather bitcoin move of it's own accord rather than as a reaction to, say, the movement of currency X, as then there is more likelihood it would be recommended to be owned as part of a diversified fund.

When the financial press, or the mass media in general, report on currency performance they refer to the relative strength of a currency. These reports often include assets like gold and silver. And bitcoin.
edit: Analogy - a football team's performance is judged on how many points they win, not how many possessions of the ball or how many games they played.

Asset correlation pertains to longer term relationships not momentary reactions to current events. If you overlay the long term bitcoin price chart with anything else - gold, reits, stocks, bonds, etc any of the asset classes over the same time frame, do any of them match up with bitcoin ie are any of them (+ or -) correlated. No. Bitcoin is uncorrelated. 
I'm not sure what you meant by 'responding to any economic externality', maybe you could revisit the definition of the term and re-phrase your point.
We can both agree that btc is increasingly looked upon as a safe haven, albeit safety is a relative term and the general public would no doubt question our logic on this!

and yet Schiff's been selling gold to gullible investors prior to the 2011 peak, through the peak at over $1800, and all the way down to now at just over $1100, and every step of the way over all those years issuing mega-bullish gold forecasts
whereas when noobs come here asking "should I buy" most bitcoiners will say bitcoin is experimental, it could go to zero, or it could go up a lot, don't buy if you can't afford to lose, etc. yes we're hoping for the best and we're bullish (mostly) but we probably wouldn't be here otherwise

Good post and I agree with your general sentiment re uniting the community.
To your analogy, in the old days, bigger files for video, audio, etc might have seemed like common sense but compression routines were a far bigger improvement.
As for the current predicament, my understanding (I could easily be wrong) is that bigger blocks are part of the core roadmap of which segwit is step 1. The stumbling point seems to be some people insist on bigger blocks first, despite that that would take longer to implement than switching on segwit.

good write up but  
 &gt; So the 2x part is the second half of a scaling agreement known as the New York Agreement. It was a compromise between dozens of Bitcoin business and over 80% of the hashpower. This is an **unprecedented amount of support**, the likes of which really haven't been seen in Bitcoin.  
2X is not supported by the bitcoin devs, and if you look at the 2X github it doesn't even seem to be supported by its own dev. Also there seems to be very little community support. Most support is coming from a few majority miners and related business interests.   
2X is a simple linear increase, it won't handle exponential bitcoin growth. Also 2X is too soon if it's needed at all, better to allow time for segwit exponential scaling to take effect first. When we need to hard fork there are other features that can be included besides a 2X blocksize increase.

Much respect to him he's a great thinker but when you make a lot of calls sometimes you get lucky.

"we are now seeing the Motherf*&amp;er of all short squeezes!! it's straight to $1151+ now....very little pausing."   
We know what happened since - the price fell and only recently regained the $750.

You said "The industry needs really good marketing to convince people .."
I might be wrong but that seems to go against Regis's major premise, who advocates customer collaboration over the old way - convincing people through advertising.
Also the context of his piece is how a company should market its products and services; this would apply to businesses providing Bitcoin products and services, not so much Bitcoin itself. 
As an analogy, no one markets electricity but energy retailers market their own plans and services.

I'd like to think seeing Bitcoin as a lower layer protocol - an enabler of higher level services - was more long than short-sighted.
I can see where you are coming from, and I fully agree with your perspective, but I see Bitcoin as far larger than bitcoin the currency, and any marketing effort that focusses on and cements that ($ aspect) into the collective consciousness may do it a disservice in the long run.

Bitcoin surged past $6,400 for the first time yesterday as an American derivatives exchange announced plans to sell futures contracts for the digital currency.
The plans, announced by CME Group, would allow investors to trade in bitcoin in the same way that they trade in gold, oil and other assets that use futures.
It also would allow investors to hedge bets that the price of bitcoin will rise, something that is difficult at present.
Bitcoin climbed as far as $6,415.28 before easing back to $6,362.65 in afternoon trading, up by 4 per cent for the day.
The price of one bitcoin has soared from $966 at the start of the year and broke through the $5,000 mark for the first time on October 11.
Bitcoin was worth next to nothing when the digital currency launched in 2009, but the price rose to $1,200 by the end of 2013. It crashed below $200 soon after.
Bitcoin, the most widely traded digital currency, exists only as strings of computer code. It gained notoriety for its use on dark web marketplaces, but has since entered the mainstream and is accepted by several retailers. Britain does not recognise bitcoin as a currency.
Joe Saluzzi, a principal at Themis Trading, said: “I have no problem with bitcoin. I like the concept. I have a problem that on Wall Street the innovators are trying to package something up and put a derivative label on it when they really don’t know what’s underneath. It reminds me of the financial crisis all over again.”

It's a backlog of transactions waiting to be mined; how can it not be about the miners? You want to try doing it by hand?
Also,  Bitcoin Core has an open source community of developers; it perfectly projects your perspective to perceive that to mean  being controlled by one team and one company. You need to learn about Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and what that entails.

Bitcoin is a nascent technology; we don't know how much energy it will use in the future, how much of incumbent systems it will replace, what entirely new industries/systems it will create or enable - the benefits of which may far exceed the energy costs, what future energy costs actually will be given development in clean renewables or new energy technologies (even dare I say it clean safe nuclear), whether current mining is overinvested and will rationalise or normalise, it's just too early to say. If the energy cost is too high it will likely be abandoned, or combined with other than POW, or otherwise evolved.

Bitcoin futures face safeguards to tackle wild gyrations
Exchanges insist on higher collateral and price caps amid calls to ringfence trades

Traders eagerly awaiting the debut of bitcoin futures will face tougher risk standards says the chief executive of the CME Group as the exchange operator plans to launch contracts on the highly volatile cryptocurrency.
Terry Duffy, CME chief executive, told the Financial Times he wants to lure a new generation of futures traders attracted by the cryptocurrency boom, although he acknowledges the challenges of creating a market infrastructure that can safely handle the hair-raising swings of bitcoin.
That may entail traders of CME bitcoin futures having to deposit close to 30 per cent of their value as collateral, says Mr Duffy, who is competing with a rival offering from Chicago neighbour, Cboe Global Markets.
The exchanges’ moves represent a first step by traditional institutions to take a serious look at a cryptocurrency, often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. There are, however, worries that the launch exposes new risks to important financial bodies such as clearing houses that guarantee futures markets. 
“Listen, it’s no mystery, this is a different product,” says Mr Duffy. “We want to get out something that’s safe.” 
At CME, no bitcoin futures trading will be permitted at prices 20 per cent above or below the prior day’s settlement, according to exchange literature. That is similar to its circuit breakers for stock-index futures.

CME will also require bitcoin futures traders to post greater margin, or good-faith collateral, held against a losing position. “The margin is yet to be decided, but it’s not going to be standard futures margin. This margin is probably going to be closer to 30 per cent,” Mr Duffy says. Typical futures margins are in single-digit percentages. 
Some are concerned about the dangers posed by such a market to massive clearing houses that help curtail systemic risk.
Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, this week took out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal to argue that bitcoin futures endangered the CME clearing house where his company has money at stake as a member. He urged regulators to require separate, ringfenced clearing houses for cryptocurrencies. 
“Margining such a product in a reasonable manner is impossible,” Mr Peterffy wrote, adding that “a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilises members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilise the clearing organisation itself”. 
Prices for the two rivals’ bitcoin futures will be based on spot bitcoin transactions at cryptocurrency exchanges whose record raises concern among financiers.

CME intends to use the CME CF bitcoin Reference Rate, a daily dollar price of bitcoin derived from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.
Six bitcoin exchanges underpinned the index as recently as April, when CME removed the Bitfinex and OKCoin exchanges after banks blocked their customers from wiring dollars in and out. 
Last year, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex lost more than $60m worth of bitcoin to hackers and was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission “for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” and failing to register. A message sent to Bitfinex chief executive J L van der Velde received no response. 
San Francisco-based Kraken yesterday told customers its platform was seeing slow response times, connection timeouts and delays in withdrawals. A CME official says the problems did not interrupt the calculation of its bitcoin rate. Kraken did not respond to queries. 
John Lothian, a former futures trader and broker who publishes a markets newsletter, says of CME’s venture: “They’re giving legitimacy to bitcoin and to these exchanges. They’re sharing their credibility with them. Whether they will be hurt by this or whether they profit by this is yet to be seen.” 
The Cboe contract will be based on bitcoin auction prices at Gemini Trust, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange. “The Gemini bitcoin auction is an incredible liquidity event for bitcoin,” says John Deters, Cboe chief strategy officer. 
Yet Don Wilson, chief of DRW, a leading derivatives and cryptocurrencies trader, expressed concern about Gemini at a futures industry conference in Chicago last month. “Some of the auctions are pretty thinly traded,” he says, noting a recent one did not take place. A person close to Gemini blamed a glitch that has been fixed.

Most banks and asset managers have avoided the $120bn bitcoin market, given its intense volatility and evolving mechanics. Vincent Viola, founder of Virtu Financial, another proprietary trading group, says: “We have stayed away from bitcoin at Virtu . . . we didn’t understand it enough and it wasn’t regulated enough.” 
However, futures industry executives say if any venues are able to handle the gyrations of bitcoin it is futures exchanges, which routinely manage contracts that make cryptocurrencies seem tame, such as electricity derivatives. 
“The industry has long experience with managing volatility and managing products that move around a lot,” says Carl Gilmore, president of Integritas Financial Consulting, who formerly led futures clearing firms. 
Mr Duffy also sees bitcoin as a way of finding another generation of customers. 
“I . . . look at it as a client-acquisition play,” he says. “There’s clients who trade our products, but may not trade as often, who are intrigued by this. There’s a lot of young people that will like this type of marketplace, and they don’t even know what futures are today.”

They're making the FUD, where's their source? Oh yeah, there is none; painting bitcoin's eco-credentials absolute black when it isn't the case is worse than just shit journalism. The reality of the energy situation is worth talking about but if someone has an extra hydro plant that's not getting used, and a miner uses it for bitcoin, and you come along and say hey that's equivalent to megatons of coal and CO2 blah blah Bitcoin is ruining the environment, then there's not much to discuss, it's blatant bullshit.

Yeah sure I'm with you on that, but that's the actual fee price; let's say it averages $10/tx, and is steady at about $10/tx, that's not volatility. It's a high fee because of high demand, it's not going to necessarily be \*volatile\* per se  - go up and down a lot, one minute $10, next $3, next $10 again.

The Romans spread themselves too thin. Conquering the Med was relatively cheap due to low transport costs. Spreading into the continental interior was very expensive.

Yes, agreed, as I've already stated the fee will go up. But I'm also suggesting the possibility that it could go up to a reasonably steady/sustainable 'high' and not \*necessarily\* incur increased volatility. ie volatility is \*not necessarily\* a characteristic of high fees. Not saying there won't be any volatility, that's always been part of the landscape, caused by a variety of conditions.

Users have around $20 billions at stake. Most don't want to move to an altcoin because none of the alts offer the same features (eg not centralised, immutable, not premined, etc) as Bitcoin.
Miners have gambled on a short term strategy. They face rapid obsolescence, at least that has been the pattern so far and there is no reason to believe it won't continue. They need to milk the system for all they can as quickly as possible. Long term for them is measured in months.

The first thing anyone looking at the history of IT will notice is the incredible scaling in almost every aspect, memory, storage, CPU densities, broadband, etc etc etc.

**Summary**  
Bitcoin is not likely to become primarily used as a currency.
Gresham's Law states that consumers will not spend deflationary currencies when they can spend inflationary ones.
No currency has ever been as deflationary as Bitcoin.
It will likely become a brand new asset class, playing several primary roles in the global financial system.
Eventually, it is likely to supplant gold as the world's primary store of value asset.

There could very well be a standard global cryptocurrency in the future, and there is no reason why this couldn't be Bitcoin since it is trustless and all or most nations could agree to adopt it, probably in conjunction with their existing fiat at first. So yes, at some point the 'hyper' part of the S-curve of adoption will occurand it may happen far sooner than 'logic and rationality' would presuppose, perhaps within 10 to 20 years. The value after that could easily eclipse gold's $7T, maybe 7-fold (which would equate to roughly 10% of global wealth which should reach $500T by then), then climb more steadily, with low volatility.

There's more than volatility in the equation, eg risk adjusted reward, legality (in some coutries you can't own gold - even happened in USA) and lots of other factors.

Probably what I meant was more like, no one was talking about a possible sudden gox closure when the price got to $1200 or so in 2013, it was totally out of the blue, whereas the types of things you are talking about are mostly already happening or fairly well known.

I’d like to say a big thanks to u/themetalfriend for running the competition, you are Gentleman!!  Your generosity and spirit really embody the character of the Bitcoin community. Good Karma to you!
  
I’d love to share my price prediction formula with you all, but I’m afraid I don’t have one! It was sheer luck. A wild ass guess. Wild, but predicated on a few assumptions:  
* I figured there was high (no not *that* high) pent up demand waiting for resolution of the scaling issue.   
* I guessed supply was tight due to the halvening, and again, price action – supply was getting mopped up, but this really was a wild card.  
* It was clear by early April that Segwit would get activated, and the price action from around then appeared to confirm this.  
 
So I’m like, well this is good for a decent 50% pop, plus a generous shot of exuberance, and that gave me a range of $4750 - $4950 by end of August.  
As for the future, last Dec when the price was under $1000 I predicted the end of 2017 price at just under $7000 (also in another reddit price guessing post lol), so that’s starting to look a bit too conservative now. Maybe I’ll polish up the crystal ball over the weekend.

And we’re back. It looked on Friday as though the much-discussed bitcoin bubble was bursting spectacularly, with the currency sliding below $3,000 — now it’s back to almost $4,000.
The cryptocurrency rallied 5.2 per cent on Monday to $3,853, a rise of close to 30 per cent from the low of $2,972 struck at the end of last week, Reuters data show.
Traders in the hyper-volatile asset seem to have shrugged off plans announced last week for China’s three main bitcoin exchanges to halt trading amid a regulatory crackdown in one of the biggest markets for cryptocurrency.
The dramatic and difficult-to-predict moves have underscored once again the debate over whether bitcoin will ever rise to the status of a proper currency, or if it will remain mostly in the purview of a smaller niche, from black markets to privacy advocates.
Still, bitcoin is becoming difficult for managers to ignore given its dazzling performance this year that has beaten just about every other asset class.

Do you think the 2X hard fork is essential and necessary for scaling, especially with respect to its timeframe? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:54:26


The $price is a metric we can all relate to, but completely replacing fiat globally, even if that's a goal at all for some, is a very very long-term goal. The potential of bitcoin is far greater than use as a currency.   
In the dot-com era people used "eyeballs" as a metric, but the underlying theme was the internet is here and it's revolutionary, and it's impact will be unimaginable.

You *can* earn interest on bitcoin, quite high interest.


There's far more to bitcoin than being 'inflation-proof' and while inflation may be low now it's very likely to not stay that way.  


Bitcoins are subdividable by 100,000,000, and in the future could be subdivided further if required.  


Ubiquitous smart phones already provide far greater reach than legacy banking, and global satellite coverage provides for those with no internet connection.   


No, we're ok that you don't get it. It's still experimental/early stage and not ready for mass rollout. Please wait until it's more user friendly and easier to understand.  


That is a misconception. Bitcoin has a public ledger, meaning all transactions are public. It's the banks such as HSBC, [who provide tax cheats and criminals - themselves included - with banking services]( you need to be wary of, and cash (mostly USD) is the preffered tender of terrorists, drug rings, criminals.  


Not sure where you got your fee income from, but Visa alone takes &gt; $13 Billion a year, and they're just one cog in the legacy system. Anyhow, saving on fees is like asking how much postage you save due to communicating by internet/email, and concluding the value of such is a few postage stamps per year * population. See  above.

Among its $2.3 billion in assets is a $154 million hedge fund, MVP 1. The fund is up 72.5% so far this year, Mr. Miller said in an interview. It has about 30% of its assets in bitcoin, he said, up from about 5% ​in 2016.
In his latest letter to the hedge fund’s investors, released this week, Mr. Miller said the fund paid an average price of about $350 for its bitcoin, which traded on ​Friday morning above $5,700.
He isn’t buying more for the fund at these prices, although he noted in an email that if he didn’t already own bitcoin in his personal account, he would be willing to “put 1% of my liquid net worth in it here.”
In the letter, Mr. Miller pointed out that a “Murderers’ Row” of revered investors have been declaring that bitcoin is overpriced or a “bubble,” including Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett, James Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Laurence Fink of BlackRock Inc., Bridgewater Associates’ Ray Dalio​ and Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management.
“My view on bitcoin is that it is a technological experiment that may or may not prove to have any long lasting value,” Mr. Miller wrote in his letter. “Bitcoin has a market capitalization greater than 90% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, but it still might fail. I don’t know and neither does anyone else, no matter how certain they are of their opinion.” As of ​Friday, Bitcoin had a total ​value in circulation of approximately $​96 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com.
Added Mr. Miller, “I believe there is still a nontrivial chance bitcoin goes to zero, but each day it does not, that chance declines as more venture capital flows into the bitcoin ecosystem and more people become familiar with bitcoin and buy it.”
Mr. Miller has some credibility when it comes to spotting value in assets that other investors regard as overpriced. In the 1990s, he was among the few value investors specializing in cheap companies who dared to buy hot technology stocks like AOL and Amazon.com
On the other hand, his Legg Mason Value Trust racked up horrific results during the financial crisis with big bets on American International Group, Eastman Kodak ​and Freddie Mac.

You might be confusing separate issues. A mining attack is when miners gain enough strength to alter the contents of the ledger ie alter wallet balances.


Mining software simply 'packs' transactions into blocks, and yes they are free to run their own software.


"When several nodes (usually most nodes on the network) all have the same blocks in their locally-validated best block chain." 


One could support bitcoin AND not trust the majority of hash power - they are not mutually exclusive. Miners can or should be trusted to maximise their own economic interest; that's an inherent part of the system, like them or not.  


Yes. The 16 or so signers of the NYA are free to express their opinion.    


We have seen this in the past; Bitmain blocked segwit progress to their own benefit. Bitcoin evolves to work around such things.

Some brief digging around on Larry Summers:
  
  
A couple of highlights:
Summers hailed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act in 1999, which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking, insurance, and investment services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act)...Many critics, including President Barack Obama, have suggested the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act.[28] Indeed, as a member of President Clinton's Working Group on Financial Markets, **Summers**, along with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt, Fed Chairman Greenspan, and Secretary Rubin, **torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in Fall 2008**.[29]
Upon being nominated Treasury Secretary by President Clinton in 1999, Summers listed assets of about $900,000 and debts, including a mortgage, of $500,000.[58] By the time he returned in 2009 to serve in the Obama administration, he reported a net worth between $17 million and $39 million.[58] He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.  
...  
According to the Wall Street Journal, Summers called Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) asking him to remove caps on executive pay at firms that have received stimulus money, including Citigroup.[71]  
On April 3, 2009 Summers came under renewed criticism after it was disclosed that he was paid millions of dollars the previous year by companies which he now has influence over as a public servant. He earned $5 million from the hedge fund D. E. Shaw, and collected $2.7 million in speaking fees from Wall Street companies that received government bailout money.[72]  
In the 2010 documentary Inside Job, Summers is presented as one of the key figures behind the late-2000s financial crisis. Charles Ferguson points out the economist's role in what he characterizes as the deregulation of many domains of the financial sector.
(There's much. much, more dirt there if anyone is interested.)

lol, subtle as the blitz.  


Only a small group of foolhardy extremists advocate the contentious 2X hard fork.  
2X is not a compromise, it's a unilateral, hostile attempt by a group of businesses, (mostly DCG group, spearheaded by Barry Silbert), to remove the Core devs and attempt to take ownership of the code.  
Segwit, which is already a 4X increase (gives us just under 4MB block weight), was activated due to the BIP148 and the user activated soft fork (UASF), a show of solidarity by the majority of the community, who at this stage do not want or need another 2X increase on top of that, certainly not as a hostile hard fork with no replay protection. Nor does 2X take into account the many beneficial new features denominated on the hard fork wish list.  It's too soon for an HF but when we do have one we need to optimise its payload to more than a 'simple' 2X.

That's something of a fallacy, it's only money when a transaction occurs and even then, it's money transferred between buyer and seller so net zero cash, so not really "therefore money".
You occasionally see new coins listed with a premine in the 100's of billions, then if just 1 person buys one coin for $1, instantly you have created $100s of billions of dollars?  No, it's just an illusion. (Ok I've exaggerted to make the point.)
Or, 
One day your bitcoin is worth $10k. You go to work and come home.
Next day it's worth $20k. You go to work and come home.
Next day it's worth $10k. You go to work and come home.

Similarly with bitcoin exchanges, to put it simply they list the people ready to buy at a particular price (buy orders) and a list of sellers ready to sell at a particular price (sell orders). (ofc it's a bit more complicated than this).

I'd like to see some reality from coinmarketcap. I think we all know the total cap is nowhere near the headline figure, some of the ico tokens for eg are worth maybe 1% of their market value, so if/when there is a crash it will be mostly the removal of an illusion, and it would also be a rollover into safe harbours - mainly bitcoin.

It's hard for most people to buy bitcoin, especially in large amounts. We're definitely nowhere near dot com levels of participation by at least an order of magnitude and then some.
DotCom was a Wall St product and was pumped voraciously in the media, compared to crypto we have seen nothing. 
However, there are scam coins and ICOs that are in bubbles. If you are buying (or donating, if you read the fine print) into a $100mill ICO for a white paper you gotta ask questions of yourself.

Yes that's the simple definition, and everyone is one the same page. If someone is willing to pay $1, that *is* the market price, and at that moment all the other coins (or shares, or barrels of oil) *are* worth that.  
But you are free to buy and sell based on your own formula of what you consider to be 'real worth'; you personally can take into account all the variables you choose to consider, make your trades, win or lose. What you can't do is get everyone else to agree to your formula because there is too much subjectivity, asymmetrical knowledge, unknowns, and variety of pricing models and methods.

No it isn't. The point of capitalism is private rather than state ownership.
Furthermore, the degree of efficiency of said resource use is not part of the equation.


Not true.  The Roman Empire consumed vast amounts of resources for 100's of years.  Its eventual collapse was in part due to eventual high inflation and there is no evidence to suggest they consumed more resources in the latter stages of their civilisation.

Epiphany perhaps?
An epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, epiphaneia, "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.
 
This article is about the feeling. For other uses, see Epiphany.

WILL BITCOINS BITE BACK?
The emergence of Bitcoin and an array of alternative cryptocurrencies over the past 5 years has been one of the true phenomena of eCommerce. Initially a purely P2P (Person To Person) mechanism, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being offered by online retailers as purchasing options. However, in their short history cryptocurrencies have been dogged by controversy, with a number of exchanges closed down and their assets seized after their owners were accused of using the sites for illegal activities, including money laundering and the purchase of prohibited substances...

How did you vote yesterday? No, I’m not asking who you voted for. How did you actually vote? The chances are you, like most voters, walked to your local polling station, queued up, pencilled “x” on your ballot paper and put it in the box. For all the ways technology has transformed our lives, it is remarkable how archaic the fundamental act of democracy remains.
Various countries have tried to drag it into the 21st century, sometimes trying to speed up the counting (punch card machines or computerised ballot counters instead of humans), sometimes trying to overhaul the act of voting itself (touchscreen voting machines or online votes).
Such efforts usually run into the same technological problems. First, the more complexity you introduce the more that can go wrong. Second, voting remotely raises all sorts of security questions: what’s to prevent someone impersonating you? Who would own and manage the database of results? How do we ensure it doesn’t get hacked or misused? Third, if you decide, as a result, to dispense with that electronic paper trail and get people to vote in person on a terminal, what if you need a recount? This is one area, it turns out, where pencil and paper have yet to be bettered. Until now.
For there is a new technology which promises to solve many of these problems — a revolutionary system whose protocols may turn democracy, and for that matter capitalism, on its head. That technology is commonly known as bitcoin.
That’s right: bitcoin. The online currency famous for being used by nerds to buy drugs and extort people. The cryptocurrency which looks a lot like an asset bubble, whose price has trebled this year alone.
In much the same way as the least interesting thing about Wikileaks is Julian Assange, the least interesting thing about bitcoin is the currency itself. What really matters is the technology sitting behind it, a kind of cloud database created alongside the currency by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
The blockchain, as he called it, is a register of every bitcoin transaction ever made. With most currencies, electronic transfers are recorded by banks and payment systems, presided over by a central bank. With bitcoin those transactions are logged by volunteers’ computers around the world, all of them constantly chugging away, processing and verifying each transaction. Equally interesting is the way those computers — or rather their users — are incentivised to be part of the network: if they are the first to verify a transaction, they get rewarded with more than one bitcoin of their own.
Here we have a currency you can send and receive, and be assured your transaction will be safely registered, not just in one central computer owned by a dubious company, but in a peer-to-peer database that can’t be meddled with. Add on the fact that bitcoin users can maintain their anonymity and you have a monetary system free of government control.
While we’re at it, there’s also something meta-exciting about the micro-economic model itself. Most new internet protocols and networks are created either by the government (email, the internet) or by companies (Facebook, Twitter). Bitcoin and its blockchain provide a new model: a way of building a network by encouraging users with computers to take a stake in its future (the more processing power you donate, the more bitcoins you’ll earn). Voila: a new, robust, self-sustaining online network that doesn’t depend on the state or Mark Zuckerberg. You can see why libertarians love it so much.
And the blockchain might just change the world. Every major bank worth its salt has started to invest in the technology — perhaps for fear of being left out of a new financial phenomenon. Governments and central banks are sniffing around and thinking about future regulation. But its uses go further still — after all, most businesses sit atop massive databases. I can think of at least one airline that might like the sound of a resilient, cloud-based database which doesn’t collapse when one server goes down. In a world where most products are created on complex supply chains, cloud-based ledgers of information — verified indices of when a product leaves a factory and so on — could become invaluable.
And then you have elections. Imagine if every vote was lodged and encrypted on a blockchain — distributed far and wide, owned by nobody. With a mobile phone containing your encryption key, you could vote from home, or the polling booth, or anywhere. That vote would be registered and verified on the blockchain: there would be a permanent, anonymised, unhackable electronic paper trail for every vote in the country. Perhaps that would make little difference in the UK — and it wouldn’t stop people trying to influence your vote offline — but imagine the impact in countries where democracy is rather less robust.
All of which goes some way towards illustrating why everyone is so excited about blockchain. As the cryptocurrency expert Dave Birch says of bitcoin in his new book Before Babylon, Beyond Bitcoin, it “isn’t the kind of liner that eventually transports passengers across the Atlantic in unparalleled luxury… It’s the kind of steamship that shows that steamships work and sets off a chain of innovation that triggers a sustainable change in the way that the world works.”

This Stolfi guy doesn't know what he's talking about: 


From wikipedia: "*Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.*"
From Investopedia: "*The terms "penny stocks" and "micro-cap stocks" can be used interchangeably. Technically, micro-cap stocks are classified as such based on their market capitalizations, while penny stocks are looked at in terms of their price.

Cryptocurrencies go way beyond Bitcoin, and way out of reach
Share via Email
Bitcoins are just one of countless new electronic currencies that are emerging. Their proponents are not interested in joining the real world, they want to work in the virtual world. 
"This is what I live for!" crows one cryptocurrency trader on the popular forum, Reddit. "The minute these babies hit 1000, I'm cashing out and buying a crypto-yacht."
On Thursday, it took less than 30 seconds for blockchain start-up BAT to raise $US35 million ($47 million) for its fledgling network using a fundraising process called an initial coin offering (ICO).
BAT released a batch of unique cryptographic tokens to the public and the appetite to buy them was so voracious, one buyer spent the equivalent of $US4.5 million to get hold of as many tokens as they could.
ICOs join the growing list of cryptocurrencies: electronic units of value that gain and lose their intrinsic worth on the otherwise intangible qualities that underpin the internet: perceived pools of knowledge, shared information, crowd-sourced opinions and networked ideas. These are the collateral of electronic currencies.
  
Cryptocurrencies encompass two contradictory principles: for them to work they require, transparency, history, ledgers and electronic fingerprints, but they appeal to people who seek anonymity and work below the horizon of regulators and investment analysts.
Could BAT's tiny strings of code be the next Bitcoin? Will their value increase by 1000 per cent? Or will the founder of BAT take the money and scarper?
Risk-hungry players
Outlining big dreams for their blockchain technologies, hundreds of start-ups are crowdsourcing digital money from risk-hungry players, who are happy to pour Bitcoin and Ether (another electronic currency) into speculative, futuristic projects.
Tech developer Storj also released a swag of tokens via ICO in May; investors went ballistic and the company raked in $US30 million. The week before that, Gnosis tokens pulled in $US12.5 million.
  
"Whether or not the innovation around these proposed projects is actually any good remains to be seen," says one cryptocurrency trader, preferring to stay anonymous lest hackers target her Bitcoin stash.
"But everybody seems to be making stupid money at the moment, pumping and dumping these coins. All of this froth and the crazy activity of the last few months is just fuelled by FOMO [fear of missing out] and greed."
The controversial decentralised currency, Bitcoin, is back in the headlines this week after the price soared to a record high of $US2420 (about $3800 at the time) on May 24.
More than $US500 million has poured into ICOs and as a result the market capitalisation for the cryptocurrency ecosystem has ballooned out to $US80 billion.
  
Potential risks
While the idea of a high-risk, high-return investment makes sense for those hungry for the next big thing, the lack of structure, the relative novelty of the industry and the opaqueness of many ICOs are all contributing to an environment that has some unease over the potential risks.
"An ICO issues cryptotokens rather than stocks and bonds, but that's irrelevant to the substance of the activity, which is raising capital from the general public," Ajit Tripathi, a director in fintech at PwC said during the week.
"Capital raising activities need to be regulated to protect investors . . . The question is how sophisticated are these investors?"
 Crypto currencies encompass two contradictory principles, for them to work they require, transparency, history, ledgers ...
Crypto currencies encompass two contradictory principles, for them to work they require, transparency, history, ledgers and electronic fingerprints. But they appeal to people who seek anonymity and work below the horizon of regulators and investment analysts.
Perhaps not very. One ICO called Matchpool gave investors a fright when the chief executive suddenly withdrew the 37,500 Ether ($8.9 million) raised without any explanation. And one crafty group is trading on the Rothschild name with "Rothschild Family LCF coins" purporting to streamline payments for Internet of Things devices.
"So many of these ICOs could be scams and so many founders can just sit on these tokens, do nothing and gain value," says another Bitcoin enthusiast, who has refrained from the speculation but is keeping an eye on interesting blockchain ideas.
"But the memory that Bitcoin was once worth 5¢ is powering people to want exposure to anything and everything."
Despite the "public ledger", Bitcoin is still the currency of choice for illegal activities the world over. The recent WannaCry ransomware that swept the world demanded payment in Bitcoin, while elaborate human trafficking, drug smuggling and child abuse rackets are known to transact only in the cryptocurrency.
Where are we heading?
The principles of cryptocurrency essentially lie in the concept of trust. At the moment, citizens have little choice but to trust the sovereign's money; the notion of a promissory note is still very much alive.
The invention of Bitcoin and the gaining popularity of decentralised, eternally public ledgers indicate a movement away from this centralised charge. The "proof of work" concept, where every participant uses software to verify the existence and history of any given asset, removes the need to rely on a government's promise.
Last year, programmers created the DAO, a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, a corporation of sorts that would run on self-executing contracts. It raised $184 million and was programmed on the Ethereum network. The notion of a self-executing company with voting rights distributed to "employees" spread like wildfire, but the project was hacked and the creators forced to reprogram and ultimately split their network.
But that demand for the DAO is not too dissimilar to that for these ICOs – where hundreds of teams are trying to think up different ways this decentralised technology could empower and streamline existing needs: it shows a growing distrust of centralised institutions and instead a reliance on computing power and the masses.
Question of trust
But some argue, all of these programmed networks, designed to cut out the middleman, undermines the human need to trust each other.
"The value of market capitalism is not just that it allocates resources efficiently; it also creates a society in which we all rely on each other for our well-being," says Matt Levine, former investment banker at Goldman Sachs and now a columnist at Bloomberg View.
Using the example of food security, Mr Levine describes the trust between those that grow food, the invisible web of exchanges, debits and credits tracked by the bank, and the money used to pay for it.
"Over time, technology has improved all of these processes, but there has always been some residual need for trust that was not entirely susceptible to technological solution, some need for co-operation and belief in the system for that system to function."
But as the recent rally in the Bitcoin price shows, more and more people are intrigued by the notion of a decentralised system and could be signalling the future economy would be one where more people have access to wealth and credit, ushering in an era of entrepreneurship. But there is certainly more than just a small amount of risk.

Around 80% of mining is renewables, but miners don't build solar farms, that would be just totally uneconomical, rather, miners set up at places like unused/underused hydro dams, where the energy would otherwise simply go to waste and can, therefore, be acquired very cheaply. Converting this surplus/waste energy into economic value is brilliant.

Bitcoin's rapid rise gives reason to question all the hype
At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Bloomberg
by Lily Katz
Bitcoin's astronomical rally has cryptocurrency bulls feeling vindicated. "Not so fast!," sceptics say.
The digital currency's more than 100 per cent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $US1,000 for the first time. By Valentine's Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $500.
Then it absolutely exploded, jumping more than $1,400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival into the mainstream of blockchain, the coin's underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient.
But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 per cent the next day. Bitcoin was down 1.5 per cent to $2,255.50 at midday trading in New York on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST). For bears, that kind of volatility shows the asset's unreliability as a store of value.

Here are some other reasons for why caution is warranted:
Safety questions: This month's ransomware attacks serve as a reminder that bitcoin is still beloved by hackers and criminals because of its anonymity.
The cryptocurrency plunged in 2014 after Tokyo-based Mt. Gox - then the largest bitcoin exchange - said it had been breached and then filed for bankruptcy. Its value sank again in August 2016 after hackers stole about $69 million from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. The exchange has since repaid its customers.
Scaling debate: The bitcoin community has been split for more than a year on how to upgrade its blockchain. The time and fees necessary to verify transactions have climbed to record highs, making it more difficult for businesses to use the currency as a means of payment.
While bitcoin executives have said that 2017 might be the year the cryptocurrency really starts to scale, others aren't so sure.
Holland's tulip-bulb craze of the 17th century is one of many reminders that speculative bubbles ultimately burst.

Last week, more than 50 companies signed a pact to speed up transactions, but ideological differences have prevented similar agreements - like the one reached last year in Hong Kong - from actually being implemented. The much-touted SegWit upgrade was also released in October, but only a third of the community has embraced it. If the latest proposal fails to gain traction and the deadlock continues, digital currency users may dump bitcoin in favour of alt-coins that offer better blockchains.
Rival digital currencies: As the surge sends the cryptocurrency world into a frenzy, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. While bitcoin's value has increased more than 100 per cent since the beginning of the year, its slice of the pie has shrunk as its digital cousins steal some of the spotlight.
There are an estimated 700 rivals, according to Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.
Bitcoin dominates about half of the overall digital currency, down from around 85 per cent in February, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Meanwhile, Ethereum's share increased to about 20 per cent. Some token fans aren't sweating it, though, as they say bitcoin's potential demise doesn't really matter as long as another digital currency takes hold.
Not recognised by governments: The general public doesn't understand bitcoin, and many regulators still don't either, which makes it tough to regulate. In 2015, New York started issuing controversial licences to cryptocurrency companies, but only three had been issued by mid-January, according to Coinbase, as many startups couldn't afford the costs of applying.
In January, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority asked the public for help identifying the potential risks of blockchain. Two months later, bitcoin plummeted after the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency.
In a report last week about blockchain in China, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote that while the technology could benefit Chinese banks, it's unlikely to start a financial revolution.
"We believe blockchain application is more likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary in developing countries like China," the analysts said. "Aside from the conservative regulatory attitudes toward financial innovations, the constraint of confidentiality and performance of blockchain technology would make it best positioned to be enterprise-oriented rather than consumer-end."
Bubbles burst: Whether it's Holland's tulip-bulb craze in the 17th century or the Internet-stock frenzy of the late 1990s, history shows that markets self correct. Speculative markets usually run out of steam at some point. Determining the trigger is always the hard part. Given the breathtaking run in bitcoin as of late, some say it's tough to believe the oft-cited mantra that this time is different.

Mostly anecdotal like reading interviews with miners. 
Some of the first mining farms in China were coal-powered but they have mostly, if not all, moved to hydro, where in some regions of China over 50% of hydro capacity (potential energy) is wasted, so the cost of electricity is very low.  
You may be surprised how much electricity around the world is generated but not used simply due to mismatch with demand, lack of storage, the cost and slowness of stopping and re-starting generating equipment, politics, etc. And when hydro plants are idled that's just wasting potential energy. 
I don't know how much surplus generation (let alone general wastage) globally is wasted but I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the order of PwH. Hopefully the build out of renewables, better storage, smart grids, and smart consumption will get us through our environmental crisis.

Bitcoin can be technically challenging but it is also very fascinating on many levels and potentially rewarding, so don't be too put off.


Compare to a Visa debit card: no physical coins or notes are involved when you use your debit card, it's just an online transfer of value.


Many years ago, before there were banks, people traded various items of agreed value - sea shells, bags of salt, etc. Bitcoin is a modern equivalent of an old system.  


As does most commerce these days. How much cash do you really use?  


You don't need to know how it all works, very few people do. Do you need to know how your internet browser works? If bitcoin really is too hard, just stay away, it isn't for everyone (yet!)

Misleading title, misleading logic.


1% of Bitcoin Addresses Hold 99% of Bitcoin Wealth
Most addresses, 10's of millions of them, are unused.  
Don't try to imply these are the addresses of 'poor people'.  
This is nothing like the fiat world's 1% v 99%.
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:53:18
Just from other estimates I've seen floating around. There are no good metrics. A single wallet, even a single address, could represent many people, eg an exchange wallet.  Alternatively, an individual may have many wallets and many addresses.

Hmm .. except oil is a consumable. With bitcoin, the more it is used, and the higher the network effect, the more valuable it becomes.


Maybe add to the formula some ratio of tx volume and median fees?


Yes, maybe if you filter out the premined, instamined, non-crypto (looking at you ripple), centralised, and mutable coins. :)




Yes you could possibly add those to the equation.

"Bitcoin Is No Longer a Currency

and concludes ...
"That leaves one final question. What kind of commodity is Bitcoin if it's not a currency? Well, it's a technologically-impressive product out to revolutionize the world with absolutely no fundamentals to justify its billion-dollar valuation. It's the ultimate dotcom stock, minus the sock puppet."
technologically-impressive - that alone, the genius of the bitcoin system  distinguishes bitcoin from almost 100% of the dotcom stocks, many of which were little more than websites fronting silly ideas (webvan anyone?)

Keep in mind Visa doesn't confirm for the retailer as fast as bitcoin. There is also an overall cut off point of 540 days for Visa chargeback from the date of the transaction.  This cost hits the retailer directly, but we all know who pays in the end through higher general prices. With bitcoin you can accept 0 confirms for near instantaneous transactions.

As a currency bitcoin may become daily use for some people, maybe in parts of Africa for instance, and in many other places is/will be adjunct to existing fiat, especially for online transactions.
The suggestion that bitcoin will replace USD for example is more of a media myth than anything emanating from the bitcoin community. You see bitcoin in the press represented as a pile of gold coins which is utterly misrepresentative.
Bitcoin is far more than merely new coins, just as the internet is more than just packets of data. The btc price and stability are minor concerns at this stage, like I said earlier, minor enough that millions of people are prepared to buy it.

no, it's still there:
"but the Bitcoin algorithm has left no place for compassion, either. Governments and treasuries in times of crisis sometimes make decisions that appear to go against the interests of the state. We saw many of those around 2008 -- admittedly heroic measures taken primarily to fix dumb-ass mistakes. Bitcoin, for all its digital purity, makes such policies impossible to implement, taking away our policy safety net."
You might not remember the GFC? Banksters 'earning' (by stealing) hundreds of billions with total impunity? Occupy Wall St? US Govt printing trillion$ (and still are). 
Not to mention that "bitcoin ... makes such policies impossible to implement" is false. Code changes can be agreed to in times of crisis.

If Peter became an advocate for Bitcoin, and therefore helped strengthen its network effect to the extent that he could, the value of his gold holdings could rise as people from markets around the world that were previously precluded from buying gold, or where there is high friction, or security issues, etc, might start buying it via Bitcoin.

Just considering the investment/savings angle, there's about $6,000,000,000,000 (trillion) of gold out there, and considering btc's additional functionality, btc could easily grow to 10% of that, or $60,000,000,000, so a long way to go yet.

We will witness the launch of bitcoins evil nemesis, Krugcoin^TM.
There will be trillions of them initially, and billions more mined everyday according to an exponential growth formula.
Completely anonymous and so widely used for drugs trade, weapons trade and war funding, human slave trade and prostitution, money laundering, tax avoidance, ie the usual Wall St business activities.
Owners of krugcoin will not really own them, only have a 'right' to use them.
Yes they are entirely worthless, but goon squads will enforce their use, and a mass marketing campaign will convince you that you actually covet them, and will even kill for more and more and more....

Well I tried to let you save face too.
I simply made a comment about litecoin, to which you replied some vague generality about hedging and market competition. Clearly I hadn't stated there should be no hedging or competition. There are other alts I quite like, and I'm fascinated by the evolution of the space. 
Knocking litecoin is not knocking bitcoin. That's clear and obvious, no further explanation needed. 
They were your first 2 points, and if it degenerated into fart sniffing, I'm afraid the wind is blowing in your general direction.
Your next points:


That's simply retarded. Like if there was more gold it would be easier for people to buy it.


If new people are paying $30 for an alt coin that doesn't offer any real value how is that less risky?


I won't go into the problems that creates.


ASICs do not decentralise the network, just the opposite.

Overstock.com (Nasdaq: OSTK) might lead the e-commerce revolution into Bitcoin.
Initially reported by the New York Times in October, NewsBTC quotes Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne in saying the e-commerce giant will begin accepting Bitcoin in the second-half of 2014. The company will be working independently to implement a proprietary system for accepting Bitcoin payments, he noted.
While many move to convert Bitcoin immediately upon receipt, Byrne noted that the company would need to find a way to hedge its risk if Overstock.com were to do something like that.
Byrne wasn't put-off by recent fluctuations in Bitcoin, particularly as the People's Bank of China took a stronger stance on transactions in the virtual money.
Shares of Overstock.com are down 0.7 percent.

Bitcoin curious recruits in Latin America
By editor / 07/09/2013 / No comments
The bitcoin , a virtual currency that was born out of financial systems , begins to develop in Latin America , reports Emilio Godoy * ( IPS ) from Mexico .
bitcoin Bitcoin curious recruits in Latin America
The systems engineer Moses user Briseno is a student of this system completely digital transaction without issuing authority.
" I buy and sell bitcoins . I check how quotes and if there are any trends . Still have little presence in the region. One of my goals is to enable existing businesses to receive and display the user benefits and business, "said Mexico's Briseno , who studied the first algorithm to mint this coin .
It was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Japanese programmer believed to be the alias of a person or group, and the software ( software) to broadcast it and share it on a network of users was published in January 2009.
There is an electronic currency " in vogue " , but something much more revolutionary , told IPS Brazilian Fernando Ulrich , the non-governmental Ludwig von Mises Institute , in the southern city of Porto Alegre.
Ulrich , 33, is an avid bitcoin ( BTC ) , because not only reduces transaction costs , it also represents a new way of thinking about the international economy without interference from national states and central banks .
" I was surprised by its revolutionary potential . Network is a robust and an innovation that can change the way people make transactions , to free the citizens from dependence on money issued by the State of a monopoly , "he said .
Each " coin" is produced by computers that solve highly complex cryptographic problems .
The provision of "coins " is limited from the outset. About half is already in circulation, but the issue will continue at a slower and slower pace until 2140. The absence of a central transmitter has generated wide swings in value against the dollar or the pound sterling , but the trend is bitcoin appreciation against these currencies.
Not be faked , by using cryptographic system , transactions are filed from person to person , and can be exchanged for dollars , euros or other currencies and goods or services.
The applicant is connected to the decentralized network of all users and thus generates two unique keys and affiliated needed to exchange with any other client .
One key is private and remains hidden in the client's computer , the other is public and is one that allows transactions .
The system includes a mechanism to verify and validate the transaction and a public record of each transaction recorded , which allows you to track the history of each bitcoin .
This coin was first used in Brazil in 2012 and its users have a profile yet beginners and are curious to understand how it works.
Rodrigo Batista , president of the Brazilian company Bitcoin market , says the movement is low, but shows rapid growth.
" Most of the use is for sale (Currency ) for profit with its value. It is in the initial adoption process in Brazil , starting with São Paulo " , the most important industrial city in the country, told IPS Batista .
In Argentina there are between 4,000 and 5,000 stakeholders , including approximately 400 using this system , while others are studying , told IPS Bitcoin Foundation President Argentina , Diego Gutierrez.
The Foundation consultant , communicates and organizes two monthly explanatory meetings at its headquarters in Buenos Aires .
" The paper money is in danger of extinction and these coins have a technological advantage , which makes transactions safer," said Gutierrez .
The portal users LocalBitcoins detected in the city or the country where the navigator is .
According to the site Bitcoinwatch , 11.65 million are in circulation of these coins with a value of 1,461 million, with an average of 2,128 transactions per hour.
Countries such as Germany , Australia , Canada, Finland and France permit, as was banned in Thailand.
United States ordered this year to investigate the bitcoin , saying it could be a tool for terrorist financing or money laundering.
Argentine companies still " not encouraged " because there is no regulatory framework , Gutierrez said . But it is " the perfect currency for electronic commerce ," he said .
" I see no signs of regulations," said Mexico's Briseno .
Batista , however , said his transaction is subject to the laws governing trade in Brazil and believes that "some kind of specific regulation will come soon."
According to Ulrich , the BTC can overcome the international financial crisis .
Obey risks is a recent experiment , difficult to predict the long term. " It may be that some currencies bitcoin technology outweigh " he said. Already have appeared other virtual currencies simple computer programs .
Critics fear it will be used " for all types of crimes," he told IPS as attorney Thomas Schulte , Internet expert .
"With the bitcoin can commit every crime with real currency , but anonymously and in an unclear legal space ," he said .
* With additional reporting by Marcela Valente ( Buenos Aires ) , Fabiola Ortiz (Rio de Janeiro ) and Julio Godoy ( Berlin).

I read it as 1% of the potential market share, not 1% of the entire asset class, which would indeed be fabulous. For example with gold, let's say bitcoin has a potential market share of 5% of the total value of gold. Now if bitcoin only achieves 1% of that 5% market share in 10yrs, that is pessimistic.

Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia[1]) is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. (Wikipedia)
Outdated: 
adjective: outdated; adjective: out-dated

There's really no argument here.

Well I hope I can help any bitcoiners at least be a little bit (no pun!) more aware of what they are dealing with rather than give money away.
Even that listed 'partner' is highly speculative. Did you check them out? IPO in 2010, 70m shares @ 20c, now worth 3.3c.
Read through some of their statements for an even better reality check. (They have to provide some info since they are listed.)
eg The 2012 annual report.  
Key management compensation = $561k for 2012. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind over $1/2mill a year for doing what? Most of the work is expensed out (some of that to related entities).
Directors share holdings less than $10k between them at current price 3.3c. So what risk are the all so confident directors taking?

Some of our 'elders' have been trained in and have experienced new disruptive technologies and major paradigm shifts for decades, not to mention the changes in the economic and financial environment (including a change in their national unit of currency), so perhaps it's easier for them to grok bitcoin?

I'd be interested in seeing any persuasive logic to show that saving won't add stability and growth. (It's not a stock btw, but I'm sure you know that). 
Saving is not hiding it away for ever: you spend out of your savings (instead of from credit cards). If more and more people save bitcoin, the value will rise, stability will rise, and the bitcoin economy will grow stronger and stronger. 
I can see your point about pure speculation, but that's an extreme and unlikely scenario, and one that certainly hasn't been evidenced in reality to date, in fact just the opposite, every day more and more companies are accepting it.

"Germany recognizes Bitcoin as "private money" to
Success for Digital Currency: The Federal Ministry of Finance recognizes Bitcoin first time as "private money" on. Is not yet clear is whether sales tax may be obtained on commercial transactions. By Kathrin Gotthold and Daniel Eckert
Bitcoin is a symbolic coin: In reality, the currency exists only virtually

If the word was new territory ever appropriate for an Internet phenomenon, then for Bitcoins. Bitcoins are a working digital cash, but how they are economically, financially or legally, politically, evaluate raises many questions. A parliamentary inquiry has found (FDP), Member of Parliament Frank Schaeffler now brings a little clarity, how the federal government assesses the status of Bitcoins.
From the response of the Treasury stating that the federal government regards as Bitcoins units of account. As such, they are a kind of "private money" that can be used like cash in multilateral clearing circles. "For the first time, the federal government recognizes Bitcoins as private money," said Schaeffler, who has become known as a critic of the "Euro-rescue policy".
The mining of Bitcoins is private money creation in the eyes of the Treasury. This would Bitcoins approved as private money and tax law by the federal government. From the response of the Treasury further show that sales are not with Bitcoins sales tax exemption under Section 4, paragraph 8 letter b UStG.
Gains after a year tax-free
This in turn raises new questions. Recently asked the Treasury realized that gains from Bitcoins after one year are exempt. Now the question arises, what kind of Bitcoin transactions subject to sales taxes. In fact, however, the range of stakeholders likely to be very small. According to the Berlin tax consultant Wolfgang Wawro the sales tax liability should only affect people who act commercially with Bitcoins.

He draws a comparison with a professional trader on Ebay. Who occasionally sell a bottle of wine there was not a commercial dealer and must also pay any VAT on its sales. However, if you regularly transfer of ownership in wine on the online platform and a part of his livelihood deny it, would be subject to VAT, however. The same principle applies for Bitcoin traders.
Flaskämper Oliver, head of Germany's leading trading venue Bitcoin.de, sees no major impact on trade with the digital money. "Our customers operate in our view, fiscally speaking private asset management and regulatory permit a freehold business, regardless of the amount of Bitcoins traded and the amount of the transactions," says Flaskämper.
Barriers to sales tax liability are high
The Federal Fiscal Court (BFH) have repeatedly made it clear that the barriers of the "private wealth management" to the "commercial trading of financial instruments" are extremely high and generally only question come when you not only for himself ("own account"), but also for other persons ("third parties") is.
However, also applies: If it turns out in the end, that the commercial trade in Bitcoins really is sales tax, it would of course commercial Bitcoin traders and brokers paid the sales tax and nachentrichtet "says Flaskämper the trading on the Bitcoin.de will. but, if at all, only a marginal influence.
Even dealers who accept bitcoins as payment, must in the opinion of Flaskämper pay no sales tax "., The use of Bitcoins as payment is no power taxed is only the work performed, so the product or service purchased," says the entrepreneur. The actual payment process, however, is not a taxable supply.
Bitcoin was invented in 2009
Especially among young people, the digital currency is popular. The Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto invented in 2009 as Bitcoin crypto-currency. The idea: An algorithm makes Bitcoins tamper-proof and limit their number, so that the digital coins differently than euro and dollar fall prey to no inflation. Initially used as an anarcho-money only from the digital bohemians, are Bitcoins (symbol: BTC) now become a worldwide phenomenon.
More than 7500 shops and restaurants which digital coins, according to the Bitpay.com internet site. For online trading platforms such as Mt.Gox or Bitcoin.de can be against euro, dollar or other lawful currency exchange. Transfers are in seconds and conveniently possible and, moreover, largely anonymous. The potential anonymity of transactions makes it possible in theory to use Bitcoins for the purchase of drugs or money laundering. The latter have in common the virtual coins with cash.
Association warns of abuse
The possible abuse is one of the reasons why the Federal Association of the Digital Economy (BVDW) cautions against the use of Bitcoins. Already in 2011, the Association has advised its member companies to accept bitcoins as payment.
"The concerns raised at that time have been repeatedly confirmed by the numerous reports of hacker attacks, illegal transactions or valuation bubbles," says Michael Neuber, counsel for BVDW. Neither the association nor the value of security for Bitcoins are guaranteed "in a manageable way."
From the perspective of Neuber and other skeptics are pure speculation with Bitcoins to objects that are to be compared with investment products on the gray capital market. Concern for the lawyer considers in particular the possibility of anonymous transmission: "This opens the door to illegal activities."
Thailand has banned Bitcoin
Last transactions were prohibited Bitcoin in Thailand. The New York Financial has already sent subpoenas to two dozen Bitcoin firms to explain how the digital currency money laundering and other forms of abuse are possible.
"Bitcoins are no generally accepted, the official currency, but a - speculative - private currency," says Neuber. The prohibition in Thailand is due to the opened with the use of Bitcoins market risks therefore logical.
A court in the U.S. state of Texas has called Bitcoins early August as a "currency" that would similarly used as an official means of payment. This could result in future, the same rules apply as for the digital currency for official payment. Also, the transaction platforms could then be subject to similar laws such as financial institutions.
Whether the appeal and acceptance of crypto currency increases, has to be seen. Euro-rebel and FDP politician Schaffler is committed to currency competition. Bitcoins are a currency that could compete with the Euro. For users such as regulators for Bitcoins are just new territory."

I've created 3 new gem types in my lab. B-gems, L-gems, and R-gems. They're all pretty. 
There's not many B-gems so they're $100. 
There's more Y-gems so they're $10.
There's even more Z-gems so they're $1.
Most people will choose the L-gems. It's an irrational 'value' decision made relative the the available options; it's basic behavioural economics.
Now substitute with btc and alt coins. Most people will go with the middle-of-the-road option. 
I'd propose that in this example btc will be seen as too expensive, ytc as the 'rational' choice, while zpc are seen as so cheap maybe grab a few as well, what's to lose?
Another example: you go to a guitar shop, they have 3 choices:
1. Very expensive but will hold it's value, sounds beautiful, and gets even get better with age.
2. Middle of the road guitar, sounds good and might last a few years.
3. Very cheap plywood thing that sounds like crap.

Oh **has**, well that completely changes the meaning then ;-)
But seriously, please show proof why have is incorrect.

Few words but a lot spoken, recap can't do it justice, watch the replay.

At least SMH they have one thing right, using crime reporters to do the finance news.

Do you pay that 25% tax on stocks, bonds, etc other 'assets'? in addition to capital gains tax?

Just to help a bit with your research, Kenilworth say is they have 'an agreement' with an actual listed junior explorer, so not much to go on, but ...
"The obvious question for reasoned speculators now becomes, “How is it possible that 3,000 publicly listed companies are able to raise billions of dollars given that the odds of success are 1 in 1,000 for an OK deposit or 1 in 10,000 for the big deposit?” The simplistic answer is that Mother Nature has been very generous to exploration geologists and by association, the brokers that **make their living selling the dreams of buried treasure to the public by playing to human nature: greed and the susceptibility to an easy getting rich quick story**. "
You gotta wonder what are the odds for unlisted explorers?

Great stuff Eric, well done, Peter is clearly beginning to grok bitcoin and is becoming far more agreeable and less dismissive.

Excellent, thanks.

When dealing with monopolies or private firms yes, but open source is a different kettle of fish.

Excellent. It would also be good to see Khan (and MOOCs such as Harvard/MIT etc) accept bitcoin donations.

Yeah, he clearly doesn't get it, but front page coverage can't be a bad thing.

Yes I've read Hayek, and I already thought about the linux comparison, and as I mentioned in another comment on this thread, I'm not against alts or competition; it's that litecoin brings nothing to the table apart from minor variation. It's like a copy of a Van Gogh, it's not new art.
