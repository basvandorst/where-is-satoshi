You're missing credibility to be taken serious. With increasing prices it was easy to state that the price would rise, with decreasing prices idem, just ride out the cycle and wait for the next one.

Ever thought about the biggest bubble of all? The USD. Just wait until that pops.

the network will adjust the difficulty, same amount of BTC will be mined over time, 12 per block until 2020. this simply means less BTC for China and more for miners in others countries with less powerful hardware. Great!!

If SHA-256 fails to be strong enough it's fairly simple to fork using an increased number of bits that is quantum proof. Quantum computing isn't infinitely fast and far from mature. Sits on the same bench as nuclear fusion.

You shouldn't be dealing with crypto if you can't even secure a password. And, leverage trading will wreck you.

1. Ask a parent to buy some for you, register an account at Kraken or so
2. Do some more research 
3. Buy a hardware wallet e.g. Trezor One
3. Buy bitcoin and transfer to wallet.
Good chance you'll be paying way more in two years time.

If quantum computing ends up posing a threat to bitcoin, bitcoin will probably be the last thing to worry about.
