That's what exzactly bitshares is accomplishing.  Right now they have bitgold bitsilver, bitusd, bitcny, and bitbtc.  It's all decentralized as well unlike bitreserve.

I feel like the easier userability comes, then bitcoin will become a prominent method of exchange.  It has to have increased benefits, and with the improvements in the ecosystem this will happen soon enough.

Didn't lava it work on this premise?  I'm sure someone can use this to create a simple email client.

Oh wow.  HOw can Bitcoin save us from a financial collapse?  Bitcoin is such a small phenomenom in its infancy.  its only a 2 billion market.  any third world country is larger than that.  Any corporation makes more revenue than bitcoin in a year.  Bitcoin still has to grow.  And additionally a financial collapse might make governemnts more privy to banning bitcoins to control the situation.

yeah but that;s through a internet site.  I'm talking about boxed retailers putting up bitcoin wallets behind their cash registers

We're being a little ethnocentric aren't we.  Your ignoring that Bitcoin is a transnational currency that has more brand mobility than Google.  Remember our Chinese friends-- they all use Baidu.  Google is banned in Russia and China.  These countries are the future, and if any other nation sees a single American corporation dominating the currency market, they would just ban their presence and expansion.  Bitcoin is a neutral p2p entity.  Anybody can use its network.  It doesn't care who you are, and what you are doing with it.  Google on the other hand, publicily traded stock-- that has NSA snooping all over its databases.

However, I do see countries, states and cities in future creating their own crytocurrienes.  Bitcoin, or whatever the better free market currency is, would still have network effect for its ability to transcend borders.

with the recent buy of venmo and braintree, this makes perfect sense.  they don't want to ever get into bitcoin and neither does ebay.

Yah bitcoins can be subdivided.....
