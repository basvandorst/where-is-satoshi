Yes I plan on storing offline, Is it easy enough to do so following some instructions online?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:02:01
I'm only investing like $100 for fun, so whatever the cheapest, easiest way to keep it secure is I want to do that

Will a paper wallet work long term, and is it secure enough?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:04:30
Will the site give me adequate instructions and information on the exchange rate and how to store my coins offline?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:35:33
Is there a free way to secure my Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:38:32
Oh ok, excellent!
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:12:46
Ok, ive had to do that before for something else, so no big deal, thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:03:31
Ok, thanks for the advice!

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:09:54
Alright cool, thanks for the information
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:43:42
Is that really secure though, it is just an app, so what makes it better than just keeping bitcoins in the Coinbase storage?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:29:33
Pop as in prices will go down?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:57
Ok, thanks so much!  :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:36:35
Ok thanks, also just another question, I'm a bit hesitant and even tho I'm gonna invest anyways(I'm only investing $50 for a little bit of risk just for fun), is it worth it to invest into Bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:32:36
I don't have a CD nor a reader, possible to use a USB or any other option?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:56:08
I c, I'm putting money into btc and ether because just in case btc blows ether looks stable.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:42:21
Ok, thank you!  
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:32:15
How exactly does it work?  Does it store it on a pc or a USB and is it free?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:44:24
Is there no free long term storage?
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:18:01
I use coinbase because it's easy and the amount of money I have on it is pretty insignificant so I don't mind losing it. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:08:15
Yes, as long as you have the right hardware.
