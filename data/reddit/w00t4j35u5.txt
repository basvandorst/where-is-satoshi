I'm choosing to be bold when everyone is fearful; I'll be fearful when everyone is bold.

This is such a great idea. I was just working on a way to communicate to some of our locals here about the blessing from donating bitcoin with regard to capital gains taxes. Most people don't realize that when you donate bitcoin and the nonprofit converts to USD the nonprofit is not responsible for the capital gains tax and neither is the donor so the donation goes significantly further. Many people in our community have benefitted from the rapid gains in the value of bitcoin (oftentimes because of my conversations with them about it). Kudos to you for leading the way in this endeavor!
I've been communicating this in our community specifically because our church run food bank distribution (over 200 families a month) and preschool to many children at or below poverty line have had some sudden surprises preparing for this winter (specifically a 1BTC ($10,000) repair needed to our boiler system. [Some photos on facebook]( This week long project was completed just before the weather started getting cold but it has put a huge damper on our projects including the fact that we needed to finance a chunk of the project and take away from other needs we have here. This past month we did not have enough food to give to every family that came in because there were so many more people than normal and our funding has been delayed from our contacts in the city to help feed people. Cash flow has become a real issue here and some of our paid staff (myself included) have all withheld our paychecks to make ends meet on these needs and we're still struggling right now. 
1 Bitcoin would make a huge impact in our community that serves the inner city of Pittsburgh. [Donation Link on Church Website](
