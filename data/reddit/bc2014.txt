Libertarian lawyer and media specialist just appointed to BF are like cancerous tits on a boar hog :)
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:43:55
Actually, I like bitcoin and would even own some if the libertarians, anarchists, criminals and Bitcoin Foundation hadn't mucked it up so bad.
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:55:19
Sounds good, translate OP pls.
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:42:55
Yep, my take. Bitcoin problems ~5 years ago.
Wonder where bitcoins is now, really?
*There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.*

@_date: 2014-04-01 05:11:55
I can tell by your erudite comments that you are a wealthy, intelligent man.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:06:47
My sincere compliments to all bitcoin geniuses. You are much smarter than me — but you all suffer from one glaring deficiency — **You all have bitcoin blinders on**. 
Or more politely, if that is possible, you have a treatable condition of focused bitcoin mono-vision, which appears to be impeding your understanding of reality.
@_date: 2014-03-23 06:31:33
Heck, all the Foundation Board could end up in jail, if for no other reason than **Aiding and Abetting.**
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:38:25
But we've had no impossible resurrection from the DEAD :)

You might compare bitcoin survival to someone who’s recovering from a serious illness. At first, everyone hopes the patient will return to normal. Then it’s gradually realized that the patient suffered permanent damage and will never be the same. So, with bitcoin.

You are very perceptive. Former is most reliable :)
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:31:24
Honestly, I hope you are right and that bitcoin will be successful.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:56:01
I'm excited it could be used to stop, or maybe just slow down, current death-spiral.
I'm NOT excited it could be used to fraudulently manipulate price.

A message to all bitcoin owners. You're a bit like the drunk cowboy coming out of the bar and getting onto his horse with his saddle turned backwards. 
You have 2 choices:

Miners are probably doing sweetheart, private deals to dump their 80%-unsold now and not trash bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:23:42
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:51:49
Assuming ~1%/day decline will continue, bitcoin price could drop to $402 about 25 days from now, Apr 18.  
1-402/561=0.28   
1-1.01^25 =0.28 
From the chart in   
breakout would occur at $540.28
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:24:20
But I'm not as sick as bitcoin and many of its evangelists, thanks
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:56:41

Maybe the fix I just posted will get you in
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:00:13
Bitcoin Foundation just put the last nail in its coffin by appointing a libertarian lawyer from the libertarian Cato Institute and a media specialist to fill the two vacancies. Our bitcoin infrastructure is not safe and secure, and the last things bitcoins needs now are a libertarian lawyer and a media specialist — neither can fix, or even help fix, what's wrong. Some politicians and regulators even tag both as rabid dogs.
The only things I see that the Bitcoin Foundation has done with its money is cuddle with Washington and NY politicians and regulators, fight amongst themselves, and feather their own nests. They are like foxes guarding the hen house!
If I were a politician or regulator, cuddling with a libertarian lawyer and media specialist would be like sleeping with the enemy, both with rabies :)
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:36:56
I believe NO Bitcoin Exchanges or Wallets can be trusted, especially to **not 'game' bid/ask** for themselves and their cronies. I hope someone can prove me wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:00:13
Our commentators viscerality is exceeded only by bitcoin community insularity — Just a perfect engine can't win the Indianapolis 500. If you can take off your bitcoin blinders, you'll see the wolves ready to devour your beautiful bitcoin baby.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:28:17
Spot on!
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:33:38
Maybe bitcoin needs the **Bitcoin Bankless Money Foundation**, not the Bitcoin Foundation
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:30:54
Wonder how many libertarians that lost their money at Mt Gox or had their bitcoins stolen would agree with you?
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:52:33
Seems like lawyer made some good points.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:16:45
It will be absolutely necessary to have **broad, bitcoin-community support** before trying to stop, or just slow down, current death-spiral with this technology.

Corollary 3: Bitcoin prices that go up will always come down when downward forces, especially shocks, exceed upward forces. 
Corollary 4: Bitcoin prices will never be sustainable because of downward shocks.

@_date: 2014-03-05 17:39:41
This proposed method of increasing Bitcoin value is a simple application of Newton's laws of motion and calculus to microeconomics. I am not aware of any other instance that brings together these three sciences to potentially increase asset value of a fourth, Bitcoins.

Unbricht's defense will probably not get very far. A “brick and mortar” drug market that accepted sheep in trade could still be held in violation of the law, with the owner’s sheep confiscated and then regarded by the court as **having material value in an illegal transaction** - See more at: 
More specifically, money laundering laws state that a monetary instrument is defined as “coin or currency”, something that Bitcoin supposedly isn't.. However, Ulbricht’s argument gets a little shaky, as a clause states that “investment securities or negotiable instruments” can also be used as monetary instruments.... In other words, **Bitcoin is no more regulated than something like dirt**. And while dirt may have some value to some people, it’s definitely not money – and would a money laundering charge (or any other charge for that matter) stick if that’s all the supposed offender received? That remains to be seen, though whatever the judge decides will have big implications for how law enforcement authorities treat cryptocurrencies in the future.

I fear for my life discovering and unleashing Bitcoin Doomsday Defect, which may be causing bitcoin death-spiral down — so I've gone underground:
@_date: 2014-03-20 08:02:09
Corollary 2: Bitcoin prices are more affected by downward shocks than upward good-news.

Corollary 1: Many forces are required to hold or increase bitcoin prices, but only one force (e.g. power) can decrease prices.

Your points are important. I'm surprised too I haven't heard this. It makes sense.
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:27:35
So true, and maybe this is bitcoin — without self regulation :)
This life, which had been the tomb of his virtue and of his honour, is but a walking shadow; a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
