Sorry for your loss. However, there are a number of ways this whole thing could play out, so do not lose hope yet. In the worst case scenario, they will apply an Mt.GOX approach and you will get a percentage of your funds back.

These could hardly be considered death treats.

It took me around a week to download the full blockchain on my spare "soon-to-be-full-node" Asus Eee PC. I have 50 mbit connection. I installed nothing by Windows and Bitcoin Core. Opening the ports required me to go into the admin menu of my router and "do stuff". This is absolutely not user-friendly. Running a full node should be quick and easy. Not to mention that Bitcoin Core blocked a couple of times or was just "searching for the best chain" for hours. It has been running for two weeks now. My girlfriend thinks I am crazy. Totally agree with your points.
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:20:46
Well, at the very least it requires you to know if your router supports UPnP and if it is enabled/disabled. And if it doesn't or is disabled (could be this way by default)..."do stuff".

Same thing happened to me two weeks ago (9000 USD). I told them that I receive coins from friends who are mining them and they asked me to prove that this is true by asking my friends to sign the transactions (ludicrous!). I sent them a full bank statement + some other information about the source of my funds, and they initiated my transfer.

@_date: 2016-03-19 00:28:35
Depends on how you define "issues". I like to use a computer that is idle most of the time. Moreover, I have been running a node on my Eee PC and when I reach 56 connections, processes get very slow. I would definitely not tolerate such a load even on my gaming PC.

I can provide you with my perspective. Basically, you can create special token (a currency) and use it to reward customers/organize processes. You can create a customer rewards program and provide your customers with [name of your business here] tokens for each purchase. These tokens can be traded on the decentralized exchange that is organized in Counterparty. Thus, thanks to buying from you, your customers can get additional rewards, provided by other entities in the Counterparty ecosystem. For example - your customers exchange the tokens you provide them with for other type of tokens and use them to get better armor in a game which has implemented Counterparty tokens. This is a very simple example, before the smart contracts introduction. The addition of smart contracts will make using Counterparty even more interesting. Numerous applications!

I was just wondering if it is a bit too far fetched. How hard will be to create such a platform? I see from their Indiegogo page that they need €825.000 before doing another crowdfunding campaign in order to raise funds for the creation of the actual platform. That is brave. Right there.

"Boots from Micro SD card, running a version of the Linux operating system or Windows 10 IoT" I am also not sure what exactly that is...
@_date: 2016-03-18 14:59:50
Usually it is good to run a node incessantly. Otherwise, it will need to sync the blocks which were mined during the time the node was offline (which takes time) and will have to reconnect with a good number of peers, which takes even longer. The Raspberry pie will not be appropriate for your described purpose.
@_date: 2016-03-19 15:28:56
Obviously not. My whole point is that running a bitcoin node uses resources and I am unwilling to run one on my gaming PC (my everyday PC).

I am from Bulgaria, where the face of OneCoin - Dr. Ruja Ignatova - comes from. I can confirm it is a proven scam. I know they are converting their money to high street properties in Sofia. They bought the Forbes cover. No one in the local cryptocurrency community takes them seriously, primarily due to their inability to prove that they know anything about cryptocurrency. They started a topic in the local Bitcoin forum BitcoinBG.eu and were simply obliterated by the knowledgeable members there.
A seminar was organized a few weeks ago by Software University (a company), with the title "OneCoin - the revolutionary cryptocurrency". A few hours later, the title was changed to "Open discussion on cryptocurrencies" - they found out it was a scam. 
A few friends and I organize a local Bitcoin/Blockchain meetup and last time there was a person who came and wanted to talk about OneCoin. We told him that we will talk about it after we address other people's questions. When we finished (we talked about the fundamental ideas and technology behind Bitcoin) he was no longer willing to speak about it. He understood that we are not "fertile" ground - we just knew too much.
Anyone really into cryptocurrencies will never fall for OneCoin. However, many who are flirting with this new technology are potential victims.
I am not sure if this gets enough attention: [OneCoin Exposed as Ponzi Scheme](

Well, I sent an official letter to the Embassy after being rejected AFTER signing a pre-contract, which was subject to a medical and SECURITY check. I am the founder of a bitcoin charity "startup" and they told me that since I have a Bitcoin charity, my profile is too risky and withdrew their offer. Pretty nasty, having in mind that what I am trying to do is help NGOs generate additional funding for their charitable causes through bitcoin. They knew I had a charity beforehand. It was in my CV. But I guess at one point it became an issue. That point came AFTER they arranged and held personal meetings with a number of work colleagues, friends and direct managers from my (at the time) current employment (they all provided perfect references about me). What I can do? I am doing it. Spreading the bitcoin gospel and not applying at embassies :)

Everyone else? You mean more than 2000 people per 10 minutes on average? I believe we will not be there soon. Moreover, you can use a wallet that predicts the "your transaction in the next block" fee amount.
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:39:58
Have in mind that a large part of all transactions are not time sensitive, meaning the user is not in a hurry to transfer and does not require having his transaction included in the next block. Adaptive fees provide a choice - fast but a bit more expensive, or slow and cheap. It is a good approach for the time being.

We do!!! Its one huge black spot on our reputation (Bulgaria as a whole)! We also believe that it will become even worse once the OneCoin ship sink, which is inevitable. I, personally, try to to warn people about OneCoin on every suitable occasion. Nonetheless, there are still people falling for it. There we even recent reports about OneCoin in the local media. Dr. Ruza is implementing an exit strategy. [This is the article]( (in Bulgarian). So yes, it is worrying but there is only so much we can do. It is a sect.

Sad, sad, sad. I have a lot of compassion for this guy and I am sure that his words are true. Like him I have never had any contact with the authorities BEFORE I started dealing with bitcoin and even though I have never done anything illegal, I have been a target a number of times. Just a suspicious character, "someone how is doing something". This caused a lot of stress form me and my family. I very much realized what Ross apparently did - you should be careful with providing too much freedom to people, because not everyone is as benign as you are, and not everyone shares your ideals. Most people will simply use you for their own purposes and go to the next idealistic sucker, after you are gone.
Does Ross think it was worth it? I don't think so. Not many things justify a life in a cage. Will he abandon his "martyr" status for his freedom - most definitely. We all have a single life, limited time and families. Rarely there appears a goal that is worth sacrificing all for. Facilitating drug dealers and all kinds of illegal tradesmen is most definitely not one of them, no matter what ideals you believe are behind it. Ross operated an immense and OBVIOUSLY really illegal empire ON U.S. TERRITORY. Could this have ended in any other way?

Thank you for this. I believe I was able to set the max number of connections through the configuration file. I always thought it should be done through the console since the only other option I was able to find was through a bandwidth control program (which did not work at all, and sounded like a really dumb solution). GUI for this would be nice.

Why don't you just keep the BTC and convert on an exchange, once a month? If you are not going to manage large transaction volumes, this is usually the easiest way to start accepting bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:39:23
Well, it is based on my own experience. I have forgotten where I hid the private key password (remembered after much cold sweat) and have engaged in practices where part of the encrypted private key password is at one place, another is somewhere else. In time I got too paranoid that I will protect the coins even from myself. I really feel more comfortable with a good hardware wallet. There are many ways to create excellent offline storage other than paper wallets, but for me they are too cumbersome and not all that noob-friendly.

Anything happening in China will affect bitcoin, BUT bitcoin will be fine in the end, even without Chinese miners or users. Price will probably be lower, the hashrate as well, but the network will continue to function properly. China needs bitcoin, not the other way around. Also:

We believe that bitcoin is simply perfect for charity crowdfunding on international scale.

If anyone has any ideas - please share them.
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:53:57
I do not think so. The Wiki Foundation must have an account at Coinbase. An account that is connected to certain BTC address(es). This bitcoin address is the final recipient and serves as an identifier that specific donation was for this specific company/NGO/person. Can anyone with a Coinbase account approve or disapprove this claim? I know blockchain.info works in that way.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:23:52
Yeah, didn't see that. Sorry. HOWEVER, I get reports that miners are being asked to join the Segwit2x movement. Reports from minutes ago.
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:54:28
Yes, this may be (and actually is) but nonetheless, they must have a specific bitcoin address at Coinbase that receives the funds. What happens if someone donates directly to that? That "final" address can be learned after a donation is sent in the "usual" way. The intermediate address receives the bitcoins and immediately redirects them to the "final" address. If you know the intermediate address, all you need to do is follow the bitcoins.

You will need to do it periodically. The blockchain changes roughly every 10 minutes. Moreover, there is no point in doing it. There are thousands of copies already and hopefully in the future - there will be much more.

I stand corrected. I guess superluminal is our best chance.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:20:06
 - this is a blockchain explorer for Bitcoin. If you have a Bitcoin address you can paste it here and see its balance and transaction history. Different stats mean different things - you should research how Bitcoin works and they will all make sense.
 - this is just a website showing market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. There is **no relation** between a coin being displayed there and legitimacy. I think OneCoin was there for a while, not sure.
For the questions - the top comment here makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2016-09-03 14:00:46
I am always interested to know what people mean by decentralized crowdfunding platforms. I believe the sources of funding could be decentralized, but if you want to have any assurance that the generated funds have been spent as intended - there must be a centralized element.

@_date: 2016-09-03 20:37:22
How exactly? The funds will go to the recipient, but how can you be sure that he spends them in the right way? Maybe when cryptocurrencies are much more widespread and everyone is using them, that will be possible. But for now no matter what rules you devise in digital form, the spending of the funds ultimately rests with the recipient. If there is no one there to look over him, they might not be properly used.

Hey, great comment. We will definitely think about how this can be organized in practice. We need "people on the ground" who can turn the bitcoins into a tangible support. Thus, we work with established non-profits, who can provide us with a high degree of certainty (formal documents) that the bits will be spent in accordance with campaign goal. Also, for the US there is BitGive which are in a much better position to organize such a campaign. Thanks for the comment, though. We are trying to expand our non-profit network so that more organizations can start familiarizing themselves with bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-25 09:09:26
Ok, I have a question. A number of people have come to me with requests to help them get bitcoin so that they can pay extortionists who have encrypted their business information. The last case was from a few days ago. The extortionist wanted 3 bitcoins for the decryption key and we sent them to him (he actually sent the key after that). 
Here is the transaction: 
The coins are just sitting there for now. What can I do in order to track this person, if we assume that he is not perfectly careful? I know that these extortion practices with bitcoin are quite widespread and really hate it that people learn about bitcoin only when someone extorts them. That goes directly against my "bitcoin preaching" work. :)
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:00:32
I am really disappointed with their services these last couple of days. The website is up and down all the time and my deposits take ages. I currently have 12 confirmations on a deposit and it is still not visible in my account. Kraken is obviously not ready for large volumes. **Update**: I got it on the 12th confirmation

Another question - "give addresses derived from it to users", you mean that each user that enters the raffle must receive an unique BTC address?

520, 522, 525. I turned the I'm under attack setting in CF just now. The attack stopped according to the hosting company. The server should be online, but it is not loading (no ping).  Error 522. I changed the IP before turning the I'm under attack mode. The failover IP was immediately attacked.

@_date: 2016-05-10 19:58:59
Well I guess they will let you guys know that I haven't. The idea is for them to be able to prove to anyone through the blockchain that they were the winners. The whole purpose of this "lottery" is for me to be able to prove to anyone that the winner was not predetermined. I have no intention to cheat, but I guess the point is for me not to be able to do it without losing credibility.

@_date: 2016-05-06 10:22:36
Hey, thank you for the suggestion. Actually, just turning the "I am under attack mode" was sufficient. What led me to the conclusion that they know my real IP was the fact that I was attacked even being under CloudFlare. However, thanks to --__--____--__-- I decided to turn "I am under attack mode" anyway. It turned out that the attack was so small that CloudFlare did not detect it and continued forwarding traffic to the host. All is fine now. Usterday I turned "I am under attack" for a few hours and the attack started again. So I am sticking to this mode for a while, since the website is loading perfectly fine (after 5 sec of CloudFlare check).
@_date: 2015-11-25 11:52:28
Yes, I understand that. However, how do I know if the wallet they move to is an exchange one? Where can I find this information?
@_date: 2016-05-15 14:12:17
The problem that they are running this system extremely inefficiently (on purpose). I believe that once bitcoin transactions volume reaches the one of legacy payment processors, the cost will still be much lower, with the added benefit of much better decentralization.
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:28:48
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:18:32
Yes, that is what I did :) The site is loading fine after the 5 sec check by CloudFlare. They do not know my real IP and their attack is so small that CloudFlare thought that it is just regular traffic and did not filter it before I entered I am under attack mode.
@_date: 2016-05-14 23:03:24
But 20 times less people will be using it :)
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:38:27
They have been doing this for a long time now (years). This is not new.

I was betting on that so that they can provide me with the code :) I need this for my specific purpose but I do not want to sell it, or provide it as a service :) I will give the code to anyone who needs it once I have it.

I have encountered this as well. I just make sure that I have the generated password until I check if it was saved correctly. Nonetheless, I have been using it for around a year now and it is great. I like that there is 2-FA in addition to a password and that I can write and save notes in it.

Bitcoin is amazing, right? :D
@_date: 2016-05-10 17:46:25
The idea is that you donate the bitcoins and in exchange, enter a competition to win a hardware wallet. So you know you are "losing" the money.

@_date: 2016-05-10 17:41:31
Ok, so let's not call it a lottery. It is a randomization mechanism that selects a value from a set of values, but the outcome must be provable.
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:50:29
Well, if the script selects the winners ONLY from the BTC addresses that have send transactions, couldn't that be overcome? I mean, the winning address should be one of those that have entered the lottery by sending BTC. In other words - it will be an address that is visible by exploring the lottery BTC address.
@_date: 2016-05-12 08:48:59
Nice. I found a coder who can help me with this. If I successfully create it - I will let you know.
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:57:56
It will just help us locate the donations more easily and match them. It is not mandatory. We were hoping to see something like this: 
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:09:45
I agree with you completely. There must be some level of trust established between the donor and the project. There should be someone that is making sure the recipient of the donations uses them for the kind of purpose he has stated in the campaign. This is a form of centralization, yes, but I have not really found a way around it (ex. even the DAO experiment is in a way centralized by the existence of the "Curators"). 
Moreover, if the recipient is a person, then things get even more complicated. Can you imagine a person on the other side of the world, announcing a project? The only way that he can guarantee that the money were spent accordingly is to first use his own money for the purchase and after providing evidence of it, for the system to reimburse him the funds (but who will brave enough to donate anyway?). Having in mind that he can always provide counterfeits, proof should be third-party verifiable. 
All this can get really complicated if including a number of parties and requiring for all the "if"s to be coded. I guess that is the purpose of all these smart contracts. 
I am sure that at one point it will all be done (when and if access to these Blockchain 2.0 or 3.0 platforms becomes more widespread), but currently - it is much too early. Lighthouse was too ahead of its time.
@_date: 2016-05-17 16:24:50
Hey, I think it is essential to have a local bank account (as in one for each country, if there are users there, of course). For example, many employers are not willing to do SEPA transfers, which still cost a lot - 20 EUR here in Bulgaria. If it is possible tell my employer to send money to a bank account that is in-country, he will be much more willing to do it.

@_date: 2016-05-10 14:37:46
Can we add the part about the automatic sending with message (informing the winner) + the random selection of the recipient of the generated funds? I am actually not a developer and was hoping that there is some available code that could fit my purpose with some customization. I mean, there are so many such bitcoin-based lotteries.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:33:36

Nice! Does it take the current price automatically? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:57:10
Yes, but the next one must try even harder. So hard, that Satoshi himself might not be able to convince us :) Look at this: 
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:58:09
If I move the CloudFlare settings to "Under attack", the attack starts. When I turn it on - it stops. How? I believe that they do not know my real IP address.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:00:58
Yes, this is exactly what I intend to do. I was just wondering how they found out our original IP, since we are behind CloudFlare (although free).
@_date: 2016-05-13 16:28:36
What goal exactly do you want to set? Do you have a "Thank you page" after the donation is completed? Provide more information, so that we can help you more effectively.

@_date: 2016-05-15 20:17:59
Hey nice video. The issue with your proposal is primarily related to two things: 1. 10 BTC is quite a lot of money; 2. How can we be sure that you will spend them on the video? I might be able to help you with the campaign if you are willing to provide third party-verifiable receipts for the services your are purchasing (so first pay with your own money), in the event of a successful fundarasing campaign. However, as I said 10 BTC is quite a sum and I am not sure if the Community will be engaged enough. You can contact me at vlad
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:00:30
Yes, if you put these sensors in places where weather data is scarce, you might start making real money. I think the 21PC provides a ton of opportunities, which will slowly start being realized.
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:16:06
He looks scared.
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:22:56
Hmm, maybe, but I doubt it. If you can find the info for free, you will not pay for it. There is no problem of "reselling" anything on the 21 Marketplace as long as there is a market for it. However, it makes more sense to generate something unique in order to stay competitive. At this point, it makes no sense to fake it. Also, there is a reputation system in place already.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:07:21
Absolutely. Check the 21 Marketplace, there are some very interesting services there. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety and usefulness.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:30:31
Maybe, but it depends how you value your service. You can put any price for a call. 5 satoshis is just too little, but then the service is not really unique. Moreover, I think in the future you will not have to decide. It will be decided by algorithms (let's say AI) which will be free to make their own decisions whether to you or not use (and pay for) a service. Also, I am not sure how viable micropayments have been before the appearance of bitcoin. A lot of technologies "have been in development for the last 30 years" - VR, AR, AI. I think that only now we might have a real chance at them due to exponential technological advancement.
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:58:35
Absolutely. I did it just to learn. As I mentioned - I am selling both services for 5 satoshis per call. I think this will be huge in around 10 years.
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:38:01
Absolutely. There is a myriad of possibilities. You just need to find a niche and start serving it with data.
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:38:50
Why on earth would you use an exchange Bitcoin address for donations for your torrent website? Sounds like Mr. Vaulin got too comfortable with this operation.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:10:06
Maybe. It is about the setup, required to start selling data. But you are quite correct - the data/service is the interesting part. If you can come up something usable, the 21 Marketplace will let you sell it automatically (like a bitcoin-paid API call).
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:12:46
Interesting. If you need some assistance - contact me. BitHope.org is a mission, it does not generate any profit :)

Thanks! I cannot say exactly. There is a command "21 log" that displays all your "sells" but I am not 100% it is working correctly. Moreover, I just find out that the ping21 server has not been running for a while due to a technical issue. I did all as an experiment and because I am interested in 21 Inc.'s vision. You will not generate meaningful sums through this. I am selling both services for 5 satoshis per call (so basically nothing). However, if you come up with an interesting application, you can publish it and that might provide you with better income. Check 21 Inc.'s Marketplace to see what apps are bitcoin-payable.

I see it as an experiment :) Everyone will perceive it in a different way. Yours is not shockingly original :D

Trezor are amazing! They are true believers and supporters of the Bitcoin idea. Huge fan here (obviously).

If it is "website.com/thank-you-page.html?433frwdg4gebg5hge", in Analytics you should only put (begins with) "/thank-you-page.html" and it will work. Send me two sample links.

Thanks for clarifying. I really want to understand how this really works, but looking the white paper...I am not a developer. I am sure many people feel the same way.

Thank you :)
1. No sure. I think it might be quite long. You can ask the guys from 21 on Slack it.
2. They do. There are currently only 8 weather-sensor data points in the Sensor21 marketplace, so I think that people purchase the information during the 21PC set up process. I do not think that anyone is currently making real use of it.
3. Micropayments - the 21 Bitcoin PC software is divided into internal and external balances. One is in the 21 buffer, the other on the actual Bitcoin blockchain. When paying for services, or receiving payments for provided data only the buffer is used. I think there was a minimum amount that can be sent, but it was quite small. I am selling a ping request for 5 satoshis, so why go lower than that?

Grabo.bg has accepted Bitcoins for months now, for which I salute them! There is also a local Bulgarian Bitcoin exchange: **bitcoini.com** ([bitcoini.com]( so yes, you can say that Bitcoin is a big deal here :)

We were planning to announce a first-time Bulgarian Bitcoin community meet-up via a post in the Bulgarian Bitcoin forum, so we are very much in favor of such an initiative.
