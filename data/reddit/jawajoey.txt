Because in a free economy, people with power/wealth only have it when it is freely given, and by spending it without acquiring more, will lose it. As they say, a fool and his money are soon parted. That's where accountability comes from in a free market. No matter how rich someone is, they can't stay in business if they try to charge $100 for a cup of lemonade. But an elected official can tax everyone in the land $100 and not face any consequences until election day. 
Obviously, the key bit there is the freedom of the market. If you own all the insulin in the world and charge $1000 per shot to diabetics, they aren't really "free" to say "fuck off."

I'm actually surprised there isn't *more* bitcoin circlejerking going on here. At least in the comments for this post, the supporters seem to be way outnumbered by the detractors (who like to complain about how the majority of other people are crazy, ironically).

That's a feature, not a bug.
If Mt.Gox had been the official regulatory body of Bitcoin, then Bitcoin *would* be destroyed by now. By not having a centralized authority like that, better places like Coinbase can exist and thrive. We are blessed to not have an authority who can "bail out" Mt.Gox by appropriating other people's Bitcoins.
What we're witnessing is *better* than the government-run alternative would be.

Are there seriously people who put their life savings into Bitcoin? Because it feels like that's what you're saying. 
How many people could there be who have more than (let's say) 15% of their net worth in bitcoin, AND did so without much research or contemplation, AND took no serious steps to protect their investment?
Either there are LOT more of those people than I ever imagined, or you spent 3 paragraphs lamenting the misfortune of a handful of stupid people.
