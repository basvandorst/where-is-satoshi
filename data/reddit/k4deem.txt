Bitcoin will decline when governments start to ban it and the expectations it hits the market are declined. Method of acquisition also isn't secure. And once scammers move to abusing cryptocurrency newbies it'll become an issue as well. It will not stabilize and will eventually plummet which is why it's a scam. There's never a good time to get into bitcoin because at any point it could plummet.

Lol you really called me a noob. It's an asset that will decline eventually after being over valued and a majority of the population won't get into it until it's at it peak. It's an investing bias that happens all the time. Sure if you bought bit coin in 2000s you're licking your chops now. I personally don't see the long term investment being worth it, and I'm not sure how decentralized current will work going forward. I was wrong to say banned, but increased regulations in addition to increased government regulation is still bad. I just think investing in mutual funds is a much better option. If you're going to truly make money off of bitcoin now you'd probably need a lot of capital, which at that point you should go into the actual market. If you're not rich why invest and get a small amount of bitcoin. There's simply too much risk involved with the product. It's like someone bragging the made a shit ton by investing in radio shack in the 90s and then somebody going and purchasing that investment in 2015

Except governments are now starting to act. There was a proposed ETF this year. Denied. China just banned bit coin. You're telling me Russia, china, the eu, and Donnie don't all dislike cryptocurrency. All it takes is one person and China already got the ball moving
