Come on dog you skipped some crucial steps with your opsec and now you are paying the piper. DNM wallet addresses are known. They know what you are using that coin for. I'd be distancing myself before papa Fed finds out not try to find a workaround.

The problem with the last bull run is that it was built on speculation and not utility. The problem with your hypothetical bull run is that it too would be triggered by speculation and not utility. 
If the goal is to pump the price to maximize returns then you are simply trading and not a crypto enthusiast. The developments in this space are just as cool at 3k as they are at 30k.
