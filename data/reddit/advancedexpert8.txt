So you want to drive your car filled with food/ammo/supplies across the apocalyptic wasteland (Block size). Your car goes slower if you carry more weight so you decide in order out drive the raiders trying to kill you (entities who want to attack Bitcoin) you fill your car with less stuff. Now the raiders can't catch you (say the raiders are an entity which wants to attack Bitcoin). Now if you take a U-Haul (Larger Block) and fill it with everything at the same time, the raiders catch you and kill you.
Lol I made this up off the top of my head but it demonstrates that if you have smaller blocks with more trips it makes you a harder target to attack. The U-Haul with everything packed in it can be attacked easily because it is slow and is not as nimble (Nimble referring to many nodes spread out across the network).
Hope this gives you some idea, I'm sure this needs polishing.

Market can't get hacked, its a ledger on the blockchain which everyone can view and agree upon. It can crash, Oil and gold can crash also. Bitcoin is valuable because it is the following:
1) Limited - Rare and only gets rarer
2) It transfers and holds store of value across the world without permission, no borders, or time to restrict you. A gold bar can't be sent across the world in a short amount of time
3) Gold and Oil do not support dollars, this statement is odd. Dollars are given value by the U.S. Government who have given permission to the Federal Reserve to keep printing money which devalues it. Bitcoin does not lose value over time because it is deflationary by nature with 21 million coins ever going to be in existence.
These are short answers and is very basic Bitcoin knowledge as to what Bitcoin was create for and what gives it value. There are tons of other reasons.
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:26:42

Bitcoin is top ranked because of its security. This is the most important part of the system, its designed so that users do not have to trust each other.

In terms of security no. Bitcoin is valuable because the network has proved that it can take a beating and keep going. Altcoins don't have the robustness to take on serious attacks.

People and companies do accept BTC as a currency. Newegg being an example. Moving money between fiats is only under control if people use banks. People do buy crypto from others with cash. Blocking transactions with exchanges does not hinder its ability as a currency completely.

The banking cartel will be throttling the price through pump and dumps because Bitcoin is currently unregulated. Just Hodling and not worrying prevents any leverage over you. The only thing they can control are bank accounts which let you spend cash through Bitcoin exchanges. Do not worry, these things are good for Bitcoin because if the banks try to hurt it, you know Bitcoin is working as intended.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:28:13
BCH was developed in order to take over Bitcoin's place. The developers wanted to steal Bitcoin's name and technology and pass it off as the real thing. Currently it is being price manipulated and many people have already lost money do to it pumping and dumping. Went from 800, to 1000 to 2000 back down to now 1000.
BCH has an ugly history and its developers should not be trusted.

Honestly I believe that to use Bitcoin you have to be a little smarter than the average population. With that being said, people that read r/btc should get an idea from the start that it is very negative, which should be an automatic 'this place shouldn't be trusted'. But hey that's why it was created, for shills.

I'm not gonna click on your clearly shilled video. But if you are serious about Bitcoin throw $20 into it. What do you have to lose?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:10:19
A pump and dump is a scam in order to get people to buy it.
So lets say I wanted to scam you in a pump and dump. I have 1000 shares of A and its value is $1 a share. I buy 10,000 shares in order to have 11,000 which causes the share price to go to $2 a share. Now people see the stock 'OH MY GOD ITS RISING BUY IT NOW SO WE CAN GET IN FAST AND MAKE MONEY!'
People buy in at $2. I then decide that I have doubled my money and sell all my shares at $2. The price takes a dive because there aren't enough buyers buying at $2 but instead offer $0.50 per share. The people that bought in 'on the pump' are stuck with $2 shares that are now worth $0.50. They lost money. I made money. Hence 'pump' up the market then 'dump' to profit after others bought in.
There was a case where rapper 50 cent bought a ton of vitamin water shares and then went on facebook and twitter and told everyone one of his followers to buy it, thus increasing the price. He then sold off his shares and made alot of money and left his followers holding the bags.

In approximately mid 2020 there will be a block reward halvening. The current block reward is 12.5 Bitcoins per block. Next will be 6.25 per block. Less Bitcoins means miners must sell at higher prices to cover the costs of electricity and mining fees. Less Bitcoin in the ecosystem also contribute to the basic economic theory when supply is lower, demand goes higher. Higher demand with lower volume correlates to higher prices.

Bitcoin doesn't care about gold. Gold is only as valuable as someone is willing to pay for it, same as Bitcoin. Gold does not have a limit however, compared to Bitcoin which is 21 million coins. If more gold is mined from the Earth which it is on a daily basis the gold supply goes up causing the value to go down. Gold holds its value only because it has a long history. Bitcoin is now a new asset class which is extremely rare. Anyways, I'm rambling, don't know where this post is going but Bitcoin is now more valuable than gold because it makes transferring wealth a whole lot easier in today's world.

*Major Risks:* Your wallet is unsecured and you get hacked, Bitcoin is found to have a fatal flaw (unlikely) and dies as a result, Voltality can erase your holding value. Many others but the point being is people will lose money.
*Have you had any financial gain/loss from Bitcoin?*
Yes, but that information is gonna stay private, hopefully you understand.
*Must you be qualified (Business degree etc.) to be a successful investor?*
No, its the same as religion, if you believe that it will succeed, come true, and has a bright future, you do not need to fear it when investing. Personally I believe it has a bright future ahead of it, don't need to be a financial expert to see that.
*What kinds of investors does Bitcoin attract?* Used to be just hobbyists but now everyone including big banks are trying to get in on the action.

Physical transaction of just handing cash over. In 2013 I bought some from a guy on localbitcoins. Handed him some cash at starbucks then he sent it over to my wallet. Nice enough to hang around and wait for the transaction to go through.
But to answer your question, the wallets are digital. You will need confirmation that they went through on your end if you deal in cash. This is the best way if you want something done anonymously. Or just buy Bitcoin off a regular exchange then send it to a new address you generate. No one can prove the new address you send to is actually yours.

Any address can be generated anonymously. For example if you made an address using say blockchain.info, you don't have to enter any personal information on it. Same with generating a paper wallet. For buying purely anonymously the only real way would to be localbitcoins and do a face to face transfer for cash using burner phone.
Edit*: But you can also send the coin to another address which would be difficult to prove it belonged to you.

Coinbase is good for starting people as its very simple to use. But recently they haven't been supportive of the community as a whole. If you are serious about Bitcoin, move them to a Trezor or Nano or somewhere you can control the keys.

Crashing to 0 would be quite difficult, the only way I would see that if governments around the world banned Bitcoin simultaneously, and there would have to be a huge exploitable bug in the code.

Its value comes from the ledger, a transparent list of all transactions. Also, that it is deflationary, only 21 million coins will be made ever. Things get more valuable if they are rarer. Bitcoin is secured by cryptography aka math. It cannot be hacked, copied, or forged. The consensus that everyone agrees means no one entity can control it. There is nothing like it currently in the world, this is a new technology that is going to stay around.

Let me tell you a story. During the time when Bitcoin was $600 each I was selling 0.01 on eBay. The amount of chargebacks I received was massive. Many hackers getting access to the accounts and buying them then doing the chargebacks. I even had one guy buy it then before I sent it he already did the chargeback lol. Made fun of him for it and he started swearing at me in spanish.
The point being is never do transactions for bitcoin through paypal. I've lost $500 to this. Hopefully you didn't lose as much.

When you buy from say Coinbase they charge a fee for service like if you bought 100$ worth of coin they add on a 5$ charge for using their service. 
Other fees include the miner fee when you send Bitcoin to another address. This miner fee gives miners incentive to have your transaction mined on the blockchain and registered to the ledger.
Hope that clears a few things up.

Don't bother mining Bitcoin, you can mine other cryptos instead and then trade them for cash/Bitcoin. Mining is hard but its probably easier to go get an actual job to invest and buy Cryptos. The amount you make is gonna be very little. You could go outside and collect cans and bottles and probably make x10 more than you would in 2 hours than a whole week of mining cryptos. Just an opinion.

One reason personally is that if I needed the liquid cash quickly for an emergency it was ready to be sold on Coinbase rather than transfer it from somewhere else. This does have its advantages but I have now moved onto a Trezor which was quite scary at first but turned into something I should have done a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:03:57
The outcome is simple: Whatever Coinbase decides will be your fate. If you don't want Coinbase making choices for you, move your coins to a hardware wallet such as Trezor (Trezor is great), a nano ledger, or an app like Electrum where you control the keys.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:21:35

Well I was a Bitcoin noob back then so being dumb I thought it was a great way to make some extra cash.

There are people out there who have lost way way more and that makes me feel better.

Basically if you hold your bitcoin in a blockchain wallet, they will determine to follow the 2X or not. Basically there are going to be 2 groups who will go different paths when the 'hardfork' becomes active. One group goes 2X, the other group goes with Core. Most likely Core will be the majority of users as 2X is not stable. Since you do not control your 'private key', blockchain does instead. Whatever they decide you will follow as you do not have a choice. My suggestion is either 
A) If you are serious about bitcoin get a paper wallet, Trezor or Nano Ledger so you can control your own coin.
B) If not so serious let the exchange hold it for you.

Not a bad thing answering questions personally, it makes people feel better that they have been heard. This will get them involved more in the community.
Similiar to if you go to a restaurant and ask the server about  an item, they can 1) Describe it in detail or 2) Point at the description in the menu. Don't underestimate the significance of taking just a few seconds of time to answer a question. It makes all the difference.

The idea is that you just buy on the dip, do not sell. I've been in the game since 2012, myself and others have always seen the new people get slaughtered on the dip because they get scared, panic, then sell only to regret it later. Just be patient and hodl. Best medicine is stop looking at the price, go outside on a nice long walk instead.

Nothing wrong, it is just safer to upgrade to a hardware wallet like Trezor or ledger if you are getting serious about Bitcoin. Having full control of your coins is worlds apart in differences. I personally have a Trezor, super easy to use and very secure, pretty unbreakable security wise I would say. Its design is pretty clever.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:49:09
Think of the fork as one group going one direction and the other in a different direction.
Coinbase holds your bitcoin for you which does not give you control over the keys.
If Coinbase decides to do something with your coins you do not have much say in it unless you transfer it to a wallet where you control the keys.
Coinbase recently came out and said it will support the bigger chain which S2X (which is the bad chain) is going to be the smaller chain.
Segwit2X is almost dead, its lead developer has now abandoned it.
When you get your hardware wallet, transfer your coins asap.
Hope this clears some things up.

Not really a dick move when you clearly haven't done your research on the subject. You can't make mining on a GPU profitable. You will end up losing money.

If you are 'serious' about Bitcoin get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. For an electronic wallet everyone suggests Electrum. Having control of your keys is the more important thing. 
is correct when you only are promised an I.O.U. for the coins when you don't actually have them.

Bitcoin isn't tied to one nation as it is global and controlled by the users. Comparing it to a standard economical model doesn't work because of its unique nature. 
There are no controls over it therefore it is easy to manipulate unlike stocks, and economic/political policies.
Price is based upon the users and entities who hold large amounts of Bitcoin who can manipulate the markets.

If you believe in the project then you have nothing to fear.
Decentralized, Borderless, Trustless, Almost instantaneous, Cheap transferring, 24/7 operational, permissionless, censorship resistant, transparent money.
This is the first time in human history that a currency is not controlled by a central authority but rather by the people. Secured by math and almost as invulnerable as the internet. The idea itself is groundbreaking, its not going away. It needs time to catch up. Its still new in the infant stage and has growing pains.
Its new and different. But it is a crazy idea that has massive potential.

Nothing is wrong. Coinbase works just fine. If its politics that bother you Coinbase doesn't support Bitcoin fully. But from a practical user side if you want to buy Bitcoin their fees are higher but you can easily buy and sell from their site. They also have a vault which can hold for longterm but that's a personal decision.
tldr; Coinbase works as intended and is fine as an online exchange.

"if" market cap is so and so. You do know prices would skyrocket if some entity was trying to buy all BTC currently available. Also you assume banks are all on the same side. They are in for themselves. Don't think that they play friendly with each other its all competition.
