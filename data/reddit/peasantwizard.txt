Condolences. To be clear:
"...connected my ledger with my BTC into trying to split those coins with BTCPrivate and BTC Diamond into. That didn't seem to work."
You were trying to claim forks with private keys that, at the time, contained BTC?
As in, you didn't send the BTC to a fresh address first, and go about your fork attempts with an empty address?
Trying to determine vector and create educational opportunity.

Dang dude. Incredibly painful lesson on risk profiling. 
Take care of yourself. Money isn't everything. It's never to late to start over. 
This is not specifically directed at you. I'm sure you know this now but for others:
* Never have more BTC on a mnemonic than you are willing to lose. Nothing wrong with having a dozen wallets, hardware and otherwise. Seriously.
* Never claim forks with an address that contains BTC. The snapshot is all that matters. 
* Do not discount the idea that forks and software are created specifically for stealing peoples BTC. This is unfortunately very common.

So the stolen BTC wasn't really even eligible for forks?
Very sorry this happened to you and best of luck with recovery.

Woah! Thanks for the link I'll check it out

In this case I've done quite a bit of extra work (because it's a project im passionate about) and the client is happy to accommodate my experiment :)
For better or worse I have a habit of putting in extra time so I think this trend will continue.
Thanks for the links!

Thanks for the link!
Your description of how it works was much more illuminating than their Web 3.0 site...

Regardless I feel like 'Alert' is an exaggeration, and given peoples current fervor, not helpful. 
And to be quite honest, I think the LTB discussion is probably better off without the Reddit userbase right now.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:56:59
FUD. Discussion does not equal alert.

Cool idea

 narrative is a bit rough but it's hard to ignore what appears to be pretty shady activity. 
I've been suspicious of Bitfinex since before  and USDT was around so I am ready to believe they up to something big.

I say buy! 
'A bit over 800 dollars' isn't much - so I'm guessing your debt isn't much either. 
Bitcoin is one of the greatest things I've ever explored, and while you don't need to own any to enjoy it, I definitely have never regretted buying even though I'm currently at a loss.

Im not having any problems

My only prior knowledge of you is from the LTB debate where you encouraged listeners to look you up on social media, which I did, and now your kind of disappointing me.
This whole things kind of disappointing. Get it together or don't do it at all
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:52:25
Awesome! Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:04:50
FWIW: I heard about this through the LTB debate (which I thought was excellent, and actually listened to twice) but by then it was too late to vote - and now I must admit feel less inclined to become a member. 
Look forward to following the new developments though!
