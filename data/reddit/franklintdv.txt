I know it's a Bot, my posting was just to alert people that they might be misled by the low volume traded in that new currency. It is not just copying a blockchain that will generate billions of dollars in cash, all care is little.

If you need people to stop being stupid and do stupid things like download anything or leave your bitcoins on exchanges I have some news to give you. This is never going to happen.


The media only serves to say when to buy and sell, if they say that bitcoin is the future sale because the price is high, if they speak that died buy. Anything other than this I do not even pay attention.


If they are so incompetent so it is not better that they forget the bitcoin and create their own currency full of problems?


Again, if you need people to stop being stupid.


If they sell one to buy the other there will be a transfer of value, then one goes down and the other goes up, you having the two makes no difference at all.
