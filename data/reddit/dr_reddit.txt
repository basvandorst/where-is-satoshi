Bits can still be the default option but he refuses to give advanced users the option to switch to different units. Keeps the app from being perfect.

Genuinely curious, what features does Bread Wallet have that other wallets don't? I haven't used it ever for a transaction but I downloaded it and it seems very simple feature wise. Definitely not as feature rich as Mycelium on Android.

You have no ownership of the term "Bitcoin Black Friday" and neither does the other site. Neither one of you are the "official" representatives, in fact nobody is.
If there's any confusion it's because you are trying to monopolize a term which is not easily monopolized and then you're complaining that someone else is trying to do the same.

I think for the majority of people the biggest pro for using a credit card vs using bitcoin is that a credit card allows them to use money they don't have to make a purchase. There's a lot of us who pay our balance off completely every month but that's not the typical usage scenario.

Great setup! Instead of diverting any generated excess to a mining setup wouldn't you make more money just feeding it into the grid and being paid for it by your electric company?

But unless the money is held in escrow for 90 days or longer, the credit card chargeback feature still wins. Many times problems that require a chargeback arise after you've already physically received the item.

Why does this require iOS 7.1?

It's silly that someone is labeled a "troll" and then any arguments they make, no matter how valid, are systematically dismissed in this subreddit.
Sad how as much as people champion change and open discussion in the Bitcoin movement, the groupthink still wins in @_date: 2014-09-27 01:30:41
There are times when a product for whatever reason is deemed defective days or weeks after delivery. If escrow is released upon delivery, the customer's only recourse is hoping that the merchant or manufacturer are willing to remedy the situation. 
The reality is that the threat of a chargeback significantly motivates businesses to provide better after-sale support to their customers.

There are hard costs involved with operating a BTM. Compliance, rent, tax/general accounting, internet connectivity, the operator's own time and also the initial cost of the machine itself (generally $8,000+) just to name a few off the top of my head.
I don't see how 1-2% can cover that unless you expect the operator to personally subsidize the cost out of his own pocket.
If the operator is really making a huge killing then someone else will come along and undercut them eventually but I think people are quick to forget or just never realize that there is significant overhead and operators need to be making money if we want to see more BTMs popping up everywhere.
Operators being profitable is the best thing for increased BTM availability and general adoption.

Getting the cash from the Bitcoin machine back to Coinbase would be the pain point in this setup as it would require depositing large amounts of cash into a bank account and then sending it to Coinbase via an ACH transfer. Banks will only let a company deposit so much cash per month into an account before they deem the account holder too high of a risk for them (with regards to money laundering and fraud) and shut down their account and ban all signers on the account for life.

Do you need to only know 12 of the 24 words to perform a successful recovery?
@_date: 2015-01-29 07:01:08
That's not the problem. The problem is moving large amounts of cash through a bank without being a MSB. Credit unions also don't allow a business to start moving large quantities of cash without being a MSB.

What all these "best time to buy" posts lack in credibility they more than make up in blind enthusiasm.
You have no basis for your argument that this is the lowest price we will see. The truth is that nobody knows and anyone investing should know they could lose their entire investment. I remember reading in this subreddit that $800/BTC was the last time it was going to be below $1000/coin and it was the very best time to buy. 
Feel free to state your support for Bitcoin but please be responsible and truthful when making financial recommendations to others.

I would use this app because it's great but the deal breaker is how the you are not able to choose your unit of choice. I would much rather use bitcoins versus bits. I'm fine with making bits the default but at least give users who prefer something else the ability to switch the units in the settings.

The Coindesk ATM map is terribly outdated. Use [CoinATMradar]( instead. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 01:54:22
More likely than not. But this subreddit finds the idea absolutely repulsive, hence the downvotes.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:44:17


That's how.

This is the right answer.
