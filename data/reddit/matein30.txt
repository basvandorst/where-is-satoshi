If transactions are not going to be in the blockchain then long time minting is not really necesssary. It is only a distribution problem. I think if another fair distribution method can be found so that we could just premint everything and fairly distribute it. Write all the book at once. This will also eliminate money control changing hard forks fear. After all this would be like real digital (quantum) gold which is all mined. Value of the coins would depend on how much coin is minted and how fairly distributed. 
What am i missing other than fair distribition method?

Yes, but hack of an exchange doesn't make fees astronomiccally for a period of time and exchanges aren't seen as saver scaling solution as bitcoin banks.
Edit: On exchange you buy and get out, to minimize the risk. But you have to keep those channels open.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:00:57
I started from 4.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:00:16
What is there to explain? Somebody can steal private keys of the hub. It is the same as any exchange hack ever happened.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:57:32
Security of LN depends on the ability to close channel whenever you want. If hacker try to steal your funds from the channel the only thing you can do is to publish your last state transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:25:47
So for newcomers BTC is pre-mined too. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:04:39
Do you understand that attacker has the ability to post previous states of channels where he has more coins than last state. Only defence is to publish last state.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:20:55
Hacker might short bitcoin, then try to steal every bitcoin on every open channel. People on the other side of the channel will also rush to close every channel. But only a little percent of them will be able to do so because of limited block space and astronomic fees for a short period of time. This might trigger loss of trust to LN and even not stolen LN channels might want to close. LN is only secure if you can close channel whenever you want. I think if LN gets adopted and if Hubs emerge and if some black-swan event like above happen then this will be the worst situation that bitcoin have ever faced.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:47:27
Central hubs can be hacked. It could be insider job. Bitcoin is decentralized for a reason. 
Edit: I could make same arguments for MT-Gox.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:54:06
I didn't say LN sucks, It is just not wise to use centralised hubs when blocks are full all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:52:19
I think the formula is (8M-BCH legit txs)/(1M-BTC legit txs) which is way much more than 8x.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:43:47
No it isn't unless you make thousands of txs which is not the usecase for now.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:03:12
LN hub that has a lot of open channels gets hacked (Private key). Hacker try to steal funds from open channels. Everybody that has an open channel with that hub has to close the channel.

They are most likely the people who will buy at the top of next bubble.

If you want to run your own full node BCH is not for you. If you are ok with SPV and want low fee, you should switch to BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:03:03
The thing is he did that money with these kind of risky calls. It is not like he invested a lot of money. So if he hodled he would have maybe 3 BTC (even that came from poker), nevertheless better than nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:32:15
I expect some bitcoin forks like, bitcoin dag, bitcoin lattice, bitcoin hashgraph.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:16:41
I understand that you realised that it can't be done without hubs created because of liquidity problems. But hubs model is actually very bad when blocks are full. If one hub goes rouge or hacked, everybody on that hub has to close their channels on a short period of time. Do you see the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:47:09
Tx are still cheap, miners making more money, nobody runs a full node anyway, everybody is happy. If intention is to increase fees logarithmically like BTC, sorry for you but it won't happen. It is at least 100x more expansive to that attack on BCH. If anything this proves big blocks are working.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:26:49
There are ways to short bitcoin.
Edit: "0 financial incentive for anyone to do what you suggest" is plain wrong because attacker can short bitcoin. So if financial incentive exists counterparty risk exists also.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:45:39
I guess it is either pump and dump or near ZERO activity for you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:14:52
I can't understand how LN will be adopted so easily. When you want to buy bitcoin you can't just open a channel with exchange and keep coins on channel for further use. If you sell, buyer would not want it on channel. Most of the merchants auto convert to fiat because of volatility. LN might work if bitcoin was already a stable currency but not when its infant stage. If it works right now it will be like centralized hubs between exchanges and payment processors which is very dangerous when blocks are full. Nevertheless time will tell.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:47:12
Maybe not but, for a centralized service it makes more sense to keep all the states as logs. For example lets assume it is a merchant, it most likely keep all states as payment logs. It is accounting 101. It is like exchanges keeping all txid of withdrawals and deposits. You might trust central hub to don't keep those logs, but it might be an insider job. Anything is posibble using centralized services. Best case scenario for you is that your funds will be locked  on a non-service channel if you don't want to close the channel, because most of the people will want to close it after the hack, you will not be able to close it easily.
Hacker can do LN white paper 9.2 Forced Expiration Spam attack, and if timeouts are disadvantageous you can lose coins.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:03:12
You guys have much hope that LN will solve all issues. Almost every usecase of bitcoin depends on buying and selling bitcoin because of its volatility. If merchants were to accept bitcoin and keep it (not convert) LN might help. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:55

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:55:24
We should have let another cc like monero be most censorship resistance cc. With its fungability it is more  suitable for the job. Bitcoin had the potential of becoming worlds cash with its first mover advantage but i think it missed the opportunity now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:10:20
LN is only safe if you can close the channels whenever you want. With full blocksize it is wating for a disaster to happen if it starts to be used widely which i doubt. Adoption of another cc is way easier for merchants and payment processors. That is why you will see BCH on bitpay before LN, if they even bother to implement LN at all.
@_date: 2018-09-27 19:24:22
Mathematically it is a concensus rule. You can create a slower implementation to double check this by different methods.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:29:49
Just make an HF. Damn.
@_date: 2018-09-07 01:55:08
Shorters have to buy back and lenders earn interest. It is not bad to keep BTC on exchange for this reason, it is bad because it can be hacked or confiscated.

They have to see it as a problem before solving."Just use visa" aproach is not helping.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:25:35
LN is only good for micropayments. Security of LN comes from availability to close channels whenever you want which needs not full blocks. After debating for big blocks for years, i was convinced that small blocks was a delibirate decision on keeping bitcoin as just store of value with most decentralization possible. The debate is over. Just hodl big portion of your wealth on btc if you believe big decentralization is enough to keep bitcoin as store of value and convert some of your btc to bch as spending money. Atomic swap DEXs are coming. I believe merchant adoption of bch will outperform merchant adoption of LN of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:12:03
It depends on adoption. Steam will be on my watch list. Which one will be first, bitcoin cash or LN? Bitpay will most likely adopt bitcoin cash first. I believe there will be a new payment processor company using LN with buyers. Let's face it with this volatility we need payment processors for merchant adoption. LN has much more usecases though. I think one killer app will be torrent integration.

Average block fee was 1.259 at 4-Jan it is 1.437 now. It makes 1.06 BTC hourly. Which is at least 1200 USD. If i had %20 of mining my gain is 240 USD per hour. My spending is 240 USD per hour too. Because i get %20 of what i spend back. So if i control more then %20 i could be profitable. (I chose 4-Jan as price was at ATH too).

It doesn't couse a sybil attack in a traditional way. Because activation doesn't based on node count. However sybil attacks might try to convince miners to mine not really supported soft forks.

Ok. I know it is probably not possible now without a hard fork but what if we had a protocol of creating utxo set (like ordered on some rule) and use hash of it on block's hashMerkleRoot. Then downloading only all block headers and utxo set at 452000 and last 1984 blocks would be enough, right?
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:35:57
I am not downloading everything. What i meant was: everything that i download, i download from nodes (You might ask where else can you download, it is a good question, what i meant that i don't care if the node i am downloading from is miner or not). By not downloading everything and just all block headers (new updated headers) , utxo set on a specified block and bigger numbered blocks i dont need to trust anyone that my utxo set is correct. I can validate it just like thin clients work. Maybe i didn't fully understand how thin clients work. What i want to achive is thin clients with utxo sets. Buy not downloading whole blockchain i only give up history of bitcoins. At least that is what i think, i maybe wrong.

"The probability at BitMex currently stands at 38.27%." This is wrong. I did the same mistake and someone on r/bitcoinmarkets corrected me. Price of COIN_BH17 is based on btc. But if approved btc price will also rise. If declined BTC price will fall. So settlement on rejection is less valuable then settlement on approvement. It is less then 38.27% probably half. (It depends on what market is pricing approved BTC and rejected BTC).
@_date: 2017-02-24 09:18:44
It depends on payment / total fee increase ratio. Increase of total fee is not just because of what they pay, they also squeeze real transactions to pay more fee. They can maybe spend %10 of total fee and and increse total fees %100 percent.
Edit: Just assume that there is only one miner so 100% of all mining is done by him. You have to accept that this would be profitable for him. So there must be mining control ratio, if you have more control then that this is profitable.

Best thing is even it becomes more centralized it won't create a monopoly. Let's assume because of network effect there is only one hub. If that one hub starts to overprice fees some investers could easily open a new hub with low fees to lure people in.

Does this suppose to scare BU supporters? Almost all he has written is how bad would it be for Core bitcoins if BU splits with 30%. First, BU won't split without at least %60 which is worse for Core bitcoins and better for BU bitcoins. Second, BU supporters want bad things for Core bitcoins after split.
His only argument bad for after split BU bitcoins is that it will lose its network effect and exchanges will name it BTU. But BU suporters think that With %60-%75 fork curcimstances will be so bad for Core bitcoins that Economic majority will  choose BU coins as real bitcoin in a very little time. If anything this post will encourage them.

I think manual difficulty change means giving up the rightful bitcoin successor and other 2 options is too and also betrayal to loyal miners. Best thing for Core is to wait economic majority to choose it. SW supporters don't complain high fees anyway.
Edit: Accually when I think about they it have to change POW or POS, After difficulty change BU miners will merge mine Core with empty blocks.

They have added a note
"Note: Because March 11 is a Saturday, there is a possibility that no public announcement will be made until Monday 13 March 2017. Therefore, COIN_BH17 will settle on Tuesday 14 March 2017 at 00:00 UTC."

I think miners are afraid of any upgrade right now. It seems like no matter which one is chosen with whatever hashrate ratio there is going to be a split and sum price of two forks will be less then pre-fork. If real concensus among all sides isn't accomplished miners will prolong chosing as long as they can.
Edit: Maybe BU with SW as HF will be the solution if both sides decide to come together and solve this problem. I know that this is wishfull thinking but i think all other approaches will damage bitcoin no whether what.

It would create different kind attack vectors. Lets say POW was finding primes then in the infancy of bitcoin some supercomputer from a lab which was already working on finding primes could take over all mining and even make 51% attack. Miners should only be incentivized to mine bitcoin. If they have other incentives it would be dangerous for game theory equilibrium. Let's say POW was folding proteins and supercomputers already working on that start to mine bitcoin and bitcoin's hash-rate skyrocketted. And a scientist made a breakthrough about folding proteins and it is not needed anymore to work an folding proteins. All the funding from universities are stopped for folding proteins so all those computers have to do other scientific things. It would cripple bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:48:38
POW change hardfork is another problem. Open to botnet double spend attacks (some hacker might short it an start attack) before difficulty is big enough to secure +10 billion economy. And i dont think any company will choose so little hashrate security fork if it is not really necessary (like main fork increase 21M).

I hope same thing happens with hours.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:14:30
I am not saying something negative. If we stuck with small blocks at least it should be as decentralized as possible in that case satelites are very good because it has different kind of strengths and vulnerabilities. Which would increase general strength like evolution of spicies with wide gene pool. We also have big block version of bitcoin too (like another specie with common anchestor). I think both versions should stick to their differences.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:31:10
I think the problem is core wants big fees to push people usind segwit and LN. Which is a bad strategy. They should be preferable for their advantages not because alternative has disadvantages. Core has to understand that bitcoin is not just compete with gold and fiat. Maybe some clerification from core about fees would help. There are comments like we should see how LN works before HFs. That is understandable but we should at least have ideas about what if it fails to reduce fees. Comments like wanting bitcoin to have 1000 USD fees won't help. Bitcoin will never have 1000 USD fees because nobody will use it if fees goes over 10 USD for a long time. Bitcoin isn't going to be digital gold if it can't even store value. If fees start to increase faster than its value it won't store any value. We will begin to see cycles like market cap increase -&gt; higher fees -&gt;  market cap decrease -&gt; lower fees.
@_date: 2017-01-21 05:24:09
I don't get the benefit of a POW change. Let's say we encountered a %51 attack, which would cause a split, isn't it better to continue with the split network then a POW change. If lots of miners HF and difficulty increase attack is possible then it means there is not enough investment to secure original Bitcoin. Hoping POW change would bring that investment is not very probable. You can argue that protecting difficulty is more difficult than securing +10 billions dolar investment but i dont buy it. So are we screwed if we really need a POW change (like China Gov confiscate all Chinese miners, or increase 21M limit), answer is yes in short term. Price would really dipp like below 100 USD before new POW difficulty really catch up. Then it would go back up. POW change is very hard pill, you can't swallow it just because you disagree with scaling solution.

Volatility don't matter if it always goes up eventually. Think about why there is inflation. Governments don't want people to store value out of economy. If people are able to store value out of economy they do it. US confiscated gold in 1933 when they devaluated dolar in order to fight deflationary crises. Bitcoin can't be confiscated.

Inflation is neccessary for economies because it prevents store of value out of economy. Bitcoin is liquid store of value. You can't run a major economy with bitcoin but people need liquid store of value. Bitcoinization is not stopable and it will definetely change how economies work.

I didn't understand your question. But it is like a big exchange opening. If buyers are just people that were already going to buy from another exchange and sellers are just people that were already going to sell at another exchange, it won't effect anything. But if new buyers come that wouldn't have come if it wasn't ICE name behind it than price will go up because sellers obviously don't have trust issues. No new seller will come just because it is ICE.

It is possible to increase it a little bit. Forever 1M-4M won't work. Only thing that keeps bitcoin high is the hope that segwit will give us some time about fees, and L2 will be a great success that it will decrease need of L1 txs. If fees don't go down bitcoin will not get much more valuable. And something else will replace it until governments declare war which might never happen, and even if they do declare war monero or zcash will be more victorious than 1-4M bitcoin.

I don't understand this teechan discustions. It doesnt need bitcoin to do anything. If people want it, people use it. I think its lack of usage comes from we dont really need second layer right now. Transaction fees may be bigger then before but still small compared to other options. If we really had a need for 2nd layer (because of high fees) it would be more used. I think LN will be less usefull than people think it will, too. Bitcoin's valuable usecases are store of value, remitances and smuggling money. None of them needs 2nd layer. Before bitcoin is usefull for payments, first it must be less volatile. Sellers should not have to convert fiat immediately. Only then we  will really need second layer.

No questions about it. It will be done. It is a necessity. Nobody likes to do simple math with decimal numbers. But i think price should stay around 1000 for a while to real demand naturally occur. Then every exchange , wallet app, payment provider should use it as default. Wallets should have already had a setting about it.

For every short position there will be long position. Don't worry about naked shorts. Lets say somebody shorted 18M future contracts. There is not enough bitcoin to hedge for those on the long side of contract. This will lead to enormous interest rates on bitcoin on spot exchanges. Then for bitcoin believers there will be an opportunity to buy and put those bitcoins on loans to get even more bitcoin in short periods of time. Which will lead to a divergence between future and spot price. This is a recipe for the biggest short sequeeze of all times including all assets of the world (World never had a truly limitted supply asset like bitcoin before).

Yes but running a full node is problematic. There has to be full nodes and even you don't intent to store cp content, you have to download it when you want to run a node from scratch which is also illegal.

Semi-full nodes with censored txs might be a work-around. Lets say some blocks have some txs that have illegal content. You just download the header of that block.

I think the problem is you can't delete them. Every free porn site are attacked with cp but there is a mechanism for flaging and deleting.

How can you delete txs from full node that is entirely different problem.

If you have an important urgent tx, you have to make sure you are at the tip of the iceberg. You can never make sure that suddenly a lot of higher fee txs won't show up.

You underestimate the power of arbitragers. Any price difference between these products will be seen as no risk investment for arbitragers. As soon as arbitrage gain goes over interest, money will flow in the direction to decrease it. It will eventually come to spot buying or shorting. More money in the space will mean bigger price for bitcoin. Thinking in the extreme cases might help to understand. Lets say bitcoin is 1 dolar. These etfs can't hold big amounts of money then. You can't have a billion dolar etf product on a 21 million asset. If that would be the case someone would buy a lot of etfs like 100M dolars and then buy a lot of bitcoins with 10 million dolars and sell etf and free money.

After the settlement you sell some of your gains on btc to cover up loses on future or you withdraw some of your fiat earnings to buy back btc you lose on spot.

This will lead to greatest short squeeze of all times. Because of bitcoin holders this will lead to price divergence between futures and spot.

At the settlement they have to buy back all their positions.
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:46:04
Yes but total money in the space will be proportianal to market cap of bitcoin, no matter what. Arbitraging short is harder on spot market, because either you have to already have bitcoin or you have to loan it from hodlers (which will increase interest rates of bitcoin) and there is limited number.

Why don't you see it as a long term investment then? You should not care how frequent it will be used if its price will go up for investment. By the way agree that what you say may come true.

I am sorry to say this but no matter how successful segwit2x will be there will be two more chains, 8M non-segwit bitcoin abc and 1-4M Segwit with POW change (if segwit2x keeps the miner support). And every future discussions about further scaling updates will increase the support for these new chains and decrease segwit2x  value.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:41:29
With %20 hashrate all they need to do is spam txs.It could go to record highs like 50-100 Usd. If segwit2x keeps %80 miner support I don't think legacy chain will survive. If pre-segwit2x segwit miners back off NYA then I have no idea how things will work out with legacy-chain, segwit2x and bitcoin-abc.

Block size should be at least 2x of natural demand. Then a miner only be incentivized to spam the mempool (if he doesn't care long term profit) if he has more than %50 of hashrate on which bitcoin has more serious problems.

If everything goes as agreed on NYA and %80 miners keep supporting segwit2x through HF, they will just spam only-segwit chain with txs, that will force users to abondon it with fees as high as 50 usd.  After bit 4 locks in they will use some of their hash rate to create clean bitcoin-abc fork with wipe-out and replay protection. If segwit miners abondon NYA they will go on to create highly contentious HF, they will spam 1x chain try to create chaos on legacy-bitcoin which will help bitcoin-abc fork on price. If everthing goes as planned they will slowly abondon legacy bitcoin and move to bitcoin-abc with flippening.

This is nonsense. You think like miners are just one entity. When organic block demand is very low against block limit in order miners to benefit from high fees with spam they must have high hashing power. Spam cost is proportional to (Block limit-Avg Block Size)/(Block Limit). If Block limit equals Avg Block then cost is zero.
Edit: We have 8 years of evidence that spam attacks were never increasing fees when avg blocksize was low.

@_date: 2017-07-10 19:55:15
Segwit SF is backward compatible as non-updated nodes still see new rule chain as valid even though they didn't know the new rules and not updated. But you can still be compatible but open to new kind of attacks.
Let's say one exchange didn't update its node. And there are 1000 bitcoins on segwit addresses. %60 of miners can make a secret agreement and HF back to old rules. They create an invalid chain in the eyes of updated nodes, longer than valid chain. For the unupdated exchange node this normally invalid chain is the real chain. They can send all those 1000 bitcoins there and sell them. It doesn't have to be an exchange node. It could be any economic node and it is vulnarable to this attack. So all economic nodes have to update if they don't want to get rubbed.

I thought Manticlops wrote "Some people don't want to use segwit" so i have written HF is same as you can update and still don't use segwit. But he wrote "Some people don't want to run segwit". Maybe he editted it or maybe simply i just misunderstood it. Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:51:57
The difference is miners won't incentivised to do standart 51% attack which will damage bitcoin itself and their investments. But fooling a non-updated node won't damage bitcoin much. Still it is very unlikely but much more likely than standart 51% attack.

Nobody says anybody has to care. But nobody can prevent people from creating a HF. Market will decide what is valuable and what is not. Not some elite group's opinion.

I had to pay 5-7 dolars for txs. It effected me. I dicided to diversify to alts with %20 of bitcoin. I am not sure they did it or not but if they spammed it for political gain they made some political gain with segwit miners agreeing 2x block size. So it seems like it worked the last time.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:41:06
What i meant was they don't need to attack with hashrate. This would also be a HF only intention would be difficulty adjustment but lose non-updating node support. But whatever legacy chain do, it will always have much more cheaper tx spam attack possibilty than 2x chain.

If you think about ratio then true but number might increase. I think what is important is ratio of number of full nodes / number of central authorities.

That would be confuscating bitcoins on segwit addressses.
Edit:"manage to seize control of bitcoin" i think this is the same mistake. Something becoming reference client doesn't bound anyone on further updates.  Something becoming reference client doesn't give any control to the developers of that client. If "control" can go from core to btc1 it can go to something else too.

I know what you try but it is a hard problem. Keep changing POW won't solve it. Focus should be on how not to be forced to change POW again and decreasing above problems, not just saying "ohh if that happens we can change again". Most of the problem comes from difficulty change period being long. This makes rule change forks hard. Starting with another cc's POW and gradually going to new POW would decrease above problems.
Edit: I am not saying we should change POW, just saying if we have to we should do it like this. For example all miners decide to increase 21M HF and attack legacy chain.

These old school economists don't get what bitcoin is. They think money as a tool to simulate economy. So bitcoin is a bad money for their view. Nobody wants to simulate an entire economy with bitcoin. Bitcoin will be a bridge among closed economic circles. 
World use dolar as reserved currency right now because gold is hard to transport and dolar is by far the most reliable paper currency because USA is the largest economy but other countries don't want to use dolar, they just have to because they have no other option. Math is more trustworthy then FED. So in the long run all countries will start to use bitcoin as reserved currency.

Nothing is guaranteed in active trading. But i will give you a relatively safe strategy. Divide your money to two equal parts. 50% bitcoin and 50% dolar. After bitcoin price moves 20% either way, rebalance dolar and bitcoin 50% again. If price is ATH don't rebalance, just wait %19 drop from ATH and than start rebalancing. You can do it with 70% bitcoin and 30% dolar but pretend that you have equal amount of dolar as bitcoin.

"none of the transactions sent or received by the non upgraded nodes will be segwit transactions so they won't even be reversible with a SegWit rollback" They won't reverse transactions created by non upgraded nodes, in the eye of an non upgraded node segwit transactions created by upgraded nodes are anyone can spend txs so they will send them to non upgraded node's address.

You are forced to upgrade via economic incentives not via abondoning your chain. By the way HFs can't force anyone to upgrade, you would want to upgrade if your chain isn't growing.

I know this is my second answer to same entry but i think i find a way to convince you.
SF means stricter rule set. So every SF makes non-upgraded nodes HF without wipeout protection.
Assume that bitcoin always had segwit. And somebody come up with a stupid HF idea that coins on the segwit addresses should be made anyone can spend. And some stupid people updated thier nodes with this HF. And this HF doesn't have wipeout protection. Technically this hypothetical network is exactly same as real network after segwit activation if some nodes don't update.
Because there is no wipeout protection on this HF they are open to attack that i described.

Stop the FUD. If anything, what he is suggesting is generous. "if we do it a simple way maybe we can do some kind of soft fork do it" he considers that it could be done with soft-fork means he is just talking about sharing the present income, not increasing it. Because increasing requires HF.

Your mistake is that it is 20k if we reach visa level today. When we get visa level adoption it won't be 20k. More adoption would make more people to be incentivesed to run full node. I believe bigger-blocks will make bitcoin more decentralized in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:11:15
There will be economic incentive to spam it up in the main chain.
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:15:34
Fair point. But your example is a little exaggerated. You don't have to trust one third party. You can check independent multiple third parties to minimize your risk. Most people just buy bitcoin once and spend it later when he needs. Most people buy bitcoin on exchanges which already needs trust the exchange. Only people that recieves frequent payments on bitcoin really incentivized to run full nodes. Your example would be more fair if walking wasn't so important. If you rarely go some place like once a month and somebody always comes to your aid with his car whenever you want. Maybe you don't have to walk.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:35:57
I don't believe the new people are selling. Among my friends who bought recently all saying they will forget about it at least 5 years. Every bubble cycle creates new wave of adopters. Some of previous bubble adopters become very rich (life standard changing rich) and they sell realize some of their gains when they think bubble is over. This is a cycle which makes distribution of tokens more fair. I belive one of the most important values of cc comes from its distribution. This new better distribution sets the pre-conditions of a new bubble.

Cboe or CME has 0 btc being held. It is cash settled. It has small volume compared to exchanges. When (if) physically settled futures begin they will lose more volume too. Because it is less risky for longers to long on physically settled futures. Gold market is way different than bitcoin because of paper gold. Bitcoin is easy to transfer and matematically provable. Longers will long futures products only that prove backing of btc in the long run, because it is less risky.

I really don't get how you consider fees as dilution of money. In that case bitcoin itself has fees. I doesn't change the fact that there are just 21M coins. By the way maybe i am not clever enough to understand what you mean by joule. You don't think that value of a bitcoin comes from what is spend for it, do you? If that is the case how can you explain POS that some coins are using.

@_date: 2018-12-08 20:28:21
Sorry to tell you but it is soft fork. SF means you don't have to update to stay in concensus with the network. If you are a miner and mine 12,5 reward block, your block will be simply orphaned from your point of view. But you will still stay in concensus. If someone else mine 12,5 reward block, it will be also orphaned, you will think like there is a reorg attack.
Edit: Sorry, i have seen you admit it in another thread.
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:44:09
I think difficulty change period should be smaller. It makes forks easier and gives more power to users. We need to see rule change forks as a property not problem. If we decrease difficulty change period and use another cc's POW + new POW starting 90%  another cc's POW and 10% new POW and in time increase new POW's share it would decrease above problems.
Edit: This would effect that other cc negatively, basically we are stealing their miners. Maybe even better idea if we also want to destroy some competition.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:59:46

It prevents ASICboost as much as normal Segwit. But not even normal Segwit prevents all kinds of ASICboost. It would need another fork.
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:29:47
Bigger the block size, more economic activity. More economic activity, more users are incentivised to run full nodes. Bigger the block size, more expensive to run full nodes. There is two contradicting lines in a block-size, full node count graph. Is equilibrium is at 1M, probably not. Best way to go forward is a peaceful divorce and let the market decide which approach will find the equilibrium.

This seems good. But i have some questions. 
What is the incentive for Chain-A and Chain-B not denouncing the link between them with future forks?

Generally i am concerned about future updates and how this will effect those.

Please not this spam thing again. Even if it is spam as yourself said already this could be miners pushing price up. The problem is : it is doable. We need to make this attack not feasible by keeping blocksize limit at least 2x of non-spam transactions.

If it forks and there is no dominant side(half of exchanges call one fork bitcoin and others call other fork bitcoin), then i believe there will be a chaotic environment. But i think in the long run it would be better then just waiting. However best outcome for bitcoin is that everyone gather around one update.

"1.0 USD is 24M joule" i am pretty sure creating 1.0 usd took way less than 24M joule, still it has the same value. " If homosapiens see some aliens heating 1000ml water from 20C to 100C by spending 1.0 alien coin, homosapiens would have an idea about how much the exchange rate the AlienCoin/USD is." doesn't mean aliens spend that much energy to create 1.0 alien coin, maybe they just instamine it somehow distribute it among aliens fairly.

BIP148 enforcing nodes will follow one chain. But it doesn't mean you don't have tokens on other chain. Somebody can HF to 42M total cap coin and you will also have tokens on that worthless chain no matter which client you run.
Edit: I think there is a misunderstading between us. About owning coins and following chains. What do you mean by "access to both chains" everybody can access any blockchain because they are open ledgers. Access and follow are different things.

This concept is wrong. Accually exact opposite is true.  Energy of digging 1.0 oz of gold is determined by value of gold. If gold price increases more mines start to become profitable and people start to mine them. If it decreases those mines close. Same is true for bitcoin. Difficulty rate is a lagging indicator for price not leading. Besides POS your model can't explain fiat currencies. Money just needs scarcity whether it is accomplished by energy or some trust model doesn't really matter.

They can't take back segwit part if users support segwit and many bitcoins end up on segwit adresses. If they do, it won't be very different than increasing 21M with HF. Nobody will follow them. They could do it if nobody uses segwit, but that would be okey. If nobody uses segwit, why keep it there.

I don't think worst case scenario is very important. And remember this study was made 2 years ago. Every decision has pro's and con's. I think 2x transaction throughput is a good pro. Most concerns about large blocksizes are made for really large blocksizes like visa-level on-chain txs. I want you to show me some study about 4MB average blocksize and its efects on those concerns. 1MB limit was put there years ago with no study for what is the best number. Thinking that satoshi came up with the exact best number is ridiculous.

How did you come up with "users dont like it". And what do you mean by users. If you refer full node operators as users we don't know how much of nodes will update to segwit2x client yet. If you mean bitcoin holders, we don't know the market price of both forks but with majority of miner support, fast txs and lower fees why won't they like it.

"send the stolen coins to themselves" They won't. They will send it to that non-upgraded economic node. That economic node might be exchange. They can deposit those coins to there and convert to other coin and then withdraw. 
"60% of miners are out to destroy Bitcoin" This attack won't destroy bitcoin, who cares about one node who didn't update.
"Meanwhile the 40% of miners not involved in this hairbrained stunt would continue to mine valid blocks on the chain everyone was following." attacking miners will come back to main chain after successfull attack, ignoring all those blocks they have created.
Of course, i believe that all economic nodes will update and this will be no issue. But they are not safe without update.

@_date: 2017-06-16 15:55:28
I really didn't understand you.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:27:31
Bitcoin is fundamentally open to splits. It always was. You can't stop people creating HF. Everybody can split it with his own concensus rules. The important thing is what percentage of the network will follow that fork. I don't have any proof of this formula but i believe value is proportional with network effect square. So if a fork happens with %50 support of network, it will create two chains with quarter of previous value so it would lose %50 value in the short term. This is the worst case scenario. Other proportions will lead to better value. But in the long run it will be better then doing nothing or chosing the wrong path. We don't know which path is better for bitcoin's value right now but if split happen it will guarantee that best path is chosen.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:42:53

If they do it early enough they can stop it being a threat to their currency. They would have the power to manipulate its price.

@_date: 2017-06-22 22:42:48
With %10 hashrate it would take 20 weeks to next difficulty change. I don't believe legacy chain will survive this. And if POW change then all nodes need to update anyway so why not already working segwit2x. Don't underestimate power of miners.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:46:30
There are some improvements that can't be done without HF. And sometimes it is better to update with %80 of network instead of not update. They may be inherently dangerous but sometimes it worths the danger.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:48:25
What spam attackers don't want is that their transactions are confirmed. So expensiveness of a spam attack isn't total fee of unconfirmable txs. It comes from txs that confirms. If block-size is 2x of real txs, spams must fill half of confirmed transactions, which would be very expansive.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:35:53
HF would be the same. You can have opt-in properties with HF.

You are the one who is clueless. If you bother to read whole of your own link jgarzik says
"To the extent that current segwit disables asicboost, or not, that remains unchanged and unmodified."
