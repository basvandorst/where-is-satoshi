Yes, but you should look at (interest-rate expense+amortization)-to-income ratio. Which is likely on the same level. As your parents likely had 5%+ ARP on their loan while you'd have like 2%.
Inflation adjusted median income hasn't been increasing in the US the last 30 years, thus in average it is just as cheap (or expensive) to live as before, yet the current inflation basket, yet the current inflation basket accounts for Netflix and cellphones etc.
Income variance has increased though, so if you're in the top half you will have it relatively better than the bottom half.

Wtf, why do you even mention game theory, and Wtf is that 51%? Totally made up number.
IF we put all the massive problems with bitcoin aside and only focus on the following problem:
Almost all crypto is owned privately.
Wealth inequality in crypto is staggering, for starters more than 99% of the world population don't own bitcoin. And even the ones who own, own relatively little.
But let's just assume bitcoin is equally distributed between the ones who own any. Furthermore let's assume no one in the current 1% owns bitcoin and that the current 1% has majority of their holdings in non-fiat.
Now if we wipe out all fiat, replace it with crypto you suddenly have (on blockchain) a very rich 1% and in real assets an other 1%, there will be a gigantic exchange between these two groups, equalizing them. So You technically halved the wealth of the top 1% and gave it to 1% of the rest.
But the other 98% is likely more poor than before.
Is this what you want? Do you think this would be fair?
Do you think choosing 1/100 people randomly and give them half of the world's wealth would be a good idea?
Is that a meritocratic system?

No, it hasn't. Inflation has been in line with wage increases.
Inflation adjusted wages have been flat and thus outperformed by inflation. But that's like saying half an apple is less than an apple lol.

daily? Only true true if you are one of the less than a million people who live in GMT-1.
Maybe biggest 24-hour increase is what you are looking for.
On a side note, in Oct 28 Volkswagens shares where having a close to close, daily price increase of almost 100% for consequitive days.

1. Thx for the spelling correction. Ddit actually know that.
2. Alright you happen to live there. But 99.99% of this reddit don't.
3. All I mean is that it is cherry picking of hours to call this a 40% daily increase. And since it only spent a short time on that level, I find it sensationalist and slightly misleading. 
4. If you actually bothered reading the article you might find it interesting. Low liquidity will cause this when big enough order as are placed. The article describes how VW price skyrocketed by the bad liquidity (and high amount of shorts)
