Shoot! Thanks! I browse 99% of the time on my phone so I usually forget sidebars are a thing. Thank you!

They don’t by chance have, or plan to have an app do they? Because that’s one reason I have a hard time switching... there aren’t any other exchanges that have near as nice an app as Coinbase, since most of my trading/buying I do on the phone.

I was thinking the same! Have you found one on AE that seems decent?

I’ve seen some people running “full nodes”. What is it and f it’s useful, can I help? My pc runs basically 24/7. I don’t mine, but my video card isn’t terrible.

I’d like to know this as well..

Thanks! That’s why’s think I just I want to move most to a wallet. I’m not planning on selling anytime soon and I sell on Craigslist and have been asked twice if I take bitcoin (and I want to). So a wallet may just be the way to go.

Like was already stated, you’re good. Unless the price starts tanking and it’s still pending meaning you can’t sell. Then you’re not good.

Hit the sell button and transfer it to your bank account. Easiest $10,500 you’ll ever make.

It was like that for me too but now it’s working again.

I see! There was some background stuff that I wasn't understanding. That makes sense!

Hey I'm pretty new to Bitcoins. How does that tip work? Doesn't there need to have a bitcoin address sent?

Enough where I probably shouldn't be commenting on reddit posts. :)

What site do you use to buy and sell litecoin/Bitcoins? Just curious.

Oh god. I really did.. Too much wine at Thanksgiving dinner! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:45:53
PM me if you want to tell me the event. :) 
Edit: Yup, I'm an idiot. Too much wine on Thanksgiving!
