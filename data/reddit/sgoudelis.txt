Well, if you have at least one running bitcoind or any altcoind running you could set it up. You should follow the instructions in the README file to set everything up. This is not plug n' play. 
You should of course be wary of the implications involved in deploying something that requires remote access to your bitcoind process. My recommendation is to deploy this project somewhere where you control the environment. Your home network for example or VPN-only accessed remote server or on the same server your bitcoins are on. Although you could setup secure/encrypted links between your bitcoind  &lt;-&gt; mybitbank &lt;-&gt; your browser, you would be in fact be exposing yourself to the almost the same threats as any online bitcoin service that hosts bitcoins of others. In other words you must be vigilant.

Indeed I am casting as float. I must have forgotten that. Since you are eager to scrutinize could you please also demonstrate a case where precision will be lost ? I would also love a patch to that issue if you so inclined of course.

Thank you sir!

WOW! Thank you very much indeed!

If the API command set is the same as bitcoind's then it should yes.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:35:22
That is understood. I'll I will keep an eye on this. However, after several tests, I have found no evidence that this occurs. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:35:47
I think you should make a more specific question.

You are reffering to a problem that is known, floating point number precision in computer systems. Thats undestood. Since I am not doing any type of arithmetic calculations with these numbers I really do not see the danger in handling these amounts in this way. Would you like to offer something more substantive with regard to your claim that casting floats to string or vice versa, in python, would lose some precision when dealing with numbers with up to 8 decimal points? That is your claim isn't that correct ? I have found no evidence to that.

Yes, it does support multiple bitcoinds or litecoinds or whatever. Sorry, no multisig support yet although I have considered it. I would love if someone would provide patches for that.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:31:25
Floats and integers where appropriate.

Thank you for your comments. I'll consider the matter closed.

It is a web interface for multiple bitcoin or altcoin applications (like the one running on your desktop). An easy way to make use of multiple wallets through a web interface and a browser. It is also a way to access you coins if you want to host them your self if you do not want to store them on an online service. I don't. You can find screenshots on the project web page here:

You could but you would need to configure bitcoind (or others) to allow external connections. Generally not recommended due to the fact that sensitive information will be transmitted over the wire. Of course exceptions do apply if you have control over your environment then the thread is manageable. It is really up to you.

I have not done a single test on windows. Django is suppose to run on windows. I can't really answer with certainty. My guess would be that it might but may need some work to accomplish.

indeed the API accepts strings. But the question was whether the amount was converted to satoshis or something else. I am not casting anything. I rely on what the user gives me. If the xxxcoind API rejects the API call then that error is show to the user. It is quite dump, lets say in that regard. I do rely on the xxxcoind API to do a sanity check on the value. If there is an error, that error is show to the user. 
Thank you very much for your interest.

Well, thank you for that. I don't know if it is amazing or not but I have being using this for 3 months now in my own environment and it has suited my needs quite well. Other interfaces just did not do it for me.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:39:55
Alternatively, I am considering removing the casting entirely and handle the amounts as strings. We'll see. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:26:51
I am using floats for coin amounts. They could be converted to integers indeed but I would have to generate the numbers and convert them back to floats for the xxxcoind API to accept. Personally I do not like this approach. Seems like to the long way around and more things could go wrong. I did not want to end up with a integer converted amount on the bitcoin back-end. That would be terrible. My goal is to keep the value as is, as that is what the xxxcoind API accepts.
