The tech is flawed as currency, but it's pretty cool.


Well one flaw with bitcoin as a currency is the speculation-- most transactions center around that.




I've been here for years to learn the tech and yes, make some money.  I don't believe it's a better version of money. In fact, it is objectively bad at it in its current state (high tx fees, slow confirmations, large cost per transaction processed, deflationary currency in the long run, and irreverrsible payments).
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:14:47

"Worthless", meaning loses around 2% of it's value annually, vs bitcoin,  which has year over year a great gain, but has lost 45% of value in the last month.
If you had loaned a buddy  $100 of bitcoin a month ago, to be paid back in btc today, they'd have paid you just around $55.

Unfortunately, that has a huge impact on social mobility.  Those multi generational households would be a weight on hard workers.  Loans can really help people get a hand up. Plus, with so many mortgages being 30 years, it really isn't practical to have people "live within their means," because to get your own freedom, you're going to have to pay for a place to live for 30 years+ and hope to buy another place.

You could make a pretty hefty amount doing sales there.  I worked up from .5 to 1 btc on profits during November and December last year, and that was offering competitive rates (4-13% depending on the market)

Also, we take into account what things can be used for as well.  Shoes are more akin to cars and bitcoins to guns if we compare crime-enabling abilities.  Most people, besides douches like the OP who cry about "statists," would accept regulations on guns more than regulations on cars, because cars, while deadly, are typically used in legal situations, while guns are used more frequently with bad intentions. Shoes are just as enabling for lawful citizens as criminals; for bitcoin, a big beloved point is the off the deep end right wingers  being able to evade taxes, and also enable highly successful drug markets and online gambling. The average citizen doesn't need a replacement for fiat nearly as much as the darknet drug markets do.

Yeah, a ton of liberals (instead of dem cheerleaders) like me are pissed at the change.  My grandma was actually quite an activist who pretty much withdrew from politics when obama was elected and increased drone strikes, and the left lost interest in protesting.  Partisanship is a serious issue. If mitt had won the last election, 2/3 people complaining about the budget would stop, regardless of actual changes.
I believe these biotech companies that are genetically tampering with various species and releasing them into the wild is a far more serious issue than climate change. the potential for pathogens and viruses we've never seen and can't anticipate is enormous. 
Eh.  That's pretty false.  I understand a lot about the science, and certain changes are not very risky, where others can be (resistance to pesticides, for example, can cause weeds to become resistant).  Viruses won't happen due to biotech companies.  They're simply not working on the same thing.


Climate change is more accurate. It accounts for major weather changes, which could cool some areas.  Global warming was a phrase that could get more fear, so the media loved it.  This doesn't relate to the science behind it, and I wouldn't expect or want you to learn msnbc's approach to climate change.

Ah, I see, my mistake.  However, I also disagree that that is the case.  While there is a large section of the bitcoin community that is buying due to lack of faith in the USD, it is a crowd that found a more convenient gold, that would otherwise buy gold or other precious metals.  Bitcoin is primarily growing because of speculators trying to make a quick buck, and secondary to that because it is cool tech.  Not because people are worried about the 1.6% rate of inflation (of the USD) (which is easily beat through relatively safe investments, and mitigated by essentially invincible investments like savings accounts and us bonds)

Most early research was military. Private parties responded to public money.


That isn't at all "only government could have done it".  That's "government made this happen, not private initiatives"


Government has made that research available. That research would not be available to you otherwise. You said "government is not able to reduce the cost of anything". Here it has-- you don't have to do the research or buy it from a private corp, and it's reduced the total amount for further research to be created.  But now you step back and say " overall government can't reduce prices". That's a huge leap back, and it's also a shitty argument, which could be applied to every organizational system.


Yup, got it. Organization/distribution costs overhead, therefore it can't be cheaper right? Surprised you didn't start mumbling about entropy or some shit. 


Oh hey, I predicted this! I honestly hadn't read it before the last part.
What youre saying is organization can never result in gain because it has costs. That's absolutely stupid. Yes, government Costs more than if the system just worked perfectly. But it doesn't.


Those are great! I hope you don't have the opinion that I hate every non government thing ever. But private industry is not owned by the people. Those awesome things rarely happen. Look at Apple v. Samsung, squabbling because apple doesn't want competition.

No, that's inaccurate, he was closer to correct. They don't create money from nothing, exactly.  It's more like it's counted twice, except that it's also counted downstream.  For example, I deposit $10k in the bank, the bank lends you 9k of that, you pay that 9k to a car dealership who deposits it in my bank.  That makes it seem like that 10k is 19k.  It's double counted, not created from nothing, exactly. You do have a point about loans they receive from central banks, but that isn't the smaller banks actually creating the money.
Now the fed is different, but they're not the subject at hand.

That *is* retirement, if you're willing to live relatively cheaply* (withdrawing ~$30-35k/year). Check out and google Mr money mustache, they're both about being able to retire early.
*Edit: hell, that isn't even that cheap, it's just not well off.  It's a little over half the median household income for the U.S. Since you wouldn't have a job, you could move anywhere to save money, and you'll probably pick up some productive hobbies because you can.

I love how you're limited to conceiving of only one freedom. It makes all your arguments so silly.
Edit: here's an example to be more helpful- mandatory vaccination.  A reasonable government policy in my opinion would require Tdap (a whooping cough vaccine) for every child along the CDC recommended schedule.  The only permitted exception would be medical reasons.  You would call this anti-freedom.  In one aspect it is, in that a responsible guardian has no choice of vaccine, but it also frees children to live, and live disease free.  Now, it is possible to get non-medical exemptions, and my state is suffering greatly because of the anti-vaxxers.  Why should they have the freedom to kill (if even accidentally) children because they don't want their kid to get a shot? Is the freedom to live invalid here?

Every system I've seen affords certain freedoms while taking others. Democracy is mob rule; welfare states take large amounts of taxes.  Anarchy requires 100% compliance for you to be free, and that's simply free from of the direct actions of other people, not truly free from negative influence. Anarcho-capitalism is rule of the rich.
Calling me an idiot or a slave is absolutely ridiculous and will never help you with anyone in discussion.
I believe that a government as rich as the U.S. government should strive to provide citizens with food, shelter, and education.  That will give people financial freedom, and combined with regulation and a police force, a better chance of being free from other's actions.  All it will require is taxation and some rights to police, who are bound to certain procedures and law.

I don't know how you reached that conclusion.


How so?


Yes, but that shows what taxes do. Preliminary research was completed publicly.


Lol no. Government is able to reduce the cost of something; for example, by forcing nih funded studies to deposit papers in pubmed, and encouraging data sharing, government is letting people reuse billions in research. Believe me. I'm downloading the data from several million dollars worth of research right now, which will go into my work's publicly accessible database, which will allow other people to use that data to address disease.

I think we actually agree in many areas. Notice I said I don't like when people use adblock on sites that don't advertise obnoxiously. It seems that your usage of adblock is exactly that.
My view on adblock comes from morals I have. I think people deserve to be rewarded for working. So blocking ads without donating is wrong, imo. However, I'm also against greed, so obnoxious ads can be blocked without hypocrisy (also they're just annoying as hell). As a last point, I'm selfish. Sorry content guys, I'm not gonna watch 5 minutes of ads for a 4 minute video.
I just think that it's douchy that people proudly declare that they don't watch ads on YouTube, or that they block ads on every site. Few of these people support the content creators in any way. That ain't right.

Democratic governments are subject to the public at large through peaceful means.  Right now we face a lot of barriers to that, but in the U.S. and western Europe it's not due to false votes or violent repression of dissidents, it's due to individuals voting blindly and a degree of apathy.

*Legitimate* monopoly on violence, who h is an important distinction.


A constitutional government of some form, which requires a significant overturn in government to be changed, can protect the rights of many despite a majority calling for otherwise.  For example, the first amendment keeps Muslims protected despite widespread hatred in the U.S., or any criminal trial in the states. This obviously isn't perfect, but it works better than pure mob rule.
A minority can convince people through education. It is an uphill battle.  A great example would be the fight for racial equality between blacks and whites.  It's far from over, but now blacks aren't widely banned in communities, segregated in schools, or refused services.

You can! Just go to unowned territory. Why should you get to opt out territory that the country let you have? You didn't buy it unconditionally.




Any property is enforced only through force or good will. You don't have to stay in the system, but you refuse to truly leave.  Becoming an ancap is supporting violence and property as much as an income tax.  It is not the same as religion, you're free to leave.

@_date: 2015-01-24 22:21:59




I'll point out that it is a voluntary system. Just leave state property and you leave income taxes.
The immoral acts of government, like taxation, are more than made up for by the good of government.  Where that isn't true, it should be fixed.


And the public has *a* say in that, even though the current system is skewed. In Ancapistan, it's all gang warfare to get what you want. The public has zero say unless they're immensely rich.


You're greedy for thinking you should be able to opt out and take your state's land with you.  You're free to leave, you just must comply with state rules while in our society.
The monopoly on legitimate force is a basic trait of government.
Again, you're not forced to participate. Just leave, or take your own land for yourself.  The only reason religion is less violent than the state is because the state protects against them.

Your problem is entitlement.


Take it by force. That's literally the only method to get anything done in ancapistan.  No one is free when they can be coerced by those stronger than them, which is the flaw with a unregulated capitalist society.


I used it, and still do some small trades for cash.  It's a severely flawed technology, but it is pretty cool from a technical standpoint. The economics of it are absolutely atrocious though, but that does make it fun to watch libertarians reinvent regulation of financial markets.

This shouldn't be a partisan thing.  Both sides are hypocritical. Where were people complaining about the deficit when Bush was in office? The outcry from the right about that is much louder now.  Like it or not, the majority of people are tribal about politics. Don't dismiss global warming because some idiots use it as a partisan weapon, if you're avoiding it because of that you're just as bad.


The planet *is* heating up, but there's also other effects. Climate change is more accurate.
The solution doesn't *have* to be government intervention, although with the private sector dragging it's feet I don't see the problem with certain restrictions. For example, requiring cars.to hit mpg landmarks is highly effective and doesn't hurt private industry.  That promotes change before drastic measures must be taken.


From what I've read, those changes are a little more lax suggestions for post disaster cleanup.  I doubt it's significant.  Some Fukushima stuff is being covered up, but that's by the Japanese government, who culturally are afraid to admit mistakes.  I read an article about lax security, and there were quotes saying "if we stepped IP security, people might think we were lax before". It's cultural, not a western coverup.


That's pretty ridiculous.  Not going to vouch for fox or MSNBC, but I haven't heard them ranting about the NWO or aliens.

I've gambled with Bitcoin and won. If I had disposable income I would probably play again. I'm being realistic about its value as a currency, because currently it's realistically not usable as a currency for things off the internet

You can get mad at them for that. Legality doesn't cover morality in it's entirety.  I don't like when people use adblock on websites that don't advertise obnoxiously (not that it's exactly a pressing issue to me)


Rights are not the same as right and wrong. I have the right to say what I please, but if I were to make fun of grieving people at a cemetery, that's wrong and I'm a dick. 


It indirectly does benefit them. I vote, and although my individual vote will never make the difference, my vote contributes to (what I hope is) the common good. Likewise, by ad impressions and clicks, you support content creators in a small way.  You'll never make the difference, but it adds up.

That doesn't really matter though. It is absolutely a need currently, and being a pedant for no reason can't really be saved.  You would have a great point of OP wasn't being so pedantic (I keep repeating that but there is no other word).

Bitcoin is illiquid (I can draw on an ATM in under 10 minutes from near anywhere; tell me how i can sell bitcoin, transfer to cash, and get it in my hand in under 3 days), highly variable, and subject to finicky exchanges and bank transfers.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:15:53




Yup.  Credit cards are getting easier to use online with various third party virtual wallets and payment systems.  Bitcoin? Still a pain in the ass that adds difficulty every step of the way, with an unreliable and ever more expensive transaction system.


No, bitcoin is not a major advancement on current systems.  It's an alternative that has shown little flexibility, when that should be one of it's values.


How much has it changed in the last 2 years for the average user?


Bitcoin is between a future tech and a libertarian wank. You're in the libertarian wank side here.


Except they don't do things right, which us why my bitcoin is negligible at this point where it used to be daily.
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:29:09
My point is a catastrophic loss of your bitcoin or collapse of bitcoin is entirely possible, and it is horribly responsible to base your assets on it.
@_date: 2018-11-17 23:28:42
The gold standard was a bad idea economically.  It cost the governmemt an absurd amount to maintain a gold supply.  The only reason to hold gold (as a government) is if faith in your currency is weak and you need to set a floor in value.
Gold has little intrinisic value-- as I said, it has no purpose beyond jewelery and industrial applications.  You can't eat it, you can't make it into effective tools, and it is an inferior currency.  And if a bank is holding your gold, they're the real owners in any situtation where the U.S. dollar (and treasury bills) lose most of their value.  If they don't,  well, you're not so much storing value as setting in a loss of real value.
U.S. bonds are backed by faith in the U.S. government.  They have more value than gold in any situation where society does not collapse. I agree that gold is a safer store of value than bitcoin, but at least bitcoin has a chance of gaining an exponential amount of value
@_date: 2016-09-11 17:48:27
Because you shouldn't base your finances on feelings or gambles.  You need to calculate risks.  The more money you have, the more you can gamble on bitcoin. However, with the number of people who have lost their wallet keys, had their bitcoin stolen, or had everything held up in an exchange, there is no low risk scenario with bitcoin, and only a slim chance that your bitcoin will skyrocket in value.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:18:06
Gold is hard to store, hard to split, does not appreciate like investments, and won't hold serious value in a major collapse. What value does gold hold besides jewelery and industrial applications? I guess its more durable than cash under the mattress, but that's not worth the draw backs.
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:51:41


While there are other mechanisms that physically transfering gold, at the end of the day you're either holding the gold or holding a certificate worth gold.


It's a natural part of national security, especially when 2 of those regimes are at risk of falling foul of the international community and the other is the economic leader of europe


What a government trusts and what an individual trusts are different.


Intrinsic value isn't just due to rarity, it's also due to use.  What makes gold different than a dozen other metals of similar concentrations as "stores of value"? Only that its shiny.


Yeah, because your bank is going to keep holding that gold for you in exchange for now worthless money.  No way they'll start using that gold to start paying for expenses, or completely fold during the period of economic ruin that would lead up to the dollar "los[ing] all its value".


What's the value of gold if there's complete anarchy? Not much. Not more than guns and bullets and food.


Everyone knows that financial cycles are part of keneysian economics.  It's still better than the thoroughly debunked Austrian economies that value deflationary currencies.


Yeah, if there's a collapse, bitcoin will be worthless, cash will be worthless and gold will have a small value.  Instead of planning for economic ruin, though, I'm working to pay off debt and buy a house with land that I can enjoy crash or not.  If there was a crash though, you'd be better off with bullets and canned food in addition to a means of food production than a shiny rock.  Hell, salt is a mineral that's necessary to life, currently dirt cheap, and has intrinsic value as a nutrient and food preservative. You'd be better off with that.
@_date: 2016-09-10 08:48:21
Reaching 0 isn't the only bad outcome, particularly if all your eggs are in the bitcoin basket. If you have $1MM in bitcoin a year before retirement, and it suffers a 50% loss *which is not unheard of*, now you've lost half your life savings just before you're drawing against it.  Most other assets don't do that, and a mix of assets will never do that.
That doesn't even take into account the diaster level possibilities for bitcoin, or bitcoin's clunky code being supplanted by a finer tech.
@_date: 2016-09-11 06:38:53
Why? That 50k is much more precious than the next 50k and so forth.  I wouldn't consider bitcoin as a reasonable asset for the majority of any portfolio.
@_date: 2016-09-21 23:42:20




I'm not even talking about the wait. Besides, that kind of wait only works for online orders or large orders; our system is designed around quick payments.




Sovereignty from governments, to be at the whims of those with computing power and the exchanges that regularly rob people or lose millions.  And because the system is so reliant on those, it affects you whether you use them or not.




It still works is a change? That isn't a glowing review, either.




Don't worry, no one cares and about your opinion, either.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:20:50

@_date: 2018-11-16 16:34:41
Honestly not any good options there.  Those bonds will do nothing. Gold will hold its value, roughly, but the end point will depend greatly on the market.  Bitcoin is really an unknown 10 years out, and it could be worth millions, nothing, or any amount in between.
Can I just invest it in a good mutual fund? That'll produce a nearly guaranteed fantastic return, and if it didn't (i.e., in the case of a severe economic crash), all the other options would be useless except maybe a bit of value left in gold (hopefully it would be worth its weight in food, at least).

The best financial move in history was to unlink the dollar from a shiny metal which costs a ton of resources to mine, transfer, and secure.  It allows the U.S. to respond to economic disasters that are inherent to capitalism. We haven't had another great depression because fiat can respond to damages in the system.  Gold bound currency cannot.

You can create this too.


Who says people will adopt weapons enmasse? Even if they do,  individuals have a poor track record against militaries.


And not a single one is legitimate.  "Incentives" made no sense to me though, and propaganda deserves a half point because it would be hard to accomplish, but that gives you a max score of 1.5/7.  That falls short of "Meatloaf's rule", which would require 2/3 or 4⅓/7 points (if I did my math correctly)

I think you still don't get it.  If I chose to start gathering mafia style protection money, and I had the funds and/or connections to get started, I've created an involuntary system in your "voluntary" world.  The only way to resist that is having more money.  There cannot be a voluntary system if people decide to establish an involuntary one (there also can't really be a voluntary system with capital, but we'll get to that later).
What totally mindfucks me is how you don't realize that human society started out as voluntary as you think, and became the system of today. 
Another thing that mindfucks me is that you want a voluntary system to be survival of the fittest, but don't recognize that's entirely what we have.  Just resist the government with your free market solutions!  Oh wait, you can't effectively do so, because they are far more powerful.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:45:11

Edgy af.  They've also been called "warlords," "brigands," "gangs," and many more.  Many of those groups have huge differences.  Governments, for example, all have some form of justice, and are responsible for defending the property of their citizens. Gangs do not require that.

@_date: 2015-02-18 06:54:32
You simply can't, unless you have almost every single person buy into the system.  As someone here very clearly explained, an anarcho-capitalist world is "survival of the fittest"-- basically, oppression by the rich (with the occasional coup), like most of the developing world.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:49:11

@_date: 2015-02-19 03:22:39

You make very good points. However, from what I understand, mining gets harder based on the power of the network.  It's more of a tragedy of the commons thing-- the race to have the most processing power is making everybody buy more equipment to push to make more bitcoins to remain profitable. This same type of race was in part responsible for the great depression putting many farmers out of business, because they had produced so much food as a whole that they couldn't sell enough to profit individually.

How's your financial situation outside of bitcoin?  I think that it's good to keep these coins, but if you're suffering a ton outside, you may want to sell some.  Get that stuff in order!
If I were you, I might spend a coin or two on some selfish stuff.  Everything else I would hold.  160k is a lot, but if the coins keep going up... you can retire on $1 million.  At that point, you want to sell your bitcoins and invest in the traditional stock market-- withdrawing 4% annually (40k/year), you will almost certainly never touch the principle.  Of course, you'll still be able to work and gain more money.  Maybe you'll be able to buy even more bicoins?
Of course, you need to try to find your purchase receipt for that.  If you want to liquidate these funds in a short period of time (less than a couple decades), you're gonna have to talk to the taxman eventually.  You don't have to pay tax until you sell.   Once you sell, find a CPA (an accountant) that deals with taxes.  Tell him everything and try to get it resolved.
As far as keeping your funds secure, listen to everyone else.  They know more about that than I.
Good luck OP, and good for you!
P.S. I'm envious.

Yeah. I mean, the high bubbles are obvious (the huge bullrush to 1k would be wrong to buy) but you shouldn't try to time the market too much. If this was more stable like traditional stock I would actually say don't time the market at all.
Also, don't play with money you need.  Bitcoin could crash or become worthless. Or, more likely, an exchange could crash or a reg could be passed or your bank locks your account due to your transactions and you're left with just bit coins, which aren't as useful fiat.

It's the small things-- "I won't buy Starbucks today"-- combined with bigger things-- bank giving loans.  All the little things in aggregate, plus the disincentive to lend money makes for an economy that will focus mostly on necessities.  Consumer culture, for all the ills it brings us, is the reason we can have so many people employed at such a high standard of living.
Everyone here says "I'm responsible with my money, shouldn't it appreciate?" If the economy is worse and you lose your job, how are you going to save then?  
Another argument I hear is that inflation helps the rich.  Besides the bankers, not really.  Inflation hurts those who horde cash more than the common person who has their wealth tied primarily to their house.  Housing tends to stay level with inflation, while cash obviously doesn't.  If you are wealthy, you have to invest your cash holdings in the economy rather than hold it if you want to see it do anything but shrink.

No, everyone always says this, but you can exchange fiat for bitcoins.  If you pay a $100 tab with 10% off for paying with bitcoins, you spend $90 of bitcoins.  You then have $100 of fiat you would have spent if you didn't pay bitcoins. Transaction fees will be less than 10%.  You came out ahead if you rebuy immediately.  No loss for you except time, which may or may not be worth the discount to you.

You misunderstand 401(k)'s and stocks-- those are reasonably safe investments (compared to bitcoin) Bitcoin? If you don't understand the tech behind it, it looks like a potential giant scam. Also, the exchanges can just close up shop and shut down with all the money you have there, or someone can hack your wallet, or you can fail to back up your wallet somewhere safe. It's dangerous.
Plus, the rush and volatile pricing is scary and dangerous when you're betting your fortune on it.  Why do people buy treasury bonds? Because they're a very safe bet that you'll have some amount of wealth.
If you are investing your life into any one asset, you can be broke in a matter of hours.  I encourage you to diversify.

Not all of us. I'm just here because I like the game and I like the ability to send money anywhere.

I'd say that its harder to get than local currency, but easier than a foreign currency

If you want that kind of turn around, go to an exchange, don't use coinbase.

The value is the gift, not the coin.

Not saying your philosophy is wrong, but that is the definition of a wealth tax;- you're being taxed for having wealth.

I disagree that he shouldn't judge science if he's not a scientist, as I think that every person should enrich themselves.  But he should stop reading the websites of frauds and start reading actual articles that are available to every one free in pubmed. Seriously, it's a beautiful resource.

American healthcare was ridiculously expensive before the ACA

It seems very close to that already.

Go to pubmed and read the papers there. Those are unbiased and number almost 5000 full papers free on climate change so you can examine methodology if you wish

I think it shows more promise for regular (as in repeated) business to business transactions, especially internationally.  Apple wants to change 35 million iphones from white to eggshell one week before release?  10 minutes or 2.5 are nothing in those situations.
I definitely agree about consumer transactions (with exceptions like cars and homes).

You're back with your ramblings about paradigms and revolutions again?
Look, bitcoins are great.  But they aren't a sure thing. They have the potential to grow because they have all the risk of not growing. They're incredibly undervalued right now in my opinion, but that doesn't mean it's safe or that value will jump as much next year as it will this year.
Everyone, be careful. Don't make bitcoin your complete retirement portfolio. Why bet on one green horse when you can bet on them all?
Stay safe, acquire bitcoins, profit.

That's nutty.

Probably not. They aren't contraband.  When they seize cars and boats bought by drug distributers, they sell them. The FBI will likely treat it as an asset like that.

That's the dictionary definition of hacking.

I'm actually transferring cash between an auxiliary bank and my primary credit Union (so I can buy more bitcoins), and it's a bit scary. Where funding this account took 15 seconds, the auxiliary bank has debited my entire account save 47 cents, claims that the transfer is complete, and my credit union is showing no extra cash.  So I understand people being frustrated and afraid, which is also made worse by this being an audience that is likely less experienced with transferring tons of cash online

These guys should find better banks. I agree that fees are bullshit, unless they are providing me with a better interest rate due to increased revenue from fees.
