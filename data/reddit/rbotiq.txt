Banks including J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. have successfully tested the record-keeping technology behind bitcoin on credit-default swaps, a move that could help it gain a foothold in mainstream finance.
The swaps are essentially insurance contracts that pay off if a bond goes bad, and the process of keeping track of the over-the-counter products can be a burden. Banks match buyers and sellers, transmit the trades via a service run by data provider Markit Ltd. and send a record to Wall Street’s central bookkeeper, Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp.
The new test showed that a portion of that record-keeping task could be accomplished using “blockchain,” a common ledger that each party can view in much the same way that multiple users can work on shared computer documents.
DTCC will now discuss whether the results are strong enough to warrant using the technology for live trades or across a broader swath of credit-default swaps, a market with trillions of dollars in outstanding contracts.
“The ink is still drying on the results, but they are positive,” said Chris Childs, chief executive of the DTCC unit that oversees over-the-counter derivatives.
The test helps make the case for using blockchain in core Wall Street activities. While alternative currency bitcoin itself has been embroiled in legal battles and volatility, the underlying ledger—which can be edited anywhere and instantly validated—has drawn heavy interest from mainstream finance.
Big banks recently have invested teams of people and millions of dollars finding ways to apply private blockchains to cut out middlemen and save money. Barclays PLC on Wednesday announced a partnership with bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to enable the digital-currency startup’s mobile app to send and receive British pounds and to swap them for U.S. dollars.
Analysts at Autonomous Research say using blockchain could cut trading settlement costs by a third, or $16 billion a year, and cut capital requirements by $120 billion. A recent report by Citigroup forecast that automation including blockchain could eliminate two million banking jobs, largely in processing, over the next decade.
The new test replicated a month’s worth of trades in the single-name credit default swap market, which has a total of $6.7 trillion in face value of outstanding contracts, not accounting for offsetting trades, according to DTCC figures. Electronic CDS agreements on individual servers were replaced with a record on a shared blockchain network.
The test included Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG, which worked with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Markit and technology firm Axoni, a new venture focused on applying the bitcoin technology of blockchain to banking.
Markit has about half-dozen active blockchain projects, but the CDS test is “the most real proof-of-concept going on,” said Jeffrey Billingham, vice president in Markit’s processing division and a lead in its “Chain Gang” testing blockchain uses. The test “revealed to everybody the ways you can improve efficiencies and minimize costs.”
Any live implementation of blockchain in swaps trading could be years away. DTCC says the next step is testing the appetite of other banks and regulators to use blockchain in the market. Some may be reluctant to make changes that threaten their own market share or introduce new complexity to current systems that have been tested and refined over the years.
DTCC, a bank-owned utility, will be an important player. It handles settlements for quadrillions of dollars worth of transactions. While bitcoin and blockchain were intended to eliminate the need for a middleman, DTCC has argued that U.S. regulators would likely still require oversight by a central body.
Regulators including the Federal Reserve, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission say they are monitoring blockchain.
Last week, DTCC said it had separately started working with Digital Asset Holdings LLC, the startup led by former J.P. Morgan executive Blythe Masters, to see whether short-term lending arrangements between dealers known as repos could be settled using blockchain.

If you look at the details of the tests, there were 3 clients tested. 2/3 clients (eclair and lightning) passed all tests. It was only Lnd that failed 3 tests under the "test_forwarded_payment" test subset. It should also be noted that this is only integration tests.

Screenshot of payment in action using Instant EFT option from Takealot and then Bitcoin from the PayFast screen. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:06:01
I did some test transactions on one of the merchant sites accepting Bitcoins and made the following calculations: For a R2000 transaction the total price was R11-R19 (depeing on BTC/ZAR exchange rate) more than selling your BTC at Bitx.co.za with a 1% transaction fee and R8.50 EFT fee. This assumes that you have a fee less way of paying for the same item at the merchant e.g credit card. For a smaller transaction I tested R99, and for this it was actually R7 cheaper than going through the BitX exchange. It should be noted that the BTC/ZAR exchange rates at BitX are higher than what Google would give you using "1BTC to ZAR". Also the bid volume on the BitX exchange is very shallow, giving you higher slippage on larger BTC amounts.

Yeah the fee is acceptable if you look at the convenience of a credit card transaction vs international money transfer for the average first time bitcoin buyer. This reduces the barriers to bitcoin participation and will help with adoption.

On their website they state that you can buy BTC as well.

There is the less know bitcoin gold fork around 25 Oct and then the well known segwit2x fork later.

Assuming that the cryptocurrency market cap becomes 1% of the sum of stocks and bonds and that Bitcoin accounts for 50% thereof , then a price of $75000 is possible.

"0.5 is also the price where if you sell all your BT2 at that price (then split the result, sell it at 0.5, and so on) you would ~double your post-split BTC."
Not sure how that works. Selling BT2 at 0.5BTC would only result in 1.5 times your original BTC?

Any airdrop of value for Bitcoin holders? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:03:01
The price is not fixed for all time. The 30% bonus is a onetime offer. The capital going to s2x will eventually move back to bitcoin. The only difference then is that you will have 30% more bitcoin.

Why are there text floating in 3d space at the top left side of the picture? If it is a photo why edit it with extra text?

No it is not. Why is this topic being down voted on r/Bitcoin when it is an important topic to discuss. All I see are posts on the price.

Front page of Bitcoin, but not one comment. It seems there are a lot of uncertainty with segwit2x.
