Thank you ALL! I think that a BRD Wallet is the best for user experience, but it has low coins...
And for security and multi platform (also Windows)?? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:35:23
Refuse 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:03:40
Why? Which is the difference with BRD or Electrum wallet? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:27:03
Bank wire, around 20 thousand bitcoins
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:17:23
Very interesting! Can I use Ledger Nano S seed into Enjin Wallet? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:02:22
Really pretty! Thank you so much! 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:50:27
All 
@_date: 2019-03-24 19:51:26
I don’t mean someone else ID.
I mean FAKE ID with everything false
Anyway Godex is Crypto/Crypto... The problem is with FIAT currency
@_date: 2019-03-24 10:04:51
Which topic? Thank you!
YES, this is the point... If Hacked criminals can’t use my Docs for illegal activity 
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:50:45
This is my opinion...Seem impossible to check every identity 
@_date: 2019-03-24 19:50:40
Yes but this is (I think) not valid for low volume and so low withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:46:34
Yeah, but it’s anyway in your name with real personal informations...
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:53:54
Thank you. So only P2P Exchganges
And what about VirWox?
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:42:20
This is exactly my fear
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:59:10
Ahahaha we can try our deal mate! :D
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:45:50
I’m not interested in providing Fake ID because I’m super verificated of course..
But I was reading this post on Bitcointalk so my curiosity is very strong
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:58:49
How many address + private key can be generated by 1 normal CPU at second?
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:29:50
Yeah, but KYC needed also for little amount
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:44:06
Today CBOE Future will expiry.
How can this affect BTC price? 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:03:08
I know, but maybe in future someone will use the same address with the same Private Key. And the software will warn me :D
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:44:35
What type of “verification” Exchanges uses? If there is no Government database, all ID can be fake, right?
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:14:20
It's for pure fun of course, I know it's quite impossible.... Buuutt
If all peoples will merge the database? What's happen?
For example 10k PCs with the same database? I think that the situation could change, right? 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:22:04
IIRC? I only know LBC but they seem scam 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:04:10
And it will automatically add under previous address, the new addresses? 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:04:33
Not 0 but around 0 :) 
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:17:52
 How large a .txt file could with all existing Bitcoin addresses and Private Keys combinations... ?
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:30:46
Idio.t 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:14:47
I don’t know this...
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:03:03
Watch blockchain, genious-.-
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:22:31
I don’t know... This may be influence the price...Think if they will send those BTC to exchange and then sell or modify price... 2013 / 2010 wallets are now active
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:15:25
Someone noticed recent activity from 2010/2013 wallets? They are moving thousands of BTC
