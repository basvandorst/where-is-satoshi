Linux may be much easier than you think, its shell shares most commands with the mac, and the filesystem structure has many similarities. Ubuntu works like a dream on all sorts of cheap computers and netbooks. Electrum works without limitations. It is far less prone to attacks than a Windows computer too. If security is the issue this should be your best option.

The main point of this surely is trust no-one. Do your transaction and get the coin safely into your own wallet straight away. That way these exchanges won't have your coin to run away with, and won't be massively exposed to hacking or temptation.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:10:50
OP is not addressing people who post legitimate concerns, rather the strange way certain facts are buried. One example is extremely suspicious. Look at the way that poor woman in Asia who committed suicide was reported as a 'Bitcoin exchange CEO' when [First Meta]( her exchange, *does not have anything to do with bitcoin in any way, shape or form.* Repeat - her exchange **First Meta does not trade bitcoin in any way, shape or form.** The people pointing out this info right here on reddit were repeatedly drowned out.

How were they holding 750k btc? Did people really leave that much on there? Personally I only ever transferred in/out to buy/sell, I honestly find it hard to believe they were holding that much?
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:40:37
Assuming the leaked doc is true, we *think* Karpeles told them about the difficulty, but also told them he was finding investors to sort the mess out. That would be a good reason to be quiet, if making a statement would devalue the Mt.Gox brand and scare Karpeles' investors away. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:25:54
No hackers would waste their time hacking your laptop for your BTC just because you have BitcoinQT unless you posted on here that you had hundreds or thousands of them maybe :) Your only realistic worry would be viruses that are designed to look for bitcoin wallets and log keystrokes, just like the ones that would attack your online greenback banking and paypal account. 
If you were to own hundreds or thousands of bitcoins then you'd want to know more about cryptography, or at least how to run linux/armory. So yes you do kind of have a point, but only if you're heavily invested and really if you're that invested you should be learning this stuff anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:17:32
Thanks, I will definitely look at that.

But is it? It has value as a means of moving/converting money between countries and/or currencies. How do you know that it is not being used in this way? There are a lot of high value transactions on the blockchain suggesting otherwise.

With a bit of luck you might be able to use Ubuntu 12.04, I think your biggest worry will be how much ram you have. You should be able to just download a live cd from the powerPC Ubuntu site [here...](

I'm cautiously optimistic, so I don't fully share your view, but I have to agree about the schmucks holding it back. There is never a dull moment on bitcointalk.

@_date: 2014-02-26 11:21:06
No I must have expressed myself badly, sorry, what I was trying to say is if you use BitcoinQT or Electrum you don't have to worry about being hacked because the crypto boffins are writing and peer-reviewing those programs for you. Publicly on github or sourceforge or whatever. You just have to watch out for the usual stuff, i.e. keyloggers and trickery. You can trust open source software most of all, because its flaws are out in the open.

@_date: 2014-02-26 11:07:52
Assuming you are using Bitcoin QT or Electrum and you don't have custom software running hundreds of transactions a minute on your wallet, your wallet software is robust and the source code is available for anyone to point out and fix any flaws it may contain, including the 'Phd in crypto' people who wrote it. The most likely way you should be worried about being hacked is by having your passphrase keylogged, somebody 'guessing' your private keys, or social engineeering.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:25:46
Yup. and meh.

In lieu of a Unicode symbol I and many others use the Thai baht symbol for now. Whoever edited the relevant section of Wikipedia agrees with me for example. I detect from the tone of your previous post you may disagree, what do you suggest as an alternative?
@_date: 2012-08-12 14:01:35
Well that only works for the first transaction post-theft, any subsequent transactions can be argued as clean, especially if they arrive via a tumbler or silkroad.

That's about where I am, I feel they WILL deliver, about 3 months late and with 25% lower GH/s and 50% higher wattage.

Normally, I would imagine, but in a case such as this where they have literally tens of thousands in one transaction from BFL, then, as they have stated on bitcointalk, they would stagger their sell-off so as not to cause market panic.
@_date: 2012-09-06 13:24:04
So how do I get the information then?
(n)umber of bitcoins spent * (d)ays since last transaction, is that for all bitcoins spent in the period you're looking at, then you look at another period for comparison?
I think I'm beginning to understand it :)

There is a possiblity of guessing private keys, stupidly small at the moment of course, but imagine the current crypto becomes much more crackable, and we all migrate to more secure keys, then any coin left in 'old' addresses is open to theft or treasure hunting.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:43:00
your keys (or account numbers) are stored in the wallet.dat file, as long as you keep this safe you can delete anything else. It lives in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin/

Did you note down the number of blocks it had downloaded and are sure it's the same number? I recently re-formatted my drive and the blockchain wasn't one of my restored backups, it took over a week to download. Stick with it.

I've just invested a smallish amount with Hashking, 8 weeks @ 1.9%, repayment due in October. His thread on bitcointalk in the marketplace/lending section goes back to March and details quite a few loans and deposits so I'm pretty confident of a return. 
Edit - I wouldn't touch the 6.75% rate, I don't think the 'Bitcoin savings and trust' scheme is going to end well. 
@_date: 2012-09-09 00:26:35
You did what to the what? Did you have any coins in your wallet? I think you misunderstood me :S
By renaming your wallet file, you made the app create a new wallet file with all new keys. What you should do is copy it somewhere, for backup purposes, not rename it. I think the problem you are having is that the blockchain is taking like forever to download, that's normal unfortunately, just let it get on with it. It takes a week :0

Localbitcoins, they have escrow which means you don't transfer the money until the bitcoins are in localbitcoins escrow, then when your bank transfer shows up the other party releases the escrow. If it was me I'd put up a buy advert on localbitcoins and do it in chunks of £500-£1000 over a couple of months. I use localbitcoins myself and have never had trouble. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:52:23
I agree, most people can deal with the difference between 1 km and 1 mm, why not 1 BTC and 1 mBTC?
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:01:12
I don't know, fortunately! I've been treating it as I would ebay and only dealing with good feedback traders. All the messaging has been through the localbitcoins site, so should it ever happen the message with the bank details combined with a bank statement corroborating the transfer would surely be enough to satisfy the escrow release. Of course there's a risk someone will try it on one day, but I figure as long as the transactions are worth less than the value of a good rating on there I'm safe.
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:59:32

The cost of mining is an intrinsic value, i.e. if a miner (who has to pay for electricity) doesn't cover their electricity costs and minimum return on hardware investment, they stop selling freshly mined coins.

No YOU. You kicked my dog. Now he needs operation.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:07:17
No I didn't, OP's bank account and the blockchain are both undeniable records of the transaction, along with a print screen from localbitcoins.com if you want. As to the price, if OP posts a request at a price deemed acceptable by somebody, it will be met. I really don't see why people are hesitant to use localbitcoins, it's the best way to connect buyers and sellers I know. I've been through the BTC-E,  Intersango and Mt.Gox processes in the past and find localbitcoins to be much more convenient and logical.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:05:48
It is a privacy measure so third parties don't easily know which fraction of the split balance from your original address is spent to somebody else and which is sent back to addresses you control. You can build more than 1 transfer into a transaction btw, if you want to dig into that too, I don't fancy losing *my* coins figuring that one out though ;) 
Addresses were originally assumed to be more or less one-time use, (and I believe sending via. IP rather than the 27-43 char. string or QR code was expected to be used much more), but most people, including myself, would rather sacrifice some privacy for the convenience of only having a few public addresses to keep track of.

The way I see it the large price swings aren't due to daytrading, they're due to early adopters cashing out in a relatively small market. The day-trading is supplying a ready market of btc/cash and should be a stabilising factor.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:55:35
Proof or it didn't happen. What is the address? If it can not been published due to it being an ongoing case etc, then the writer of the article must confirm that they have seen the transaction in the blockchain or risk their reputation. Otherwise it is merely idle gossip.

It's almost as if the banks are delibarately forcing people underground - encouraging people to use localbitcoins, word of mouth, bitcoin meetups and OTC, doing their bit to foster grey economy off-grid peer to peer exchange. Maybe they're not so bad after all.... /s
It reminds me of the days of Napster when the record companies wouldn't provide digital music in a convenient form :) Look how long it took for them to catch up, I would imagine the banks are going to be much slower.
