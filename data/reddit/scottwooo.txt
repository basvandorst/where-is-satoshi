Is anyone experiencing transaction delays ? Sent 3 low amounts of Btc with standard fees on coinbase and have 0 confirmations for all 3 after an hour ? 
Tested by sending some LTC and confirmed almost instantly ?

If this is recent then gdax/coinbase have issues with deposits/withdrawals right now so things are moving slow. Transferred Btc from one coinbase account to another GDAX account and I'm still waiting for it to show up. Sending account states 0 confirmations and I sent it well over 2 hours ago. Just a waiting game.

Well you have your recovery phrase and your wallets on your PC/smart phone so you are able to recover it if you lost your ledger or if it was stolen etc.

It took about 4 days, I'm in the UK so it might take a little longer for the US

That was my intention, however I've tested sending some low transactions from coinbase to my wallets. My ETH and LTC have gone through fine but my BTC just has had no confirmations and coinbase isn't giving me a hash to check on the block chain? 
Do you know if there's delays or is it just coinbase ?

About 4 days. 
I'm in the UK though so shipping from France was quick.

Directly from ledger 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:22:20
Yeah just checked and apprently the blockchain is extremely slow atm. So I'm just waiting before I transfer all my BTC across.

I think he means 1btc = 50/100k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:55:33
Well that's one positive 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:20:00
I prefer this analogy 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:33:16
I'm getting a tingling feeling 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:19:13
I know between different exchanges that the price will differ slightly but as I set the HODL app to the Coinbase-GBP rate that I'm confused how they can be showing different rates? 
Do you know what the most accurate exchange is ?

Update, we hit £7k! I'm going to celebrate with a curry and a pint! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:59:53
Well I don't fancy that if I'm honest. 
I will ask you though that was the subs current ongoing war against r/Bitcoin started because they were angry about being banned ? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:55:01
Seems to be very variable for me aswell, transferred £170 earlier today and took 15 minutes for 6 confirmations, about 45 mins ago I transferred £130 and has only got 1 confirmation as I type this.  Both with 183.031 sat/B. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:31:17
I have, but finding a user friendly site/app that converts to GBP is making things more of a pain for me (maybe I'm just being slow). 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:25:05
Thank you for taking the time to leave a detailed and impartial explanation. I appreciate it . 
Do you believe that BCH will fade much like Bgold and B2X ? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:02:07
Well that's my plan, I'm just trying to find a way to word it without the mods deleting my post because I'm not pro BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:33:37
I'm patiently waiting !! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:47:34
Yes well that's the impression I get from the posts on there. 
What's really getting me is one of the first lines in the pinned FAQ thread at the very top of their sub is "The r/Btc community was originally created as a community to discuss Bitcoin." 
But that's not what they are doing? They are essentially saying how awful Bitcoin  is and promoting this knock off brand ? 
Honestly I'm really concerned because with the way Bitcoin is gaining popularity, people from everywhere will flock to places like Reddit for information regarding Bitcoin and some may sadly find themselves in r/Btc and get the complete wrong impression. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:34:36
Ah you know what I was being slow- market aggregate at the very top of choices on HODL app 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:06:12
I'm here at £7,500 so I guess it's still a celebration for us Brits ! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:56:08
Sorry that's my mistake 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:49:02
Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:40:17
I'm sure it won't take long for you, maybe another week the way the last few days have gone ! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:43:00
I bought at ~5700 and was sitting watching it creep up and then drop. Now I'm trying to decide what colour my Lambo will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:58:34
Yes, send it to me and I'll make sure to keep it safe for you .....
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:09:30
That seems to make sense, must be the reason.
And yeah I've encounter their helpful reply before...
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:52:41
Were they band from here for promoting Bitcoin cash in the first place ? Or did they get banned then went out on some vendetta against core ?
