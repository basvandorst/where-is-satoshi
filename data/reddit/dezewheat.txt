Update: I turned off my VPN, the network synchronized and my transaction completed within the next 30 seconds lol. Thanks guys

Update: I should have clarified this wallet is loaded onto a flashdrive. Made the noobish mistake of letting my computer go to sleep while the transfer was going on. I changed the settings and will update when I'm back home and can see what she's up to.

True, I just worded it poorly. I'm figuring my VPN was doing something to prevent my wallet from synchronizing with the network.

Wallet was installed on the 20th, yes it has loaded the blockchain. But I let my computer go to sleep, which I'll guess prevented the transaction from going through.

The real question is why don't you switch banks.

What do you mean?

Would that'll explain the price drop as well.
Edit: Severely misspelled a word that changed the meaning of my comment.

What would this mean for miners? I'm looking to buy my first asic but I don't want the currency to explode weeks after buying it.

I was wondering about that, but the transaction has been confirmed for a couple hours and still nothing.

Thanks for your replies, the money is back in my account. Will be sure not to use this feature again until I figure out how it works.
