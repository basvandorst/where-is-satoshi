I originally intended to buy it to see how it worked practically.  I only put in as much as I was willing to lose at the time.  I was curious about the subreddit, looked around at the things everyone was saying, and just decided that, hey, maybe I'll try buying something with 0.5 of a bitcoin.
While I admit, I wasn't going into it with the bright-eyed idealism that some people have about it as a cryptocurrency, I was at the very least curious about it.  The fact that what was once $300 is now $250, means that as an Investment (for the 2 months I've had it) and as a currency (for the 2 months I've had it) I've been disappointed with what I could do with it.

What a poor choice of words

I was with you for a while, and you completely lost me now.  
If you can use this historical analysis of yours to start tracking the weather accurately from now on, I'll actually pay attention to what you say about Bitcoin, but for now I'll just ignore you.

It's a commercial series from Direct TV with a list of unfortunate consequences, that started with someone having a bad cable/satellite TV connection.  They then say to switch to Direct TV
Here's an example:

Didn't downvote, and I don't believe you've gone to school to predict the bitcoin prices.  So, what you've said wasn't needed or valued.

I bought bitcoin because I was reading the posts on here pretty regularly.  I have a layman's understanding of the technology since i'm not a programmer, but aside from that, I had seen that it was being taken up by new merchants, and I was interested in seeing what I could buy with 0.5 of a bitcoin.
300 bucks is nothing to me.  I don't make much at the moment because I'm in grad school, but 300 is something I don't mind losing on a pet project.  I bought my bitcoin, and I held on to it for a while because I didn't have any need to buy anything, and I just forgot about BTC for a while. When I came back to check my coinbase after a month, I noticed that the value of what I had bought had dropped by basically 25%.
I didn't come into bitcoin as a speculator.  I wanted to buy it because it seemed like something new that was interesting to try and if it worked well, it would be a good backup for any online purchases.
As a medium of exchange, the rate has been changing, and all i can do is exchange it to a place that will likely change it to Fiat. And notice that prices fluctuate regularly.  What good is my medium of exchange if I can't buy the same thing at the same price 2 days down the road?
As a store of value, I have lost value.  I'm not sure why you say I'm speculating on it.  Conflating things that have literally nothing to do with each other?  A store of value is an investment? So what are you talking about?
So, yes, maybe I'm new to this, but Bitcoin has failed to perform on both fronts of what I, a beginner to Bitcoin, would want it to do.  My introduction to this seems to have been significantly less rose-tinted than yours has been.

I bought 0.5 of coin at $646 per coin.  Small potatoes when it comes down to life in general, but the faith I had in bitcoin being a good investment or currency is dropping dramatically.

Why would demand for bitcoin rise if cash is available for the same purchasing power without having to get the bitcoin through cash?
