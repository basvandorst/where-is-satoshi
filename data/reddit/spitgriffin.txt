This is not "debt", it's insolvency. Debt would imply that there were sufficient assets in the business (either liquid or otherwise) that are able to entirely offset any debt. If BFX liquidated all their assets it would not be sufficient to cover their liabilities. This is Balance-sheet insolvency.

This was my little weekend project. It's essentially a Lego box housing a Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" LCD display. It's running Chromium in Kiosk mode and loads up a single html page that polls GDAX every 2 seconds for the USD to BTC/ETH exchange rates, the colours alternate between red and green (depending on price movements). It's fairly simple and you can pretty much adapt it as per your own preferences.

Let's say I buy 1 BCash on Coinbase thinking I'm buying 1 Bitcoin, then I try to purchase something online and send the funds to a BTC address. Technically the funds can be recovered, but you're now very much at the mercy of the receiver. If they're a huge company it's not going to be an easy ride. If you've ever dealt with the general public you will realise that these sorts of mistakes are common place. Now we are seeing more individuals getting involved in crypto, and these people are used to PayPal and not necessarily managing stock portfolios. All I'm saying is to have two Bitcoin named products listed in Coinbase is a big fail on their part.

The blockchain will grow in a linear pattern anyway. So even with a 1 mb block limit and even with L2 solutions, this problem will not go away. However I'm unconvinced that this will even be an issue in the near to mid term. Storage is getting cheaper, bandwidth is gradually improving around the world. Increasing the block size will have negligible affect on node distribution and let's face it, this will need to be done at some point regardless.

There is a wallet software called Electron Cash. Install that to a computer and you can sweep your paper wallet and then either keep it on the computer (bad idea) Send to a hardware wallet or send to an exchange.
Keep in mind that Electron Cash isn't compatible with BIP38 encrypted Paper wallets so if your paper wallet requires a password, You will have to go to Bitaddress.org and enter your private key there, Then enter your BIP38 password and it will show you the unencrypted version of your private key. Paste THAT into Electron Cash and sweep the wallet.

BTC is already regulated by current money transmission and AML regulations in most parts of the world. I've never personally used an exchange that doesn't do these AML/KYC checks.

Unpopular opinion but true. In the UK there's such a poor choice for any non-tech people to get into bitcoin.

Then by your assessment bitcoin can never become mainstream. There is no world in which AML/KYC disappears.

Bitcoin wasn't yet a thing during the 2008 crash. We've now witnessed a long consistent period of growth in the stock markets and all key indicators seem to suggest that a correction is well overdue. There was a 2% drop in the Dow on Friday, now a further 4% today. We may be on the verge of a significant global downturn if this continues to snowball. It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin will move inversely to a decline in the stock market. Usually Gold is the safe haven asset of choice, but we now have a cryptographically secure store of value that didn't exist during the last financial crash. Interesting times ahead I'm sure.

I don't understand how buying mining hardware is ever going to be viable for the person acquiring it? It would surely always be more profitable for the company just to use the hardware themselves to mine the BTC. The exception to this would be if the equipment they're selling is either outdated or defective.
The only other exception is if you're buying from a chip fabricator that are not themselves in the mining business and you're doing so at significant volumes.

Go to the filing history here:
Now look for the entry **Appointment of Mr David Kleiman as a director** and click to view the PDF. This was filed one year after David passed away, but the date of the appointment is October 2012.
I saw the original company name, it was setup with nominee directors. It was only later CW and DK were appointed.

If your BTC wallet is anchored to your phone then you need some contingency plan if your phone is lost or stolen. This invariably relies on some backup seed, as is the case with most crypto wallets right now. Then once you start storing large sums you really need to start looking at geographic redundancy i.e. offsite copies of the seeds and splitting those into multiple locations. It quickly becomes complex and that's the issue, most will rather offload that responsibility in exchange for convenience. If there's a small cost to this or they need to forego some privacy so be it, most people will be OK with that deal. If you want to transact on-chain then you can do that too, that's what I love about crypto, you have the choice.

One specific issue I often see with Coinbase is related to 3D Secure on EU debit/credit cards. Even when you can reach the dashboard, payment attempts will repeatedly fail. I figured it must be the bank, but called them and they said no 3DS validation response even reached them.  As soon as I can get the damn thing to work the price has already recovered a couple of 100 USD :(

I work on frontline support for a software company, you wouldn't believe how many people are terrible at IT security. Emailing me their passwords, credit card info you name it. If BTC is ever to become a mainstream tech 100% it will need some form of centralised entity for exchange and storage.
