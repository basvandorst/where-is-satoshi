You confuse market value and intrinsic value. The stone you mention has little to no intrinsic value because it has little to no usefulness or utility but if people are willing to pay for it it has market value. Art, paper money, and bitcoin are all in the same boat.

Because of supply. There isn't always a correlation between intrinsic value and market value because of supply. Water isn't going to be very valuable until it is scarce and not readily-abundant.
This is one of the big reasons why some people like bitcoin, because of the limited supply... It's sort of the entire point to it with limiting potential inflation. How do people on a bitcoin forum not get this concept?
Intrinsic value is the answer to the question what am I going to do with this should there be no market value. The best use of cash if the market value collapses would be shitty firewood. The best use of a gun would be to shoot stuff. Guns have high intrinsic value and cash has low a intrinsic value.

You can amend your last 3 years worth of returns to correct errors. If you haven't reported gains it's not too late. If you haven't reported losses then the IRS probably won't come tell you about it but it would be in your best interest to report the losses as they can offset your other capital gains or ordinary income, like wages, to a small extent. Go see a local CPA or enrolled agent. It's honestly not that complicated to report as long as there isn't a ton of transactions. To add to that, a lot of people wouldn't owe tax on it anyway as your capital gain rate is 0% until your taxable income is in the 25% tax bracket which is about 70,000 for married filing jointly.

Actually it's pretty close. Total market cap of the DJIA was about 7 trillion on 12/31/2017 so going down 2.6% is 182 billion down. Bitcoin had a market cap of 325b at its peak and has lost about 179b of that. So 182b vs 179b.
In reality though the amount of money does not really matter and that's why you look at these things in percentages. 
Edit: Updated to reflect the current market cap of bitcoin. (146b)

Pretty salty about that price and the accuracy of my prediction huh? Haha

Oh so you sold? This room is only for people who hold, please show yourself out sir. Kidding aside you were wise to listen to my advice and sell. Frequent trading of the only way play this garbage.

Probably not that low as long as you can still buy things with it but there will be a massive price correction.

This comment would not have made *any* sense in 2014. If you asked the average person in 2014 what bitcoin was they would not have known or most people wouldn't have. If you ask anyone now they know. I had retired relatives asking me about it over the holidays. There is no more new bitcoin blood left.
This is even quantifiable. Look at the google search history for bitcoin since 2014 (my link). It was not very popular until recently (i.e. hadn't become mainstream). In December 2017 it was about 10 times more popular of a search than anytime during 2014.

��What an impressive argument. �� You clearly are a smart guy and know how to convince someone.�� 
What's going to drive this price increase? Where is that 175b going to come from? Are a bunch of people who have never heard of it going to buy in like the last few months? No. Everyone knows about bitcoin now. Are a bunch of people who just bought in for the first time going to sell and never buy again? Yes.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:57:59
Not everyone had heard of it at 5k due to lack of news coverage. There were tons of people who had never heard about bitcoin until 3 months ago with the massive amount of news coverage.
Do you really think there are people out there who are hearing about bitcoin for the first time and thinking they should buy in after it was covered non-stop on the news for months? No, they heard about it 2 months ago and bought in then and thus the massive price increase.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:10:07
Everyone has now heard of bitcoin. Where are the new buyers going to come from to get this massive price increase? If you were going to buy into bitcoin you probably already have by now. It will never get to 20k again.

New buyers drive massive price increases and with the amount of news coverage over the last few months literally everyone has now heard of bitcoin. If you were going to buy you probably already have.
The big problem with the current crash is everyone is watching due to this recent news coverage. A lot of recent buyers will see this and make up their mind about it not being a wise investment and will write it off and sell.
I feel that people who truly back bitcoin would want to see it at a more reasonable price and stable price. The massive price fluctuation means places like Steam no longer accept it and this defeats the entire purpose of it IMO.

The crazy amount of news coverage of the last few months means that if you were going to buy into bitcoin you probably already have and thus we will never see the 20k peaks due to a frenzy of new buyers again.

You can certainly claim the loss on your taxes but it will only offset other capital gains except for $3,000 per year which can offset your regular income like W2 wages. The rest of the capital loss is "carried forward" to future years to either offset future capital gains or continue to offset $3,000 of regular income per year.
People who sold, spent or traded coins at the end of 2017 when the market was at its peak should have reported the gains on their tax return by now (final due date was 10/15). When people realize the losses by selling spending or trading in 2018 won't have gains to net them against as they were reported last year and can only net $3,000 per year against their other income.

The price needs to be more stable before it can ever become mainstream. Bitcoin is in quite the conundrum here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:14:26
Bitcoin has an infinite value. It will go up until the end of time.

With bank fees you pay a fixed amount that is relatively small and known beforehand. With bitcoins you stand the risk that the entire coin market collapses and you lose everything. 
Now, think about it in terms of running an actual small business where we're not talking about $1000 in sales but $100,000 or 1 million in sales and a 20% fluctuation of $20,000 or 200,000 could be your entire profit for the year. Are you, as a small business owner, really risking your entire profits in speculation? If you answered yes, please avoid self-employment.
