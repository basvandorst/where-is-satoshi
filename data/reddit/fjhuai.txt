Shhh. A bunch of Hillary bots are trying to make it look like Russia is attacking Hillary and that Donald Trump loves Russia. This is their agenda and they are pushing it without facts.
No matter how many times you will try to tell this person "Russia had nothing to do with guccifer", he will try to push his narrative.
It's basically the only dirt that Hillary can bring up on Trump right now is his Russian donors, but nobody looks at the arab Clinton foundation donations because corruption and greed and ISIS.

Not exactly "sources" but I could google and reference some more honest news media.
The evidence for Hillary arming Isis insurgents is in the emails which are not released yet, and the FBI is holding them because the emails also implicate most other branches of government in crime and collusion. A huge shitstorm is emerging and people are wondering who they should throw under the bus, or if they can sweep it under the rug.  Constant balance between the two. If Russia or some other power releases the rest of the emails, we are screwed. That is why Trump calling for Russia to release the emails is dangerous for the USA.

/r/ politics -- TRUMP IS BAD
-- TRUMP LOSES IN POLLS
trump is bad! politics!
 if you look in Politics, there will be 95% pro clinton, anti-trump posts.   If you look at the evidence, you see this is 1984.  The Cold war never really ended, we are still at war with North Korea, there are many sides to world power and issues.
politics used to be about both sides, and all sorts of issues. People who used to browse say that they hate it now. I am sitting on sidelines trying to point out emperor's new clothes.
