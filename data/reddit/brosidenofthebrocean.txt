True, that is the nature of reddit. Thank you my man
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:04:59
Yeah that's a good idea. Does anyone know any good lawyers for Crypto related things?
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:14:38
You’re right. Thank you for the advice.
I thought it was just really difficult to raise limits on coinbase and this was a way to buy more ASAP, and an incentive to get people to do it :(
Too much faith in humanity :(

So basically it's impossible to reverse the transaction from the bank. I.e. he cannot retract the money wire?
Sorry for asking again just wanted to double-y confirm 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:40:34
Even if they aren’t my assets?
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:24:23
Thank you for your opinions I really appreciate them. Guaranteed lesson learned. Didn’t make a dime off this and I’m just going to block him I think. Almost feel like I should report him to the authorities
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:04:18
Ok, yeah this concept scares the fuck out of me. I mean he said he's from Alabama but I don't fucking know. I really shouldn't have done this in retrospect
.... as to your first point, am I able to explain to the IRS my mistake? I'm scared af right now
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:43:18
Why? If I purchase and send it to him immediately aren’t they his asset
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:12:01
Yes, Thank you. I agree. In no way have I profited from this endeavor, thank god.
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:07:35
Yeah, I fucked up really bad. If it sounds too good to be true then it is  FUCK. Do you have any advice?
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:45:20
Is that allowed? I thought that if purchased instantly it’s wired immediately are you saying you he can retract it?
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:03:49
Have since talked with a Lawyer, deleted this post, and collected as much evidence as possible on the situation, including this reddit post. 
To those of you who offered good advice, or at least tried to empathized with my situation: thank you. I really appreciate it.
To those of you who hammered me with malice and/or make me feel terrible, please find a way to display your thoughts in a more interesting light :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:42:30
Yeah I realize the severity of my mistake now :( I’m freaking out man
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:45:46
Fuck. I didn’t think of this
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:15:30
Yes, you are absolutely right; trust me, while there are no repercussions happening in the near-term, I have ABSOLUTELY learned my lesson. 
Never again will I act so NAIVE, IGNORANT, IMMATURE, IRRESPONSIBLE, STUPID, and honestly, just straight up PATHETIC. 
Hopefully someone else can learn from my mistake.
