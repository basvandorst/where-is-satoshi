So Im not a tech guy, Im just money guy so all the inner workings I know very little about.
My understanding is the Lightning Network makes it possible to exchange bitcoin in real time, and with no miners fees correct? however its all in theory and beta form at this moment?
Is this the tech that will be needed to make bitcoin a viable way to pay for everything from coffee at mcdonalds to the mechanic working on your car? How far away is it from being something that would be usable commercially?
Also I get it saves money from no miner fees but wouldn't the network itself be quite valuable and thus a cost to put in place?

Well...one dead guy seemed to do just that
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:32:15
So how much money would it take for you to fake your own death, abandon everyone in your old life, change your identity, and steal from everyone who ever trusted you?
Whats the number? 
$137 Million is a pretty good number.

The worry is that it only takes 1 time for these doomsday people to be right for it all to be over.  
This atmosphere is more concerning with this dip if you ask me. People have to start wondering "Will it never go back to 20k?" and "What if they're right about quantum?" People have to invest in bitcoin for it to go up, and at some point people will sell and not jump back in later because of the roller coaster and now theres real unknowns over head.

For simple people like me who don't get into the nuts and bolts of all this crypto stuff and just look at money, its easy. If ETH or LTC or any alt coin is jumping 50-60% I look at Bitcoin which I know as THE major coin and think "Well if theyre going up that much Bitcoin will soon go up 50% too and if I buy now I'll make 'X' amount of money" and do that quick math in my head. Then I want to buy.

Things were moving though. Things aren't really moving here yet. They're looking up, not moving like it was Nov 2017. That was a comet, I don't think people were stunned it got up to 16-17k

Crazy all the motivational speakers that come out the woodwork during a dip. 
I'm long, so I'm with you buddy but whenever I read stuff like this I always wonder who it's written for?
Did OP write this to convince us or to convince himself?
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:45:16
Yeah I use Coinbase. Its fine.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:36:48
so if someone had coinbase, in this above scenario, and lets say not paying taxes on their gain was life or death, had to do it, how could it be done?
Does Coinbase send a 1099B to the IRS?
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:15:33
Yeah it's fine. What you dont realize is you need regular people to buy bitcoin if you want the moon and lambos. Coinbase makes it easy for regular people. 
Here's a tip, the more difficult and technical and inside nerdom you make Bitcoin the less people will want to buy it
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:00:29
I reject everything you just said because it doesn't make me feel more optimistic
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:54:38
So there is a way, you're saying. 
Interesting. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:49:50
very clever way to try and convince me to hold on to them and not sell. 
I know you're correct in what you're saying, but also...want me to hold
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:56:10
Litecoin has jumped so far up. I think alt coins showing strength is a precursor to a Bitcoin move. People see alt coin numbers jumping 60%+ (easier when only have to go from $32 to $50) and will start thinking "Bitcoin will pop off soon too" and buy which will actually lead to Bitcoin popping off.
Or none of that will happen.
Either or.

Comon need to see some more growth here soon, Ive been fooled too many times and ended up looking at Bart. I like the steady growth so much more than this spike and then flat, it has yet to work out for us.

Where I worry is sitting 6500 ish in Nov, huge drop, holds at 3200, climbs and climbs, starts to take off again and NOW everyone that freaked out after the Nov drop is probably looking to get off the ride. 5k seems like a good spot to exit.
So theres a real barrier there it feels like. The more BTC takes off the more people who got freaked out will dump as it gets closer to the 6500 that they had originally in Nov, and then the less BTC takes off.

Bags packed, got on the rocket, fell asleep, woke up this morning and looked around.

Why does Chinese New Year matter so much? People taking losses before end of their year?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:32:26
Just because it hasnt doesnt mean it won't. Matching up to 2018 so far.
And recognize that Bitcoin is a public thing now. Its no longer just "inside baseball" sharps. Regular people buy it now and regular people dont care about all the technical shit. Regular people do things in patterns. These habits influence the number more now than they ever have.

I actually think they're ultimately inverse. The stock market and crypto still dont share a majority who invest in both. Old school market people believe in their way. New school cryptos believe in theirs. When stocks dip I think independents and cryptos think "Things might go bad in the world need to get decentralized". When Crypto dips I think independents and Market people think "Crypto is too unpredictable we better get traditional"

Just a copy of last year. Will bottom in Nov. Hold low in Dec/Jan. Flirt with Bart Simpsons in Feb and March and spike in May.
