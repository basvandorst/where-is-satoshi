Hello! How are you?
It would be really cool to collaborate on this -- let me bring this to the team and see what we can do.  Thank you for the idea! @_date: 2014-11-08 07:18:26
Cool idea :) 
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:18:29
That is literally an idea I had a few weeks ago! Great idea :) Great great idea!

Ah, go into your changetip account and check out the monikers - all the amounts are to the right.  You can edit them, delete and make new ones, too!
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:29:17
Agreed.  How do you see it going? I'm here to help everyone build... I would love it to go viral over twitter, too!

@_date: 2014-11-11 03:54:48
Don't jinx it!
Rude guys are still out there. Just being drowned out by all the changetippers
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:21:27
yeah, we are working on it.  How annoying eh?
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:15:59

This response made me lol.
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:26:29
I hear ya.  Slack is still rad, though. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:15:38
OK, great.. thank you for letting me know.. just learning the ropes here... Apparently I've tipped some trolls. 
Great ideas though. @_date: 2014-11-07 18:49:35
Good point - we are going to suggest some changes today and look for your feedback on them as well. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:23:39
I think you can choose whether you want it to be bits or not.  Is that what you meant?
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:42:35
I agree.  What do you think about a good place to start? I'd love to rally the community up for a good cause and do another wave to bring even more people into the bitcoin fold.. by appreciating good content.  What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2014-11-07 07:15:18
most awesome app evar

This is a great idea! Let me bring this to the team! Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 19:28:02
That's really great feedback, thank you for sending that along.  I'm going to pass this onto the team now. @_date: 2014-06-14 16:28:17
Standard luxury tavern is great and they use ottawa-based resilient21 app and cavirtex, which is cool. 
They average 5 transactions a week in bitcoin, too. Owner Mike is pleased with the tech and the "enthusiastic" customers who use it! 
the Flour Shoppe on bank in Ottawa also accepts bitcoin the same way - delicious cupcakes, but no gluten free or vegan options. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:04:58
Victoria here from BSG. As someone who helps merchants on board with bitpay, is there an affiliate commission involved with this or will I have to charge the merchants for help with integration? Thank you :) - Ottawa, canada 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:10:29
Great content gets great tips.  value for value.  Here, try it out some more and see how you feel.  High five for the feedback! private
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:09:29
Would be nice... but then we wouldn't have a product?
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:47:30
Yes, great point, should have been mentioned above.  Thank you @_date: 2014-11-25 03:12:45
great work... $5 for your efforts... maybe we can crowdfund your lawyer :P
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:43:40
This is a great article; lots of good points. Many factors involved in this.  The important thing, as Jason said, is to reach out for hugs and know you're not alone - we're all the same :) &lt;3
Hugs - '3 a day to stay alive; 8 to thrive'

Maybe broke in comparison to the work he was doing prior. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:04:07
Hello! No problemo.
Hmm... okay, no worries - I am in charge of that e-mail address too, let me look into it for you.  Do you want to send one to me directly victoria -- I will also forward this onto the dev team so we can get this sorted.  
Thank you for reaching out.  @_date: 2014-11-06 18:09:38
Whatchya want? A box of smarties? private
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:41:52
Minimum tip amounts? What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:22:30
haha, ok, I will :) do they accept bitcoin yet? :P
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:23:32
I like your style.
props @_date: 2014-11-07 19:59:36
ok, cool, I'll add this to the list of good feedback for us to review. Thanks! @_date: 2014-11-10 02:22:20
haha oops.  I should probably change that now that I am in the states.
Hey, our dollars are pretty good!
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:31:07
Wow! Thank you! Even a reddit noob who forgot to link her account? :)
high five @_date: 2014-11-07 19:43:57
Yes, trust and community are the most important things.  I agree with you.  And thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I've already updated Nick with your idea, and taken note of it in our feedback channel.  Thanks again.
Great feedback, Diapolis! @_date: 2014-12-09 19:19:18
Well, welcome!
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:17:22
We do have an FAQ on our site  - have you seen it? LMK if I can help further victoria
thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:43:22
I think that's a great idea -- crowdtipping!!! will you keep in touch about this? victoria
Thank you for your idea!
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:15:35
Thank you! How kind. Really appreciate your support.  We are all in this together - truly a community effort... so thank YOU :)

@_date: 2014-12-09 19:21:00
haha, I wish I had that kind of reddit power.  Thanks for the props though; I actually didn't do anything. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:18:37

so far, nada.  I believe in the new year, we will charge 1% on withdrawals from our hot wallet :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:28:39
Yes :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:59:30
Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure we do +90% cold storage.  However, I have been asked a lot today about our storage, so we will have a statement on this soon so everyone knows - transparently - what our position is with this. Sound good?
Thank you!  @_date: 2014-11-17 07:18:31
Arthur Anderson did audits. How well did that work out?
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:53:05
Yep! You can go into your account and cancel it.  I like the idea of however.. will bring that to the team.  Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 21:22:45
That's why we love you :) 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:56:45
Like a phone app? Yep..  lots of things to work on.  Thank you for your feedback! @_date: 2014-11-08 07:17:55

We love other alts! Did you see this article?
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:03:04
Thank you for the feedback. This will deliver eventually :) @_date: 2014-06-22 04:07:18
Dude, chill - I wanted to add a quotation from him as part of the article.  Why don't you post some articles and show us how it's done? :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:40:05
Yes! They're called monikers, and you can access/edit/delete/create them in your account.  Feel free to reach out if you have any other issues with this topic - glad to help
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:00:49
I would love to have it over e-mail, and Slack. Do you use Slack?
Did you see that dollar sign logo that was there for a while in Gmail? Something like that, I agree, would be cool. 
Or how about the idea of sponsoring emails? Nifty.
Good feedback! @_date: 2014-11-07 20:16:06
Makes sense.  Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 20:05:22
Thank you! I'm really excited to be here.  @_date: 2014-11-07 19:38:51
Hmm.. I'm not sure.  I'll add this to our feedback list and see about this.  Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-06 17:48:46
Welcome! Gold star for you private 
If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to reach out

I totally agree! Tuesday's coming up fast. Who do we pick?
@_date: 2014-12-07 10:27:54
How do we become better than traditional banking?

Wasn't David's video awesome? 
Great ideas -- esp. the advertising-free internet - we are working on this.  Great feedback. Thank you! private
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:57:03

@_date: 2014-12-09 19:23:35
Ok, good feedback -- @_date: 2014-11-07 21:38:25
Aw.  Well, thanks! It just kind of worked out this way.  We can still work together! Become a power tipper and we can work on all sorts of projects together :D together we change the world.. not alone..
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:51:02
Nice moniker :)
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:21:50
You can update your profile with your username.tip.me... otherwise you ca install the chrome plug in and have it updated to twitter, but no other button yet... Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:30:15
well there you go. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:52:48
Send them some bits -- thank you for the enthusiasm !!! private
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:29:50
Ok, good good, glad to hear it worked out.  Sorry about the delay.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:02:00
Yes.  Transparency is important, and yes, this is all about the community. Where did this come from - is there something you're finding that isn't transparent? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:40:41
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:34:26


Good feedback - actually we saw this comment a lot yesterday and took note of it

good call - Bitcoin Embassy recommended this on twitter earlier. Props @_date: 2014-11-07 20:18:57


I'm working my way through a ton of e-mails, so you will hear back from me soon, -- thank you ;) I love kebabs
I believe it is possible, yes - feel free to email again (sorry, just getting started in this position) so I can get this in priority line and get back to you.  victoria
Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 19:12:43
haha yikes! okok
I'll talk to the people in charge of this and get back to you! 
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:18:42
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:01:46
so true
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:17:05
It's not just me, it's the community... everything works better and faster when we focus as a team :) thanks for the encouragement!
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:45:03
Thanks for the feedback -- $5 for you for all your explanations.  @_date: 2014-11-08 06:39:31
It's very important that people remember security best practices.  
ChangeTip is a hot wallet.  I do love your recommendation about teaching people about storing, however.  I am going to take this into strong consideration and perhaps create a video series teaching people these basics for ChangeTip.
Thank you for the ideas! good feedback @_date: 2014-11-07 20:01:29
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:27:22
Microremittances and social tipping over sms (like 37 coins) are huge deals for me.  
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:19:41
Adding this to our feedback channel :) danke danke!
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:36:11
I think we need to really pull together as a community and focus on promoting valuable, worthwhile content.  etc.  Show people outside of bitcoin, who are doing immensely valuable work our love.  I think we need a really focused community effort.  A place, kind of like an online club? Where we can discuss what we want to do, and then focus all our efforts onto that, instead of a more scattered approach. 
Just my later night thoughts.  What do you think?
good feedback @_date: 2014-11-06 23:55:31
How would you see this happening with someone on a street? My thing is, what if they don't have a phone, or a smart phone? QR code what we print out that they have?
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:52:02
lol.  we'll always use the smaller amount. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:01:30
Have $1 on me @_date: 2014-11-07 19:15:02
We're working on a solution for this -- new link coming up soon with our plan so we can get your feedback on it. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:08:10
Hi there! Thanks, we want to make a product you continue to love.
So, this question has been asked a lot today, and it's a really important matter for everyone.  Personally, I don't have an answer yet (I just joined) but I will find out and promise to keep us up to date with the best and most secure measures.  Until then, remember, like any hot wallet, it's a hot wallet, so treat it as such... 
I will consult with our team and get a statement issued on this and encourage technical solutions from the community so we are always employing the best security practices :)
It's hard to ask for trust in a trustless environment, amiright?
Re: facebook - another top request -- we are working on it... promise. I want it, too!
thank you for the questions @_date: 2014-11-13 00:54:44
I think so... I'll check it out again!
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:21:34
Good clarification.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:17:28
damn it!
let's try again
props ... @_date: 2014-11-13 18:53:24
Great feedback.  I think an important part of bitcoin adoption is doing exactly this - getting out into other sub reddits.
A previous redditor suggested subreddits like and other similar subs to tip people who create content. 
It would be cool, as well, IMHO, to organize a community effort so we can point our energy in one direction - what are your thoughts on this? @_date: 2014-11-07 20:06:37
Hm.. well, we wanted to show how fun custom monikers are.  You can delete all of them, if you want, and make your own.
Some fun ones we've seen so far:
Magical unicorn heart
3D printed Satoshi Nakamoto figure
I personally use "thank you", "props", etc. But one surprise was seeing how much my high five was worth vs. my hug! I think my hugs are more valuable than $0.75 ;) hehehe.
Feel free to change them, customize them, play around.  Let me know what other ones you come up with...
Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-06 20:41:48
be sure to check out and register on  all people on it, we can tip each other all the time IRL
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:03:25
Welcome! Glad to hear it.  Always open to feedback :) Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 19:12:03
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:37:53
Sure - victoria :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:05:08
Agreed.  I'll take this down. I'm with you on this one; I do think it's important. 
Good feedback @_date: 2014-11-13 00:55:18
Great idea - let me bring this to the team. :) 
@_date: 2014-12-13 03:23:03
New button coming soon, and I think you will be pleased. I'm excited to get your feedback on it! Stay tuned!
(Or if you'd like to join our mailing list for updates, you can do that, too... hmu victoria
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:02:29

@_date: 2014-11-06 20:20:59

@_date: 2014-11-15 02:39:21
props to your contagious feedback @_date: 2014-11-06 20:18:48
That's the plan! Great suggestion.  Thank you @_date: 2014-11-08 06:54:20
Yes! Great idea.  It's all about the volume, right? I would love for us to all find a great cause to start out with... and overwhelm them with positive tips.  Any ideas on a good way to start this?
I like that latter idea too.  Good feedback! @_date: 2014-11-06 21:39:18
Love, love, love this community.
So proud.
Standing ovation for all your work.  @_date: 2014-11-07 07:12:54
Ooh ok.  Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:11:22
We have a lot of really great updates for you coming out soon... stay tuned, that's pretty much all I can say at the moment!
Anything in particular you'd like to see? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:37:05
thank you for the love @_date: 2014-11-07 00:01:38
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:50:23
Yes! ChangeTip.  We are all about making change.  And the way to do this is to connect and build a community... together we make change, not alone... a company is a collection of people.. so you should know the people, right?
Thank you for your encouragement.  It's awesome to hear :) I feel very welcome. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:04:41
Ok, great, thank you for this - I am on it now.  It may be, it may be because I am new to reddit and I simply didn't link my account.  Either way, not OK, and will be fixed now! Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:49:06
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:41:01
never apologize for that! high five @_date: 2014-11-07 19:29:46
Unfortunately, after a chat with the payments guy from Facebook, he said he likes the credits and doesn't see bitcoin being involved quite yet. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:49:45
Welcome! Thank you for your enthusiasm... private
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:57:56
Yes, awesome.  First we need charities to link to.
I know Greenpeace accepts, United Way accepts, how about Sean's outpost? How would you see this working -- tip, then pops up with an option of charities that accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:19:21
Let me know if I can help in any way :) 
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:54:51
Why sorry? All feedback is appreciated... 
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:58:16
followthecoin.com is an example, twobitidiot has it on his blog, oureverydayearth.com has implemented it -- you can read more here
Off the top of my head :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:50:12
We have many ideas in mind and always welcome more :) thank you private
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:11:31
Yes -- your first suggestion was overwhelmingly recommended today, so you are in good company.  All things coming with time!!! thank you :) @_date: 2014-08-27 20:33:43
I think I get sad involved in bitcoin, too.  I think I get sad because when I work in bitcoin, it's for a better future, but I am constantly reminded of the harsh realities that have been created by these legacy systems.  Financial despair is really crappy, and the state of the world that I read about and hear about every day is depressing.  It's important to balance, too. Take time to remember all the beauty of life and in the world, that it's not all bad.  Because sometimes, when you remember that money and central banking, etc, etc, etc,. has done all these terrible things to people, and the connection with fiat and war, it's hard to believe that things will ever change. And that is depressing. 
IMHO. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:26:02
Edited: Title changed from "ChangeTip hits 10,000 Users in One Day" to "ChangeTip hits 10,000 User Tips in One Day."
Hey guys! Soooo before I jumped on my 30-hour long plane ride, I updated our blog to reflect the 10k tip day we had last week.  Except... **the title is a bit misleading**.  It reads like we got 10k new users in a day - which is totally inaccurate.  SO. We have added "Tips" in the title (as it should be!) and letting you know about this update.  So sorry for any concern this may have caused - or question marks over people's heads.  I know that if anyone actually read the content they would realize this mistake, but you know that 80% of people read the headlines, so it's important that we clarify this ASAP.  We passed 10k users months ago, but this title makes it seems as if we hit 10k NEW users in a day. No wonder Jackson was freaking out! :simple_smile: So sorry... If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me directly. victoria

@_date: 2014-11-10 02:22:53
Could be a cool idea. Thanks for that!
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:53:32
Thank you! I'm really looking forward to incorporating everyone's feedback so we can build an awesome product for everyone to use and be proud of :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:58:06
Ok, let me take this feedback back.  I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:27:19
We love doge.
Did you see this article? So rad. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:20:32
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:46:25
We just launched our tip.me button -- go to  and follow that... updates going there :) thank you for the feedback! private

Yes, all good feedback, thank you @_date: 2014-11-06 17:44:57
Isn't it? Thank you for the feedback private
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:11:36
if only :P
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:22:08
Definitely.  It was one of the top three most requested features, and I have suggested this strongly to the team.  I assure you, we are working on it, and I value your patience and support.
Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-13 20:18:04
Good feedback Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:31:30
nah, It was definitely my mistake.  Thank you though for having my back.
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:38:09
pleasantly persistent
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:48:59
Nice share.
Yeah, David Seaman has worked on this guy, too.  Very happy he's involved! I tipped him pretty big tonight.  Would love to see him using it and spreading the word. It's going to happen. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:18:19
thank you! Your support is appreciated... :)
We will wind up doing an AMA.. I'll post details in soon :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:04:08
That's the question.  Can we combine all our volume in bits, in a fun way, to make a real change in the world? And what does that look like. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:18:20
This is old news! 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:57:01
:) thank you for the support and encouragement. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:42:31
Such a great idea.  We are definitely going to do this -- 
Microwork. 
hey, you gave me great customer service - win
here's a tip for that great customer service - win
business gets better because the customers are happy and the customer service reps are happy - win

Who should we integrate with first?
thank you for this thought! @_date: 2014-11-21 06:59:14
Tips tips tips tips!

I am! Just got on.  toriborealis
Yes, it is my dream job, for sure for sure. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:58:15
Good call! I will :) Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:43:03

Welcome :) 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:23:11
I think it's about a week they stay in limbo...
You can also cancel them from within your account and try again (my recommendation). LMK if you need help with this.  victoria
You're very welcome, and thanks for your time!
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:55:50
Any more good ideas about this?
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:48:19
Here's a coffee to start private
also register your name at tip.me :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:28:34
Good point with overstock - I'll reach out to patrick on this. good feedback @_date: 2014-11-08 07:09:09
Yep - good idea.  Need to wait for confirmations as of now.  We are working on partnering up with another company to offer instant confirmations.
I think that's a great idea.  Thank you. I think overall we can have more basic FAQ guidelines... that's coming.. stay tuned!
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:23:38
I love that rule of thumb!
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:07:54
For sure. How can we infuse today's energy into a really great cause?
Khan Academy accepts bitcoin.  So does United Way.  Then there's Sean's Outpost, of course.  And BitcoinsNotBombs.com or AntiWar.com
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:17:00
Great feedback ... I am working on this.  If anyone has any contacts.. HMU
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:08:33
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:55:58
I've actually seen this happen before and has been on my mind for a few months. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:24:03
it's fun :) 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:47:29
Interesting.  Kinda really love that. Thank you @_date: 2014-11-06 20:37:31
thank you @_date: 2014-11-06 21:07:51
Hello from ChangeTip! We are working on this for sure.  Where would you like to donate to? We are onboarding charities and want to include the community's suggestions for places we should onboard first.
Thank you for your idea! @_date: 2014-11-10 19:00:58
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:55:26
Agreed - did you get a chance to read my article on it? I would love to start off with a project we can all get behind.  Something we all want to fund, and then really overwhelm them with love and positivity.  Great first use case to show how bitcoin can actually change lives.  
 thank you for taking the time to write to me :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:28:49


Hah, this is a great idea.  Thanks for sending it along - I put it in our feedback channel and I'll share it with the team soon.  Will you keep in touch so we can work on it together? Victoria
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:55:20
We did reach out to CoinDesk and they said no, we are in talks with Bitcoin Magazine about this. I have also asked theCoinFront and a few others.  Any you'd like to see us reach out to?
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:20:58
Awesome.  Thank you.  Writing this down for sure.  @_date: 2014-11-08 07:25:09
Great. 
Yeah, we saw that.  We're thinking of making the minimum tip amount 100 bits to curtail this from happening again in the future... your thoughts welcome...
We have also been hearing a lot that privacy should be the default setting.  Wondering about this, as it detracts from the virality of the product...
YES.  Stats for sure.  You actually touched on our top three suggestions.  So, you're bang on! Thanks for the great feedback Keep it up!
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:06:06
Great ideas.  Standing ovation for you @_date: 2014-11-06 20:25:35
Really love this.   A hug for you.  @_date: 2014-11-22 02:19:17
For sure! I'll do that :) thanks for reminding me.  
Also Nick and I are gong to be doing an AMA soon - would love for you to join in!
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:17:35
We were thinking about this - sponsored emails... say you really wanted to get in touch with some VIP, add a $50 tip to the e-mail...
pros and cons of this! 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:15:31


ok, I am taking this down as feedback for the team.  Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:43:09
best tip I've seen today. 
high five
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:56:29
Working on it... hopefully soon.  I would love that.. and slack!
@_date: 2014-06-22 04:08:11
Happened more like this.
Andreas is talking to someone else at a table full of people.  My friends' table is full.  I go up and kind of interrupt his conversation, he stands, speaks to me, and points me back to another table, full of people from Let's Talk Bitcoin.
Just to clarify...
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:38:58
Awesome, glad to hear it :D
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:50:22
welcome to ze future :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:19:19
Very cool - love how much you've thought this through.  I've made a list of all the feedback and ***'d the top ones (that most people asked for).  Email isn't in the top three most prioritized, but it is still a priority, so stay tuned, and always feel free to reach out @ victoria :)
great feedback @_date: 2014-11-07 20:20:03




I'm not sure about this, but I'll put it in our feedback doc and bring it up with the team.  Good ideas, thank you for bringing them to me.  Feel free to e-mail me as well victoria if you have any other ideas, questions, concerns...
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:59:50
thank you!

Ok, let me bring this feedback to the team. Thank you

Thank you! I actually moved to SF! But I'll still take it ;) mmmmmm cofffeeee @_date: 2014-11-07 19:36:13
That's really, really great feedback.  I will bring this to the team for sure.  Our list of feedback is long, and I love it!

Thank you!! So appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:02:37
Hi there,
Not yet, unfortunately. :(
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:28:04
:) thank you for your support.  It's a community effort. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:35:26
Hey! Thank you! Very much appreciated. 
Kate is such an amazing person, really like her.  She's actually got a full time job, but we hang in SF.  If you're ever in town, hit us up!
Not sure -- do you want to send me some more details so we can look into it for you? Make sure you link your account! Don't make my mistake :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:57:52
Wow, great point.  I love the analogy :) 
I think we are going to settle on 100 bits minimum tip.  Plus it feels nicer than 1 satoshi.  Imagine a newbie to bitcoin collecting  1 satoshi.  Not so exciting after you realize how much it's worth.
Thank you for the feedback! @_date: 2014-11-06 18:03:16
Thank you for the feedback! Really appreciate it.  private

Great feedback. Have noted that down for our team.  Thank you private

great idea.  Taking note.  Thank you @_date: 2014-12-07 09:49:30
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:14:15
Agreed x 187364245
That's the first integration I want to work on, but we have a few others beforehand I need to do as well. Any other recommendations? Some said "Steam"
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:42:02
I can't speak for ChangeTip, but I can speak for myself -- I think a lot of centralization is going on now... I can see it happening.  But there are other platforms and companies that are focused solely on decentralization and who stay true to the ethos of bitcoin, that we read about in the white paper.  I think if we focus on projects we love and support and feel for -- OpenBazaar? Dark Wallet? I know some people like these projects, our tipping culture can go a long way to funding things we care about.
Centralization will always be a way of life... but other options can always be created and funded.  What do you think?
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:33:43
I like your energy! Thanks for putting time into these ideas.  Great feedback.  I agree -- transparency is key, and staying true to the ethos of Bitcoin. 
How do you see us using this incredible momentum to move forward? I am thinking we can branch out into other subreddits, like another Redditor suggested -- etc. and reward them for their awesome content... then slowly spread bitcoin everywhere. 
What do you think? @_date: 2014-11-06 20:42:34
thank you - but it is truly a community effort.  &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:42:47
Haha.  Sweet! Thanks for the love.
Kate works at another business most of the time now! But we still talk all the time.
Yeah, I feel like it's laggy on Twitter... Maybe try it again though? Let me know if nothing happens. 
I am sending everyone cool presents in the mail.  Can I send you one, too?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:10:43
super cool.
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:28:31
(let me know if that tip works :))
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:48:11
Thank you! I am getting used to it :) thanks for the warm welcome
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:55:47

@_date: 2014-11-11 17:43:18
Working on it. :) thanks for the feedback! 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:40:09
I appreciate your appreciation.  It's truly a community effort, however.  WE can't spread bitcoin without each other. 
Glad you are in love with it :) &lt;3 bitcoin -- where do you think we can all spread the love next?
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:17:21
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:19:50
Hey there! Definitely one of our most-asked-for features.  We are working on this. :) Thanks for the feedback!

@_date: 2014-11-08 07:12:13
Hmmmm what platform did you connect to? Perhaps that is how?
Ok, sounds good - let me bring that to the team as well.  We have some other updates coming... I think you'll be pleased.
Thank you for the encouragement :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:56:59
Straw man argument 
@_date: 2014-12-07 09:52:48
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:10:45
I do think that some people using ChangeTip do use it for harm.  I think we saw a bit of that yesterday, and definitely today.  We are speaking as a team about solutions for this problem, without disabling the virality of it and the ability for us to send small amounts over the Internet. 
I think it's also important for us to create or develop some kind of basic tutorial - sometimes I respond to something and wind up tipping the person back.  We are working on incorporating all feedback to make ChangeTip really robust and excellent.  I accept all feedback, whether positive or negative, and am open to suggestions.  We're all in this together, so feel free to send more comments my way.
Thank you! @_date: 2014-11-06 23:56:15
Better yet- x.tip.me... or a qr code that is scannable.
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:38:35
Agreed.  Good feedback. @_date: 2014-11-08 07:14:35
I think we can do wonders with this.  average cost per acquiring users in some cases is like $5.....why not just pay them $1 to try the game? etc.
I think it's such an awesome idea.  Thank you for reminding me.  @_date: 2014-11-06 22:04:57
Now how do we move this onto main Reddit and get non-bitcoiners involved?
@_date: 2014-11-08 07:28:13
We are all in it together!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:49:10
High five for your enthusiasm.   Love it! private
If you ever need anything, feel free to contact me --  or victoria
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:02:13
Will you keep me updated on this, please? I want to get this sorted for you :) thank you victoria as well
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:30:47
good feedback, thank you! @_date: 2014-11-07 21:22:32
It is.  I am Canadian.  Good call, I am now in the States. Soooo perhaps time to update to the federal reserve note denomination? :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:44:03
obvs :D
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:56:13
Hmm.. are they just public now? I'm not very familiar with github...
Sure - I can look into this.  can you e-mail me at victoria and follow up on this with me?
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:23:00
We've had a few comments about this being difficult - I'll take it back to the Devs for you :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:10:40
Love this moniker :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:47:56
lulz. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:11:51
Sooo yes. Feel free to laugh the n00b.  I am new to reddit and forgot to link my account. :( Anyway, everyone is laughing so don't feel bad about joining in - we are reprocessing all the tips today, so everyone will get what I intended to send out. 
Thank you for not reporting me. Yes, definitely embarrassing for me!   This won't be my first mistake, but I promise I'll be accountable and do whatever I can to fix the problems.  Thanks again for bringing this to my attention.  
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:36:57
Thank you! It's exciting to still be in Bitcoin and be working on such an amazing project.  Team is great, too.
I can guarantee you that everyone here is dedicated to ensuring we are secure and safe, and staying true to Bitcoin's ethos.  If there's anything weird going on, know that I will do my absolute best to fix it.  I don't think we have to worry about the co-founders; they're some of the best people I've met in the space (hence why we all chose to work together!)
I think proof of solvency and a good technical solution is key - what are your thoughts on how this can be done? Feedback always appreciated.
That's a cool idea; I will bring it to the team.  Thanks again! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:45:31
Working on it.  Great feedback.  Thank you private

It's ignorance. Consumers of anything should know what they're consuming. "Consuming."

@_date: 2014-11-06 22:05:37
That's a good idea :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:16:38
I'll look for some options for you.  I know United Way and Greenpeace got on board --
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:48:06
Shoudl be alongside twitter share, facebook like, etc. One click love experience :)
thank you for the feedback! @_date: 2014-11-08 06:45:33
Hey there! Welcome!
Thank you for the feedback.
Sooooo if you're asking about tips you've sent other people, they get reminded after a week, I believe.  Then they get back into your account.
Check out here --&gt; my account - money -- you can scroll down and see all tips that are pending, errors, etc. 
Does this help? victoria if you have more questions!
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:17:32

@_date: 2014-11-10 19:19:27
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:20:37
Here's a gold star on me First, I would create some custom monikers -- I like "props", "thank you" and "&lt;3" -- you tie words to amounts. 
Then, tip people, or provide valuable content and collect tips!
