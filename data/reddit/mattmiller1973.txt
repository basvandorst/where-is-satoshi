the revolution really WILL be televised! i agree. love the lakota!
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:05:26
i told betty today!
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:06:34
amen -- good points.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:11:43
dude. it WAS fitty.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:05:46
amen, brother
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:55:55
Anybody apply for this job? Seems like many redditors could do it. Except for same day settlement and up to the minute trading.
We're going to discuss on BTV at 1pm. Other hedge funds already exist with big BTC interest, including Exante.
I hear fortress and pantera are gearing up as well and wedbush Morgan put out a note today...
Thoughts? Please!?
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:57:19
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:07:29
agreed. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:08:58
can and will. i say that all the time. i do wonder if coinbase takes a cut though... anyone know how that works? do they get poiints?
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:58:44
great points all -- what's FUD? the Fucking Us Dollar?
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:03:35
thanks dude -- i always get in trouble when i read the prompter because i like to pull back the curtain a little. actually, i always get in trouble anyway...
donohoe has told us before that he's not averse to digital currencies, and the paypal ceo, david marcus, has long been long bitcoin. 
i wonder about bezos? i suppose i could google it. i wonder about google?

@_date: 2014-10-06 13:19:40
hahaha -- i was referring to the imminent demise of this fiscal house of cards in which we live!

@_date: 2014-06-06 14:03:34
good point! 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:47:00
yes, please explain! the media would like to know
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:42:40
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:11:15
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:32:20
i thought it was awesome. did you think it sucked? those are the only two possibilities for me, as i'm not terribly articulate.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:12:06
i'm using that. can i quote you directly?
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:26:20
very good point, though Dick Fuld is not the best example, since he had almost his entire fortune invested in Lehman just like all of his lieutenants. Jon Corzine is a good one.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:24:50

@_date: 2014-02-26 13:24:20

@_date: 2014-06-06 05:05:15
i also use that analogy.
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:59:35
true. the haters are starting to feel proven wrong.
@_date: 2014-06-06 04:56:58

i think it's a little bit of both, actually.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:47:17
i love this! 
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:10:56
wait, what? you lost me at multipools but picked me up again at pump and dump!
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:45:32
i meant he is lead developer. for some reason, in my mind, that makes him the master. i don't hear much from/about the others that often. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:00:43
i think they are. but remember news is a business too -- there's only so much of it joe public wants to consume.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:04:47
whales are key in low volume situations. like the mining cycle someone else pointed out too...
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:23:10
i used PIZZAFORCOINS -- but next time i'll try GYFT. 
i totally just pain $31 for one pepperoni pizza.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:02:01
i just sent 0.02 btc to some kid on twitter who opened his first wallet. i think the ``fee'' was about $0.0002, but i can't be sure -- i'm not that advanced yet. i don't know how to read the extra information in a transaction...
in any case, my video will be redone in about 45 minutes. they made too many graphics mistakes in the first one. what i have is very very basic, and goes like this (from a page someone sent me: 
1. you need a wallet and then you need to put bitcoins in it (there are four way: buying on an exchange, buying from someone, mining or selling goods or services)
2. then i explain the wallets, which allow consumer to send and receive bitcoins, like a normal wallet, and can work like cash registers for merchants/producers/service providers.
3. then i try and explain private and public keys, and how they meet up to form a transaction
4. then i explain how the transaction is verified and secured by miners.
as i said, all very basic but key tennants.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:21:43
that is a horrible thing to say!
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:26:35
i don't have 15 minutes, bro. people who are intrigued hopefully check it out themselves after. we all know how to use google. 
bottom line, regulation could make or break bitcoin. i expect u.s. congress to be in favor of making it. but they are all still gonna want a piece of the action.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:43:13
so my contribution to this segment was completely fcked up by the graphics people -- i will be doing it again at the end of the 10 o'clock hour. hopefully then we'll get it right. 
but it will be incredibly basic, really an overview for the uninitiated.
p.s. going to my first bitcoin meeting tomorrow!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:38:31
let's just say i'm hoping they'll reimburse me... but it is a blast so far. 
i can't wait until it gets to the stage where merchants take it like e-tix and starbucks cards... mobile payment so easy.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:54:12
isn't it better to describe it as a race? do the miners with the best and fastest equipment win every time?
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:06:59
but only one miner -- the first to provide the proof -- gets the reward, right? and that would be 25 btc plus fees? or the fees always add up to 25 btc?
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:27:39
hahaha -- yeah! last seen: Webster Hall
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:06:11
well yeah but it was SERIOUSLY FUCKING IMPORTANT to the price of BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:18:05
it doesn't matter much if you can buy 413 items on chinese ebay. in fact, i can't imagine that mattering any less than it does. who cares if someone is selling a crocheted oven mitt on etsy for 0.007 BTC?
bottom line is, the government will kill you if you enable that sale as a third party merchant and they catch you. and if you want to buy bitcoin on BTC China, you'd better already have money in there and you've got about three days to pull it all off. they don't fuck around.
the german steueramt and wolfgang schaeuble, the finance minister, have both said they are considering taxing bitcoin sales for fiat currencies. Denmark is also planning an ``amendment to existing financial legislation,'' according to its Financial Supervisory Authority, which could include taxing bitcoin sales the same as the others. 
cringe away.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:39:48
whoa! so i just realized, when I buy a card from Gyft, i'm essentially trading bitcoin for fiat, at least indirectly.
i wonder if they need that too?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:26:49
not if i point that out. but some, like dogecoin, seem based more on fun than schemes. like even though i might buy monopoly from parker brothers for real money, it doesn't mean i'll start trying to use their currency to buy real hotels on park place.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:13:33
thanks very much -- i think i'm starting to get it. i actually think REDDIT might be more complicated than BITCOIN
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:06:23
you got it -- i will tweet from my  acct right now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:18:47

thanks! there is a lot to understand and explore! and eat.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:17:56
thanks -- i see it's up 70% in the last day! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:42:14
actually, wait, are you saying south-east asia because of dogecoin? i heard it's very much pretty than BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:16:02
he wanted to show how it worked, and i was more interested in the product than security. my bad, but i actually love that it turned out that way. better publicity and only cost $20
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:28:17
well now i like you because you're funny.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:56:25
no but i am always wary of giving out my account details. and when i give them to bank america or deutsche bank, that's a little different than giving them to an organization i've never heard of before. i don't like giving my social to fcuking anyone. and i don't trade forex.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:27:08
fuck you! now i have to go and get a haircut. and maybe a nose job...
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:04:28
i just went on fucking television and mentioned how i was getting flamed on reddit this morning so i signed up to check it out and got a lot of help with bitcoins -- from everyone but you because you are an asshole.
how do i block people?
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:54:07
well that's a little different than calling me a liar. but i would answer that in two ways.
first, maybe you're right. i should have better explained myself.
second, my hopes for this currency is that i'll be able to hold my money privately and exchange it quickly without serious transaction costs.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:00:21
total spam -- won't work. i tried. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:03:17
yeah -- i have been talking to him. going to try and get him on the show!
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:51:46
talk to me, brother -- i didn't know you could short bitcoin (even getting fcuked by your exchange). can you do it on any of the big exchanges?
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:24:54
i hope the gov't isn't as able to get involved as it will want, if you lose your wallet aren't you fcuked? and the price is whatever people are willing to pay. there was a bubble in tulips and people still appreciate the flower.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:47:23
i find drugs are best bought with benjamins!
or blue cross blue shield.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:21:31
good point. now that you mention it, i think i SHOULD get an award! 
joining this community has been reward enough.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:24:03
i was thinking about Ferris Bueller's Day Off. you know how many times Ferris has been sick? if you don't, that's because he wasn't sick. he was skipping school...
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:45:39
what are the main causes you're thinking of, that are capable of killing bitcoin? trying to put together a list, but i can only see the possibility of another common digital currency, and maybe some flaw in the code?
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:28:23
hahaha -- troll! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:50:54
thanks! this is very exciting indeed! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:11:52
nice -- i'll tell olivia to go there right away! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:41:38
just to see if i could buy *something* with this.
to be fair, pizzaforcoins.com wrote back and told me they're going to send me two-for-one because they hadn't updated their exchange rate yet.

@_date: 2013-12-17 13:46:33

@_date: 2013-12-23 00:16:58
it has to be a topic i talk about at least once -- i've already said BTC is unhackable. 
i know the others are unbelievably smaller and that ``the network effect'' makes bitcoin a winner. but people are talking about altcoins and i need to clarify the differences/similarities.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:20:57
thank you and, yes!, radio is almost always a better format. it's the way i get my news as well. bbg, BBC, NPR, GD
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:22:07
and i love this argument against altcoins on the mises circle, pointed out to me by Pierre Rochard: 
but what are the great arguments FOR altcoins? easier to mine? easier to use? funnier names?
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:26:04
HANG ON! I called in sick yesterday -- Day 5 -- and i spent most of the day playing Need for Speed: Rivals on Xbox. On a side note, the game rules. i literally played for 10+ hours.
But today is Day 6 and i've already bought a plane ticket on cheapair.com -- incredibly easy with bitcoin! -- and i am now taking steve to a dogwalker in manhattan, while i then slip off to a grocery store in brooklyn, before going out to a bar called EVR. all of those places will be getting paid straight BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:09:13
very interesting indeed! 


@_date: 2013-12-11 22:24:35
hahaha -- classic. bitcoin-bowtie
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:16:36
Wow, dude! This is exactly what i was talking about on air and with  -- so much of this community is altruistic and down with paying it forward, being charitable, being ``kind,'' as Jerry put it. 
I will definitely check it out -- thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:29:58
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:36:36
it is a great group -- i gotta get more into this REDDIT thing. i have interviewed Alexis Ohanian before, and he is a boss, but i never got any further than reddit gone wild.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:29:45
i just tweeted this &gt; all the pain in buying Bitcoin is caused by the banking infrastructure and relieved by Bitcoin itself.
love it! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:06:52
amen, brother
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:59:14
German Finance Ministry has said while Bitcoins are neither a legal tender nor electronic money, they’re a unit of account and a financial instrument that serves as “private money” for those who accept its value...
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:50:10
what are ``orphan blocks?''

if it's a bitcoin transaction, rest assured alice and bob are involved!
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:22:31
while what you're saying is spot on, i doubt i would have any difficulty now, so long as i could agree on a price. i am going to bitcoin events nearly every day with loads of people who trade them regularly.
the more interesting point, which i find hard to explain to wall st kids, is that it's not all about money, certainly not all about dollar-values. the community seems to have a higher, or at least different, purpose.
like i've said, it's a lot like the dead. if jerry were still alive, he would have a bunch of bitcoins! (showing my age) 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:31:05
yes! i want to cash in on this right away! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:09:41
the minute-by-minute price problem is one that redditors have too. i agree with you, people keep freaking about it.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:28:24
my bosses always think that too.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:30:14
but how in the fhell do you memorize a 12-word stream? in order?
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:36:24
i can't not talk about the price. this is a financial news network -- the price are a big part of the story. i understand that volatility is to be expected, and it will likely smooth out in time, but i don't want to just ignore it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:44:39
yes i am and i just ordered pizzas so come up! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:51:32
very cool to know! thanks
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:00:58
what about jason statham??? or at least bruce willis or something?
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:22:08
this is me -- and i'm glad i'm not dead too! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:24:31
quite a cool place, actually. i didn't hear what music they were playing, but i appreciated the simple, modern design of the bar and they have good liquor. on the other hand, if you want to drink beer, you'll have few choices. definitely a good bottle-service club.
paying with bitcoin is stupidly simple.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:59:35
i don't know that i was criticizing coinbase, i just said i wasn't comfortable giving them all of my data, like SS# and bank acct, etc. i'm not comfortable giving that information to anyone -- especially over the internet. as it is, i did give them everything, but i still wasn't able to trade instantly because i only use MC and AmEx -- they want a Visa. In the end, i used a blockchain wallet and got coin from a friend.
In any case, Coinbase boss-investor Fred Wilson is coming on our program at 4:30 to discuss.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:28:40
if i use a plain old blockchain.info wallet i got for free, is that unsafe? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:24:09
i cannot WAIT for this to happen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once banks start using bitcoin to replace ACH transfers between each other, things get really interesting.
wiring money between banks accounts has always proved costly and frustrating for me, not to mention slow as hell. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:24:03
i didn't even see the comment before i verified the tip! i am not yet a reddit master -- i see most of these comments/tips when i click on the red envelope in the corner. 
it is a little weird for someone to give you something and then tell you to give it to someone else specific, though, isn't it? i will give it all away to other people trying bitcoin and check out sean's outpost as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:50:47
i would also argue that bitcoin is a work of art as well. a labor of love. even if it were worthless, i'd rather have a bitcoin than a tulip.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:01:04
when i figure out the tip bot, i will talk more about it -- thanks for the Big B little b clarification!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:05:53
i never research before i buy -- it's a fatal flaw. i'm an impulse buyer.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:40:20
i'm no sure what you just saw, but all i'm doing it buying a bitcoin and spending it. so it took me forever to figure out how to get a bitcoin and i had to sign up on like three different websites and many asked for my bank details and the people i tried to buy it from directly didn't have it or wanted too much over the mtgox price or they wanted me to deposit the money before i got the coin i mean... it is pretty sketch as an outsider coming in. wish i'd gotten on reddit earlier but i didn't know much about this either. my web knowledge goes slightly past google to twitter and stops there. i still don't really get what a ``meme'' is.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:56:50
i'm always too rushed. but i'm starting to get the hang of it. people here have been incredibly helpful.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:05:00
how do i ``like'' comments on reddit?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:32:31
i appreciate your screen name (especially as an reply to a post by ironicalballs). is that a thing? bits4tits? please say yes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:46:00
thanks -- i'm trying  to figure out how to use GYFT on my iPhone now. i think i may have to dump it for an android...
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:06:38
i'm going on BBG radio right now as well
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:51:09
thanks very much -- this might make a great topic for one of my days. getting an offline wallet, why i need to, can i transfer? 
it makes me wonder all sorts of things -- who has the most bitcoin? where do they keep it? how many bitcoin millionaires are there? can they better avoid giving money to the man?
what a fcuking FUN topic. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO DO THIS???
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:47:51
holy awesome! thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:53:49
it's coming! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:22:45
wow, no lie. you are a troll. here on the VAT:
and while i'm sure you can use bitcoin in China, if you don't understand what's going on there, you're an idiot as well.

oh, Ronex, me want!
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:10:40
very good point! the dream is that one day everyone will accept bitcoins for goods and services and that we will no longer think of their dollar/euro/yen equivalents...
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:02:15
ok, i will mention my REDDIT helpers and you, specifically, in my next hit at 11:45 on Bloomberg TV -- COLSATRE?
i am now going to attempt to order my first PIZZA with bitcoin via pizzaforcoins.com -- i'm kind of stuck on the payment page but i think i can figure it out.
 -- thank you very much! it apppears you're trying to give me bitcoin, but i'm such a REDDIT and bitcoin newb that i can't figure out how to pick it up...
ANY SUGGESTIONS? I'LL BE DOING THIS ALL WEEK -- MAYBE FOREVER!

it's day 9, bro. and our viewers are the same people every day!
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:05:21
i am not talking about the situation currently, rather the situation as it is likely to be -- hence germany is in yellow. 
statements from the steueramt and from schaeuble lead me to believe ze germans will eventually tax buyers of bitcoin just as they tax buyers of software. 
also, BaFin has to license anyone doing a commercial transaction in bitcoin. ich weiss, ganz genau wovon ich rede. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:23:58
a-HA! thanks
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:49:57
i couldn't agree more: 


i think the media focuses too much on the day to day, week to week, or month to month price value, when this is something that should be thought of in terms of decades. at least in this early stage.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:13:01
it is a bit confusing -- thanks for any help! 
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:37:48
except he says you can transfer funds from a to b and there is no record of where it came from. every time you do a bitcoin transaction it not only brings with it record or where it came from, but record back all the way to the very first transaction ever, to the genesis block. 
for the IRS, it's a dream come true.

again, the difference is familiarity and trust. i have been using deutsche bank for 20 years, my father used it before me and his before him. the same is true of my bank in columbus -- it's been there for many years, my family has been using it for generations. i only heard of coinbase last week.
i would also like to limit the number of institutions that have this information, and the amount of times i send it over the net.

I bought my Spanish girlfriend a plane ticket to come and visit me in NYC. Also bought a couple of box seats to the John Mayer concert at the Barclay's Center. And I got a little Christmas tree. But the best thing I've bought so far has probably been a six pack of IPA from the bodega in Ft. Greene, Brooklyn. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:43:23
where can i get one of those coins? i'm in the media, i'm long real bitcoin, and even i don't know where to get a prop!
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:40:30
i agree, sort of. it would be better if it were less volatile, especially for people who live in less stable currency regimes and need a steadier store of value. bitcoin isn't that important to wealthy westerners right now, but it provides real help to those living in the third world and southern europe.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:19:18
suh-weet! it's like i'm at an early Dead show!!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:40:25
this is very interesting shit -- i'm on it! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:16:53
a miner gets 25 BITCOINS per block? i want to mine in that case.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:28:08
would have been highly likely.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:37:51
freaking AWESOME! 
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:39:59
thanks so much -- great info! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:46:44
i will talk about that probably tomorrow when we look at the mechanics.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:34:37
that makes it MUCH easier! thanks
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:12:48
i like you and i like bitcoin too, but it would be a little weird if i came over to you and said, ``here's $50, go give it to wounded warriors.''
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:40:09
you are a skeptical group for sure! but i've been talking about the REDDIT community in the past two hits i've done, plus i tweeted about it.
now i will check out your link -- thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:50:09
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:58:05
we are putting together exactly such a map for tomorrow's broadcast. day NINE of the ``12 days of bitcoin!''
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:25:52
can i still get on SILK ROAD? i want LSD! ;)
thanks so much for all your help. not only am i a bitcoin newb, but this is my first time on REDDIT too. this is like the old bulletin boards! love it
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:35:29
Fred Wilson from Coinbase is going to come on and talk with me about this at 4:30pm EST -- definitely will be clutch to clarify that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:37:17
holy shit. so coinbase and bitpayhad to go through all that crap? or just people operating exchanges?
ahhh, that's why coinbase swears it's not an exchange!
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:19:48
mike hearn talks about it here: 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:08:31
i think that's the same case for everyone. i have yet to meet someone who has really educated himself on bitcoin and is not convinced of the story. the only problems, as i see them, are regulation and the possibility of an alternative to bitcoin becoming more popular.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:15:05
GREAT idea! we will definitely try this
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:53:31
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:06:07
communists gonna hate, bitcoin is ultimately about freedom.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:01:31
my purpose isn't to promote bitcoin, i am trying to report on it. though i do believe that once people learn about its benefits and see what it is, they will look past teething problems like this current volatility and embrace it in one way or another.
and the answer to your question is: no stock!
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:33:14
working now -- but you can't buy gyft cards with bitcoin *inside* the app
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:23:34
thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:52:30
haahahaahaha -- i have thought of it exactly the same way. except i am taking tom from the darkside!
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:51:47
we could have talked a lot more, but the producer was in my ear, yelling at me to ``Wrap! Wrap! Wrap now!''
i need a more relaxed forum for this sh!t.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:59:36
i have been thinking about it this way for sure, and it has been explained to me in this way by smart kids like Max Raskin. but i'm pretty sure older people -- there are exceptions to every rule -- won't get it. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:58:08
barry tweeted me this morning! i'm probably going to fall in love with bitcoin and end up as an activist like dylan rattigan with OWS.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:18:57
amen, brother. amen
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:32:48
so is this the price you guys all use? i wonder what price blockchain.info uses?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:24:29
i will definitely point out that they MAY NOT HELP THE CAUSE. and that most of the big-money people i've met getting into bitcoin obviously don't feel the need to trifle with the others. indeed i think one of the guys running coinbase started litecoin (is that right) and he's obviously thrown in with the BTC crowd.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:23:05
A. I was kidding (hence the winky smiley face;))
B. Is buying LSD really illegal? ;) (see, kidding again)
C. Mainstream media mentions things like silk road because they are *amazingly* interesting to mainstream people. Probably to all people -- what a fascinating drama.
D. When we get stories about big banks laundering money for crooks, like those that you mention and so many more, we go to fcuking town on them. They are awesome too.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:11:19
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:55:21
thanks -- it's amazing how welcoming this community has been!
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:39:58
thanks! i am by nature someone who wants to learn and yearn for better systems, but many others are simply too lazy or resistant to change, and willing to accept the status quo, no matter how flawed. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:15:01
haha -- YES!!! so freaking classic but also a GREAT lesson in bitcoin security! you can keep the $20 -- well earned. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:33:58
oh my god! they actually gave me three for one, and the office devoured them. good first purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:38:03
i did not lie, RandomMuthafucka, i was describing the process for ``Instant Verification'' on Coinbase.com
 Verify Bank Account
 Verify Credit Card
 Verify Phone
 Verify Identity
Within ``Verify Identity,'' you are asked to give your Social Security number, RandomMuthafucka. i didn't want to share this information, as i only share it with my employer, trusted insurers, and banks that i have used for decades, and that my family has used as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:40:32
we did find this list: 
so we know Australia, Belgium, Canada and France are fairly definite yesses -- a testament to their love of actual freedom.
not so clear in Deutschland oder Amerika.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:34:31
thanks to all! i really appreciate your help through all of this. this community could have been offended by my very green and newb ideas, as well as exclusive and closed to outsiders. But instead most of the people on reddit have been open minded and polite and, most importantly, willing to share ideas and knowledge. the best part is, i was able to basically make this series almost a reddit-interactive piece! so thanks and merry xmas!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:17:23
hahahaha -- we don't do that! i'm 40, anyway, and this is a free country, right?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:45:52
i found many people advertising coin for a price they later weren't willing to take, or people advertising coin they didn't have.
on thursday i'm going to a meetup called Satoshi Square!
