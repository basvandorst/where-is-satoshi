Viva BitCoinLand ... Easy to enter, difficult to leave, just too much going on, way too much fun to leave. Bit tiring it being 24/7/365, but that's half the fun, the sun never sets on BitCoinLand !

Thanks, great article.
Bitcoin is just too functional to suffer long term damage, the price, well that's what grabs the headlines.
I've seen the Bitcoin community in action, truely amazing. 
The people are the strenght to Bitcoin and Bitcoinland, the price of Bitcoin, well that's irrelevant.

Thanks I got one of those mails, looked dodgy, so ignored it. Nice one cheers for confirming it so so quickly.

Mmmm, the 10's give a little bit of an issue, I need to sort out customs, last time I got some through got hit with duty &amp; handling charges on the silver coins. 
I think they're out of stock at present, but will be getting more in at sometime. With luck should be able to work out a decent a price &amp; fast shipping.
