They provide privacy with the exception of a single circumstance:
You're breaking the law, get caught, and a court order issued by the province of BC is presented to Hushmail.  All of this is in their TOS. 
People's expectation of privacy has gotten out of hand. Businesses have to comply with the law, or else they don't exist.  Is that so unreasonable, that Hushmail comply with a legally binding court order?  People have assumed because of that, they're buddy buddy with the NSA.

Uh, sorry, but this sounds kind of fishy. Your account was disabled for a TOS violation **OR at your request**.  The login message you received also says that. 
What's more likely here? Hushmail disabled your account for a TOS violation, and then suddenly it magically worked? Or you just deactivated it yourself (as your screenshot says) and forgot, then simply asked to have it reactivated?  You even said you spoke with them.  Details of that conversation? What, they got scared, and just removed the flag, and gave a TOS violating user access again, because you sounded tough on the phone?  Why would your account be suspended for a TOS violation, and then they'd just remove that for no reason at all?  There is something missing from this story. 
This doesn’t add up to me, sorry. Sounds more like user error.  Luckily for you the circle jerk hate for Hushmail around here is ready to chime in, rather than use a little critical thinking and evaluate this story logically.
