This is the biggest reason i tell people the current price of bitcoin might not be a bubble. Until it is at comparative levels of gold's market cap it is still cheap!

Yup i wanted it to drop so people would shut up about it going to drop and corrections are healthy for any market.

The actual price of what gold would be if it wasn't being used as a store of value and only as something to make jewelry with is a fraction of what it's price is now. Bitcoin is taking over that space. So its price should actually be alot higher and it will get there.

Everything and anything that happens justifies it. Every time another person joins coinbase or another big company announces that it is getting involved with crypto or a government shows that it will act favorably toward bitcoin/crypto that's what gives it it's value. 
Its not like a company where they have to keep making innovative new products to show the company has value all bitcoin has to do is show that its going to be around and its looking like that is happening.
That's why it is either worth zero or millions. Everyday its having more money poured into it and that will continue to happen until its at the level of other stores of value like gold and its not even close to that.

This is the definition of a bubble.
"trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value."
The price hasn't exceeded this. Either bitcoin is worth nothing or it's worth hundred of thousands or millions. Bitcoins Value is determined by looking at if it is being adopted and because it is a better system bitcoin is looking like it will be adopted.

Yes this is easy to argue against. The adoption that it is at is not close to what it will be. Gold the thing we use to store value now is at 9 trillion. Bitcoin is only at 3 billion. Bitcoin will take over where gold is now bitcoin will be hundred of thousands of dollars soon.
It a better system to humanity. And humanity is pretty good at utilizing and adopting a better system. Bitcoin will be used as a store of value instead of gold and then we can still sell the stupid amounts of gold being horded for jewelry.
