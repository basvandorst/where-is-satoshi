I like how 11k feels low already

I can easily see a future where most people only do LN transactions and the on chain transactions are used for large settlements. Seifedean Ammous explains it best. Kind of long but worth every minute.

This guy cannot stop talking about Bitcoin

I think it's a cool concept for an "event", but if you already realize that you have coins on an exchange, I wouldn't leave it there just so you can participate on January 3rd.

We're going right back over 9000, aren't we?

Because there is a middle ground between "spend all of my money today" and "take all of my money to the grave".

He was expecting everyone to say hear, hear!

Having a few big blocks once in a blue moon isn't really "testing things out". Consistently having huge blocks and seeing how that affects the network would be a real test.

Bitcoin just loves to dominate in the 69 position, huh?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:08:33
Here we go, gentlemen! Hodl on to your asse(t)s!

What the hell is this? Upvote.

Cool beans!

I need someone to hodl me

All your Bitcoin are belong to us
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:32:19
Yeah, I was expecting it to start 6 months before the halving!
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:51:31
I for one would love to see the Vegeta meme one last time...
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:02:46
We missed you 11k
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:33:21
I have a feeling this guy gonna sell ��
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:13:40
Ah, reminds me I need to get that done too. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:48:20
And we are going to be exceedingly good at it!

So you'd be able to deposit BTC, sell for USD, and then transfer to bank account?
@_date: 2019-09-29 00:52:20
I just realized we get to see the Vegeta meme one more time! \*cries in Saiyan\*
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:09:38
Thank God for all those BTC labels. I would've forgotten what chart I was looking at.
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:15:28
It was actually Vegeta reading Goku's power level of over 9000, so it should really be Goku training lol.

The real question is, why is Alice paying Bob nearly $8000?
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:04:42
On the bright side, you get to enjoy Vegeta memes so...
