Because they don't know anything about Mt. Gox, Right now no one actually does. What is probably going to happen is that in 24 hours Mt. Gox and Mark Karpeles will vanish from the face of the earth.

I have never used coinbase myself (not in the US) but I've never heard anyone say a bad thing about them and its the most reputable exchange around at the moment plus you can buy BTC instantly. Maybe you got confused about people warning not to store BTC on Coinbase because recently a bunch of BTC got stolen from users who got there accounts hacked.

This is probably a hoax but if its true kiss Mt. Gox goodbye and the price is going to crash hard for the foreseeable future.

Coming from people who are willing to take a risk and buy cheap BTC from Gox users in the hope of making some money when Gox opens withdrawals again.

Probably. Unless they just disabled trading to implement a fix then its a great investment for the people who bought.
