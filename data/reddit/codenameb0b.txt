I think both dashed lines are public perceptions of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:55:43
Thank you again! My hope was that people would google it, or at least engage by asking what it was. I learned of bitcoin in 2011 and even spun up a node, but I abandoned it until a lead called and asked me if I knew what it was back in September. On his advice I finally signed up for Twitter and Reddit and I feel like I jacked into the hive mind. The last 100 days has been drinking from the fire hose as I try to catch up. There aren't many agents in my local market that would make the time to do that so I like my chances here. The reality is crypto is just so massive, and it takes time and a lot of critical thinking to have an informed understanding of what it is, and exuberances like "to da moon" and endless memes (which I love and collect) can be off putting to someone new to the space. When core developers are saying they still don't feel like experts after years of working with it, I can't expect real estate agents to grasp it in one post, but at least it's a counter to the willful ignorant calling it a bubble. And it might be a bubble, but if nothing else it's a new kind of bubble. It will only fail if it needs to fail, some new bitcoin will take it's place if and when it does. **again, thank you so much for taking the time to give your feedback**

So what if you submerged them in a non-ferrous fluid that connected to a boiler system that heated an efficient house as well as a driveway and sidewalks? Would a tank of ten heat the fluid to near boiling?
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:07:43
It’s a 7000 sq ft house in the mountains, with a big driveway, and sidewalks and stairs with pipes running through them. Even in the summer you could dissipate heat through the concrete at night. Just have to figure out a bypass on the boiler that would switch between the mineral oil and water when needed

You can, but according to my title company you can't get a title policy on the transaction. My guess is an attorney can probably bless the deal.

I have the same problem, no idea how to get the server running again. I blame the crippling effect of being raised on Windows
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:50:01
I'd like to thank you all for your assistance. The user error was downloading the wrong version from bitcoin.org. Once I had the right version I copied bitcoind and bitcoin-qt to /usr/bin and whadaya know. Thanks again

As so often happens, the problem goes away, and a new one appears. Everything is running, but my connection to localhost port 8080: Connection refused, no matter what node I try to connect to, including the one I had connected to previously. Probably a simple linux fix, the conf files all look correct

/home/yqia/bitcoin-core/bin/bitcoin-cli is where I found it with that command.
 Copied everything from /home/yqia/bitcoin-0.16.0/bin/bitcoin-cli
into that folder, but BTC-Core still says .15 after I started it
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:04:31
I ran that command and only one line was different from above: lrwxrwxrwx 1 bitcoin bitcoin   24 Feb 18 11:43 .bitcoin -&gt; /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet
i have testnet instead of bitcoin. I created the bitcoin user but I get an error that bitcoin is not in the sudoers file again

I think I needed to add witnessaddress, I’m trying that now. I got new coins. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:51:47
I did try that command before nuking, I got a no such file or directory error. Also, I have an ActionTEC router that doesn't give me the option to use a lower number for my static IP so I used the default it had, and I couldn't name the services as you did (Lightning, etc.) Any issues there, as long as I use the correct port numbers? It does ask for this info: 4. Enter the remote port and IP information, and I can choose a specific IP address or all IP addresses, I chose all on the first iteration, is that correct?
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:54:52
This step is instructed to be done while logged in as user "bitcoin", but when adding that user there is this statement:
"Adding the service user “bitcoin”
Bitcoin Core will run in the background (as a daemon) and use the separate user “bitcoin” for security reasons. This user does not have admin rights and cannot change the system configuration."
Can "bitcoin" change the configuration file? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:37:04
I'm starting over from the beginning, once I get through to that point I'll use that command to verify the link. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:33:43
Ok, I copied the blocks and chainstate folders using WinSCP, took about six hours. Some issues I ran into:
- I don't have an lnd service running. I used your guide and set up eclair. I have no lnd conf file to configure
- this is what I get on the debug log, says I need to rebuild my index?
I have a feeling I should nuke it and start over at this point?

Thanks for the quick reply! I'm pretty new to this obviously and I've probably compounded a couple of errors and need to start over.

Third iteration, still get permission denied on this test.file command. I'm having trouble with this step: 
Now, the configuration file for bitcoind needs to be created. 
$ nano /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf  
[ Directory '/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin' is not writable] is what I see when I run that command
I don't have permission to write anything there, and I don't understand if I'm supposed to write something there. The next step is the rpcuser and rpcpassword block, is that what is supposed to be pasted into bitcoin.conf? This whole portion has been a block for me, any chance at some clarification for a noob on what is supposed to happen here?
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:08:58
I'm so new to Linux I didn't realize I could SSH from my linux machine to the pi - crashes are a thing of the past, and I can copy-paste addresses etc. - not easy being a noob.

From the guide:
The “eclair-cli” client script needs to be installed.
$ cd
$ mkdir bincd
$ cp eclair/eclair-cli bin/
$ chmod +x bin/eclair-cli
Does that "cd" need to be on the end of bin on the mkdir command?

@_date: 2018-02-24 22:24:13
I was able to add a second channel to NORMAL after adding more coins and sending them to a segwit address. Am I right in assuming that the channel stays open even after my wallet is locked again after you have reached this state?

ELI5? I'm new to linux and I've been googling how to do this but the directions don't match what I see - I'm using qt and I've seen instructions to just overwrite my bitcoin-qt file but I don't have that specific file name when I search for it. I've downloaded and extracted the files from bitcoin.org
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:30:27
Hi, I'm at the part where the configuration file for bitcoind needs to be created. I change the node name, and the password, hit ctrl + o and then enter, I get "Error writing /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf: Permission denied. I'm in my bitcoin user and don't know how to get the right permissions. And while I'm in my bitcoin user and try to shut down I put in my password and I get: "bitcoin is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."  Any ideas?
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:57:22


Ok, back to configuring the bitcoind file, and running the command above gives: touch: cannot touch '/mnt/hdd/test.file': Permission denied
I'm logged in as bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:40:49
No, it's in /.bitcoin, and in my installation there are three folders: blocks, chainstate, and database, the bitcoin.conf file is there with wallet.dat and other dat files, but no bitcoin-cli. I installed through the CLI. So I don't know what I have going on
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:56:24
Wow, learning so much. Added the witnessaddress and sent my coins there, got connected and opened a channel, waiting for status Normal and the pi freezes AGAIN. Maybe enabling the swap file is the solution? Will it degrade the SD card that fast? Opening the lightning testnet web page kills all the memory
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:29:52
I have one channel in Normal state, my first one, and I haven't seen another one get there yet, though I've connected and opened a channel with a dozen or more. I have about 3.5 testnet coins in my wallet 
I saw on github that:
Eclair needs a synchronized, segwit-ready, zeromq-enabled, wallet-enabled, non-pruning, tx-indexing Bitcoin Core node. This means that on Windows you will need Bitcoin Core 0.14+.
And in my log right now there were a series of pruning returns for shortChannel ID's - I'm shooting in the dark here : )

 I think you’re right, I tried again today and the payment was instantaneous on Starblocks
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:30:11
The seller wanted proof of funds, and was a long time friend of mine which helped. She's one of the most successful Realtors in town and had never heard of BTC. I brought my laptop to the inspection and showed her a watch only Electrum multi-sig wallet that my buyer had put $2.5m in. This was around 10/8 and it had ballooned to $3.3m by the time she saw it. Cap gains tax I left to my buyer to deal with, but it was going to be six figures
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:19:51
Everyone here has probably tried to explain how BTC works as a store of value to someone who has never heard of it - now imagine you're trying to get them so comfortable with it that they will accept the magic internet money for their multi-million dollar house. I don't see that happening on a broad scale for a while. But, at least in the area I work, if you want to buy a home with BTC, I got you covered, fam.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:37:48
No question this time, just wanted to say thanks Stadicus, I've successfully started the bitcoin service and it's downloading. Learned a lot about Linux and had fun, though it was frustrating at times - big surprise! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:06:26
You would certainly need a forward thinking lender. The first thing that comes to mind is setting up a multi-sig Electrum wallet with the lender as one of the signatory's, that holds some amount of coin that satisfies the lender. You wouldn't be able to move the coin without their consent, nor they without yours. And you hold the private keys. If BTC crashes there might be the equivalent of a margin call, but we all know that's not going to happen, amirite?
With the standard disclaimer that I'm not an attorney, lender, or title escrow officer, and you would be insane to take financial advice from me.

@_date: 2017-10-31 17:41:50
Great question - I can tell you my buyer has been in crypto since the white paper and he has analyzed it backwards and forwards. I am going to put this to him. He has told me from the beginning HODL for ten years, but it could go to zero, maybe he wants something IRL just in case.

Bitpay’s introductory offer - my buyer was pretty shrewd in the negotiations. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:53:38
In Utah it has to be US dollars wired from an FDIC institution, so there wasn't much to distinguish this deal from any other currency conversion deal - only because this title company is forward thinking enough to know BTC has value and agreed to set up a merchant account. I'm working on getting this to our local paper, and will link it here when I do. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:49:12
We are singing from the same hymnal, I'm exploring ways to market this unprecedented opportunity. I was the third agent my buyer called and the first to know what crypto is. I'm open to your suggestions good sir!
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:49:03
When BTC went from $4300 to $6300, we withdrew from that deal to pursue the first choice that we closed on Friday. By this time we had a title company that set up a merchant account with Bitpay - I had tried three other companies that all thought I was running a long con with the magic internet money. So on the next deal we never mentioned BTC, just said our buyer was in commodities and we'd go hard with the earnest money in 7 days, so they didn't care about proof of funds. They still don't know it was BTC. Title Co sent an invoice to buyer, buyer converted on a Monday and Bitpay wired the fiat the next day, less their .5% conversion fee. We closed the following Friday, one week early because there was no reason to wait at that point 
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:14:14
My node isn't visible, I've had one normal channel for several days now, and I just added three more today. I'm connecting through a VPN so I would expect to see it in the area where the connection is?

Thanks, I think I’ll sit back and see how the bugs get worked out at this point. It was definitely worth the effort and I appreciate all your efforts. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:02:17
That would be ideal, but you really get the sense of how little bitcoin is known IRL when you try and get a title company on board. I didn't know how it was going to happen at all until I saw this story and tracked down who they were going to use for the title company:  Even then, they hadn't put their merchant account in place at Bitpay and it was a nailbiter until we got that set up
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:25:46
Converting triggered a taxable event, so in real estate speak, our earnest money was going hard as soon as we converted. Capital gains tax was a major factor in our negotiations - we had to have a locked down, closed ended contract before we converted. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:15:08

Relative to where it is and where it has to go, real estate without a doubt. The crypto boom has room. Park City is a distorted market, the Olympics in 2002 pushed us over the edge, and now money is flying in from all over the world. We aren't seeing any of the markers from the 2008 crash here yet, and half of our sales in Summit County are cash. Colorado has the terrain, but we have the snow and the access to the airport. Salt Lake City is becoming a tech hub and it's an easy commute from Park City.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:13:46
Once we had a merchant account at the title company, we didn't have to tell the seller it was bitcoin, as far as they knew it was a straight deal. We had to get the house under contract with the personal property inventory locked down because converting triggered the taxable event and we couldn't negotiate from strength - we were buying the house no matter what at that point. Since the title co had all of buyers info AML was covered. During negotiations we just said we were converting from a volatile commodity. The real edge of the seat moment was when we found out the trading desk closed at 2:00 EST Friday 10/20, and we went under contract after it closed. We had a floor of $5650/BTC and had to watch the price all weekend until we could convert at 7:00 AM EST the following Monday. True story, Bitpay just trusted us not to convert while their desk was closed - if we had converted, $3m+ would have just sat their twisting in the wind all weekend until the traders showed up!
