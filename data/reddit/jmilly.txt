Ha! I sold 36 bitcoin for my motorcycle. :(

This is why we don't get to know who Satoshi actually is.

Are you wasting your time? This month has been a tough one for me. Today I'm selling Bitcoins I earned through faucets circa Jan 2012. The combined value is just enough to make rent and maybe buy a beer.. it wasn't worth much back then.

I'm not on the list but I got a spammy pay request: "stroke8dotorg just sent you a request to pay 1.337 BTC (worth $645.74 USD) using Coinbase."

Coinbase, please get your shit together. I have referred way too many first time BTC users to you for these type of scenarios.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:33:46
Great work. I'm following you in Behance now.

You know, I bought a motorcycle for 84BTC and sold about that many to buy other items, fund projects and pay rents over last year. Now I have a quarter of the coins I once had and sometimes I feel stupid when I jokingly talk about how the bike cost me ~$84k. But realistically, I would have spent $3,200 of fiat cash to buy the bike that day regardless of my good fortune with bitcoin.
I try to consider bitcoin a currency over an investment, had my grandfather kept that 10¢ he spent on bread or milk knowing that with inflation it'd be worth much more, I probably wouldn't be here making these observations today. I'm getting paid in bitcoins this month. I am charging a BTC price regardless of the USD cash out value.

That dude in the photo on the left is a buddy of mine. He's got nothing to do with and possibly no understanding of bitcoin. Funny shit.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:24:45
I hope he desung the fuck out of it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:29:55
My bad. I spelled "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" wrong.. fancy that.

It's weird realizing that I have spent more bitcoin than some people (my future self included) might ever own in their lives.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:29:59
To be honest, I think there's already too much misinformation about bitcoin at the moment to allow for April Fool's jokes to be funny.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:23:35
Why anyone would store coin with an exchange is beyond me. Especially given the history of these types of companies. Even in my peak trading days, I only lost about $13 USD in the Mt. Gox and Bitfloor closures.

How do you pay rent?
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:13:00
I love bitcoin because an old 1BTC faucet drip paid my rent in pinch 4 years later.
@_date: 2015-02-17 03:37:56
I figured, I was just curious.
I'm not sure if it's still the case but tenants of 20mission.com are (were) able to pay rent in BTC (with a 5% discount).

He's up all over Brooklyn. Nice enough dude. Met him once at my art gallery in Bushwick.

Meanwhile.. please feel free to use this half-baked web app my brother and I started putting together today: 
Expect glorious feature updates shortly.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:19:27
To this day I regret learning to code. I loathe the fact that I spent my days making easy money instead of pursing my dreams. Now I get paid to do my dream job but work less then my peers who didn't detour in coding.

If you do the proper verification, Coinbase will up your buy limit to 100.0 BTC a day.

Thanks for your response. I'll keep my eye on it.

Coinbase has restrictive limits but I have sold about $8k worth of BTC to them so far with success.

Thanks! We're very open to new feature suggestions should you have any.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:04:45
So that's how this works! Nice!
@_date: 2013-02-04 23:01:26
I use Coinbase and I have had nothing but fantastic experience with them.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:12:12
I think you've done an acceptable job keeping the forum together. Kudos on your continued work. I know there are more complainers than grateful people and that crap isn't easy.
@_date: 2013-07-11 23:02:46
Update to this: I got my coin ~25 minutes after ordering.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:04:16
If anyone cares, I do video production in the New York and Bay areas and have and will continue to accept and use coins.

Blockchain is great I have a wallet with them. If you're interested in buying BTC, I highly recommend Coinbase. They are a reliable service with a great UI.

I'm not sure how I feel about a flammable cold storage wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:52:10
Exactly my point. So, waterproof is the only enhancement this method of storage offers over paper? Why not etch onto metal sheets or something? It'd be lighter and more durable. I'd hate to loose bitcoins to termites.

I want a tip from you, I really do... But if you're gonna throw some coins away today, might I recommend Sean's Outpost?
