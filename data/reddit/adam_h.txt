Wait I'm actually on time?

Mint should allow you to track a BTC amount using just a public address imo

It's so easy to get caught up in the day to day news. I often forget how far bitcoin has come in such a short time. It's pretty damn exciting to think of what the next 5 years will look like! Thanks for sharing :)

Awesome, thanks. Love to be able to visually process the steps.

Oh wow, colour me surprised.

It's hard to find a good elevator pitch that I can share with non technical people. A bit about why its useful, ie what we can do now that bitcoin exists.

Caught this on the news this morning, the reporter mentioned that BOC is in the business of issuing currency and that they are worried about competition from digital currencies. Also that they are amping up their research in this department and that BOC may one day move to use digital currency technology.
I'm genuinely curious if a central bank could pull off a successful digital currency. My guess is that a lot of people would be willing to put faith in a digital currency issued by a major bank; especially in the early days of this technology, while there is still a lot of skepticism.

"cooked up by Dorian S. Nakamoto aka Satoshi Nakamoto"
Wait.. Do people believe that?

He is waiting till his bitcoin fortune is valuable enough to start his own nation.

Yeah.. 1km = $1,000 obviously.. So more like 384,400,000

I think you're missing the point. People who are receiving money via remittances cannot sit around and wait until neo can spend his bitcoins for everyday things.

Fractional reserve bitcoin banking can be avoided, because anyone can take control and be their own bank. We have no choice with traditional banking services.

This the best way to learn something, by doing! 
Many people get hung up on the details of btc and the complications with buying btc. Your friends well automatically start filtering out details they don't need; they will focus on information that is actually necessary to use btc. (Ex how to start a wallet)
This is a fantastic way to get people involved who have been on the fence or are too busy.

The 12.54 could have been any amount, and he still would have paid .50

I am a bit of lurker around here. As a casual observer of the scaling debate this podcast has cleared up a lot of details. 
Andreas' also adds some much need perspective  which is that there has been a tremendous amount of development happening. Anyone skeptical on bitcoin's progress should have a listen.

So.. Can you link the double spending accusations?
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:30:57
They do seemed to be backlogged. I've been waiting on verification for a while. I couldn't believe how much faster it was to get verified at Vault of Satoshi

It looks like flattr is working on it
