How difficult is it to set a site like this up?
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:27:38
I want to have a site like this for myself.

The Ctr is really low. I can't see the actual ad that you used but I'm guessing you used reddits ad system to get redditors over to this sub? 
Did you try different variations of the wording?

So your saying if we get in early it's a win win for us right?

Where are the users landing on when they click on the link?  Someone should put together a landing page that explains bitcoin and what this subreddit is about.  My idea for the landing page:
* User lands on a landing page about bitcoin
* Bitcoin is quickly and concisely explained without going into TOO much detail to make it as simple as possible. (A user does not need to know all the intricities about bitcoin in their first day)
* Explain how and WHY the rate of the bitcoin fluctuates so crazily sometimes
* Tell them where they can for exchanging bitcoins and buying bitcoins
or maybe a simple 20-30 second youtube video explaining everthing?

Can you clarify the commission? Is it 4% of the total transaction amount?

How long does it take to mine one block?  I see lots of posts taking about miners that cost over $1k, how many blocks can those things mine in what sort of time span?

Sorry for asking a stupid question, but when you mine a block how many bitcoins do you get?
