Which is why it's important we remain vocal and post about onecoin and not downvote - we're making an effort to warn people so when it does collapse fingers can't be pointed at us.

There's a plethora of crypto's out there and I'm mostly in BTC/DRK and usually very cynical with Alts. However, I've been following XST and have been very impressed with the developers no hype just function. I'm certain this coin will reach a market cap similar to Bitcoindark.

What truth? That your negligence caused this? The LBC team attempted to help you, then, once it was apparent that you didn't back up your wallet.dat file they ceased their efforts, as your coins are not recoverable.

Plausible if Bitgo / Kyber / Republic protocol were BS projects however:
Republic Protocol has a working product and one of the most active githubs in crypto: 
Bitgo is backed by Goldman Sachs: 
I’m sure Goldman do their due diligence lol - an exit scam that could only get away with a few million is hardly worth Bitgo/Ren/Kybers time considering the platforms they’re building are actually worth a lot more and WBTC facilities further liquidity on DEXs.
