You should buy some now, with money you can afford to lose, and then you will have incentive to learn about what bitcoin represents and you won't need to ask random internet strangers for financial advice.
If you buy now, the future you will either...
be happy you tried even if you lose, because you participated in the greatest hard money experiment ever.
be happy you made money and know what bitcoin is.

In the past week I have heard about 2 people that went to stores to buy gift cards for the IRS scam, both times the clerk talked them out of it and convinced them it was a scam. I think the best approach is education, maybe offer to put warnings on the ATM's about using bitcoin to pay scammers. You need to convince the police bitcoin is no different than gift cards or paypal for scammers.

Coinbase is fine, I've used them many times. As you buy more and more you can learn to transfer to coinbase pro and save some fees, or use a different exchange like Kraken. Transfer a small amount to your wallet until you know what you are doing, many people lose their bitcoin because they transfer to the wrong address. As you aquire more you will want to get a cold wallet like a Trezor, so take some time to learn about cold wallets.

For someone to have "lost" millions of dollars they would have had to buy millions worth when the price was high and sold when it was low. I doubt this ever happened.

I recently watched one of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos where he talks about people living in poorer countries that send a family member to a richer country to work and send money back. I know a few few people here in the US that work two jobs to send the money of the second job to their family in another country. Western Union charges 15% to wire money. If you can only send $100.00 and WU keeps $15.00, that is huge. With Bitcoin that transfer can be less than $5 or $1. I don't care if I can ever buy coffee with Bitcoin, I do care that I can go anywhere in the world and spend my Bitcoin. It's also sad that if I use US Dollars to buy Bitcoin on Coinbase my bank charges me a foreign currency fee. Banks charge more to let us use their money than most people realise.

You might be right, the federal government created much of the cryptography that bitcoin is based on. They also created much of the backbone of the internet and the GPS system.

selling bitcoin is different than spending it, depending on what is done with it after the exchange, but I agree we need to use it, if bitcoin wasn't used for pizza and drugs on the silk road it probably would have no value.

bitcoin had value the day it was created because Satoshi thought it was a good idea and might have some value to others. Then he found others that agreed and they helped him make it better. Then someone was willing to give someone a product or service in exchange for bitcoin because they felt it had value, then others did the same and the value grew and the number of people that felt it had value grew.

An Option is a contract that controls 100 shares of stock. Not sure how this will work with bitcoin. You can buy and sell options and make or lose money without owning the stock.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:44:10
You can already buy a smaller piece of the pie, Bitcoins are traded in decimal values, you don't have to buy 1 bitcoin you can buy 1/100, 1/1000. They are divisible down to a Satoshi or 1/100,000,000. Dividing a bitcoin doesn't make it less valuable. Once all the bitcoins are mined, scarcity will make the value go up. Rare art is valuable because it is scarce. The dollar becomes less valuable because they keep printing more and it becomes less scarce. If you really want to understand the concept read the "Bitcoin Standard".

A hardware wallet is unnecessary for beginners but its better to learn before it becomes necessary. A trezor can be defeated if someone gets their hands on it, but not if you have a passphrase. If you have enough bitcoin to require a hardware wallet then you should educate yourself on how to use a passphrase, otherwise keep your coin on an exchange. You should stick to facebook until you grow up.

Find a reputable exchange and set up an account, then buy small amounts and leave them there until you understand how to transfer to a wallet. Once you have several hundred dollars in bitcoin then invest in a hardware wallet.

The only way to prevent bitcoin theft is to educate yourself. Learn what bitcoin is, how it works, how to buy and transfer it. Most thefts occur because people make bad decisions, they believe scammers, don't secure their computers from mallware, or trust third parties to protect them.
Take the time to learn...

Passphrase on the trezor is very easy to use and I do use one. And reading through your posts shows how insulting and childish you are.

There are no "lost" bitcoins, every bitcoin ever mined is on the  blockchain, about 17 million. There are an estimated 4 million that are  not spendable or transferable due to lost private keys, but this is an  educated guess because no one really knows if the keys are actually  lost.

If I bought bitcoin from an exchange and then had to wait weeks to move it to my wallet like many have reported, I wouldn't consider that trustworthy.

Buy from an exchange like coinbase, kraken or gemini. or from cashapp. Leave it there while you research wallets and how to keep your bitcoin safe. Depending on how much you buy you can move it to a wallet like electrum, or samurai, or cold wallet like a trezor. Move small amounts at first until you know what you are doing and not risk all your bitcoin in one move.

"not like a stock where you can do a fundamental analysis. It doesn’t provide a performance report that would make you more or less confident."
Are you saying stocks prices aren't manipulated? I agree there is some manipulation with bitcoin but only because its still new and in an accumulation/speculation phase. The fact that it didn't go to zero after it almost hit 20k tells me there is much more to the price than manipulation.

@_date: 2019-02-13 17:11:14
it really doesn't matter what the value of your currency is to the USD.  when you buy bitcoin and the price goes up, the value of your bitcoin will be higher. if you own .2 bitcoin and the price increases 10 fold then you can buy 10 times more with it. Bitcoin is more likely to hold its value, or go up more than any currency on the planet. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:19:42

@_date: 2019-06-17 11:18:25
I think the media will push it as a better crytpo and most people will think its just like bitcoin. I already saw that on CBS this morning with the winkelvi, the reporter asked them if facebook money will put them out of business. Its already difficult to convince people to buy bitcoin over all the alts, this will make it harder. In the end though I think it will prove how strong bitcoin is, I don't think facebook money will last in the long run, it will just be another choice in the long list of alts that don't hold value.

Wide spread adoption will happen because of those that believe in bitcoin, in the technology, in the decentralization and in the trust-less protocol.

You would be safer leaving it in the exchange rather than risking the other methods, there is a lot of risk moving coins when you are unsure. The trezor has a larger screen, you can see the entire key without scrolling, it is open source firmware.

I've used coinbase pro with no problems, but I stopped using them months ago because of all their politics. I switched to gemini and kraken, I have bought from cash app but they sell their bitcoin above market price so it costs more. 
I have heard hodl hodl is good and bisq is good but I have never used them, I have a hard time trusting an individual to sell to me and not scam me. The biggest risk is letting the exchange hold your keys.
I haven't worried to much about selling, I plan to hold a long time, then hopefully use bitcoin directly to buy what I want instead of exchanging is back to fiat.

Central institutions attempt to control it but fail, it is much better to let the market balance itself, whenever an institution manipulates supply and demand it causes unforeseen problems in other places. I don't think bitcoin will replace lending, but loans may be backed by bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't replace credit, though in time it could reduce it.

value, or the expectation of increased value, gets people to trade fiat for bitcoin, once bitcoin is trusted by the majority of people it will become a store of value and fewer people will trade back to fiat. I hope one day to retire and use bitcoin instead of fiat, I don't plan to sell, ever.

Wallets don't store your bitcoin, they are on the blockchain, you can view them on any blockchain explorer.
Paper wallets are difficult to set up and secure, use a hardware wallet. I prefer Trezor over ledger but with either one you can use your seed phrase to recover your coins if they are damaged. Use a passphrase to secure your coin if it is stolen.

It has already been tested, PGP encryption was banned but later found to be free speech, from wikipedia...
Criminal investigation
Shortly after its release, PGP encryption found its way outside the United States, and in February 1993 Zimmermann became the formal target of a criminal investigation by the US Government for "munitions export without a license". Cryptosystems using keys larger than 40 bits were then considered munitions within the definition of the US export regulations; PGP has never used keys smaller than 128 bits, so it qualified at that time. Penalties for violation, if found guilty, were substantial. After several years, the investigation of Zimmermann was closed without filing criminal charges against him or anyone else.
Zimmermann challenged these regulations in an imaginative way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book,[18] via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing to build their own copy of PGP could cut off the covers, separate the pages, and scan them using an OCR program (or conceivably enter it as a type-in program if OCR software was not available), creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitions—guns, bombs, planes, and software—was (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other encryption software, however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).
US export regulations regarding cryptography remain in force, but were liberalized substantially throughout the late 1990s. Since 2000, compliance with the regulations is also much easier. PGP encryption no longer meets the definition of a non-exportable weapon, and can be exported internationally except to seven specific countries and a list of named groups and individuals[19] (with whom substantially all US trade is prohibited under various US export controls).

Why do you care what "self proclaimed" experts say about the future of bitcoin? No one can predict where bitcoin is headed, no one can predict the future.

I bought mine from Amazon, there are ways to be sure it hasn't been tampered with...see the Trezor website
From Trezor Manual
Our devices always come without anything preinstalled, the first thing you will be asked to do once connected to Trezor Wallet is to install the device system - firmware. This is done to ensure that the latest firmware is in place when initializing a new device. Leaving this step to you also enables you to check the firmware legitimacy.

People will learn when they have no choice, when fiat fails as it has in other countries they find alternatives. There is a learning curve for bitcoin but anyone can figure it out. Most governments want to eliminate cash, they will probably start their own crypto but in time it will fail and bitcoin will keep going.
I don't think fiat and cash are that similar, bitcoin is far superior. For small amounts of money, bitcoin can be used with a cell phone wallet. People use apple pay and paypal, bitcoin can be just as easy. If the government stops using fiat and begins using crypto it will be easier to get paid with govt crypto and convert it instantly to bitcoin. Good money pushes out bad money.
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:10:25
Anyone who transfers bitcoin pays a fee. Unlike banks where you pay a fee to have a debit card and a fee to spend your money and a fee to have a bank account, and all the hidden fees...interest, fiat devaluation.
I think its easy to spend bitcoin, its difficult to buy bitcoin with fiat, its difficult to keep it safe, its difficult not to get greedy and want the price to go up, its difficult to trust bitcoin if you don't understand how it works.
Try buying something with gold. 
Confirmations will get quicker in time, adoption will take time, replacing fiat will take time, I think its worth waiting for.

If you charge $20.00 for a haircut and he gave you $20.00 worth of Bitcoin that is your cost basis. If the bitcoin goes up in value while you have it you pay taxes on the amount that it went up.  Tax = increase in value - cost basis.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:46:47

It is that simple, we don't continue to move up because as the price goes up more people are willing to sell and the price goes down. It's all about the ask and bid prices, just like stocks. The supply doesn't increase because the price goes up. Mining is the only thing that affects supply.

bitcoin transfers can take 30 minutes or more, but usually only 10 or 15 minutes.  hopefully that will be faster in the future. I sold some bitcoin and it took 3 days to clear my bank. Last night I bought dinner with a visa debit and today it still hasn't cleared. We tend to think credit card transfers are instant but they really arent, vendors just trust they will get their money so they allow us to use our cards for their service.

The best way to prevent someone stealing you bitcoin is not to tell everyone you have it. Every day I see posts about how much bitcoin someone has. Its as stupid as posting on twitter that you are on vacation and away from home.
There are many great ways to protect yourself, you can keep your keys in multiple places and give up a small amount if you are threatened but this won't work if someone knows how much you have. You can use multiple passphrases that only you know and keep a small amount with no passphrase in case of theft.

@_date: 2019-05-26 17:01:35
yes you can. If you generate the 24 word seed and secure that then no one else will have it. I stamped mine into a titanium plate and locked it away in two metal boxes where no one knows where, (except one trusted beneficiary). Then use a hardware wallet to generate the private keys. The wallet will help you track your bitcoin. You can also use a passphrase that only you know. If someone else has your wallet they still can't take your bitcoin. You can put it in a safe deposit box or a home safe.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:48:21
you can still access your bitcoin if your trezor or leger fail, when you set it up you will get a 24 word seed that you can use with a replacement wallet. Educate yourself on properly storing the seed.

I disagree, bitcoin only needs to be indistinguishable in "perceived value" .
Bitcoin can be fungible and traceable, if bitcoin can be exchanged for any other currency in the world and buy the same product or service anywhere, then it is fungible. As long as everyone agrees on the same value, and trades at the same rates bitcoin is fungible. Two bananas can be indistinguishable but you can't trade each one for the same value, one person may give it more value than another based on how much they need or want it.

you're confusing value with fiat gains and losses. if you buy a car in the US and take it to another country where it is worth more, its value may go up but until you sell it you haven't gained any fiat. Value is just a perception. 
If you buy a rare painting because you like it, but later when you want to sell it, you can't find anyone to pay what you did because no one likes it as much as you, it still has the same value. If you sell it for a loss then you are down the difference in price in fiat.
BTC has value to me for many reasons, the least of which is its cost.

So if you buy a house for 250K and in 5 years its value goes down to 200K did you lose 50K? no you still have the house. Its value only changed against the price. you can get for it at any one time.
If I buy 10 BTC and it goes up in value against the dollar how can I use that increase unless I sell it for fiat? I still have 10 BTC.

Are you asking about a wallet, a miner or an exchange, coinbase is an exchange. You can also use Kraken or Gemini as an exchange.

Please educate yourself on how to buy/store/sell bitcoin before you jump in too heavy. get an account on an exchange and buy a small amount to experiment with.

If they don't understand it they should educate themselves or don't use it. Every usable form of wealth store of value requires a third party and is not secure because of this. If people knew how unsecure their third party protection is they would stop using it. We can't be responsible for educating everyone, they need to come halfway and learn themselves. 
There are some third party protections if you keep your bitcoin on certain exchanges, I'm sure this will grow in time but many have been hacked and more probably will be.
Bitcoin is the first to not need third parties, lets keep it that way and see how it works.

According to Google...'
'Archie was the first search engine, six degrees was the first social media. Many have tried to top Bitcoin but they have all failed.
3 for 3 wrong.

If that is true why did Finney say early on that CSW was Satoshi, and then later say he wasn't, just to help keep him anonymous?

What does traceable have to do with fungeable?

bitcoin and blockchain are still relatively new, there are new wallets being created all the time, just like the internet and email were hard for the average person at first different layers were created to make it easier. There is a difference in putting your bitcoin in an account that you don't own the keys and having someone secure your wallet without knowing your keys. Each person needs to decide what level of security is good for them. One of the problems in trusting a third party is the fine print. If your bitcoin is hacked they will want you to prove you didn't give someone the keys, how much will they insure, how will you be reimbursed.  
People shouldn't rely on doctors, they should educate themselves so they can ask informed decisions about their health and get a second opinion when needed. They don't need to become a doctor but self education is very important.

Banks use fractional reserve and shadow banking to create new money from nothing, making the bankers rich. then when the banks fail governments bail them out with tax money. this can't happen with bitcoin.

Jameson Lopp's website is one of the best resources
Andreas Antonopoulus is very good
Book "The Bitcoin Standard" is good too
and look at the sidebar ======&gt;

I think being traceable will give bitcoin more fungibility because criminals will stop using it when they know it can be traced, then governments and the masses will trust it more. If I buy my bitcoin from an exchange I don't care where it came from, but if I buy from an individual I would care. Cash is used everyday for crime but we spend it anyway, not caring where it came from.
