Same problem here.  I also emailed for support.  Just to be sure, I checked the blockchain and coins are still where they are supposed to be.

Seth: You need to verify your personal details: 
→What does that involve?
→I do not want to buy or sell bitcoins
Seth: It is still required to send out your Bitcoin.
→It was not required before
→I sent bitcoins without it
Seth: You have exceeded the limit on how much you can send without personal details.
→What is the limit?
Seth: I do not know.
→Coinbase accepted the transfer in with[out] ID
Seth: Thank you for contacting Live Chat at Coinbase. I am unable to continue this conversation. If you continue to have questions or comments please contact support Thank you for your understanding. Have a nice day!

I was not using it much over the last 4 months.  I can see that I sent bitcoins in August without verifying anything.  I am not buying or selling bitcoins for fiat - which I would understand requiring ID.

I would tip you but my account is locked :(

You are right.  I do have proper 'wallets' that store private keys, construct and sign transactions, and send them to the network.  Coinbase is now something different in my mind.

Think I will transfer to my ledger wallet.  Keys are then on my keyring.

Had a scan.  Mostly people complaining about 2FA and the process of verification to buy or sell bitcoins.

Its good.  I met Thomas France and the team.  The interface is nice and they are really thinking about how to extend to other formats.  They have an NFC model in beta.

I am not buying or selling fiat.  Show me where it says that they require ID for moving bitcoin in and out of the wallet?  Look below - their own rep could say what their policy was.  I don't mind using a service if it described accurately when you sign up and you are made aware of it.  If it is a bad service I will say it how it is.
