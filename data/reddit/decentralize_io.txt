I have been trying for 2 years to get something going on decentralize.io 
1st a p2p mining pool where the hosting was $2000 per month. Super high end box.
2nd the forum here.
You know its bad when you try and give bitcoin away for signing up and no one will do it.
Everyone has nothing positive to say.
Even in these replies you guys are making.
Bitcoin should be called bashcoin.
Keep in mind like I said I have a succussful business and this is all for fun. I accept bitcoin daily and use Robocoin multiple times a week.
In fact I have more experience in Bitcoin than I am guessing 80% of the people here.
Right now Bitcoin is bad. Plain and simple. 
I have not seen one good thing that the public has embraced with bitcoin.
3 only good things that the public took interest in with bitcoin
1. Silk Road
2. Overstock
3. Soon to be PayPal
Beyond that it has been a complete $hit show.

I have started a few successful companies.
I am an entrepreneur. I know what it takes to get something going.
Unless the whole attitude changes even in these forums it will always be a $hit show. Just look at what is going on.

Actually very fast because of the infrastructure. Very secure because of the DDOS protection in place.

Replaced "Official" with "By The People, For The People".

I will pay 0.01 BTC for everyone who joins and starts a meaningful discussion. Leave address here along with your decentralize.io username.
First one to 500 points via our points system gets 1 free Bitcoin!!
(posts must be meaningful and be unique. No copy paste.)

Nope its all the bashers and the negativity.
As I said. This is not what it was like when the internet started.
* This is all for fun. I own a successful business.

The forum you see there is the best infrastructure in the industry.
"Secondly, many years are put into developing robust and powerful bbs messaging forums, how many hours did yours take?"
Personally none but the company running it has put in years and years and years.

I have 2FA on the domain and its locked. As you can see the site is very fast and secure. Not sure what you mean use both domains to capture visitors. That's like saying google.com should be google.gl.
Maybe I am missing your point or am confused...
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:12:09
I just changed it. More input please.......
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:52:11
Neither is bitcoin talk.
@_date: 2015-05-28 05:30:33
What do you guys want to see on decentralize.io next! ?
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:27:09
Ah no. See below.
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:38:38
I have added a description.
@_date: 2015-05-28 03:50:16
Yes. I should and will remove the "official".
Difference between this and other mediums is this one is run by someone trustworthy.
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:00:50
I will wait on the SEO.
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:09:27
Well guess what. Just like everything else with bitcoin you try and do a good thing but no one is interested.
I took the site down.
Getting pretty sick of bitcoin and I have been in it from the start!!
Great work.!

I am not interested in a .bit domain as I want to run a commission free P2P mining pool here as well....
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:29:59
Man. Just read this whole page and let me know if you get that warm fuzzy feeling of something new and exciting that will take over the World. :)
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:27:04
lol. That's part of the security layer. The forum is overseen by a reputable corporation. It needs to stay that way. An open source solution is just going back in time to bitcointalk.org.
