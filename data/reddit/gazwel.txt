Sir, you have balls to do this. Not sure if I would have taken the risk myself!
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:34:03
Same just happened to me, lucky I have 0 in the account though.

We have been warned since the start about MT GOX, over and over again. You are an idiot for not listening.

Easily replaced if you have £500 to spare, most people don't have that.

Is the lyrics not actually about how he doesn't walk with a limp?
I always thought it was "Hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp".

I thought one of the main points in bitcoin was so we would not have to use paypal?
Paypal is a horrible company with a horrible track record in customer service, why on earth is this happening?
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:46:33
Yeah, if they were open the comments would totally not be hijacked by annoying kids writing "le reddit" and other pointless shit.

The Isle of Man has a long history of corruption, I would not touch it with a bargepole.

What a great Mum, I wonder if she already knew all this stuff or if she taught herself it after Ross's arrest.
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:42:42
That is amazing and Ross must be really proud.

I was so confused reading this until I realised you are talking about a state in the US.

I "literally" just replied to one of the top comments though, so that should tell you I had not read the whole thread at that point.
I am not American so when I see Georgia it's obviously the country I think of first when I hear the name. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:55:16


I honestly cannot believe people can be so naive.  You don't live in a magic country that is free from debt problems.

Why is MTGox needed at all? Blockchain has it's own wallet system and you can send to any address from there.
@_date: 2012-10-02 08:38:47
Check out the pingit bit in the wallet section blockchain website, I use an RBS account and it works fine, much faster than Intersango and MTGox as well. Takes a day to set up but after that it's bitcoins in minutes.
@_date: 2012-11-08 14:32:31
blockchain worked fine for me 2 minutes ago
@_date: 2012-10-15 12:26:27
I have had payments reversed before when I contacted my own bank and told them that I did not get what I paid for. This will be my next step I think, I did mention this in my last contact with Mt. Gox and they asked me to please not do it so I am waiting another couple of days max.
@_date: 2012-12-20 08:29:57
**Our fees are the lowest out there (7.5% over current Mt.Gox prices).**
As soon as I read that I was put off, why blatantly lie like that? It's clearly not the lowest.
@_date: 2012-11-01 11:00:00
It's back thankfully :)

Bitcoin is getting noticed more and more by the masses, people don't trust banks with their money and are looking for an alternative. 
@_date: 2012-10-30 10:46:17
The only place you should be going is blockchain.info. Get the pingit app and you can have your coins in minutes.
@_date: 2012-10-31 16:35:27
I know what you mean, just seems to good to be true. Hopefully it lasts.
@_date: 2012-11-01 21:14:52
Looks good but when I log in I only see pingit and phone deposit options, How do I get this? Sorry if I am being stupid, Thanks
@_date: 2012-10-15 12:17:59
Can someone explain to me why they can't get someone to actually walk into the bank and get the statements printed out? You know, like any one of us can with our own accounts?
I have been waiting since the 7th of September myself, at some point I am just going to ask my bank to reverse the charge as this is beyond a joke now.
@_date: 2012-10-01 18:36:55
blockchain have a pingit option which is easy to set up and use. Had to set this up myself as I am still waiting on a deposit from the 7th of last month from mtgox :(
@_date: 2012-12-25 10:26:44
I used to think paypal is not so bad, they have never fucked me over.
Then one day they fucked me over with selling on ebay costing me a lot of money. Never used it since and never will again.
Fuck paypal.
@_date: 2012-09-14 12:31:01
Sorry, do you mean the posters situation or the situation in general? I deposited 1 week ago into the UK account and still nothing is in my mtgox account, if there is a problem can you let us know please?
@_date: 2012-10-15 12:30:28
Apparently they had problems with that date before Barclays closed the account, what I was told by a customer rep was that too many people had deposited that day and they could only view 300 transactions at a time on their online account. 
I would need to wait until the end of the month when they got their statements, well you know what happened after that.
@_date: 2012-11-01 10:59:39
Panic over, it was a temp issue apparently. It's back people!
@_date: 2012-09-20 14:07:51

By printing more money, would that not make your money worth less and less though?
I am sure Zimbabwe tried this....

localbitcoins.com or bitbargains.co.uk
You can sell by bank transfer and there are some ridiculous prices on there just now so sell it while you can.

Solved my own problem, coinbase is good for this if anyone else searches and finds this thread.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:45:31
Glad I could help :)
