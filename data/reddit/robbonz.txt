Lol! Ok so you have to keep a record of your blockchain for 7 years, and you must report any suspicious transactions in your local blockchain immediately.
Failure to comply will result in confiscation of your local blockchain and Ross Ulbricht style jail sentences, to set an example

You don't understand the Lightning network. There is no such thing as a "Lightning coin". 
These "lightning coins" as you call them, are bitcoin transactions that don't directly hit the Bitcoin blockchain until the channel is closed.
The transactions are between the 2 parties in the channel, and they can be accepted instantly without hitting the Blockchain because they spend the inputs in the multisig wallet.

You're either trolling or dont understand the lightening / thunder networks.
Yes, you can transfer coins used in the lightening network over the bitcoin network. The lightening network runs on top of Bitcoin. The coins are locked in a multisig wallet to enable the lightening transfers.
What your saying is like removing the TCP protocol from the IP protocol. They are both enabling the same goal.

I know this isn't true. Stopped reading
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:52:05
So here's the thing, that caught me and probably a few others out; within months bitcoin went from $4 to $1200. So at one stage you had $1000 on the exchange (nothing to worry about) to suddenly lots of thousands of dollars on the exchange.
I'm sure there were probably people who sent many thousands of dollars of BTC / Dollars to the exchange itself. 
Also remember without all these people risking all this money you would have had no liquidity, and Bitcoin would not be where it is today.
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:44:35
It's great that finally the good news of bitcoin is getting out. Unfortunately he doesn't fully understand it, and this is no more obvious than when he says that the blockchain is the amazing underlying technology, and bitcoin is merely an asset.
What I would point out to anyone watching this and getting the wrong idea - the blockchain and the bitcoin currency aspect are inseparable. The blockchain only works because of the Bitcoin reward to the miners that mine it.

There has been a lot of arguments I've read on both sides in here. I don't feel this is actually an echo chamber, but as soon as you say something like that it downgrades your comment as a whole in my mind. 
What I'm interested in is the scientific process of determining the correct way of scaling bitcoin, this point of the speed of validating a larger block would be a good argument against raising the block size at this point.

Hey mate its easy to get flustered when the price goes down after being up. I've seen it a few times. Shady people will always do shady things.
Everyone has their own valuation of what a bitcoin is worth. The current price currently represents the current mean of everyones own valuations. The price that bitcoin is at right now is what its actually currently worth.
We know this exactly because we have no controls on the value. We cant print more bitcoins. We cant force people to buy or sell. I know what you mean in that people with lots of value in currency or btc can dump or buy a lot, thereby directly affecting the price. These guys actually take as big a risk as any other person buying or selling. 
Currently the bitcoins are in the hands of the few and it does make it easier for these guys to buy or dump a large fraction, but without these guys the price wouldnt be as high as it is today.
Your valuation of bitcoin is obviously a lot higher than the price currently reflected in the markets, and to be honest so is mine. There is really nothing you can do but tell people the honest truth about bitcoin and hopefully it will open their eyes. Regulation to attempt to force the value of bitcoins is going to be counterproductive as it is a step back to the old system.
All I can say is have patience my man. If you're sure about your valuation of btc, then everything comes to he who waits.

A fork to 2MB is not an attack on the core devs. Its someone's idea written as a code example. Forks can be merged into the original repo.
Often the discussion doesn't happen until the fork is created. A discussion about 2MB blocks was not widespread until Toomin created the fork.
I like and appreciate all the work the core devs do, but we do not swear allegiance to the core repo.
By creating a fork you're adding to the discussion in a positive way, because people can look at the actual idea in-code as concrete, and hopefully we can have a real scientific discussion about code rather than personal attacks.

So instead of broadcasting tonnes of small transactions on the blockchain, the signed transactions are sent directly to the recipient, for instant confirmation.
The transactions are all from a shared multisig wallet.

So we're on what Satoashi wanted?
In that case, rubbish, Satoshi hard forked the network himself to fix the overflow bug. 
Satoshi is not saying he's against hard forks, he's saying he doesn't have resources to support a second version.
Satoshi also said the block size can be increased easily with a code example of "when block size is XX increase block limit to XX"
Lets not forget what the blocksize limit was originally added for; "spam protection" being much larger than transaction volumes at the time. Now its intended to be used as a "rate limiter" for all transactions.
The problem here is that when the original limit was added, the frog was in the pan and the water was low enough for the frog to breathe, so with the lid being on, no one was worried at the time. 
Now the water is right up to the top of the pan, and some myself included are wondering how we can give the frog some breathing room, while a more awesome pan extension is being built.

So lets get this straight, if we all move to Classic, we get everything in core so far plus 2MB block size. Toomin can go batshit crazy and start adding random shit into the code, no one is going to use any code they don't want to.
If we don't like what Toomins doing with classic, someone can fork classic and call it Classic-Less-Batshit
If the core devs keep working on core, then we can cherry pick commits that we like and pull them into Classic-Less-Batshit.
If the core devs quit due to hurt egos, then doesnt matter what happens to core.
If core devs accept that the 2MB block size is an OK compromise and add it to core, and/or Toomin is batshit crazy, then we all go back to core.
Lets get this straight, this is the community deciding what features they want in bitcoin by running the code they want to run.
Lets say we all start using 2MB and shit hits the fan, we basically all downgrade to core (or 1MB if core accepts 2MB was ok) and then we all eat our hats, admit core devs were right all along, and stop whining so hard.

But that's just time, not proof of time.
I wonder if there is a way of provably generating a random private key?
If so then you can tell the satellite to generate it and then fire it away from the earth, and use that as your proof of time
Then for someone to steal the private key they'd have to capture it, which would be hugely expensive, and more expensive the further it got away from the earth.

Hey mate, was a bit of a pain I had to compile bitcoin from source, installing all the tools needed. I think I also had to reduce the thread count on the compiler cos it kept having problems.

It's not POW's fault if miners don't upgrade their nodes to accept segwit. Upgrading is a human decision based on what ever information they have available. Maybe they're making money with the current system and don't want to rock the boat?

From someone who's been using Bitcoin long before they had password encrypted wallets, there is much more low hanging fruit and other stuff to worry about than the potential for someone to figure out a weakness in the computers RNG, in which case i'd assume then all forms of computer encryption are compromised.

So after a bit of reading about Nautiluscoin, the only difference between it and Bitcoin (other than a massive lack of security due to the network hash rate behind Bitcoin) is that the owners have pre-mined 1% of the coin which they reckon they can use to prevent the price from fluctuating too heavily. 
Interesting thesis, best of luck, but using it in a production environment without a massive amount of hash power behind it is a super bad idea.

Yeah, I think we all need to treat each other a lot better. If you go to a store and the workers obviously hate their lives, do not shop there.
They're probably stuck in the job paying a mortgage and supporting kids with no other options. All the stores that paid properly and looked after their workers shut long ago because no one shopped there, probably because their prices were a bit more.

You're thinking you'll have this low level control over it, you won't.

The difference is that me and everyone else have been born into a system of IOUs such that we never knew any difference. We were never able to reject the IOU before and ask for the thing that it was backed by. Obviously because fiat is backed by something non tangible. 
Now I do know of the alternative I am able to choose (to some degree) myself whether to hold or accept an IOU or bitcoin. So while it's possible to have a system of fractional reserve we're now able to opt out of it by requesting for the actual coins themselves

I agree with you, a small block size is not ideal, so there is some kind of sweet spot right... a goldilocks zone where the block size is big enough, but the decentralisation is still high enough.
You know if it ever gets to a "the sky is falling" situation with the blocksize, me and everyone else around here are going to install a version of bitcoin that increases the block size.

You show Dave a big stash of your coins that are put in a box and locked with yours and Dave's padlocks, you agree to open the box in 1 week and you can get the remaining coins out.
You can then tell dave that you have paid him tiny fractions of the coins as much and as often as you like, Dave keeps a tally. If Dave needs the total coins you paid him at any time he can open his padlock and he gets the total of what he has been paid, you get the remainder.
As soon as Dave does this, you can no longer pay him tiny amounts quickly any more until you set up another double padlock box

So here's what I think regarding SN's genesis block key;
Satoshi Nakamoto never spent any of the early Bitcoins (apart from to Hal finney). Whoever has the keys to them has still not spent them. 
If the keys were ever stolen the funds would be spent.
Ergo; Satoshi Still has the keys.

I don't think its pointless. I think we need to incentivise miners and nodes.
Wallets and merchants can work a fee in there somewhere if they need to as they are providing a service directly to the end user, however its harder to see where the fee can come from for nodes.

Great article. Interesting part about the utility of the coin and the shared hallucination. I remember telling my buddy back in 2013 that he needed to look at the "value add" of a new coin, rather than just investing in any old coin.
Also as saying that no other coins will come close to the value of bitcoin,  I would be happy if this were true. However using your argument, there can always be a shared hallucination about the other coin, and the value of the coin is essentially the magnitude of that shared hallucination. 
While people will always trade one less worthy coin for another when there is "value add" in the other coin, rather than just being a straight copy, then there is always room for a shared hallucination about the value added. This shared hallucination about the other coin is where the value of that coin is derived from.

So currently you're saying buying power drops and wages stay the same, which puts the onus on the worker to ask for more pay or they lose out.
If it were the other way round, then the onus would be on the employer to try to drop the wages otherwise the worker wins.
You're saying this would cause unemployment, but this depends on how well the business is doing and how many people the business needs
