Why is he offering to give people gold in exchange for useless paper money? Shouldn't he be getting rid of all his useless paper money for as much gold as he can hoard?

I haven't touched USDT as well. But I can't help wondering, if Tethers are created out of thin air, and then used to buy bitcoins, isn't the price of bitcoins being artificially inflated, with way less fiat entering the system than we think? Am I spending hard earned fiat buying BTC while Bitfenix buys BTC using Tethers created from nothing? How much of the price of all coins is being propped up by air? How artificially inflated are the prices?
I may not fully understand this, but I'm also wondering how the price of Tether stays at approx USD 1? Since it's traded openly like all other cryptos, shouldn't the price fluctuate based on demand like all other cryptos? How does it stay at approx USD 1 unless Tethers are created/destroyed in response to changes in demand?
The whole thing is quite fishy and I'm frankly quite worried about my cryptos...

Do the 8-digit backup codes provided by google only restore access to the google account or to all the services that use the Google Authenticator as well?

Hope those who sold at 3000 didn't lose too much and gained some valuable lessons from it. My most painful lesson was during the hard fork plunge in July. Watched the price plummet leading up to the hard fork and thought I'd sell off 2 BTC at 1,900 and buy back at a lower price. Of course, 1,900 was about the lowest it went. I set a stop-buy limit at 2,100 in case it went back up. Turned out to be an expensive lesson. Price shot way past 2,100, the stop triggered but because it was a limit buy, never executed. Spent the next few days watching it go up and up, hoping in vain that it would come back down to 2,100. Never did. Finally bit the bullet and bought back at much higher price. $2,000 lesson learnt: set a stop-buy at MARKET, not LIMIT.

Yea also with sell. But at least if the sell order fails to execute, you're still hodling. Unwilling hodl, but still.

Worried about this as well. I would imagine that if bitcoin were to be a currency for daily use, most non tech people will just use a mobile wallet. Which can be lost or hacked. How many people would really know how to store their bitcoins offline securely, or even want to be their own bank? Seems like too much for the average non tech person.
