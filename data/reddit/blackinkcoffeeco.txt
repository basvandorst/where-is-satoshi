Haha very interesting and definitely a fair trade!
Well, if you ever are looking for coffee, let me know :)
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:27:38
Yes, that counts! How has the process been for you? 
Are you more likely to purchase beer from someone that accepts cryptocurrency versus someone that does not?
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:29:02
Haha fair enough, I like this answer! 
If you did want a coffee though, would you ever buy it with your hard earned satoshi's?
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:32:11
Absolutely! We work with a few well know importers that are top of the line in the industry, that only offer specialty coffee. So the origin on these are 100% accurate and some are even traceable to the exact farm! Let me know if you have any questions and I would be happy to answer :)

Unfortunately not, I will go ahead and put "US" on the top of the page to clarify and confusion. I wish shipping wasnt as much as it is for our awesome customers across the water, but there is no getting around that at the moment.

Haha thank you....

Negative! You just have to sign up with that link and share :)

I'm sorry, I thought that a coffee company that accepts cryptocurrency, which helps push along mainstream adoption, would have a good fit here opposed to the stupid memes I scroll through every day that dont help the r/bitcoin community... 
Just my two satoshis

I'd like to hold all of my profits in crypto if I can manage it. Ideally I would never convert it back to fiat!!!
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:29:19
Friend request where?
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:04:24
Lmao oh, I guess I must have missed that example when I first got into blockchain/distrubuted ledger technology years ago!
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:27:39
Who is Alice and Bob?
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:59:30
Darn. Thanks for response though!

Excellent feedback, I really appreciate it. The vehicle has very low value so I believe it is better suited for Craigslist. I look forward to the day that vehicle transactions become more prevalent and there is a safe platform to do so. Thanks again for your input!

What do you mean it "never works?"
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:38:43
Haha fair enough, yeah I have considered Craigslist even though it is slightly sketchy.

I do not have a store front yet, but will be accepting crypto as payment for great quality fair trade coffee. Feel free to go to my site and sign up as a backer for my upcomming kickstarter. All early backers will receive exclusive offers and early bird rewards. I love seeing that people want to buy products, like coffee, with crypto! It certainly helps with mass adoption :)
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:30:02
Thanks for that info, will do!
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:43:10
Kickstarter doesnt accept Bitcoin. I have a cryptocurrency payment processor for my site, but Kickstarter doesnt unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:21:59
Nano was my first as well, followed by Haas trading software. Cant wait to see crypto used more and more!
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:38:57
Sell right now
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:19:59
Not a bad idea but I am restricted to whatever the plugins use until I can build my own crypto plugin.
