Who does? Seriously, I would drop Coinbase in a heartbeat if a suitable alternative operating in the US supported SegWit. 
I hear that Bitstamp does, but that using them is a pain in the ass because you can't just hook it up to your bank like Coinbase, and instead have to rely on wire transfers.

Taint becomes a lot harder for Coinbase to track and punish with some privacy enhancing countermeasures, such as tricks like Samorai wallet's ricochet feature. If you are considering sending coins to an exchange that is not above policing taint /civil asset forfeiture, you can bounce them among several addresses you control before they arrive at the exchange address. It's not perfect, but it pollutes the analytics firms' data.

I get the excitement and then relief,  but why does bad have to follow?

It's terrifying to be the black dot in the sea of white vice versa

What's the name of the repository for it on GitHub?

The disk is a few years old, so corruption is certainly possible. It's just strange that it was working just fine a few weeks ago and just failed out of the blue. The operating system is Windows 10; it is possible that one of their updates compromised the integrity of my block database?

That's the thing, I cannot see anything Blockchain related in the directory that I originally specified to hold the copy of the block chain in. I think that I must have deleted or hidden those files. I'm inclined to think hidden, because if I deleted them, wouldn't the Core client simply start rebuilding a new blockchain there from scratch?

I don't recall any disk failures that may have caused this. Indeed, the only application that seems to be exhibiting aberrant behavior is the core client. A full system backup seems like an extreme measure at this juncture.

Are you referring to the startup of the Core client? Because if so, I don't think I can access the controls to that setting. When I run the core client, the only UI I see are the ones depicted in my OP.

You say that like it's a *bad* thing

In this video, Andreas concedes that while decentralized exchanges with fiat gateways like Bisq are possible, they will always come with a certain degree of counterparty risk to users due to the reversibility of electronic fiat payments. 
&amp;nbsp; 
Doesn't this pose a major problem for Bitcoin / the broader crypto ecosystem existing at the mercy of centralized authorities like governments? Either you use a centralized exchange and get KYC'd to the point where all the activities of your coins are subject to regulatory scrutiny / surveillance, or you use decentralized exchanges and face the risks described here. This really saps a lot of the economic sovereignty that cryptocommerce is supposed to empower users with. 
Even supposing we get much better privacy tech in Bitcoin  / the proliferation of mixers in most wallet services, this runs the risk of centralized exchanges being shut down entirely. How does one migrate money into crypto then? We all resort to using services such as localbitcoins?

People always bring this comic up, and it's upsetting because this vulnerability (if it is indeed as bad as xkcd makes it sound) could potentially be really bad news for the long-term viability of bitcoin. 
But I have to wonder how realistic a fear this is. There seem to be many countermeasures available for people to mount low-profile resistance to state-sponsored or other thugs 'beating the bitcoin out you'. A few I can think of off the top of my head:
1. Most people don't own any bitcoin. So for at least a long time (before it goes mainstream), the best defense is to simply not let people know about your savings (let alone how much). 
2. Say it does go mainstream, and the government gets in the habit of regularly confiscating people's savings (as they do with fiat) whenever they know about its existence. Once it becomes widely known that people are getting robbed this way, if you can't credibly pretend not to be worth anything, you could still take measures to obfuscate how much you're worth. Maybe you give up the wallet with a couple of satoshis in it for the waterboarding session and hope they call it a day at that point. If they proceed on to thumbscrews, admit "alright alright, there's more" and toss them a slightly fuller wallet containing a few bits. When would they ever know when you're actually out of keys up your sleeve? 
&amp;nbsp; 
Of course this is some pretty paranoid, next level defenses given today's legal climate regarding bitcoin, but I'm trying to imagine worst case scenarios to address this concern. 
Has anyone found any in depth discussion / exploration of this topic?

Not exactly tl;dr material, but [The Deep Web (2015)]( is a great documentary that explores the story of Ross and the rise and fall of the Silk Road.
