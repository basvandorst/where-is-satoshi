Pretty sure the motorbike in picture is own by the OP. The license plate is not Vietnamese citizen standard, it has "NN" (which stand for "nước ngoài") is a code for foreigner registered license plate.
Moreover, on the first line of the plate, 59 is SaiGon Code, the three number behind it indicate that the vehicle is registered by an Indian citizen. 
Fuck me if I'm wrong !!!

It's a perk for being a Vietnamese living in Saigon for 27 years !!!
Well, I think I could possibly pin-point the exact location where he took this picture in Google Map with little indicators shown. 
The restaurant with the coconut led sign board is where I usually take my foreign friends there to experience the "Foreigner Night Street". 
It's fun watching the "Capitalism Pigs" walking around, enjoying their time in "Communist Heaven".
