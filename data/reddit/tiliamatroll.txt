Do you have nothing better to do with your sad little life?

I was just trying to be cute and piggyback off your comment. You took it super personally, chill. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:46:46
That’s a great way to lose your customers. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:32:23
That has nothing to do with your initial statement though. How does it solve societal issues?
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:53:18
This is not binary. The pareto principal and systemic racism can both exist simultaneously. You seem to be eager to get into some kind of debate around systemic racism and I'm not going there with you. I still don't understand which societal issue you're solving though. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:09:33
intentionally obtuse I see. I was wondering. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:37:16


this is an absurd statement. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:59:30
Can you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:01:02
It has nothing to do with government being a group of individuals with a common goal 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:28:23
How does one gain the "being wealthy skillset"?
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:46:52


you could say the exact same thing about the government.

The products are getting better incrementally, but it's not because of the size of the pile of cash their sitting on. They're no more innovative today than they were ten years ago.

So give it to the individuals who will spend the money, not the companies that will hoard it.

Yea but did they parlay the eagles to win the Super Bowl with Nick Foles to win super bowl mvp? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:08:40
No, you said "An individual will always make better use of money than the government"
I agreed and said "So give it to the individuals who will spend the money, not the companies that will hoard it."
You then said "A corporation is a group of people that have a shared interest and goals"
I then said "you could say the exact same thing about the government."
None of those statements are incongruent with my opinion that the overwhelming majority of individuals would be better off if they had more money to spend than if companies did.

This whole conversation started with you saying that people understanding the Pareto principal would solve some of societies issues, I asked how and you provided nothing other than your thoughts. I don't even know which societal issue you're claiming it would solve.

People shouldn’t take advice from kids on reddit, and if they do it’s not OPs responsibility to care about what happens.

In what way is bitcoin a zero sum game?
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:01:02
Shitposts don’t get real responses. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:40:47
How would it ease societal issues? “Look people! Can’t you just accept the fact that you’re always going to be poor? After all, it’s natural for 20% of people to hold 80% of the wealth”
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:30:49
So in your mind, a world of serfs willingly accepting their place in nature is an acceptable end state? That universe sucks. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:58:26
lol ok. if you say so.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:45:56
except sometimes people with low IQ become successful. you seem to be advocating for a system that rewards people for not trying to become the outlier. as if genetics are the be all, end all. it sounds like you'd really buy into phrenology. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:58:05
There is nothing but opinion in this comment. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:03:56
Solving issues isn't though, bud. You're presenting statements as if they're facts and using them to validate your initial statement. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:26:46
hoarding is a very recent phenomenon in industry. we are not better off as customers when apple has a trillion dollars to their name, especially compared to when they had 500 billion. that money is much more beneficial to the economy when it's being transacted, spending is what our economy is built on. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:02:35


I don't think those people exist. This is a non sequitur, not an analogy. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:56:25


k. none of that has anything to do with your initial statement. 




except, you know, elections.
