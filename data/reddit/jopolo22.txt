And it is not really a wallet just a virtual porfolio. No link to any wallet or blockchain :)

Guys wake up. You cant live in a world without authorities even though bitcoin's phylosophy is to have no midle man.
Did you forget that if you are confortably using your computer is very likely because you have goverments behind you? 
Like every evolution in society things are gonna have to adapt. Governments will understand they cannot stop this technology and we have to accept the authority come into the game.

Why? Why? Did the team pre-annpunced pre-news for 2021? Another fork maybe?

I do not know but maybe both?

In my opinion it doesnt look like a good ico. I do not see anything concrete. 
It is like a troll ICO (to not say SCAM?).

Way too dificult to know. Do you have kids or own your house? What are your monthly expenses? Are you planning to use the bitcoin to buy houses, dollars or gold for example. If you keep your bitcoins safe what if the price goes down? What if you somehow lose it or someone hack it from you? 
Do not think about your retirement now. Make yourself a budget with your expenses, personal goals etc. Ask yourself first what are yoj going to do with the profit you are going to make (I hope for you). 
Someone told me once that you should always diversify your investments. So puting all your savings in cryptocurrencies is maybe not a good idea.

Dont sell it! Just make a zoom out on the Bitcoin graph and you will understand.

Dont worry. If you hold it, it is fine. Maybe in 1 month but it will for sure one day...

If your goal is to have a Bitcoin you are maybe right. If you want to make some benefits it doesnt matter as long as Bitcoin is increasing value.

Try to make a bank deposit to a platform that allows you to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:42:56
For sure it can create problems. Not only to store but also to "do the calculation" on the proof of work technology. Imagine the energy it is taking already to mine bitcoins. Imagine in some years.
But I'm sure the technology will also adapt and change.

OMG (Vitalik etc) Lisk (competitor of ETH and zheir team is pretty active) DNT (lost 70% though) TRST Wetrust coin (pretty good idea team seems active, it is still cheap and a nice market price in comparison with the circulating supply, Vitalik was, is, can be their advisor also).
