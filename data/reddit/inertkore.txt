"Someone suggests stamping secret codes on real dollar bills which lucky finders can then exchange for virtual currency, creating a kind of countrywide treasure hunt."
Someone should make this happen.

Might I suggest Coursera?  They have cryptography classes (the one happening now is taught by a Stanford Professor), give certificates for course completion, and are much more... economical.

Another female chiming in. And to preempt the follow up: SO and I were introduced to it at the same time, I bought first, but only beat him to it because of an opportunity that made it easy to.

This post does a hell of a lot more of protecting people than the police would.  Maybe he gets arrested, maybe prosecuted, we get a bunch of bad press on btc, OP gets ruthlessly investigated, OP can't comment without interfering with an investigation, and chances are the btc community knows less about it overall...

On the contrary, I am saying that this post informs the community, while contacting the police very well might prevent OP from informing the community (bc it would be interfering in an ongoing investigation).  It could also have an adverse effect on OP and the bitcoin community in general.  In situations like these, it is important to keep in mind that the role of the police is more heavily anchored in punishment than prevention.
