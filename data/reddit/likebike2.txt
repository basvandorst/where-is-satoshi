As long as you're ready to hold through a BIG correction (think $4k), you'll be fine.  Keep a long-term perspective.

China was  (97%) in activity one month ago, before the Chinese government significantly restricted the BTC markets.  This caused a shift in capital flows, as Chinese people are passing their money through Japanese and USA BTC exchanges instead.  But the demand still originates in China.

You guys don't think this down-move has a strong fundamental driver behind it?  Chinese government has effectively shut down all the major BTC exchanges, which is where 97% of all BTC demand comes from.  Seems like a significant change in fundamentals to me.

Well said.

Wow, the title of this post is not a "paraphrase" -- it's a direct quote!

Thanks.  I didn't know about that subreddit.

That's an interesting prediction.  Why do you think March will be a turning point?

It's because Tether is crashing.

What a dumb decision.  Liquidity will flow out to other exchanges.

It's liquidations, not shorts.  People are being forced out of their long positions.

You broke it!

Derivatives enable you to use more advanced strategies.  In particular, they enable you to trade volatility rather than price direction, which is often much easier to predict.

I'm a bit skeptical...

"Bible" just means "book".  It has nothing to do with religion.

This move is so irrational -- it was triggered by a flight-to-safety away from Bitfinex, which happend to push the price past some critical levels, and now people don't realize that the entire reason for the upwards move was bearish to begin with.
