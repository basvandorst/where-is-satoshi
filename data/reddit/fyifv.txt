I shrugged reading that. Every time anything happens to btc, someone's gotta go write a damn article about it repeating this same shit ad naseum.

Did you perform all of this without worrying about anonymity?  As of late bitinstant doesn't work on Tor and I'm suspicious about sending anything directly to my wallet to begin with. I've heard conflicting reports about it working directly to SR either.

I actually just did this with bitme instead.  Worked out fine.  Just tense considering old faithful is now an old piece of untrustworthy shit.  It's amazing how something can destroy all of that credibility in a matter of minutes like that.

They aren't going to "scam" anybody, but it wouldn't surprise me if they show down the rest of their customer base by permanently shutting off cash to account # or BTC-e, just like they did cash deposit to account # earlier.

Yea that's a pretty good observation.  Except what I'm trying to convey is that I don't think they'd disappear with everyone's money with their existing reputation.

Well you will be missing out some more if you had any plans to do regular business because any functionality that allowed even remotely for cash to BTC account is now turned off completely.  Bitinstant won't be getting my business anymore that's for damn sure.  And a shame too.
