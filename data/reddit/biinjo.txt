That's not just the beauty of Bitcoin, that's the beauty of open source software in general.

Well this did the trick:
- Restore backup to old iPhone
- Managed to get wifi and 3G working by tingeling with the hardware
- Using the internet connection, iPhone re-downloaded all apps including Bread Wallet.
- Breadwallet's contents where restored. I was able to lookup the recover phrase.
- Entered the phrase in my new iPhone, rescanned the blockchain and got the btc back :)
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:06:22
Technically, Bitcoins are internet points as well
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:48:29
For everyone asking: yes the iTunes backup is encrypted. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:47:42
This answer comes close to what the creator of Breadwallet told me. Will give this a try in a few minutes. Ill be back :-)
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:15:27
That's funny my story is the exact opposite: I bought around $2500 in Bitcoin right after 'the big peak' and have been trying to forget about that purchase ever since.
It keeps chasing me though.

Exactly ;-)

@_date: 2014-02-04 04:46:14
Interesting to see that critics get downvoted.. We're just here to help and shed light on some issues other users might run into as well.
BTW; I did figure it out eventually. By accident during a final 'tap everything for 5 minutes' session before I was planning to remove the app. Now I know how it works, I'll keep it.
@_date: 2014-01-17 13:46:28
Sweet dude. Nice design!
@_date: 2014-01-17 13:52:27
I must add to that - it's completely non-intuitive. I don't mean to bash or anything but I'm a software developer myself and have no idea on what to do when I opened the app. Can only imagine how an average user would feel.
Perhaps you could build in a one-time-only wizard showing off how to use the app. That's what you see with most of these minimalistic apps (like ZeroBlock)
Edit: After 10 minutes of trying, I'm giving up. It's completely useless on an iPhone 4 unless you tell me how to enter my BTC value.

As tempting as it is, this as much a cliché as it is true: NEVER invest money you cannot afford to lose. If something unforeseen happens, you're stuck with a loan you got to pay back. 0% interest or not, it's still not your money.

Guys on all sides of this discussion: thank you for finally discussing and argueing on a more sophisticated level. This is some interesting information you both shared and food for thought. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:54:20
Got my friend enthousiastic about crypto. He bought a full bitcoin at the $2400 rate on my advice. Then he sold it at $2800 because he figured he made quite some profit in a couple of days... :-( Forgot to explain about hodling and not selling..
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:28:25
How old is this?! $19k not even mentioned.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:36:31
$4500. 
Im only saying this so I can make nice profit on that dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:08
Nah man, got her a car at 10k so we're all good.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:15:35
Google invested in Ripple. There is no need for every company to create their own crypto. Just because they can doesnt mean it would make sense to do so. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:19:02
Yeah sold at $4500. Its a fairly decent second hand car hehe
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:58:53
Someone told me. He was wearing a suit so he mist be right. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:32:17
Turns out it was hash power indeed:
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:14:20
You should not buy any then
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:39:29
I sold the bitcoin for USD and got a second hand car for that money :-)
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:37:24
Their main business is advertising. That revenue pays for the rest of their businesses. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:11:41
Newbe here. What would be considered a spam transaction and how would it hurt bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:38:22
But do these transactions pay fees? That will cost someone a lot of money right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:28
That's an awesome idea. My boss did this 3 years ago. I got a bitcoin worth $400 at the time as my annual bonus.
This year, I bought a car with it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:07:22
Oh I agreed with the rest of your comment, just wanted to let you know about their main business; its advertising. 
Furthermore I dont see how Google should be afraid of blockchain tech. On the contrary, Google invested a lot of money in Ripple.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:18:32
I always told myself I would sell one BTC of my portfolio once 1 BTC equals a full options Tesla Model S. Lol. Not so much of a lambo guy :-P So I suppose I’ll sell at roughly $150.000-$200.000
Next threshold would be 1 BTC for an entire house. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:47
Where did you find her
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:39:12
More for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:36:53
Based on what Im reading and seeing in forecasts and trends it should be somewhere around the $5000 I suppose. 
But if anyone is able to predict the price, they wouldnt probably be answering questions on reddit lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:55:40
You. Sell me this bridge.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:48:40
Nah Im just enjoying my profits en hodl bigtime on the rest. Who said this was my only bitcoin ;-)

Probably because in Europe people don't sue each other for every damn single thing that could go wrong. Activities like this are screaming for a good old American lawsuit from the first rider who gets a bug in their eye.

Just leaving a comment to read along with you. But as far as I know it's called "BIP 146" and "BIP 91" where BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. And it has something to do with the way it's implemented that they first roll out BIP 91 and then continue rolling out BIP 146.
Correct me if I'm wrong. There's not much more I can tell on this matter.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:16:56
Yeah that's what I thought but that's not what I'm reading in different places. Is there someone here who can explain?
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:11:12
From what I understand, if you have 5 btc pre-split you will have 5 btc + 5 bcc post-split. 
However, and this is the part I find confusing, the newly created 5 BCC will take value off your BTC. 
If your BTC was worth $1000 ($200 each) pre-split and BCC is worth $100, your BTC value will be $1000-(5x$100) = $500 if I'm correct. 
Please enlighten me if I'm not.

@_date: 2017-07-28 17:41:16
That's what I understood as well but how is that different from what says? Other altcoins didn't influence the price either.
But if BTC will drop; I would argue that this will create a great buying opportunity.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:53:55
Why and how does BCC affect BTC prices?
@_date: 2015-03-02 13:28:15
And then what? How do they know a certain wallet is yours and for example not for a friend?

New to the 'participating in exchanges' sphere. Poloniex just doesn't have their design / user experience on point in my opinion.
Coinbase on the other hand "looks" very modern and trustworthy.

WTF. So if I'm holding 2 BTC now, I end up with 1 BTC for each fork? How does that work?
Or will it be so that I have two BTC on each blockchain? If that's the case; how would my wallet handle that?


Sounds to me as if the price is going to take a huge hit on August 1st...

Like I said - too good to be true. That's because your offer is far from free but you pretend it's free.
If my rig would generate 1 Bitcoin in a month, I suppose I can easily spend that 0,5 Bitcoin on the electricity bill and save the other half in my wallet.
