Most of the above comments are accurate, but to me, it has value because it is a distributed ledger of every transaction ever made using bitcoin thus making it a trustless and decentralized tool for people to use to transfer value from one person directly to another without a third party (i.e. banks) in between.

Most currencies depend on the US Dollar I believe

Yes, but don't panic if it dips or even crashes in the near future. It's a long term investment. Read about it and, if you believe in it, buy as much as you can. If it succeeds 1 bitcoin will be worth way more than 10k

There's a bunch of good primers on YouTube as well. Just type in "what is bitcoin"
Have fun

Thank you for your post. I've only recently been learning about bitcoin and other cryptos and still trying to gather the bigger picture. Never heard of people who buy gold (I'm assuming) as goldbugs either lol

When I read it in this way I feel the shadiness... But if Subway gets the cash still what is the legal reason that they'd get fired? I guess a similar situation is if I gave the Subway employee a lump of gold and the employee put their own cash into the register as payment to Subway...but I still don't see how that's wrong.
