yes you can do alot of things if you still have your harddrive, you can load the computer with a live OS and search the Harddrive for the wallet.dat file,
also you can add the harddrive to another computer and look for wallet.dat
if you computer went belly up, could usually be somethign with the OS, if not could still be alot of other parts in the computer, last thing could be that the harddrive is corrupt, and even then, you can still sometimes extract data from the harddrive even when its already at an unreliable state,
i think you can still recover your wallet.dat,
if you need help how to do it, pm me i can try help you out for sure!

you cannot say they would be losing money, bitcoin itself can go up in price, also buying such device could be and is to help secure the bitcoin networks thust furthur driving the price of bitcoins up,
people buying hardware are helping secure bitcoin, and are being rewarded aswell, thats why the hardware is for,
its for mining bitcoin blocks, and thats what it does...
you payed you recieved why complain?
you were misled? well thats your own fault, should of thought of why are you getting into this? for greed to make money out of nowhere?
well if its too good to be true, trust me it is,
you have to put in work...
fruit of your own labor, well yeah
gl in your future ventures!

except for a trustworthy source that collects transactions and then publicizes them to the blockchain asap, as soon as there is enough to cover the small miner fee,
this is in a world when and if bitcoins become much more valuable, and transaction fees go up...
