Congrats, this is incredible on your end. Incredible not because you have bought btc, but more so because you have decided on a goal, and have gone above and beyond into reshaping your life to make that goal a reality. That is dedication, motivation, and resolve.  Qualities which I argue will take you much further in life than bitcoin ever will.

Have you thought of the energy consumption issue of bitcoin? 
As a hodler, this has been my primary concern in the long run of how viable it is for bitcoin to continue to exist 20 years down the road.  
Would we eventually be using 1.21 gigawatts of energy per 10 minute blocks? Or do we already do that? What are the implications of this in terms of global warming? 
There is much more to think about beyond just financial freedom.  There is no point having financial freedom if the entire damn planet has re-route electricity just to keep mining farms going.

If there is a whale in a pond, then what's the point in believing in a so-called decentralized currency? I mean, if a few people can shake up the market so much with so little effort, can't these whales just keep screwing around with the market? They sell 100 bitcoins when it is at $500. Then screw it until it comes down to $300, where they buy another 100 bitcoins at that amount, and repeat and rinse? 
Or is this not possible at all and I'm thinking about this wrongly? 
I'm really new to this bitcoin thing and I'm trying to understand how these powerhouses aren't essentially just robbing from the smaller fish. It's like we're helping them, in a crowdsourcing fashion, to become millionaires while we delude ourselves with the notion that bitcoin will be something one day. 
I'm just really struggling to see how this can be revolutionary, other than it being yet another way for the rich to get even richer and for the poor to be fooled into giving their money away.

I think if you're going to explain it to a layman, convert bitcoin into a simple physical ledger metaphor. I must warn you that my understanding of bitcoin is probably not COMPLETELY accurate, but I hope the following example gives you a sense of how you can explain it to a layman.
Imagine 10 accountants working for a company, each with their own personal ledger book and they are seated in a room.  In this room, there is also a company ledger book that does not belong to any of the accountants.  The job of each accountant is to record every transaction that is going on in the company, as it occurs, and each accountant does the recording independently.  Naturally, some people work faster than others, so the accountants vary in their accounting speed.
Every 10 entries, however, each accountant must compare their ledger book with the other 9 accountants. Now, if the first accountant to reach 10 entries then shares their ledger book with the other 9, and it is clear that the ledger matches the majority of the group (i.e., at least 5 out of other 9), then those 10 entries is now "confirmed" as being legitimate, and is then also entered into the company ledger book for future reference. Nothing can ever be changed in the company ledger, which is why getting a group consensus is so important on what business transactions actually took place.
Finally, because the accountant that submitted it first and also got it right ahead of the other 9 accountants, this accountant is rewarded with $X amount of currency.  Now imagine this concept, but applied to thousands of computers on the internet, located all over the world, with each computer essentially acting as an accountant.
Note: I left out things like difficulty because I honestly don't think that's relevant to your peers in terms of just trying to get a gist of how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:15:20
Out of curiosity, when you convert them back and forth between bitcoin and dollar within Coinbase's system, do you still get charged 1% EACH time you do this?
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:35:18
How would you go about doing it? I'm asking because I'm genuinely curious.  I've always been thinking of ways to explain bitcoin to friends who have absolutely zero knowledge on how the whole thing is even possible.
My example is more of a template, because I think for a jury you rrreeaally want to avoid any, if at all, jargon when describing bitcoin (i.e., addresses, blockchain, etc).  
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:03:19
I get the feeling that certain powers that be are now invested in Bitcoin and view it as a way to get a nice tidy profit, resulting in the big flashfire of media coverage we've seen lately.
The reason why they need media coverage, if I'm right, is to get more liquidity in the market as there's insufficient of it now.  What better way than to get 100,000 average joes to each put like $500 into the market, injecting an easy $50 million.  Of course, when this happens, we'll likely see impatient bearwhales again cashing out periodically.

It is truly unfortunate that and has devolved into petty name calling, witch hunts, etc.  Instead of discussing software engineering related to bitcoin, we are now seeing the effects of unintended (or intended?) social engineering in breeding hatred, contempt, and disgust for the supposed "us" and "them" mentality.  As much as everyone is camped in one room or another room, we all forget that we're living in the same house that may very well be torn down by a an incoming brigade outside cause everyone is too busy watching the other room's door instead of the windows.

Serious question, what is the legal definition of "receive" here in this context? Does it include buying? Or is it defined as someone giving/gifting crypto to you?
What does "acquiring any financial interest" legally mean too? Is it interest earned in crypto? or Is it being financially interested about crypto? or does it include buying? "acquiring any financial interest" is so darn vague in that it can encompass SO many things. 
I'm interpreting the question that holding crypto with no transactions in 2019 would yield a hard no on that question.

What if it is not a given set of addresses? Just to be sent to any addresses in the blockchain that received bitcoin in the last 1 month, for example. Would that be technically doable?
This is literally for someone who has no one, no friends, etc. And they simply do not want the coins to go to waste, but they do not know who to give it to. So the script would simply give it to active receiving addresses in the past month (divided evenly, if possible, or randomly if there is insufficient funds).

For the life of me, I never understood why the activation period was 95% for Segwit. That is just downright impossible. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:29:48
If I'm not mistaken, won't this just make miners more resistant towards activating SegWit? I mean, it is going to be fees galore, transactions backed up for weeks at a time, and the fees may skyrocket with no end in sight? 
This is going to be terrible. Wrong time for consumer adoption IMHO. Bitcoin will get clogged worse than a clogged toilet, and first impression is crucial for something in what I consider to still be in its infancy stage.

You got the advertised hash power. My guess is that you have the hardware for the covert ASICBOOST, just that it is not activated for you.
Please understand, despite the name, it does not boost your hashpower, it simply reduces your electricity bill (by up to 30%), which in turn indirectly increases your profit. But of course, it is very likely not activated on yours. Sorry bud.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:58:57
You buy $50k worth of miners from Jihan.  Out of the door, you're already 30% less efficient than the same miners being operated under bitmain.  Your duration to get a positive ROI is now substantially longer, and bitmain continues to gain more profit per time period.  The issue here is time, time is everything.  The longer he stays ahead, the greater his control over mining becomes.  I see it as a snowballing effect, given enough time.  
Either we quickly ensure every single miner gains access to this, from the individual to the pools, or no one at all.  At least this is how I think of it.

Im happy for you. That is amazing that you retired at 41. 
Your way of living, however, is not the only way of living. And at the end of the day, whether you retire at 41 or 72 makes little to no difference in the grand scheme of things. Your life will come to an end. Calling other people losers just because their choices in life are not optimal in your view is not an effective way to communicate with others.
Furthermore, I get the feeling that you do not go to bars much cause even if you can now, and you speak the way you do about losers and poverty in real life as you do behind a monitor..ah well. Let's just say that some people do not care how much money you have.
Ive known of people (personally) with more than tens of millions of dollars, likely much more than you ever will make in this life time. Are they happy for all the conveniences money buys them? Absolutely. Are they just as anxious about losing it all? Absolutely again. Heck, even being in public and near public transportation triggers anxiety about what might prematurely end their life before they can fully enjoy their wealth. Point is, just play this game of life how you want it. Serve others when you can, and check out and leave a tip when you're done.
Sure, maybe a good portion of reddit may never have the life that you have right now, but that is ok. It doesnt make them losers, or you a winner. Good luck to you, and thank you for being kind in being willing to mentor younger ones.

You do not choose the seed phrase. You do not want to make a private key based on words of your choosing. It is insufficiently random, including lacking in entropy, and that this would make it easy to eventually brute force your private key. 
Yes there is no harm in sharing the public key. Just always double check before you send your kraken balance to your public key that it is indeed the right public key.

@_date: 2017-10-11 20:02:28
Im glad I could help. If you want, after getting your seed and public key written down, shut down the machine and start tails up again. In electrum, restore your private keys and see if the generated public keys matches what you have. They will be the same if you did not make an error in your seed words. 
You can bookmark your publickey on bitaddress.org to check the balance from time to time. This method of airgapping your private keys from the internet is secure enough. But if you want another level of digital security, go with a Trezor or Ledger Nano. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:53:50

No problem, I'll try to explain what I can, and hopefully it will help.  Technically, Kraken isn't holding "your private keys or your coins".  You have no coins with Kraken.  On Exchanges, what you have are I-owe-you agreements with the exchange.  That is, the exchange has their own private keys with their own balance, and they agree to owe you X amount of bitcoins.  You only own these coins when you choose to transfer the coins to a public key derived from your private key.  Hopefully that isn't too confusing.
For 1), you could have seed words written on paper, or you could literally write the ENTIRE private key string down.  You transfer the BTC balance on Kraken simply by withdrawing it to a public key of your choosing.  When you generate a wallet in Electrum, it will include both a private key and a public key.  The public key will always be algorithmically derived from the private key.  
Yes, NEVER type your seed phrase anywhere online, or on a machine.  Keep it on pen and paper, and use traditional methods to secure that (e.g., safe).  
You do not need to be connected to the internet when using tails to transfer coins.  I'll try to break down what you need to do, given your situation.
1) Create your Tails USB.
2) Boot into Tails as is, do not connect to the internet.
3) Start up Electrum in Tails, and make a new standard wallet. 
4) Write down the seed phrase it gives you on paper only. Write it on a digital medium if, and only if, you are extremely sure it is secure.
5) Go to the receive tab (how people would send you coins) and look for your public key.  Write down your public key, this can be on paper or digitally. 
6) Shut off tails.  It is time to verify that you wrote the write seed words. Reboot the machine and boot into tails again, and again, there is no need to connect to the internet.
7) Start up electrum, and this time, opt to reload a wallet based on the seed words you received in 4).  
8) After loading up the wallet, go to the receive tab again and verify that the public key is the same as what you had written down.  It should be.  Otherwise, you've written down the wrong seed.
And that's it.  When you transfer your balance out of Kraken to your public key, send a small amount first, either 0.01 or 0.001 BTC.  DOUBLE check the public key before executing the withdrawal.  
After that, use any bitcoin address explorers to monitor your balance via the public key you obtained.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:31:20
Technically, you dont even need tails to be connected to the internet or tor. You just use electrum inside tails to generate a new seed for you. Write your seed down, and the public key. Moving forward, just send your coins to that public key. Check your balance on other machines or through your phone on mycelium. This way, your private keys never interface with the web. If you want to send coins, you can use electrum to sign the transaction in tails (without any internet). You will get a file, which you would locally send (via a usb drive) to the live machine with electrum where you load and broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network.  If my understanding is erroneous, I hope someone else will chime in. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:18:24
Tails plus electrum in an offline solution to generate your private keys people. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:46
Still reasonably safe. If you want it to be safe, just restart tails again and not connect it to the internet. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:29:33
1) Download a copy of tails and load it onto a USB drive.
2) Boot your machine and load it from said USB drive.
3) Find Electrum already built into the Tails OS. 
That's it. Tails is an amnesic operating system, meaning nothing is saved upon reboot, unless if you choose to have persistent storage.  IMHO, under no condition should you ever trust Windows to handle any type of bitcoin-related matters, unless if it is for a watch-only account balance. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:48:15
OP, sorry that this happened to you. I cant even imagine what you must be going through right now. 
It appears that there are only two interpretations to this situation: (a) there was a glitch in JAXX or (b) there was, unfortunately, a mistake on your end somewhere along the way. If (a), I would imagine that this sub and the jaxx sub would see others with similar predicaments. If this isnt the case, as much as it pains me to say, it very well may be due to (b).  For what it is worth, I have been in situations where I was 1000% sure I did something one way to only find out that my memory was not as accurate as I thought it was. 
Good luck, I hope it is (a), and that you will be able to recover your BTCs.
