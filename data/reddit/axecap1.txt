I hope you are joking
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:10:29
Sorry, it should say own
@_date: 2019-02-08 04:10:29
Awesome job on doing this! Please keep up the good work!
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:10:12
Sorry, damn autocorrect. It should say own
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:45:36
Is anyone do concerned about the large amount of coins being rereleased from Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:04:43
What does having more full nodes exactly do?
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:07:30
So for a hypothetical example, what would happen if there was only one full node on the network?
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:44:31
What would happen to the fees of Bitcoin if the block size was increased? I've done some research and I'm still pretty confused. I appreciate you answering.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:51:02
Congrats my man. Update us on how it goes
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:39:37
Would 2 nodes sufficiently validate the rules the same as 200 nodes, or are more nodes needed just in case a large amount of nodes would happen to go offline? Thanks for your responses bu the way.

This may not be what he did, but when I gave bitcoin as a gift. I made them a paper wallet
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:54:26
Good point
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:56:35
I dislike autocorrect. I meant concerned 
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:53:08
Would putting the block size at 2mb for example double the tps?
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:26:11
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:35:05
Bullish News lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:04:16
The average Joe does?
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:02:58
So I can send funds to a LN wallet from a traditional wallet, but not from a LN wallet to a traditional wallet? Thanks for responding!
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:14:10
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but is SegWit currently activated?
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:00:42
Ok, thanks
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:50:33
Thanks, it says in order to withdraw I need to have an invoice. Where is that info on the Blue Wallet app? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:22:23
Yea, idk. I would say I'm concerned though. Just don't want Bitcoin to drop from 3000 to 1200 overnight 
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:24:32
Thank you for your response. It was really helpful. Just one question is that the more nodes that there are, the more secure the network is?
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:53:54
Can you send satoshis from a lightning wallet to a traditional bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:20:12
I would open a LN channel, but I wish it was less complex
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:45:47
How do you feel about all the Mt. Gox coins getting rereleased?
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:00:41
Are the red nodes just the ones with the most Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:27:05
When will this be voted on?
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:53:16
I want to do this but I'm not the most technical person in the world. Is this difficult?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:55:28
Do ledger nano addresses support segwit?
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:55:36
Did you need to add external memory in order to do this?
