I personally had very familiar situation. I have several e-wallets (not just crypto) and when the bank where my money was stored has been closed and fiat accounts have been frozen, the only way was to convert all fiat to btc and send out to another crypto-wallet. No authorities can confiscate your crypto (if it's not an official federal procedure when they confiscate all your belongings), that's true. No rolling reserve and all other financial stuff. That's what i like in crytpo most.

Agree. Even  more than fiat. When the market and BTC price are unstable you can lose your sleep. If you forget your wallet password you can lose your nerves and so on. And digital gold  rush, of course, in this list

not only Coinbase, but in general, yes. this way is the best one as per now. i can't just transfer my crypto to "a buyer", here is neither security nor trust.

well, it's obvious a company wants to advertise itself. and this ad is quite captivating, i need to say.

great example of crypto adoption among people themselves. that's good that a person can choose the most convenient means of payment for any type of goods.

Maybe not in the near future :(

Oh, I see. Sorry :)
But, dear beginners, do your own research and consider all the risks! :)

Wow, it's a big surprise to me. I never thought this Islamic country may be so progressive in terms of crypto. But considering the crisis of Turkish lira, crypto investments and savings can be a good decision.
u/cryptoforfun, where have you found this rate?

Are there a country where crypto is totally legal? i.e. buying, selling, operating, mining, exchanging etc.
I don't believe so. It is in the grey zone at best or partially legal. Anyway i think it's quite normal that some new technology or product is not legalized at once. We all need time and enough knowledge to accept it.

It  is better to make such a manual on how to get Coinbase account safe. Considering the fact they block or froze customers' accounts "for security reasons". Honestly speaking, I have little trust to Coinbase and won't use it in the near future.

Thank you! Will look through.

It's not about the way to pay. It's about the popularization of crypto in different countries and for different purposes.
As far as i understood this market is located right in the downtown so there are lots of tourists, foreigners etc. Also local youth.
And it may be great marketing strategy as well.

That's what should be written on every billboard, wall, newspaper, breaking news ticker and so on! xD

Blockchain is a technology. But BTC and altcoins are means of payment. Commonly used and wide spread, btw.
