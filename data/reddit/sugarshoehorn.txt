No offense but your commented isn't needed either. Just let Roger melt his could-have-been-good reputation and become a bitcoin memory instead of a bitcoin legend...

This is really getting it too what with Paypal often shutting down people's donations to causes online that they appreciate because they get spooked potentially that their's fraud like what happened to Something Awful or all kinds of internet forums when they just tried to do charitable crowdfunding. Bitcoin is a One way transaction process that isn't reversible and from one perspective this is a weakness but from another it means that there's no central authority to say NO YOU CAN'T DONATE TO THAT, you can't do that! or we're concerned fraud might have been involved and need to do bookkeeping and put you through an EXTREMELY bureaucratic process to receive your funds.﻿

This guy is not obsessed with Bitcoin, he is obsessed with gambling. He has a problem controlling his greed.﻿

Its simple. It’s volatile because it’s small. Wait till market cap is 2 trillion. You won’t see these big movements.﻿

Seems like it would be a really bad idea. Like Javascript mining on a CPU for only 10 seconds?  That can't make much.

I'm guessing he just had a lot saved up already and it's frustrating he can't touch it without penalities. I'm curious if maybe it's possible to transfer some to a Bitcoin IRA (though I hear there may be some fees--like 15%--to transfer over. Maybe that's not terrible in the bigger picture with that possibly being like a couple weeks of gains? Also, I'm curious if in the next year or two we'll see something similar that he can adjust some of his funds to crypto without leaving his current plan at all, if any of it is self directed (vs a school pension or something where it's completely managed). Is that what an ETF would allow? Still a newb, not 100% sure...

IF the story is true i would think the data would be irretrievable after all that time maybe he should hire a metal detector :-)
