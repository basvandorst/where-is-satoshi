The fact that it dropped at $15 means this is likely to be an entirely speculatively driven bubble. People are concerned that it's a bubble so they cashed out at $15.
I'm still confident the long term trend for bitcoin valuation is to go up. The market over reacts sometimes, and this is definitely a case of people bandwagoning, but I'm still confident they're undervalued.

I wouldn't go that far. A sell off can happen at any time, for example, lets say that the people who entered the market at $4 or so, and perhaps they entered the market in a big way. They get to $12 and they think "right, lets cash out" and they begin to drop their coins onto the market.
The price starts to come down, and perhaps it triggers a sell off.
Of course, the opposite could be true. What's important for bitcoin is an economy outside of trading them directly emerges. That way, people are not forced to change their BTC back to traditional currency to 'make money'.
Until that problem is solved, a sell off is a possibility. So how can we stop that? Everyone needs to get developing new bitcoin services and products, and they need to remain reluctant to selling coins they purchased and instead leave that to the miners.

Hi Yishan and the rest of the reddit admin/CEO types. Let me put it to you this way, I'm not one to pay for anything, but if you accept bitcoins for reddit Gold, I'll buy it at $29.99 per year. 
All provided I have a 'gold only' mode , or something similar. Reddit was amazing way back, and I'd be happy to pay if I had the option to 'remove' the undesirables who arrived here with the PR companies and disgruntled digg readers.
I support Bitcoin, if you support it too it will be like two huge pillars of amazingness coming together into one. I'll be supporting two things I really believe in.
Also, if you could some how factor a Private Eye subscription to the deal, that would also be great but I won't hold it against you.

I have been saying this for years. This is a very important idea to what we are doing. If this idea were a symbol, what would it look like? Because we need it.

Gavin Andreson has confirmed for the discussion. Who are the most prominent people in the community so we can let them know? 
Do you think the bitcoin community will be interested?

Thanks! That's the nicest thing anyone on reddit has ever done for me. 
Hope you liked the show!

So... No. Lets not contact him. But seriously, there must be someone?

Hello I'm the presenter of the debate taking place on Thursday, so thanks for posting this. We're going to be talking about all the most cutting edge digital technology that can help us govern ourselves better, removing middle men, intermediaries etc.
Bitcoin certainly has a role to play in that future, and I'm really interested in finding out how that might happen. If you're interested in the debate and have a YouTube account, give the truthloader channel a subscription.
ThePiachu and are you cool if we post a link to the live debate when it happens?
BTW, Birgitta Jonsdottir is also in attendance.

Why? Not enough Gavin? 
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:24:03
You need to chill the fuck out. Or perhaps you need to carry on, I'm not sure. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:41:38
Can't you just put a captcha before each trade? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:29:03
Agreed. Bitcoin is like currency on speed, it's similar, but everything is quicker.
When I say bubble, I mean the market over reacts sometimes and goes nuts and then very quickly corrects again. $45 is an incredible amount.

That's great news. I tried to register into the forum but they aren't accepting registrations any more. On the day it would be great if you could perhaps organise a list of questions on the subreddit that people would want answered?
They would have to be specific to the ideology and values of Bitcoin rather than the nerdy elements of it. Perhaps how we can change the world with it, how it's different, what makes it special etc.
@_date: 2013-01-31 21:16:43
I'm interested in that too. I have an editor who makes calls on what we can do, and we have to really try and grab mainstream audiences so there's an element of that in the way we do stories. I enjoyed the conversation, I'm certainly hugely interested by it. 
Will hopefully do a lot more of this kind of stuff soon.

The debate is THIS Thursday at 7pm GMT on the [Truthloader YouTube channel](
Would be awesome if you helped promote it? Can you think of anyone who might like to be a part of the debate to argue for Bitcoin?
