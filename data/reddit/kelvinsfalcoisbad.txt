Accessibility / Standardized, a lot of people just plain dont know how bitcoin works. Everyone knows how to use cash, so you can go around making transactions with whoever you want.
Stable value, most goverments try pretty hard to make sure your $5 will be $5 tomorrow having your money all in bitcoin could mean something totally different from day to day. 
[Bitcoin value]( vs [CAN value]( relative to USD, unless the bitcoin graph flatlines at some point it doesnt seem like a good thing to be using to trade goods. Most currencies change my minuscule amount compared to bitcoin. 
[Quaks like a duck?]( maybe crypto will be a solid currency at some point, now just seem like that point.

Yes, but that wont stop people from not knowing how it works or how to use it. Its not a very good currency if there is a limit of what you can purchase with it.


2275% inflation over 100 years is a lot different then a 10% change over a *day* inflation is kept in control for the most part, most places aim for 1-3% inflation. It also helps that 100 years ago the systems in place were probably a lot more bunk and prone to things like crazy high inflation. If USD changed by that much on the daily a lot of things would pretty much implode, things like selling a car would be ridiculous. Its worth 10K in the morning but 11k in the afternoon? lots of people would just stop selling things, and it works the same with buying. No one selling or buying would destroy an economy.

Canadian tire cash lets me buy shit from Canadian tire, that doesnt make it money.
Being able to buy things with it doesnt make it money outright, just from the surface you can find many reasons for why to not use bitcoin.
