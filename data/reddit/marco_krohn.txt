Please be more specific. Who is misreading which statements?
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:45:31
1) Sorry, you are still not answering the question. The only relevant question is if the *current* node count is sufficient to support the system. Data suggests (  ) that this is the case.
2) Node number can increase if Bitcoin becomes more widespread is highly relevant.

The average user is not interested in running a full node. Everything that takes longer than a couple of seconds is inconvenient and too long. Whether the block size is 1 MB or 20 MB just doesn't matter. 
The whole discussion that links the block size with the decline of nodes is focusing on the wrong aspect. What is needed is an incentive on the protocol level to run a full node (e.g. like Dash masternodes).
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:19:01
Correct. A bit inconvenient now, but not a big thing. Interesting from a technical perspective, but little impact for the average user. At "Genesis Mining" we simply increase the fee if there is too much "traffic".
Things will be different if there are more real users in the future and everyone wants to get his transaction into the blockchain as soon as possible. Then it will annoy users and there will be frustration about Bitcoin as a payment system.

This. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:53:55
Correct :)
There is wide consensus that the block size should be increased (moderately). Only very few people are against it or are not specific about the circumstances when they want to increase it (which is not too helpful). Unfortunately, in the subset of "core developers" these form a majority and block everything.

The 50% in 5+ years statement is a bit misleading. The tx-chart (excluding popular):
The number of tx might grow faster than you think (I think it is more like a year based on the current trend). Regardless if it is one year or two, I think it makes sense to plan ahead: If the limit is needed in one year, then it was good to put it into the code now. If it is not, the higher limit is not used and no harm is done.
@_date: 2015-06-15 10:42:52
Thanks. That is what I am aware of, as well. There seems to be wide support by miners and businesses in the 5-10 MB region.

Opportunity costs, i.e., someone else could have used the (hydro) electricity instead of burning coal.

It dropped by x% is not an argument. You should show that the current number of nodes is not sufficient. My understanding is that the current number of nodes is good enough:
Quote: "The current number of nodes is greatly in excess of what is needed in order to meet current demand"
In addition to that I have to say that "smaller block == more nodes" argument, is very simplistic as it neglects a number of other factors (such as economic interest in Bitcoin). Also it does not take into account other measures of decentralization (number of nodes is just one of many measures). 
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:16:24
If there are two path A and B, and it is known that A will lead to problems (e.g. user frustration as their transactions are not confirmed), this does *not* automatically mean that B is the way to go. For example, if B means that the whole system collapses, then A certainly is the right way.
However, in this particular case I am convinced that *moderately increasing* the block size to up to 4-8 MB is the safer path forward. 
It will help to grow Bitcoin as a system and actually will increase(!) decentralization. The simple equation: big blocks = less nodes is wrong. Just imagine that block size would be limited to 1 kB. Almost no one would be interested in such a system and there would be far less nodes than today. My own business runs several nodes because there is a market, and we would run more nodes if there were more users. A growing market also means more nodes (disk space and bandwidth is cheap). 
On the economic side similar simplified claims are made by the "no camp". For example, claiming that only making scarce block space will lead to considerable fee income is economically short sighted. Guess which market is bigger: "cheap" Toyota / Volkswagen cars or "expensive" RollsRoyce. 
Testing? Yes, you can always test things more and better. But at some point it is enough and you just have to take a minimal risk (which is involved in every decision). If the "no camp" would agree on an increase under exactly defined tests and outcomes I would not complain. But please be specific. "It is not tested well enough" is not good enough.
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:40:37
Can you please provide a reference? 
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:51:53
Good question. It makes me afraid that there is so little willingness to strive for a compromise. 
I am not aware of any concrete proposal by them which would show under which exact conditions a block increase would be agreeable. And I would not bet that they agree to lift 1MB at some point in time. Saying so is one thing, proposing a concrete solution is something different.
I do not see much chance at the moment that this group of core developers is able to reach consensus. The consensus in the userbase, mining industry and businesses has long been established: "yes, please increase the block size!"
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:38:25
I read it this way, too. No change of the 1 MB limit. 
This is against my understanding of what Satoshi had in mind and what the "social contract" of Bitcoin implied.

@_date: 2015-06-15 15:34:17
Because it gives you more time to fully develop alternatives. 
Let's continue to grow and in parallel work on sidechains, lightning etc. sound like a reasonable approach. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 10:50:39
1) I am missing an answer to my first question: based on what data do you think that the current node count is not sufficient?
2) If there are more users and services interested in Bitcoin there will be more full nodes. Something your simplistic approach does not cover. As an example, I am running a cryptocurrency related business and we provide several full nodes (if the market would be smaller we would not exist and consequently not running any nodes).
3) It is up to the individual whether he wants to run a full node or not. Many decide not know and you should accept that individuals have different opinions.
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:23:26
He has a different opinion. I do not agree with Theymos, but there is no reason to insult people.

Most users seem to agree that discussion about BitcoinXT belongs into this very subreddit. I have not seen a similar reaction by the community when some altcoin post was removed.
Keep this subreddit clean from obvious spam and non-sense. And sincerely thank you for doing this important work!
But re-think your decision regarding BitcoinXT. This discussion belongs here, and you are doing more harm then good at the moment.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:59:25
What I want are moderators that listen to the community and not moderators enforcing their view on the community.
Moderators certainly do a good job keeping spam and garbage away from this subreddit (and thank you for doing it!). However, at the moment they are doing more harm than good.
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:15:34

For BitcoinXT it is very clear that the majority of users considers this ontopic. So act accordingly!
PS thanks for cleaning up spam, and stuff that does not belong here!

Bigger blocks require more resources and therefore cause more centralization is too simple (and not correct). When larger blocks are needed, this means that the adoption of Bitcoin has increased. More people and more businesses will run Bitcoin and some of them have an incentive to run a full node (like my business for example).
Thought experiment: if the block size would be 1 kB, would we have more or less nodes? It is pretty obvious that such a system would not attract many users and therefore almost no nodes would exist.
More users and companies will result in more full nodes, not less!
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:15:59
I agree. Most people would like to bring Bitcoin to a global scale (and keep its decentralized nature). 
There is indeed almost no one openly in favor of B. Most people and businesses want to increase the block size rather sooner than later. And then there is a small number of people that argues that the block size needs to be increased at some point in time. 
However, what I am missing from many in the "*let's do it at some point*" is a defined set of criteria *when* they would agree to an increased block size (and to *which* block size). Otherwise, it is hard for me (and others) to see a difference to the "*opposing every block size increase*" camp.
So, could you please define as precisely as possible under which circumstances you would agree to increase the block size, and to which size?
(Sorry, if you have stated this somewhere before)

The sum of difficulty from now to Nov 2013 (everything before is neglectable) is 1,214,951,333,601. 
Dividing this number by the the current difficulty (51,076,366,303) results in 23.787.
In other words: if someone has about 360 PH/s (all of the current mining capacity) he could rebuild the whole blockchain in about 24*2 = 48 weeks (which is slightly less than year). 
According to my own calculations creating such an alternative blockchain would cost roughly $200 mn .
@_date: 2015-07-29 09:39:29
If we have a reorganisation for 10,000+ blocks then certainly something is going completely wrong. However, that would also be true for 9,000 block reorg. So at the end of the day I wonder what the benefit of the checkpoints is.
What do you mean by "that checkpoints are not a lock-in mechanism"?
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:17:34
The question was how long it would take to restart the blockchain from scratch. The answer is almost 1 year if you have 360 PH/s available.
You are correct, that the blockchain would grow in the meantime.
I think the question is more of theoretical nature anyway. Checkpoints would prevent a large reorder of this magnitude.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:58:50
The 100 mn number is misleading (to put it mildly). As others have already pointed out it is probably closer to 2-3 million.

How can they if they do not even know what segwit is? You can spend your own coins though.

The numbers that Guy provided are correct. We did calculations on our own and ended up with similar numbers. 
Bitmain 70% is not the number to use. The electricity cost provided by Guy are a very accurate approximation and everyone from the ASIC / mining industry knows that 100 mn is completely wrong.
Read the postings by Sam Cole (former ASIC manufacturer who was also aware of ASIC boost, Guy Corem or Timo Hanke who holds the patent). All of them come to the same conclusion that ASIC boost is not a major driver in the industry. 
Also if you quote Jimmy Song, please give the full context:
"Guy is talking about the current state of the network and Bitmain’s current savings to use ASICBoost. Essentially, he’s saying it’s not worth it for Bitmain now to use ASICBoost since it only saves $2M in a business that’s making a lot more.
Greg is talking about the theoretical future state of the network and a miner’s potential savings should the network reach a theoretical equilibrium point. Essentially, he’s saying that the it may be worth it for a mining company to benefit greatly in using ASICBoost in the future."
Again, 100 mn is completely misleading.

The purpose of the "difficulty bomb" is to ensure that a hardfork takes places. Nothing more, nothing less. So miners / nodes are forced to upgrade the software (switching to PoS could be one option, or postponing the "difficulty bomb" another).

Good explanation Cryptolution. I started algo trading Bitcoin (and other cryptos) long time ago by doing arbitrage between mtgox/tradehill/exchb. Haha, these were great times. The market has become way more professional since than.
If you want to trade larger amounts you normally want to avoid changing the market price, because "eating through the order book" costs you money. The technical term for that is [slippage](
If you want to reduce slippage, use a bot. For example, our algorithm is optimized for splitting large orders up into smaller pieces and to inject them into the market without much effect. This is the correct way doing it for large orders, unless you hope for a psychological effect.

The mining industry is heavily centralized already. Requiring more bandwidth for mining pools will not change anything about it. 
I agree, that mining centralization is not a healthy situation. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 12:47:08


The converse is true:
* on node level both are roughly equal at he moment
* on mining level Ether has a far higher degree of decentralization as everyone with a GPU can mine Ether (there is an unhealthy level of concentration in Bitcoin on the mining level)
* Ethereum has several teams that develop different clients, so is better decentralized
