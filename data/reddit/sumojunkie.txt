Makes perfect sense to me. Definitely a market led by the whales but I don't see any harm in owning a Bitcoin if it does hit these projected numbers. But you are right. As soon as my dad asked "what gives it value" it made me lose a little faith in it. The price is essentially just the owners agreeing it is worth that much. However I also think the limited supply will cause the price to rise when demand goes up. Many things are pushing many people towards crypto, and they always choose Bitcoin.

Y'all are really killing me driving this home :( I can't get a damn job yet so I'm just hoping it doesn't get too expensive, or worst case scenario is the growth is so fast that buying 1 BTC takes more money than I can earn in a year. Because I know in a few years it'll be $200K at least, and no 18 year old has that salary

Thanks for some reassurance man. I think I'm being overly greedy just focusing on the money to be made, but I hate feeling left out on such a great opportunity. Feels good even just to be told I will have a similar opportunity.

If BTC can wait a few more months for me to turn 18 and get a job, I'd be a happy youngun

This does bring a tear to my eye :,) At these current rates $1,200 can get a little less than 0.1, I'll keep stacking sats, though

There's always that. But I don't think I could start a successful company unless there was an opportunity in a field I was very passionate about. The only thing I can think of being passionate about is making money. I'm passionate about my friends too, they are always  but Zuckerberg already made a company out of them

Yup I'm actually ridiculously happy that I know about BTC. I don't know anyone my age even thinking about buying it. Even if I do just get .1BTC, that's still a lot!

That's the power of Bitcoin engineering

You can't get SpaceX stock? Wow I didn't know that. I'll be keeping my eye on the industry over the years. Sooner or later we're going to need to start mining our Solar System.

The next Bitcoin is going to be the stocks of whichever asteroid mining company perfects the process first

Have you ever used the [Bitcoin.com]( thingy to buy? I was thinking about doing that since I read some negative things about coinbase. My dad is going to be the one putting in his information so I don't want anything sketchy to happen that will put him off of his son's plan. I already have an encrypted email and a bunch of huge 12-16 character passwords plus 2FA protecting all my crypto related accounts so I'll be holding it. So excited!

Dude.. you're right. Talk about a kick in the pants. I'm aware we only get one life and my biggest fear is being a normal person, our existence is too lucky to waste. Some people have different definitions of success and are happy with different things. My definition involves having a lot of money, intelligence, and friends. I tell myself every day that I can't fail, not because it's impossible, but because I am counting on myself to succeed. Forex and TA and charts and all will always be there for me. Thanks for the advice, Bitcoin isn't the only thing, and I have many tools to succeed.

Comparing the two, bitcoin.org also looks more "official". I was under the impression that bitcoin.com was the official website or something. But everything on it is Bitcoin Cash themed so it was kinda weird. I feel bad for anyone banking on BCH or BSV
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:42:54
Truly great to hear! What's got me scared is all the people calling for a $200k Bitcoin before Q2 of 2020 is wrapped up. Other than that, you're right! Those people must be a little too bullish
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:41:54
That's what got me back into BTC, I knew about crypto for a long time but never knew there was money to be made. Until I stumbled on a thread of ChainLink hodlers thinking they were at the start of a huge parabolic run. Then I figured I should probably look into this crypto thing.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:10:13
My dad always pushed me to get into the stock market. Personally I never liked it very much. I should have added, I sold my dirt bike recently for $1,200, I got my parents with me on the Bitcoin train and we're buying some tomorrow with that money. Of course, it's their money, not mine, y'know. They won't be putting in $100 a month like I wish they would. But I take comfort that my family will have at least some amount of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:38:28
That seems unrealistic to me, at least in the next 50 years, but I've been wrong before. Wait, no, I forgot they just send probes to do that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:32:20
I was wondering why the hell Bitcoin Cash was all over that site, even on the wallet it's promoted. Thanks for telling me why. And yeah the rate was bad too, I put in 1200 to test the water and it said far less than .1BTC, at 12K, that's what I should get. Thanks for the heads up man.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:50:36
You're spot on with the forex. I always had that on backburners as a plan to make big money, but I thought it was too difficult for someone my age to learn. The main thing attracting me to BTC is that if I put in $12K it can potentially grow to $10 million later. It seems so crazy to me how many people are going to be rich just because of that. I am also expecting BTC to become something of a de facto currency. It's really about making the money and feeling proud of owning a whole Bitcoin, which will be so coveted. Honestly, life just isn't fair and I gotta accept that. I'm going to get a job and start buying as much as I can in a few months once I'm 18, I can only hope I can accumulate a whole Bitcoin before it hits something like $200K
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:52:51
That is exactly why I'm not even batting an eye at the altcoins. Not until I have one bitcoin. I recognized pretty quick how Bitcoin was going to be the crypto experiencing massive gains, and was always going to be the mainstream crypto. Trust me, as soon as I turn 18 I'm working like hell and pouring every cent into BTC. All I can do is hope the growth does not outpace me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:27:52
 Really? Shit... better reopen my Coinbase account. It was very tricky opening an account, usually they just say "Yer under 18 so ya can't make an account" but I managed to get verified, just unable to use the account. What about the [bitcoin.com]( wallet?
