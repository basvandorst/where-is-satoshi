Plenty of refunds were processed, when he got cold feet he could have requested one and exercised a little patience, or returned it after he'd gotten his chargeback through paypal.
This is exactly the kind of immature attitude that shows how much of a crutch the current payment systems/modes of thinking are, and how much it lets people get away with.  "Poor me, I made a mistake and ordered something that I thought would make me rich.  Now I *DESERVE* to keep something I didn't pay for because I made a bad call."  
Seriously, it's fucking juvenile.

I tossed up some templates for some paper wallets here: 
Based em on the size of the frames I was putting them in, but it'd be negligible to make them bill sized. Since these were designed to be used in frames, I didn't include any where for the private keys, but could come up with that pretty quickly if you wanted.
I also put together this template for a giveaway my wife worked on:  which has a space for private keys.  Just fold in half and tape closed (3"x3").

"I'm pretty sure..." == I'm pulling it out of my ass.
It's rough, I get it.  Ordered too late, hashrate spiked without anyone knowing how fast it would come, late delivery times... But just coming up with what sounds good to you cause you feel burned moves the responsibility of your actions onto them, when they are only a hardware vendor.  It's not a magic money making machine that they stiffed you on, it's what was for sale and you bought it.
But hey, this is reddit, come up with some more wild conjecture and pump that karma.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:18:14
Regardless of how you feel about BFL and their "broken promises", ordering a chargeback and still accepting the delivered product is still theft.
Pre-ordered a non-existant piece of hardware and were surprised when it took longer than expected?  You made that choice, and no matter how much you'd like to try and justify it through whatever bullshit reasons, it's still stealing.

I couldn't find anything else comparable at the time so I invested in these.  With the updated firmwares in a warm environment, ten of them are averaging at about 8.5gh.  
The first bummer thing is they are very touchy when it comes to temperature, so to run them cool at home I need to also run the ac, and with power costing about $0.34 per kwh, it cuts out about 1/3 of what I earn.
The second bummer thing was the wait.  It took about 8 weeks for me to get then after I ordered.

I used the image you gave as a template so nothing important would get covered:
From what I understand, the image gets printed on the card first (including a layer with things like the upper lefthand logo, upper righthand wireless symbol, month/date, the lower righthand visa and DEBIT).  Then the numbers are embossed through the card.
If you gave me your bitcoin address, I could mess around with how it's displayed (e.g. Use an entire QR address, include a human readable address and a laser scannable barcode).  I just used the colors from the bitcoin logo, so those are easily changed as well.

Here is my try:  
That's the firstbits QR for my address, by the way...
**EDIT **
That orange square in the upper right corner is for the wireless icon that's shown on the card.  The left guilloche is centered over the card's chip.
Don't know if you wanted any other text or stuff, figured if you give me your btc address I can put that on there in a "security" type strip with a scannable barcode as well.

Make me an offer.  :D  I paid about 7k for everything, and the turn around from Butterfly labs is still at about 8 weeks.
@_date: 2012-06-01 07:45:07
Seeing as there are 10 BFLs @ $633.00 each ($6,330.00),  add to that the corsair AX1200 Powersupply ($280), the custom cables (18 BTC or $93.78), the power supply tester ($30) and the 12 port USB hub, that brings it to $6,763.78, or around 1,300 BTC.  Adding in the 8 week average delivery time from Butterfly Labs, where this instead would be mining (at a stock rate of 8,320 mhps), brings in an additional 295 BTC (or around $1,531.71), then the bare minimum bid I'm considering is 1,595.29 btc, or $8,295.49.

I'm only interested in selling them all together at this point.  I figure I'll see what happens after a week, then maybe part them out.
As to my identity, not sure what I could do in order to validate that.  I identify through  using my pgp key, and would have no problem verifying any other info to anyone serious about buying them.

The first time I can remember buying BTC was around feb of last year.  I'd heard about it on a podcast (This Week in Tech i think) and started hanging out in   I remember when it passed a buck per BTC, and everyone was freaking out (Dollar Parity Party, wooo!), I knew it had real potential.
I didn't have anything worth mining on (NVIDIA... :( ) but I knew I had to get in on it.  I'll probably catch some flack, but I had always had an interest in how the stock market worked, and figured this was a way to get into speculating on the ground floor... What a wild ride.
I think the first thing I ever paid for in BitCoin was one of those bit-bills.  Just wanted to see how it looked.  $10 for a 10 BTC card, not bad at the time...  I've bought hardware with it, starbucks and itunes credit with it, and even now I try to look for people selling in BTC rather than $$ when I need something.
Now I mine, and it's actually the only income I have at the moment.  It's not a whole lot (it pays for itself and a little on the side), but personally I think it can really only go up from here.

I've compiled both cgminer and bfgminer on OSX 10.7.3 on a Mac Mini Server (quadcore), and they work just fine for mining with BFLs.  Running Pooler's minerd on the side as well gets me about 40 khps for litecoin as well.
Setting every thing up that you need (xcode, mac ports, dependancies) can be daunting, however.  The easiest mining solution I know of is  . Java based, runs stable in OSX now, and it gets comparable, if not better hash rates than most miners.

I guess I should clarify that easier means that i can use bitcoin directly for amazon credit via Gyft, it’s pretty much instantaneous (minutes for a digital code), and that I pay a considerable amount less than I would at the Microsoft store, or anywhere else I might be able to purchase it locally.
As the the arguments for or against amazon, I’ll leave that to someone else to consider.
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:58:00
Kinda old news.  Whenever it first came out, I loaded some BTC into my Microsoft account to reup xboxgold or whatever.  Can’t use it for xboxgold.  Converts at the time of transfer as well, so even though I didn’t use it for like a year, there was no gain in value.  Can’t get it back as BTC either.

You plug it in to your computer, and press the button when it lights up.  It should be discovered by your computer as a USB keyboard.  Depending on how long you hold down the button, depends on which key it outputs.
There are two types of presses:
A "short" press typically lasts less than a second, and will give you one key.
A "long" press takes about three seconds, and will spit out a different key.
Which press/key you need depends on how you set it up in your Gox security center.

Well, using  interested BTC buyers would get in touch with me (or I with them, when I was interested in selling BTC) and we'd agree on an amount (say 5BTC for $500).  They'd then run and pick up a moneypak and send me the code on the back, allowing me to see that it was funded with the total amount ($500) and I could then instantly deposit it in my account.  Then I'd send the BTC to the address they wanted.

If you want relatively smooth payouts, go with a pool.  If you feel like gambling, and aren't too worried about how often you get paid, try solo, but be prepared to wait for at least a week+ before finding a block.
[Bitminter.com]( is nice, since it has it's own Java Mining engine which works with just about any platform (I've tried it on windows, osx and linux).  If you don't mind paying a little extra to the pool (1.5%), you can opt to use their "perks" for instant payouts, and even payouts on orphaned blocks.  They use the PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), so it takes a day or so to settle in to your expected payouts.  You can take a look at a pool comparison that explains what the different payout methods are here: 
Some may argue that it's better for the security of the network to use smaller pools to spread out the hashrate, but I think it's more about personal preference at this point.  Should any large pool approach 50%, I think wither the miners or the pool operators will opt to switch out.  You can see the top pools here: 
Normally, the bigger the pool, the smaller per-block reward you get, but the pool will solve blocks more frequently.  Smaller pools mean a bigger per-block reward, but you open yourself up more to the luck of the pool and can go for long periods without finding a block.
How are you mining, with windows or linux?  What about the mining software you are using?  I've opted for cgminer/linux as it takes the least amount of work day-to-day, as everything can be setup to run automatically (though building everything and setting it up the server and scripts can be an interesting exercise, especially if you are new to it).  Reboots, monitoring, mining all can run unattended, which makes it super nice.

We believe in the potential Bitcoin has, and can only hope for a day when we can pay for everything directly in BTC.  Is it really better to just hoard it and hope it takes off, or try to use it in our day-to-day lives?


To us, when we bought the cards from Gyft, we paid in BTC what it was worth, nothing more.  We didn't see any exchange fees or markup.  As to convenience, we show them the gift card, they enter in the number, and our items are paid for.  I'd say that it's pretty comparable to using a credit card or cash. 


Bitcoin (through both mining and investments) is our primary source of income. Instead of wasting it on potential exchange and bank transfer fees (as well as the week+ long waits), we decided to use it a little more directly.  For those of us that *are* incorporating Bitcoin into our day to day lives, Gyft is a tremendous advantage.
I don't know of any Bitcoin accepting company that doesn't touch "fiat" somewhere along the way; to cover their costs, to pay for shipping, to purchase supplies.  As great as it would be if they didn't have to, we just aren't there yet.

I'm pretty sure it's in:

Make sur eyou quite Bitcoin-QT first!  Then just move your old wallet (in the terminal):
    cd  ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
    mv wallet.dat wallet.dat.OLD
Alternatively, you can hit Command+Shift+G in Finder, and type in:
    ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
and do your moving and deleting of the wallet.dat there.
When you are done, restart Bitcoin-QT and it'll automatically generate a new wallet.dat on startup.  Give it a bit, it might have to rescan (not redownload) the blockchain.

CatBawx has a pretty sane take on it.  The BFL hate-train is in full steam, and everyone is getting on board.  Nevermind that they were the first company making specialized hardware for mining (their FPGAs), or that they were the first to pursue ASICs.
Anyone who ordered should have known the risk.  Their FPGAs came out late, why wouldn't their ASICs?  I didn't pay to have it in October (wishful thinking), I paid to be first in line when they started shipping (which I was, got my SC Singles last week).
Sure, they were late getting orders out, but they are still selling the most power-efficient mining hardware.
tl;dr  It's easy to get on the BFL hate-train.

BFL isn't in the business of selling bitcoin hopes and dreams.  They were selling undeveloped hardware that could do specific SHA256 operations at a specific speed.  Not an ROI, not a guaranteed number of Bitcoin generated per day.


Thanks.  When customers turn rabid at the thought of losing all of their imagined money, ditch all of the responsibility of their own actions in favor of class action lawsuits and petty threats, it's no surprise to me that some of the forward facing employees at BFL lose their shit.  Those employees are real people, having to deal with outside circumstances that they can't control, and they have to listen to this kind of garbage every day, a majority of which is spread by people with no stake at all involved.
But I'm a shill, I guess.  I flew over there to meet them, to see what they were all about first-hand.  To shake hands and talk, not to point fingers and rant.  I already knew that complications arise from my early FPGA pre-orders, that I may not get my order for months (and months, and months) and was willing to accept things however it turned out.  I admit it got close towards the end, and that sucked badly, but I was tossing dice, not making some kind of informed investment decision.  
The point I'm making is that *I understood when I pre-ordered that it was a gamble, and if everything crashed and burned, it was completely my fault.*
Face it, investing in Bitcoin itself is a helluva gamble. Go ahead and compound it by investing in uncompleted custom hardware (which is just about every ASIC vendor now, other than Avalon, ASICMiner and BFL), and throw in the fact that it all entirely depends on both difficulty and the trading price of BTC.  It's gambles all the way down, and to truly believe otherwise is naive.

Well, I've never done this kind of thing before, so I'm not quite sure.  I wanted a place that anyone can go to ask anything about Bitcoin they might want to know.  The girls at Chad Lou's were super nice and said we could have the meetup there.
I guess it could be a place for people to trade notes about mining, or trading, of even offer a safe place to trade face-to-face:  I think there are definite benefits for small businesses, so I'd like to try and get some local companies to accept it.
In the beginning, it's a kinda whatever's goes kinda thing.  If anyone has any ideas for where this goes, bring them on weds!
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:44:00
I'm in the same boat.  Pre-ordered FPGAs, had to wait a little while.  Pre-ordered ASICS, had to wait a long while.
But they delivered a product that worked the way they advertised (actually better, I was able to overclock most of my FPGAs to 896MH, and my SC Singles were all within 1-4GH of the 60GH advertised).
It's a tough spot for miners now though, and it doesn't look like it'll easier any time soon.

in the withdrawal center, you have the option to link it to a bank account (add withdraw method) using the IBAN / SWIFT/BIC / ABA / BSB Australia / Japanese Domestic Transfer numbers.  Once it's setup, it's a regular bank to bank transfer (for me in the US anyhow).

Basically, greendot provides a reloadable Visa or Mastercard for Walmart.  It works just like a regular debit or credit card, even allows you to take out money via an ATM.  It accepts direct deposit (from employers), you can reload with cash at one of their ATMs, or you can use MoneyPaks.
MoneyPaks are a way to reload these cards (as well as other cards, like PayPal) using cash.  You go to a store that sells them (Walmart, CVS, 7-11), and buy the card (normally around $5).  Then you load the card with cash (up to $1,000.00 at Walmart, $500 at other places).  You scratch off the back of the MoneyPak, and enter the number into your account, and the cash is instantly credited.
The biggest draw for us was the ease of use.  Interested buyers could go with cash and pick one up, then we could have the money instantly transferred to our account.  I've never had a chargeback using them, and since it takes minutes, lets us send the BTC almost instantly.
@_date: 2013-07-17 23:25:29

I also pre-ordered their FPGA singles (last year in feb, got em in may).  Waiting for new tech is a pain, but it comes with the territory.  They mine well, and their overall support has been great.  They offer up and down locked firmware, and you can run auto tune to get them comfortable in whatever environment you put them in.
I preordered their ASICs back in June (upgraded my singles to SCs).  I was prepared for a wait, and even now I think it's worth it.  I opted to collocate them there in KC, and shipped my host and singles in about a month ago (sure, it was a little premature).  They have been super cool about it though, they plugged in my host there, and have been letting me mine with my FPGAs till they switch them to SCs.
Sure, there were times when a reply took a while via email, or I couldn't get the answers I wanted that very minute. Uncharted technologies and workflows that very few have ventured into, coupled with the problem of too-much-too-soon has put them in a tough spot, but I see them as a small company that has tried to tackle a very difficult problem, and are honestly trying to do the right thing as best they can.

Wait, where did these arbitrary rules to living on bitcoin come from?
We mine our bitcoin, and don't have employers.  Buying things "DIRECTLY" is ~~close to impossible now~~ easier now than it's ever been, but still kinda difficult, and in order to make ends meet we have to pay out some bills in dirty, dirty fiat (haha).  Services like Gyft have made a huge difference in how we get to use our bitcoin day-to-day.
And these venders that accept bitcoin via BitPay, how is that "DIRECTLY", when they can choose to cash it out instantly to dirty, dirty fiat as well?

The guy who updates it has been pretty cool.  I told him that my order was shown as delivered, when it actually wasn't, and he updated it.

Yeah, if you don't already have a BlockChain.info wallet,  take the time to set one up.  It's way easier to do on a laptop/desktop, then just link it to your phone.

@_date: 2013-07-09 23:04:27

@_date: 2013-09-07 03:05:25
They didn't buy an ROI, they bought X amount of hashes to be delivered at an unknown date.
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:49:30


Preorders I believe opened in September of 2010, and they shipped in April/May, so 9-ish months.  Pre-orders for ASICs opened in June of last year, for a target delivery of October.  It's been about 9 months since October.  People saying it's been a YEAR since they ordered are forgetting October.
And the FPGAs did have issues.  Bad PSUs got shipped, fans went bad, units would throttle.  But they worked through all of those, with little if no cost to the end user.  Funny how no one remembers that.


Which I was told about a while ago, so I got my own power supplies.  Why should I give a shit that they can't send me one, or choose to wait till they can, if I can go to the store and pick one up in 15 minutes?

You can mine with a mac, but it involves quite a bit of banging around.
* [BitMinter.com]( is a good all-in-one, just needs java.  Need to mine on their pool though.
* [MacMiner]( should work, but I haven't been keeping up with it.
So far the best success with compile-it-yourself is [BFGMiner](  You'll need to install xcode + commandline utilities in order to build it, as well as [MacPorts]( or [Homebrew]( to get all the dependancies required.  I haven't succesfully got [CGMiner]( working on OSX for a long time, so I've stuck mostly with BFGMiner.
If you want to set it up as a server, you'll also want to look into reading up on [LaunchD]( to schedule jobs.  [Lingon3]( works really well if you don't want to do all that from scratch.

Guess I am a shill then, since I did invest with BFL and I pre-ordered both the FPGA Units as well as their ASICs.  Worked well enough for me, but then, I knew there was risk involved and was prepared to take responsibility for my decisions had it worked out differently.
So sure, those of you that aren't shills, blame your poor decision making and risk assessment on others, and sue.

I'm really trying to wrap my head around the state of mind of the anti-BFL crowd.  I've noticed over the years how quickly bitcoin-related bandwagons form, regardless of proof, logic, or critical thinking, but this trend towards legal action seems ridiculous.
This kind of mob-mentality, arm-chair criticism only makes the community as a whole look worse.  Go after the people that **have** scammed, the fake companies, those that have gone dark and no longer reply to requests or emails.  It's funny, that with so many confirmed scammers and thieves (of not-so-small sums of both BTC and USD) over the course of the last two years, no one seems to be going after them with as much alacrity as the few businesses that are still around.  Jack shit has been accomplished, and there is actual proof.
The whole thing is a gamble, and has been since the beginning.  Bitcoin is an experiment, the businesses around them are experiments, and the custom built hardware is as well.  Do your due dilligence, research where you see fit, and take ownership of your own gambles.
*cue the "paid BFL Shill" responses*
I pre-ordered their FPGAs in February of last year, before knowing if they'd ever deliver.  The cries of "vaporware" and "total scam" were just as loud then, but it was wholly my decision to gamble my money on them.  They delivered late, sure, but they delivered a professional-level FPGA product that is still more efficient than anything else that came to market (except for the ASICs, of course), and they won my trust.
I pre-ordered their ASIC line as soon as I could, specifically because they delivered a superior product before.  I knew it was going to be a wait (though not this long), but I understand that difficulties down the chain of suppliers can crop up, and when they do, are unavoidable.
I called them up and asked if they'd mind me stopping by a few days before Bitcoin2013 to check things out, and they had no problems at all showing me around.  From everything I saw, and everyone I've met, they are a small company trying as hard as they can to get their product delivered, in light of the delays and problems they have encountered.
I got to see a single hashing at 57GH, in person.  I got to meet all of these great people that are constantly demonized online by people who have never met them. [ They even let me take a picture with one of their wafers.](
I knew when I pre-ordered the ASICs that this was a gamble.  But this time it wasn't a gamble about whether they'd deliver or not, it was to be as close to the front of the line when they did.  Hindsight's a bitch, full of wishes and "i should haves", but anyone who thinks anything related to Bitcoin is a "sure thing" needs to take a long look at the risks they take.
BFL is far from a scam.  I went there, I met them, and have been waiting in line just like everyone else.
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:36:02
These threads are getting so repetitive.
If you invested with them, then you should have weighed the risks of giving a startup company your money, and anticipated delays for your money-printing machines to arrive, based on their previous performance.

I've known him for a while from IRC and the BFL Forums &amp; Shoutbox.  He used to be a volunteer moderator there, but bowed out to setup this company and avoid any conflicts of interest.  He took the time and out-of-pocket money for lawyers to secure his mining initiative, and has plans well into the future for upgrades to the hashrate per share.
You can read a description of the company and offering here:

I think it's a valid option and it's up to the user to use a secure passphrase.
After all the trouble I went through having to re-establish my GAuth keys the first few times I lost them due to an upgrade, then having to backup my own keys to encrypted containers and keep them up to date, it was a lot of trouble to go through, especially with how many new services use GAuth every day.
When I found out that Authy essentially did the same thing, without me having to do all the foot work, it saved me a lot of time and trouble.  It's encrypted/decrypted on the phone, and it's easy to keep up to date.
