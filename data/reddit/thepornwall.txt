Our team recently made our first prototype to help sites do this!  We don't require any signup to use the code snippet and are able to do tighter integration with the content site to better protect the content!

We will have an option for pay per view based versus time based access soon.

Porn and bitcoins are a perfect match. Everyone around the world can monetize in less than 30 seconds. Thepornwall is a paywall for porn. Your visitors pay for 1 hour of access to your site with no signup or credit card processing required.
We handle the hard parts of bitcoin payments and session management so you can focus on sexy time ;)
With bitcoin, there are no chargebacks and your users can feel safe and secure knowing they don't need to share sensitive personal information.
Feedback is appreciated! Installing on your site is easy and can be done in seconds.

We have taken feedback into account and lowered the fees. We want the service and fees to be desirable for all sorts of users and now pay out over 95% of the transaction to you!

This is a super technical thing to do with 99% of users having no clue what you just said means :)
We do have plans for a client side 'API' that would allow for detecting if the user has paid and then loading content accordingly. This requires the website owner to do more work to get started. Our current offering is a balance between ease of use and protecting content.

thepornwall partywall covers the content until the user pays. We make it super easy to implement and pay without signing up for either side. This is much better than the current experience on pay sites.
