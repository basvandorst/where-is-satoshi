So the 500,000 doge coins I received for free that I converted into bitcoin then sold for fiat means nothing??? Come on are you that incompetent?

Then lets pay the IRS with bitcoin!!!! If the want to tax it.

 Diluting up the ase scam!!   What's happening is bitcoin is being diluted by the other easier alt coins that are mined. It's easy to mine them now. People are then converting them to BTC and selling. Why hasn't anyone noticed this? Investors should check the cracks of the program here. Mine some scam coin then convert to BTC sell. That how you make money. Lol!!!!

It keeps rolling because a select few want it to.

I'm a hard believe in bitcoin but this must stop before it goes anywhere we want it to.

That's why they shut down Gox! Hello!

400 to 600$ is the new stable locked in price for a long time. That blows!! Still a nice innovation to society!

China news will keep coming until it does not affect the price anymore. It's part of the innovation.

As gox collapsed we are all policing and brainstorming what has happened. We are regulating bitcoin ourselves. This is happening right before us just look at all the post in here. By the time Ben figures out how TO we will already have it done. If you study and look deeper into bitcoin besides the great protocol and monetary benifits. Bitcoin is much much more. "We are the experiment". Gox lost or missing 7% of coins. Mmm! Some of the smartest people behind bitcoin don't even realize it. Bitcoin will prevail as planned! This is the new way of life. IMO!!

I've been for a year and have made an extra 20k cash by converting my crap coins into bitcoins then selling my BTC. The more alt coins that spring up the more my pockets fill up. If this was not happening BTC would be at 2500$ easily. This is a MAJOR problem right now.

I lost coins on gox! We donated to the experiment. Bitcoin could be shutdown with a push of a button. Blockchain.org is a website like every other. The question is why haven't they done so???

After reading this document bitcoin timing and technology make perfect sense. It's a great innovation indeed. The real reasons are outlined in the document. IMO! July 1 2014

That's correct! No mention of bitcoin. It basically reads we are going to control all of your assets and accounts in the u.s and abroad. LAWS like Cyprus,Ukraine,Artgentina already have.

That's why we had that spike yesterday!!! I should buy another
