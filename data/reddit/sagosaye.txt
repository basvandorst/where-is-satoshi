Coinbase SUCKS !! How are they getting away with FRAUD,  horror customer service and more scams?

Coinbase has shock me beyond.  Do they sue people as well as take their coin and fiat?

That sounds about right.  Then diminishing returns beging to materialize and morph. However,  that was @ 12 years ago and then I began to waddle in shallow water as the post above explained.

Throw in a few more bucks a week to cover the cost of transportation, etc.

It would be easier to convenience them that the world is flat. ,�� Terminating the addition took me 36 years. Imagine if I had the self disapline to have put the cost of the 2-3 packs a daily plus a couple of dollars a week to cove the cost of gas, wear and tear on my vehicles  and an additional  $5 per week that the insurance actuaries had me pay in the higher price of insurance and invested the grad total accumulated into BTC back in 2009 what my net worth would be today. Not to mention that I would have more time to live so that I could enjoy traveling around helping people help themselves or get nack on their feet after a catastrophic event. Hey man its my fantasy let me elaborate. ☺��
