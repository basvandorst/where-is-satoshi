Farewell. I plan to do something similar. When I get enough return on my investment to move out of country or spend 12 months not working at a job, I'll cash out and go on with my plans.

There is no range. Do not mine bitcoin with a PC. 
I have a $5000 PC at home due to my work, and I'm not mining. There is no point in mining with a PC.
An asic machine costs similar to a good PC but it mines like 6000x more than a PC can.
If you want to mine, research ASIC machines, learn their differences, pick one and purchase. Put it in your dorm room, plug in free electricity and start mining 6000 times faster than you can compared to a similar priced PC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:07:54
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:47:51
Don't do it.
Not because stealing electricity is bad, blah blah blah... But because you won't mine anything with $200 builds. Bitcoin isn't mined using CPUs. It's not even mined using GPUs anymore. People use ASICs to mine it, they'll be mining a million times faster than you do. ASIC = Application specific integrated circuit.
If you absolutely want to mine something, go for another altcoin that can be mined with CPUs. Monero can be mined using CPUs for example.

No, that long of a domain is usually purchased by domain squatters. If amazon is creating a coin or a wallet, they will pick a much easier name.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:17:43
This is a terrible, terrible image.
It doesn't say who is Roger Ver, except a small text saying "ceo of bitcoin.com"
For newcomers, this means **"owner/creator of bitcoin is a criminal"**.
This image has absolutely **zero** indication that "bitcoin cash" is different from "real bitcoin".
It has a few source links that are way too long to type in a browser.
This is a terrible, terrible image.

I will not back down!!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:14:39
They are still buying those names to prevent domain squatters. They will not use those names in production.

According to Electrum's description, you only need the seed to recreate your wallet and access your coins.

No it's not. It's actually supposed to be annoying.

Sure, let's all downvote the smart trading insight and upvote the very basic "let's hodl" recommendation to the sky.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:55:27
Do you even know what "trade" is? Change of hands is ALL there is for the price. Nothing else ever affects the price. There is not a single thing on earth that affects bitcoin's price other than what people are buying/selling it for at that exact point in time.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:01:59
1. Complicated formatting? You mean simply writing 1. and 2. before newlines and it automatically converts to bullet points? Give it a try. I only used my phone in this entire thread.
2. Ok.
3. I earn 30% instead of 60% during an increase, but I do not lose during a decrease while you may lose 30%. Because I do not hold for dear life, I sell high, buy low.
4. Supply/demand works only if someone supplies. Holding means you are withdrawing yourself from the market and waiting to see what happens. You do not affect the price. Other people, who make the supply and demand will effect the price. That's what I'm saying. Supply affects price, but if you don't supply or demand, you aren't the one affecting the price. This is why "HODL to increase the btc price" is meaningless. You want to affect the price? You buy or sell.
5. See number 4.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:18:45
If everyone hodl's, there is no sale, no price. 
You have very basic understanding of (any) trade market, I'm sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:44:48
No one cares about the supply. 95% of people in this market doesn't even know there is a limited supply. The price is increasing because those people are seeing that when you buy bitcoin at $X, you can sell it at $X+Y. This increases FOMO, fear of missing out, so more people join in the market and drive the price up.
If you buy at $X and never sell, then you are doing nothing for contributing to the price. You are just someone who purchased bitcoin at $X. The guy/market who sold you that bitcoin has helped increase the price. SELLING FOR PROFIT increases the price, that's a fact.
1. You BUY from someone who SELLs. Price increases a bit.
2. You wait until you make profit or loss
3. If you are at profit, you SELL to someone and increase the price a bit.
4. You HODL if you are at loss, so you don't contribute to a price decrease.
Please stop telling people to HODL **if they are at a profit**. "HOLD!" is a good advice if the price is decreasing. If it's increasing, you keep buying and selling for profit, and the whole market goes up along with your profits.

So, you ran out of arguments and now attacking the person in unrelated post histories. That shows you are a good fella.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:44:56
Yeah, pretty much, except I read what you call "counter arguments" and ignore them once it's obvious that they aren't really arguments.
The rest is point on.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:52:43
Buy at 8k, sell at 9k. Buy at 10k, sell at 11k. Buy at 12k, sell at 13k. You now have less bitcoin, but more dollars both as fiat or as bitcoin.
You think the big whales in the market is profiting or manipulating the price by just hodling?
Newbies, novices, inexperienced people believe buying and holding increases the price. No, selling at a profit increases the price and your profit. Buying and never selling does nothing to the price.
Selling at loss decreases the price, so don't do that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:43:37
Sure, sure... My phone auto-capitalizes k to K and I lose all credibility. Great, awesome argument.
Point me to the post where I said I'm an economics professor. Please, go ahead.
If you buy at 7k, sell at 8k, buy at 9k, sell again at 10k, you keep making profit each time. How is this hard to understand? 
BUY LOW, SELL HIGH. That's how you make money. That's how I made money during the last bitcoin crash. BUY AND NEVER SELL will help you crash alongside bitcoin. 
You are clueless. Please do not believe anything I say. Otherwise I would accidentally impose wisdom on someone like you. I don't want that now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:32:25
HODLing doesn't increase the price at all. SELLING HIGH increases the price.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:42:32
No I never added 1k between buys. I purchased less BTC each time, but still made profit on top of my original investment.
Also, in this scenario, if I knew it would go to 15k, I would hold after 8k. But by buying and selling, I not only help drive the price up, but also avoided price drops in between.
Bitcoin fluctuates. If you sell at profit without holding too long, you not only realize your profits, but also avoid losses in between, and also help drive the prices up.
I won't try to further teach you years of economics lessons. If all you know about market trading is "hold to make profit", then every single person would hold forever, and everyone would be millionaire. Does that make sense to you?
If holding increases the price, why doesn't everyone just hold, and get rich?
I'm trying to teach economics of market trade to a group of teenagers. I'm out. Go read an economics book and argue with me later.
Here is the introduction:
1. People holding FIAT money don't affect BTC price.
2. People holding BTC don't affect BTC price.
3. People SELLING BTC AT PROFIT will increase the price.
4. People SELLING BTC AT LOSS will decrease the price.
5. If you are buying, someone else is selling it to you.
See you in another thread.

Haha, you are looking through my post history and downvoting them all. And I'm the shitty person?
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:12:58
Three people who buy bitcoin with their pocket money they got from their mommies, and has only one argument saying "demand increases price".
Sure, half a trillion dollar markets are run on this principle. Keep believing these. Three strangers against one, three must definitely be more knowledgeable than one. It's not like people have vastly different educations or knowledge.
You posted in all of my history, you never were able to produce a counter-argument in any of those. You just said I'm a jerk. I jerk around ignorant people like you who had no idea what they are talking about. And I don't care if I'm downvoted. I write the truth, people don't like to be corrected, they become bigger jerks and start attacking my history one by one. They never find any incorrect information though.
You aren't the first do call me a jerk, you aren't the first person whom I'm smarter than. You don't want to learn from me because you think I'm a jerk, your loss.
I already made profit during last bitcoin crash from $16k to $8k. Knowing when to sell and buy makes you profit. You don't need to believe that I made a profit, you don't need to believe I'm telling the truth, you don't need to like me at all. Just try to realize people can be smarter or more educated than you. Those people can be jerks too. You'll meet successful jerks all the time in your life. They aren't actually jerks, they just don't try to win your love.

Who says it's 10K in the first place? If someone offers 10k for your blown up car, would you sell it?
If you knew someone else would offer 15k for it next month, would you sell it for 10k today?
Your car analogy has nothing to do with a trade marketplace. Try a different analogy.
Also, you apparently have no knowledge about market trading. Did you ever trade in markets before bitcoin?
