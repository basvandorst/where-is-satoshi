Did this get resolved? I have same right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:41:19
Nah, the wheel is at the wrong side.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:14:19
doesn't help to that, except increasing the appeal of bitcoins decentralization model vs so many centralized shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:28:50
Money for these guys is not what it is to us. It is an indicator of status, the more you make the better you are... That's what they live for.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:06:46
Google Denarium.
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:33:36
What is the disaster you are talking about? The world is better off than ever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:59:16
There are higher statuses in their game, might not seem so to us. They live for competition, and their net worth is the indicator.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:31:10
Will it tho? No.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:10:33
Your comment makes a lot of sense. It gives light to the bigger picture.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:15:57
I am very hung up on that. But, maybe I buy 50% before 50% after
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:57:38
Wow, lots of new info, thanks. Surely not gonna support chinese mining cartel.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:52:49
I do find core team more trustworthy. Maybe I tried too hard with the technicals, true. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:51:11
I second this, taken like 2 hours
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:58:50
Your comment is amazingly inspiring! Hope there will be more like you. Imagine even 1 % of e.g. Africans to start using bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:52
Helpful in its own way.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:04:29
That train seems to be gone.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:43:54
Haha thanks for your answer! Checking out the video now, even though I think I already learnt that it is best for bitcoin to keep the "backbone" blocks small to let it be possible for others than huge corporations to mine.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:31:37
Ok, thanks for clarifying. Hope I can get this sorted out.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:38:25
Thanks for your post, was clarifying.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:23:10
Thanks for your insight. This is the safe bet, sure. But I yearn for the benefit of purchasing BTC at a lower price to reach my goal of owning one. Still not sure which path I choose, perhaps diversifying 50/50 before and after. Or should I get it before the fork with 5500 or lower I might go all in before.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:01:54
I sincerely thank you for guiding me to read the both sides of the story. Done that now, and need to really think about this.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:33:58
And I read it already was, about 2 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:37:22
great comparison
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:14:19
"Never visit rbitcoin again. This sub was created by core team to spread propaganda and lies", would someone from there tell me.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:14:57
loled xD
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:59:57
You seem like you know this stuff and you support bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:13:29
Does not seem a good system... I also see second layers as much needed future, but they see them being something out of the original ethos of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:36:15
Wow. It's mind blowing how totally different opinions can people have. After gathering my information I have started to prefer smaller block sizes due to mining decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:39:06
That negativity prob is because of their agenda. Thanks for telling about your experience, this guides my way.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:29:15
Ah, the classic "don't do what I do"! :D
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:11:09
They could make throw-away accounts and spam it to their needs.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:31:49
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:31:22
For now.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:16:03
I hope it will. Seems too shaky for wide spread use and investors otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:29:02
I surely hope so. I wondered if I should have waited for the s2 fork to be over too, before investing. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:11:46
Gotta jerk some dick from the both sides :D
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:14:08
Is it worth using coinbase/gdax route as EU citizen? Transfering EUR to USD could bring some costs.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:46:32
Another possible option.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:05:59
Nice to hear about your experience from the both "camps". I think I can learn about this.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:18:07
Just bought today my first 0.2. Feels not safe, feels YOLO. But still feels good.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:42:11
Wow, thanks! I am about to make the same decision as you, partly because comments from guys like you, who have already thought a lot about this. That quote you gave was really good, gotta give that guy upvote aswell. Understand now why small blocks are for the best, even though they lose in performance!
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:47:14
I am willing to lose this money, yes. I can afford it and I am ready to take risks as a young man.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:25:12
I prefer conservative, long thought changes on this matter.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:16:23
Depends on your country, usually only profit
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:30:52
One local company from where I am from in the Nordics. They have informed that every customer who holds bitcoin on their website will be granted gold. But I already made the move to my wallet, which is pending. I did contact them. Hopefully they give me the gold. If it is worth anything...
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:33:29
Your comment is complicated but I think I got the point :P
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:43:00
Yeah. Well, I would also sell s2x coin, but there is a problem. I am using paper wallet and, to my understanding, I would have to create a new one, because when I proceed to sell those s2x's my wallet becomes hot.
So I would have to create a new paper wallet everytime these fucking forks come.. On the other hand I dont want to miss e.g. 300 dollars, if I would sell those shitcoins. Just dont bother to make new paper wallet all the time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:54:14
Very good point! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:02:28
Thank you very much! :-)
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:03:41
Thank you mate. Gl to you!
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:05:44
Yeah, I am trying to learn and form my own opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:47:24
Willing to lose all.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:27:25
Good to know you have chosen bitcoin. And you are right, that's exactly what they would say. 
It is hard to come here in the middle of all this. I think it would be easier to pick sides and know things if I would have followed for a longer time.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:32:10
Hah, thanks! been studying this all for a few days now.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:00:51
I, too, want to thank you for this post, because it was of most importance to me as understanding these forks as a beginner in cryptoworld. That said, I do not take what you say without a grain of salt, but will remember this. I hope it is true what you said, because I really would love a strong BTC with open source decentralized development and ownership. Because I want to buy and hold for years.
