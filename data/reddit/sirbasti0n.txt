Seriously, check out this website:
[xapo]( - Not a referral link.
[xapo Debit Card]( - Currently on pre-orders.
[My xapo Referral Link]( - for those that would like to help me out for giving you this awesome revelation.

[Here is what I have so far.](
[My thread for updates and discussion.](
What does everyone think of the direction I'm headed in? Open to all suggestions since decentralization is the thing these days.

I'm working a re-design right now, should be finished with a rough mock-up in about an hour.
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:10:28
If you can't do, teach. Or something like that, right?
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:08:28
Yeah... I'm not doing the research for you. I gave you the resources. If you are interested enough, all the information is clearly given on the website. If you don't understand the information, that isn't my fault. If you don't care to read the website yourself, that isn't my problem.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:39:46
Thank you! Any suggestions as far as what has been done already, or what I should do to make the design better?
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:18:09
Honestly, I don't care if lazy "consumers" do not "adopt" bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:22:31
$231.63, this will be the price.

May I ask what colour you would enjoy more? The hex code is  but with a transparency of 85%.
I haven't quite decided on a font either, I'm only using Segoe UI for the mockup. However, I'll see what I can do about bumping the font size up without making it look super cheesy.

* Inform users to protect them from common mistakes.
* Give an accurate description of Bitcoin properties, potential uses and limitations.
* Display transparent alerts and events regarding the Bitcoin network.
* Invite talented humans to help with Bitcoin development at many levels.
* Provide visibility to the large scale Bitcoin ecosystem.
* Improve Bitcoin worldwide accessibility with internationalization.
* Become an informative resource about Bitcoin.

A fellow human was asking for information. I gave two resource links, and a referral link for anyone that doesn't mind paying it forward (Leaving a non-ref link for those who do mind since I'm not fighting for a measly 50 bits). If you are too lazy to use the internet even AFTER the fact that I gave you resources, I really can not stress how lazy of a human you are.
*EDIT* If you are that resilient to learning about Bitcoins on YOUR OWN, you should just get the fuck off of the internet since you have no use for it.
*EDIT 2* And if I cared so much, I wouldn't jump to just leaving you to scavenge for the bits of information you are looking for on your own. You are full of ignorance, young one.

Your sarcastic comment isn't welcome. If you have constructive criticism or feedback, that would be appreciated. :)
What do you think about the colour palette? How about the amount of text to explain bitcoins? Do you think the header requires any work? Stock images aside, what do you think about the use of transparency?
The site is designed off of bootstrap to be fully responsive on any screen size, so there are certain constraints as far as what design elements I can implement to service a mass amount of site visitors.
Those are all things where your feedback would be desired. If you can't provide any value to the conversation, you don't need to say anything. Thank you!

[What do you think of my design?](
It's not finished, but I've got quite a few visions for how it should look and perform in the end.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:59:26
Hey BitQuick! I would like a simple way to purchase Bitcoin with my AMEX card (Bluebird). Most places don't support AMEX - for what reason, I'm not sure - and it makes it extremely difficult for me to get started in the Bitcoin world. Is this possible with BitQuick?
As far as instant access goes, I prefer instant access, but only because I'm impatient. ;)
Aside from that, what I look for most in a company is brand loyalty, consistent brand identification, and outstanding customer support!
Thank you greatly for your service btw!

No I wasn't hired, I was bored and wanted to try my hand at a design. However, if he wanted to incorporate my design to his website, I wouldn't complain.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:59:08
You asked why you should care. Don't ask if you don't want answers.

[CanadianAddress.ca]( is the only mail forwarding service available in Canada. I think it costs $20 through PayPal to ship a package, since they receive the package and then send it to you.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:46:03
You can sign up with whatever credentials you want. I signed up with my real name but a Canadian address since they don't offer them in the US yet (You can use them in the US though). You need to verify your credentials to raise your limits however.
*EDIT* To answer your question, they don't mail them to your US address, but using the method mentioned above, you can use a service in Canada that will forward the card to you.

This whole "Bitcoin wont catch on because people steal it" is starting to get annoying. Wherever there is money involved, there are thieves involved. Paper currency gets stolen way more often than Bitcoin, and it is way less secure. So using that as part of an argument as to why Bitcoin wont catch on seems asinine to me.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:09:46
I second this, the only way I know how to buy Bitcoin with AMEX (Bluebird). However, you are paying $0.77 on the dollar.
@_date: 2015-09-16 05:53:50
How very Reddit-like of you.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:53:23
Sorry, I didn't realise how vague I was being. I sent it from Hive Wallet to freebitco.in, which I've done plenty of times with no problems.
I still haven't received anything and it is up to 80 confirmations. Perhaps freebitco.in is the problem then?
*EDIT* I feel so dumb right now. They got sent to another wallet of mine by accident -_- Thanks for the help though!
@_date: 2015-10-03 03:07:47
You can download the pro versions directly from their website. That's what I've been using.

Computers aren't capable of abstract thinking. Until that happens, your artificially intelligent, sentient computers will never be able to achieve what humans can achieve. Aside from that, computers will never be sentient. I cannot see how you can program software to "feel" things. Sure, you can program them to artificially feel things, but they can't truly "feel" things.

So banks are free from making mistakes? I deposited a $72 check through an atm and it put $10,000 in my account. When I talked to the teller the next day, they had never seen anything like that. They asked me "Are you sure you didn't put $10,000 when it asked you how much?" Yeah... First, the atm automatically did everything... Second, I tried committing a $10,000 fraud on a $72 check thinking I could get away with it. /s

E-coin is pretty dope. You can deposit any amount of bitcoin, load up your card, and it's ready for use. If you live in the USA you can only get the virtual card, but other places they will send you a physical one for something around $20.
