Even reddit gets crushed with traffic from time to time. Coinbase is still young in the tooth. They'll get it figured out eventually. I hope.

"BTC will NEVER hit $100K. Within the next 2 years it will literally fade out to zero value." 
Sounds like something I heard in 2013 when Bitcoin was under $300. Someone said something or other about how Bitcoin was worthless and regulations are going to decimate it. It will never reach above $1,000... blah blah blah
I'll pay attention to what the market itself has to say, rather than some prediction that a person whose name is irrelevant has. So far, the market has shown that, while the value of Bitcoin (and crypto-currencies in general) is volatile, it most certainly has a place in global economics.
To assume Bitcoin 'will literally fade out to zero value' based on some upcoming regulations is not an educated assumption, especially given the history of Bitcoin and attempts by various governments to regulate it across the world.
Even if these regulations do get put into place, people will still be able to use Bitcoin for transactions. It is not possible to prevent people from transacting in Bitcoin and as long as people are willing to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, it will have value.
Value depends on the market.
