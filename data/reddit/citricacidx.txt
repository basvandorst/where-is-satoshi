I found the same. No iOS apps that could integrate with the exchange APIs for importing. I also looked to see if there was one that had both an app and a web interface where you might be able to import it from the web and then have the data on the phone. But couldn't find anything like that either.
I didn't delve into OSX platforms, but only because I still don't remember I have a dual booted Mac I got recently, still have a Windows mindset. But I was mainly looking into iOS apps specifically.

I saw a new service posted on a Facebook crypto group similar to what you mention. It's [TokenTax.us]( They seem to integrate with CoinBase/GDAX, Bittrex, and Kraken. It's supposed to export your transaction history, figure out what taxes you owe, and generate a 8949 form. Is this a real trusted service or will whoever signs up for that be giving away their coins?
It seems to be setup by [Alex Miles]( and [David Holland Lee](

I sent BTC from GDAX to my Bittrex wallet so I can buy a few more alt coins. GDAX has deducted the coin and has it in my Account History as a transfer. It hasn't shown up in my Bittrex account yet or under Pending Deposits. How can I check that status of my transaction? I have searched the wallet address, but it only shows my old transfer from October.

Quick question about taxes (in the US). I fall into the 15% tax bracket (MFJ - $18,651-$75,900), which has a Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate of 0%. Just.. for the sake of argument and nice round numbers, say my taxable income is $60,000 and I bought 1 Bitcoin at $5,000, HODL for over a year, and sell it next year at $25,000. When I bought the Bitcoin I was at $60,000 salary and in the Long Term Capital Gains 0% range, but if I cash out fully I have now profited $20,000 and that bumps me out of the 15% Income Tax bracket. Would I owe Long Term Capital Gains tax of 0% or 15% (because I got bumped above the 15% Income Tax)?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:29:05
Is there a transaction fee if I send BTC from GDAX to a cold wallet like Ledger Nano S? What about sending from GDAX to Bittrex?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:21:34
Talking Alt coins, if I'm day trading on Bittrex, going from BTC -&gt; Alt and the back to BTC etc, is that taxable? Or is it only taxable once I try to go from BTC/Alt to USD?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:18:03
It wasn't an offer of free coins. It's a service that looks through your transactions and calculates your tax liability and generates a 8949 form.

This is what Bitcoin Futures should be about. Betting if OP will actually get a tattoo when BTC hits $26,000
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:17:20
So I'm trying to figure this out for myself and a buddy. If you're on an exchange like Bittrex, and you're day trading BTC -&gt; Alt -&gt; BTC -&gt; Alt etc, all of those transactions are taxable if you profit. Not just if you pull out to USD in the end? My friend said


I'm just trying to do what's right and make sure he and myself don't get screwed over come tax season.
TL;DR If I day trade BTC -&gt; Alt -&gt; BTC, but don't cash out to USD/fiat for over a year, are the trades taxable as a short term capital gains or long term capital gains? And I am talking US Tax laws.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:34:59
I guess so, I kinda forgot about that in the setup process.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:52:57
Hypothetical question; if I mined some alt coin and only used what I mined to buy Bitcoin, and eventually withdrew my BTC to USD, would that be tax free? Since I technically didn't purchase any coin but mined it and then sold it for BTC on an exchange like Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:54:02
That's it! I had been entering all my Alts into Blockfolio and those are in Bittrex. I forgot to set the exchange to Coinbase when entering in Delta. That should fix that problem... silly user error.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:25:52
Does anyone know when ∆ Delta is going to launch the desktop part of their program? App is great, but if the desktop interface releases soon I'd rather wait for that to import my transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-27 01:06:07
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:41:28
Just spent some time manually entering my transactions into Delta and Blockfolio and I have a small problem with both of them.
**In Blockfolio is there a way to specify Time of a transaction more than just date**? I have a few day trades on stuff from early on, some of which happened on the same day. Blockfolio isn't organizing the same day transactions in the order I entered them. Some sell orders are showing up after my buy orders, so my unintentional sell low/buy high strategy isn't properly reflected.
~~In Delta the prices it shows on the Transaction history are different than what I entered. Yet if I go into the details to check, the correct purchase price is there. For example I purchased 0.05067556 BTC @ $7,049.49, but it shows $6,972.65 on the page that lists out all the transactions. Delta does allow you to specify a purchase time (which is awesome and my problem with Blockfolio).~~
EDIT: made me double check I was entering the correct exchange for my transactions. That fixed my Delta problem.
Also, and this is for both apps, how can I enter a transfer from my account on one exchange to my account on another exchange (that then got turned into Alt coins). So I didn't really sell or buy, I just transferred the money.
Does anyone know of a fix to either problem?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:46:55
What is your (current) goal/moon? You HODL your BTC until you have enough to _______.

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:59:47
Just curious if there's a good (as unbiased as possible) place to discuss alt coins. So far my experience is people either shilling the alt coin they've put the most in, or people asking what the next big thing is going to be. Often times the comments show "Do your own research". Going to an alt specific subreddit only lends to people posting about why their alt coin is going to be the one to topple Bitcoin/survive the Bitcoin bubble.
I just want some place to objectively learn about the different alts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:26:37
You say that as if this guy is never going to touch crypto again. Why can't people get rich ~~quick~~ AND invest? I'm assuming OP is an OG HODLer. And not someone who just ran some major pump and dumps.

I love that they use BCash as their main example lol
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:09:27
Yes I realize it's a fork. It's totally different to be PART of that brand rather than saying your ARE that brand. That is the part that makes Bcash a shitcoin.
It's not quite like Linux distros. elementary OS didn't come on the scene and start buying the domain and twitter handle "Ubuntu.com" and " and try to call itself THE Ubuntu that all your friends have been hearing about, while calling the original Ubuntu it copied from Ubuntu Classic and being the only distro to attempt such a rename scheme.
You can call "New Coke" Coca-Cola, and rename Coca-Cola as Coca-Cola Classic, but the people aren't stupid. "New Coke" may be a fork/reformulation of the original Coca-Cola formula, but the people knew which was the real Coke and which was the shitcoke.
So yes, it's a misrepresentation.
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:51:15
It doesn't trash it, it just shows they try to misrepresent themselves using a well established brand. It would be like someone trying to claim Coca-Cola when their product is Coca-Cola Soda, and trying to give real Coca-Cola some made up name. If you believe in the tech you believe in the tech, their marketing/PR is just not quite the best.

I just purchased some as well, but it's acting weird. Try putting in the USD amount and give it a few seconds, that might force it to work.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:33:33
As with everyone else, I'm watching the candles dip a little lower and lower. **I'm not afraid of Bitcoin dying**, but am I wrong to want to sell high and buy low? I'm trying to get as much coin as possible, currently at about .05. If I can increase my investment without throwing more money into, and just timing things as best as I can estimate, is there anything wrong with that? **I plan on continuing to invest in Bitcoin**, but is there a reason why I should watch my investment shrink instead of selling it to USD and HODLing that until the drop stops and starts to go back up and reinvest then?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:45:35
That seems like a short list lol.
But seriously, nice work

Why the difference in price between GDAX and CEX?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:16
Everyone talking about the drop (before it pumps up again). Would it be wise on GDAX to sell the BTC and have it sitting as USD and wait for the drop, then snatch up whatever BTC you can before it pumps again?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:37:53
Yeah, I figured that out lol. Went from like .0512 to .0482 but I've traded my way back up to .0499. Just been watching the past few days.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:57:03
Still new to the game, is now a good time to sell high then watch for a drop to pick it up low?

Any significance in that $690? If it hits anywhere near 1,000 I'm going all in.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:03:55
I'm new, I jumped in when it was in the mid 5,000s and have enjoyed watching it nearly break 8,000 within 2 weeks. I've tried to look back historically and I'm not confident on how far it may drop or not. I'm thinking it could drop back to the 4-5k range. I also realize when it first breached 1k and dropped back down to the 200's, it took many years to get back up to 1k. However, since Trump has come into office, BTC just continues to go up and up and up. I feel like more and more people are distrusting traditional money and BTC is gaining mainstream popularity.
In short, I have no good idea, I'm just hopeful it'll drop low enough to buy 1 coin and then to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:08:40
