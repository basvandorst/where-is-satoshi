It's not a problem as a customer. People like a 0%-interest month-long loan, extended warranties, fraud protection, travel insurance, and the convenience of cards. Those are real features with real value. If that means costs in a store are 2% higher than they otherwise might be, I think that's a pretty fair deal.

*Dollars* aren't technically part of their payment system either. Apple Pay is a more-secure surrogate for your credit or debit card. Get a bitcoin-denominated account from a participating bank, get Visa (etc.) to process transactions with bitcoin, and get a merchant to accept bitcoin, ... and you've got bitcoin over Apple Pay. 
Apple Pay isn't involved in the actual processing of transactions, so there's no logical place where Apple could "add" support for bitcoin. It's not supported, and it's not *not* supported either; it's external to what Apple Pay actually is.

Someone is unaware that, seasonality aside, the iPhone has fairly steadily gained market share over the years. Never has it been the volume leader. Cheap Androids replaced cheap Nokias, and Apple has been slowly gaining market share, all while absolutely dominating the profit share.
Your false history was pretty popular for a couple of years, but the rapid implosion of Samsung sales and the very positive reactions to the iPhones 6 really changed the narrative. 
And for what it's worth, both Microsoft and IBM are more successful now than at their "peaks."

That's absolutely not true; Apple doesn't have any record of your transactions. They're not even involved in any step of the transaction itself.

No, it's really not. It's completely different. Also, what Apple did with the Mac worked really well; Apple makes about the same amount of Mac profits as all other PC makers combined, and is one of the top global vendors by volume (100% of which is premium).


It's hard to know where to start with this. First of all, that link reports a 1% drop. It's also a *seasonal* loss. It's an article from a month before Apple announced new iPhones, so yeah, sales taper off. This isn't new. Also, the smartphone market isn't the same as the phone market. Extremely cheap Android phones have replaced extremely cheap feature phones. This results in a large smartphone share increase for Android, but has literally no relevance on Apple, which was still growing its share of the *phone* market (and, of course, now that new iPhones are out, iOS share of the smartphone market is up again).


No, it is pretty much the very definition of a good thing long term.


When your competitors are competing against *each other* on price, maybe, but Apple isn't competing on price. It's competing only at the high end of the market (Galaxy S/Note lines, HTC One, etc.), and it massively outsells, in raw numbers, the *comparably-priced* Android phones.


It's not sacrilege; you just said something incredibly wrong. It's that simple. Stop trying to be a martyr.

I read that paragraph several times and I disagree with your assessment. The paragraph is about how the lack of trust and stability. The collapse of Mt. Gox is merely one example to illustrate that.

Reduced fraud means there's a bigger pie of profits to share in. That's how Apple sold Apple Pay to the banks.

@_date: 2015-01-21 19:36:16


Definitely grasped that. Thanks.


Right, and how many businesses accept Bitcoin? Accepting Apple Pay requires only that a business accept credit cards and have a working NFC terminal. Pretty much all of them already accept credit cards, and almost all of those will soon upgrade to NFC-capable terminals, if they haven't already. In other words, in the next couple of years, you'll be able to use Apple Pay pretty much everywhere. Being "cross-platform" doesn't matter when most businesses don't use iOS/Android/Windows Phone to accept payments but rather specialized POS equipment from IBM, Toshiba, etc.


Well, no, that's just straight up wrong. Apple's cut comes from the bank's fee. It's that simple. Find a single example of any bank raising their credit card fees to pay for Apple Pay.


I actually never said it was. I said it's an extension of the credit card system, which already *is* the big thing. Apple Pay isn't trying to replace anything except the *physical* card. It's not designed to actually change the payment system. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:12:10


Apple Pay is an easy and *much* more secure way to pay with a credit card. That's it. It requires nothing more of merchants than a functioning NFC terminal, something almost all will have anyway within a couple of years. It's already part of the existing payment system.
Bitcoin is a completely different system. Why is there a need to compare Bitcoin to Apple Pay? They're related only in the most tangential ways.


Nothing like some good old-fashioned FUD, is there? Banks are willing to give Apple a cut of *their* fee because it will dramatically reduce fraud, cutting their own costs. The author should stick to the facts.

Google Wallet gave Google access to your purchase history, but then Apple Pay came out. Apple does *not* know what, when, or where you buy things with Apple Pay because Apple isn't actually a party to your Apple Pay transactions when you buy something in a store. (Caveat: you can optionally enable anonymous location data with Apple Pay so that your phone will report that *someone* made a purchase at a location, which they can use for their mapping data, but nothing else.) Google Wallet subsequently was replaced by Android Pay, which is more or less a clone of Apple Pay and I believe has similar privacy standards.
Your personal advantages include greatly enhanced security and privacy. Instead of giving out your real card number and name to every merchant, they get a token that is useless if (when?) stolen. It's also faster and easier, and lets you use cards without having to carry them around, which is of no concern to someone like my fiancée with her big wallet, but matters a lot to me with my [tiny wallet]( and [strategic use of rewards cards](@_date: 2016-06-02 12:19:13
Meanwhile, actual usage for Apple Pay has continued to grow significantly. 
That chart shows relative trends. The first day it was announced, when nobody knew what it was, would naturally be the biggest single day. Mini spikes appear to correspond to foreign roll outs.

This headline is completely ridiculous. It’s comparing the few days to order a terminal that accepts all cards to the “hour” that it will take someone to set up a BTCPay Server, while ignoring the fact that the BTCPay Server must first spend days syncing the blockchain according to its own documentation. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:04:12
On a technical level: They'd have a supporting bank who denominated accounts in Bitcoin and then everything else would be handled over traditional card networks in US dollars, etc. Apple Pay is a way to get a more secure surrogate for your card number on your device, and then present that surrogate to a merchant. That's it. Anything beyond that has nothing to do with Apple Pay and would be a request for a completely new, unrelated (technically, though not conceptually) service. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:05:32
The writer of this article completely misunderstands the issue. People aren't being double charged just because they have two devices on them, and this isn't a result of both an Apple Watch and iPhone being linked to the same account; it's pretty much the opposite. Also, nobody is advising people not to carry both. 
It's a simple thing: the physical card, the token on an Apple Watch, and the token on an iPhone are all different numbers. If you use an Apple Watch to start your journey, you need to use the same thing to end it. If someone *mixes* use of card/phone/watch, they'll get charged more than they should because TfL has no way to know they're the same person. 
This article is an embarrassing hit-piece that does nothing to further Bitcoin. And let's be honest: the thought of people scanning QR codes at a busy subway turnstile is ridiculous.

True story: My fiancée and I went on a run this morning. At the beginning of the run we stopped by the store a few blocks away to buy a drink. I double-tapped the side button on my Apple Watch and used Apple Pay to buy the drink. It worked perfectly, was completely natural and easy to use, required no internet connection on my part, and worked with existing industry-standard hardware already in the store, and with existing accounts that I, like almost every other American, already have. 
*That* is what Bitcoin has to compete with if it wants to be used for retail payments in America. I think Bitcoin has a lot of promise and a lot of potential for the future, but I also think that a lot of its proponents have let ideology blind them to just how much work needs to be done before it becomes something that normal people regularly use in normal stores.

It adds a huge amount of security to credit card payments, so that's one useful thing. You can also use it in a tunnel or other places where you don't have an active Internet connection on your device, which is a lot better than most options I've seen involving Bitcoin. Apple Pay works really well for retail payments, which is the only thing it's used for. Bitcoin works, to the extent people accept it, for sending money, but it's just not good for retail payments. The most plausible "fixes" for this that I've seen are largely just recreating the existing payment networks but using Bitcoin instead of established currencies, at which point it's not much of an improvement. 
Or you could stop trying to bash something that's very good at what it does, and shoehorn something else into a role it's poorly suited for, and instead we could promote Bitcoin for the things that it actually does work really well at. Just a thought. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:28:01


It's not an Apple Pay network. The transaction happens over the normal card networks. Apple isn't part of the transaction at all.


Basically, yeah. Apple Pay is Apple's specific implementation for Apple's devices, but it's based primarily on industry standards. Samsung Pay is pretty much the *exact* same thing, except for their own devices. Same tokenization.


The participating merchants are just large chains that agreed to install industry-standard NFC terminals in all of their locations. That's it. Some may also put up Apple Pay logos in their stores to let people know, but *any* NFC payment system will work with it.


They're not getting the payments.

I don't think you understood. If you have an iPhone and were to do all of your card transactions using Apple Pay, which is an entirely realistic scenario for lot of people within a few years, your account information would be 100% secure and nobody could fraudulently use any of your cards because you'd never share the real numbers. 
Also, NFC cards provide no enhanced security for online purchases.

That report was completely bogus in so many ways it's hard to count. The exclusive source was a person who works for competitors, the actual fraud reports were unsubstantiated, and more importantly, it's all completely irrelevant because the fraud had nothing to do with Apple Pay in the first place. People previously stole credit cards. Some may have loaded them on Apple Pay and then used it to buy stuff through it. Or, you know, people could have just typed the numbers into any website. It was part of a calculated smear campaign by a competitor and a pretty embarrassing journalistic failure by the WSJ.

Apple Pay is accepted all over Canada. Anywhere that accepts NFC payments and accepts the person's card takes Apple Pay. The major limitation in Canada is Apple Pay is not currently available from Canadian banks, but this is likely to change before the year is even up.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:20:02


Actually, that's exactly what Apple Pay fixes. This fraud here has very little to do with Apple Pay; the card numbers themselves were previously stolen. If people had *already* been using Apple Pay, they wouldn't have been able to steal the card numbers because Apple Pay replaces them with tokens that are useless if stolen. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:21:00
Because when you use Apple Pay, you don't use your card number. You use a token that gets mapped back to your account by the issuer. If this token is stolen from the merchant, you're still fine. A normal card number can be stolen from a merchant and used freely (which is exactly what happened to you), but the token *requires* the dynamic security code that only your phone can generate (using an algorithm provided to your phone at the same time as the token). You can't just load the token on a fake card or plug it into a website; it will be rejected. Anyway, that's the short version of it.
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:07:30
Centralized how? Apple Pay is just a system to store tokens for your existing credit/debit cards on your iOS devices. Apple itself doesn't store anything.
EDIT: Anyone care to justify their downvotes? I get that credit/debit cards are "centralized," but this comment is a response to someone not trusting *Apple* with their money. But *Apple Pay* itself is not centralized.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:52:48


Apple doesn't save your card data. It's briefly read when you add a card, so it knows which bank to send your request to, but then discarded. 


That's why you have to authenticate to use it (unlike the physical card), and why you can remotely deactivate it.


There's no "account" to compromise. Your details are stored only on the device. 


Users will eventually learn that Apple Pay is *much* more secure than using their physical card, but you can't always expect tens of millions of people to instantly be up-to-date. It'll happen, though. The next hack of a store's credit card database (like Home Depot or Target) is going to be a boon for Apple Pay when it's all over the news that people who used their physical cards are at risk and Apple Pay users are not.
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:36:20


More or less. The back end components were either already in place or under development for a while. Apple was just the first to actually piece *all* of them together, and wrap it in an easy-to-use experience for the customer. If you're curious about some of the more technical details, I wrote an [article]( a little while back. Apple Pay represents a *huge* security improvement over regular cards, so I'm a pretty big advocate.
@_date: 2015-03-07 00:14:03


The line you quoted from the Apple Pay page is a simplistic summary of the basic concept of what it does, but isn't how it actually works (which is made very clear in Apple's other descriptions). Your actual card information is *not* stored as part of Apple Pay. A token is generated by the card issuer and stored on your phone, and the token is useless without the dynamic security code that your phone generates. It is very secure because there's literally nothing of value to steal. Also, it doesn't sync. You have to separately add Apple Pay for every device (each one of which gets unique tokens).
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:59:52


Just to clarify/expand some things: The industry term for Device Account Number is "Payment Token" and it is not actually generated in any way from the credit card number. It is generated as a random number and therefore absolutely cannot (even theoretically) be reversed. The credit card companies maintain Token Vaults that stores the actual card numbers and associated Payment Tokens (the same card would have different tokens for your iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad, for example).
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:03:36


My point is that it's completely irrelevant. If you have stolen credit card numbers, you can use them fraudulently. Apple Pay isn't required to use them, doesn't necessarily make them any easier to use, and isn't actually widely being used that way. This *entire* thing comes essentially from one guy who works for a competitor and is paid to create FUD about Apple Pay. It's a non-issue.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:58:59


There is no such thing, which is kind of my point. Simplified version: You add your card to Apple Pay and your bank generates a token that is stored on your phone. When you pay, the token goes to the merchant, through the actual payment network, back to your bank where it is mapped back to your real account number. Apple's only involvement is when you add the card, to connect you to the bank. When you actually pay, Apple isn't involved at all. 
The only connection between Apple Pay and an Apple ID is that you can use Find My Phone to deactivate Apple Pay on your lost/stolen phone by signing in online with your Apple ID. To call this "centralized" is quite a stretch.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:23:01


What on earth are you talking about? The full credit card numbers were already stolen, and Apple isn't the one who verifies customers; the banks verify their own customers according to their own rules. They can take on the risk for fraud themselves in an attempt to make things easier for their customers. It's a business decision ... and still has nothing to do with Apple. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:16:29

I'm pretty confident I understand how Apple Pay works better than any person you've ever talked to. Seriously. Correcting misconceptions about it is a hobby of mine. 
Apple Pay is not currently available *to* Canadians. It requires deals between Apple and the banks. The best information is that they're currently working on it and Apple is getting everything lined up before announcing it in the very near future. It is still, however, available to *use* in Canada. 


No, it's not. It just requires NFC, which is already extremely widespread in Canada. If you can tap your card at a place, it accepts Apple Pay. It's that simple. Anybody with a card from a participating bank in America or the UK can already use Apple Pay in Canada. People have been using it there since it originally launched in the US a year ago. It requires absolutely nothing special on the merchant side; they don't have to even be aware that it's a thing that exists. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:04:47
That's not even possible. The whole point of Apple Pay is that your real card number isn't even used. If you were able to use *only* Apple Pay then you'd definitely be safe. You should try to use Apple Pay as much as possible to avoid this in the future.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:19:48


I wrote a really long explanation [here]( if you're interested, but the short version is all about tokenization. When you add a card to Apple Pay the first time, the issue sends a token which is saved on your phone. Your card number is *not* on the phone. When you go to actually pay, only this token is given to the merchant. The merchant doesn't even know the difference, but crucially, this means they don't have it. This token, unlike your real card number, requires the dynamic security code that only your phone can generate and therefore *cannot* be used if stolen from the merchant. Merchants can't be trusted with credit card numbers and Apple Pay means they never get it.


Apple takes a tiny cut *from* the bank's portion. They're generally happy to give it up because it both encourages greater volume and reduces very costly fraud risks.
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:09:06


No. Apple has no say over where you use it. They don't even know where you use it. It's just a surrogate for a credit card. If the merchant accepts your bank's card and has functioning NFC, they accept Apple Pay.


It's not a person-to-person transfer system.


If they take credit cards, then yes. Apple doesn't even know when you use it.


Credit cards *are* the more universally-accepted system. Apple Pay  is just an alternative to the physical card.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:53:39
Not really possible since there's not really anything to hack. That's kind of the appeal of the entire system, you know? No credit card numbers?

[Prologue: Think of this as "tough love" criticism of something I really do want to succeed. I'm not bashing Bitcoin here.]


I think a pretty compelling argument could be made that Apple Pay is the more "open" option in this scenario, depending on how pragmatic/ideological you want to be with "open." Is something "open" if it has *extremely* broad industry support, and anyone can support it with little extra cost? Apple Pay requires nothing proprietary from merchants to accept; they need only industry-standard POS terminals and an account with someone to process credit cards. If this is a "walled garden" then it's a garden big enough to contain almost the entirety of non-cash retail payments. Bitcoin acceptance isn't magic; it also requires POS hardware and, if we're being realistic, some sort of outsourced merchant services to handle all of it and tie into fiat bank accounts. Neither one is free to use.


Can you clarify this? The only limitation for spending with Apple Pay is functioning NFC.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:56:26

Well the same company came up with the specs (EMVco), but the big difference is that chip-and-PIN still uses your real card number. It uses a dynamic security code, so that's a huge improvement, but since a security code isn't *always* required by everyone who takes cards, it's not quite as good. The tokens used by Apple Pay absolutely cannot be used without the security code that only your phone can generate, which makes it that much more secure. Either way, the move away from magstripes is a huge benefit to everyone (except criminals).

In just a few years, it's extremely likely that an absolute majority of all retail purchases (by dollar totals first, the later by transaction) will be made by owners of Apple Pay-compatible iPhones. 
Longer explanation for people who aren't getting it: the iPhone is already the most popular phone in America and is still growing in share. It *already* has almost 50% of the US smartphone market, and smartphones are close to being the entirety of the phone market. iPhones are by no means limited to the rich, but iPhone users do skew disproportionately affluent. This means that most of the money being spent is being spent by people with iPhones. In a couple of years, the upgrade cycles will ensure that most of the base of iPhone users in America will have Apple Pay support. In other words, Apple Pay will be "limited" to the people responsible for a majority of all spending, which isn't much of a limitation.

Xiaomi is a huge threat to Samsung, but there's no reason to think it's a serious threat to Apple.

Honestly, I think there's plenty of market share to go around for both.
