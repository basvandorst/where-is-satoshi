The tea party believes just that. They have stated over and over that the government is the cause of all problems and can never be a solution.

Yes I do. I'm not a fan of unions that represent public employees. They're already some of the most protected and well compensated in the world with tremendous amounts of job security.

A federal court has ruled that we are legally allowed to record video and audio in public and that police officers do not have an expectation of privacy while performing their duties in public.

No, but the government's mission statement isn't profit at all costs, profit this quarter, and every quarter after. Also I get to vote for who gets into office. Privatization means I will have no say as to who provides these services or what their specific policies are.

Yeah, because private companies are completely interested in the good of the public and would take a financial loss for the greater good. Oh wait that's wrong. It's technically illegal for a publicly shared company to lose money for its shareholders regardless of the overall outcome. Look at the private prison industry if you need any more proof as to why privatization is a horrible idea for plenty of services and agencies.

Yeah, so you totally took my advice and researched private corrections for a bit.  You saw the cases of prisoners being denied simple medical attention to save money. You read about the judge going to prison for twenty-eight years in a kids for cash scandal. Look, it's your right to be ignorant and obtuse. But please try not to spread the stupid around anymore than you have to.

No the DOJ has suspended a program that allowed local police working alone to confiscate property and be able to keep up 80% of the proceeds. They can still do it in tandem with the feds and the feds can always do it. They really didn't do anything.

And capitalism isn't violent?

We have quite a few systems in place for questioning their authority. I certainly wouldn't say the system is perfect, but I feel better about it than anything that's solely profit driven, opaque, and answers to no one.

I mean a free market. Capitalism. It isn't perfect. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:48:56
It looks that way.

While I agree that we imprison innocent people who haven't harmed another human being or property, I still disagree with privatization.

When private organizations are the authority, no one may question them. When everything has a  price tag, then poor and working people are often excluded. 
Edit: I was reminded of this comment just now 11 hours later, while trying to deal with Microsoft.

So you think things would be better if private interests were to have power? Do you have a hole in your head? 
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:26:46
No, I firmly feel that there are some goods and services that cannot be trusted in the hands of profiteers. Otherwise, I'm not anticaptitalist or promonopoly at all.

Actually it's not necessarily wrong. Unfortunately, we now have a system that grants corporations unlimited  political spending with no transparency and a crackpot segment of the conservative party that thinks that government shouldn't exist at all. If people would come back to planet earth and look at our problems objectively we could get a lot done. You may disagree, but there's historical precedent for thinking this way.
