Sort of. But that has a much lower upper bound than the amount of possible keys. That's why we're able to do it. If we set the difficulty *really* high, we could effectively slow the process down to such a point where it's not possible to find a block which is very similar to what's going on with key values.

Would requires WAY too much space. Being able to use a large number and being to store that number are "easy", but storing that number and all other numbers of that length are totally different things. If each key is 256 bits, then storing even 2^64 keys is a lot of space. 
Rainbow tables work by sacrificing space for speed. You spend the time no matter what, rainbow tables just spend it before you use the table.

Well, in a lot of cases, it already has. Look at how most payment apps, etc, use QR codes to shortcut the copy/paste step. Generating the codes still isn't always as convenient as it could be, but we do have some progress on avoiding the copy/paste.

Still feeling generous? This is why I love this community

I think you replied to the wrong comment :)
But, to the point, what you're asking is essentially asking if someone can "fork" the network and mine it to the "end". And yes, its possible to fork the network and do just that, but no one else would accept it. By avoiding the main network and not following the difficulty adjustments that limit the frequency of blocks being found, you've essentially created a new protocol that isn't bitcoin. If some did follow the difficulty adjustments and include transactions, but didn't release the blocks, that'd be an attack on the network. Such an attack would fail unless they have a huge amount of processing power - more than half of the main network's. We call that a 51% attack and its extremely unlikely that we'll ever see such a thing.
