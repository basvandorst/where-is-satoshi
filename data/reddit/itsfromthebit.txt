Economics is not a science. It's an absurdity pretending to be a science.

An economy is a thing that cannot be understood and will work against an understanding of it **by definition**. If you cannot understand that then you have no business calling yourself an economist.

If you are a Chinese laborer making pennies its due to dollar hegemony.
Here's the **truth**:
US exports dollars to China.
Chinese government makes workers slaves.
Slaves send products to US.
It's slavery by fiat currency. And it is unjust.

General principes of economy can be studied of course. But the idea that beyond the basics, that it can be known further is false. If that was then economists would just push the magic money button and we would never have a recession again and all be rich.

I'll take a non-optimal currency that favors savings over growth rather than an ever-inflating currency, sucking nature dry, tricking people into debt slavery any day of the week.

You're the only one that brought up impoverished monetary slaves.

The economy does not need growth. What it needs is stability.

Bullshit. An economy is a complex system in perpetual change that nobody, nobody can understand. Why? If you could understand it you would be making easy money from your understanding of it.

The only people who make two chairs a year on Earth are those who have their labor stolen from them due to an unjust monetary system.
