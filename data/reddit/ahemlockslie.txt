I don't think strong growth is bad as long as it's *maintained.* That is, it's perfectly okay for hash rate to grow quickly so long as it isn't followed by a sharp decrease. There's nothing wrong with more hash power coming online, but we should worry if it starts slipping away, especially if it does so rapidly.

Which is great, until they start talking about taxation being theft and privatizing lots of critical infrastructure and public services.

Testing is always a valuable way to help. Lightning network is the most well known and highly anticipated development still in need of testing. I hear it's relatively easy to set it up on the testnet and toy with it. I'm sure there are other projects in the space that would absolutely love to have additional testers, too.
If you're interested in learning to code, you could start learning a programming language. I'd look at a few projects and see what's most commonly used if you're interested in desktop/server development. Mobile is often predetermined by the platform you want to work on. Testing can go well with this. It won't *directly* help, but you can read the code and help developers pinpoint what's going wrong. That would help you learn to code and make you an even more valuable tester.
Someone else suggested writing, and that can be helpful. You can help new users get informed and old users stay informed, or you can try to help attract new users, which might indirectly help bring in new helpers with various skills.
You can host useful services. We can always use more full nodes. I think electrum and over SVC nodes can also be useful. Lightning network testnet nodes would probably be useful even if you don't put much effort into testing. There's probably a few other I can't think of at the moment.
If you can do graphic design, I'm sure there are plenty of projects that would love help. Logos, icons, etc.

If you're paying $30 in fees for a $20 transaction, you did something horribly wrong. 140 sats/byte translates to about $3 for a single input transaction. If your coins are splintered over 10 inputs for only $20 worth, you kinda fucked up.

Technically, we have a block *weight* limit of 4 MB. That is indisputable fact. That translates to a likely block size of... I think 1.8 MB +/- 0.1 MB if segwit usage becomes universal. In some cases, block size will be even higher, as evidenced by our recent blocks over 2 MB.

I think we'll eventually see lightning hardware wallets. You set up the node, connect the wallet, and approve certain spend conditions, which can then be carried out automatically.

It depends a bit on your wallet, but shouldn't be *too* bad either way. If you use electrum, I'd do a pay to many transaction. Send whatever you have to to whatever address, then send the rest to your new segwit address. You'll have to do a tiny bit of math probably, but just (amount for first address) and (the rest to segwit address minus whatever goes to fees). I'm not sure if there's a built in feature to dump the entire rest of your wallet into the other second address, it's usually just the change from the UTXO(s) you're initially spending.

Makes sense to me. Ctrl-F (error code that should be in the source somewhere) or, on Linux, cat (source) | grep (error code). If it doesn't show up, where does it come from? Either it's obscured/obfuscated in the code somewhere, or it's getting pulled in from an external resource. You shouldn't be obfuscating open source code that needs to be evaluated for security and trustworthiness, nor should you be pulling it from external, unverified sources.

6 blocks an hour isn't intended to be some sacred number that must be maintained 100% of the time. It's what we adjust to based on past block production. That's not to say that 6 blocks an hour is bad, though.

This suggests you're letting your wallet determine your fees. I've never seen a wallet push fees down as low as they can actually go if you've got time. I typically manually set my fees to just within the top 1 MB of transactions by fee, and I get through within a few hours. If I stopped trying to game it so much and left another couple hundred KB of transactions under mine with a slightly higher fee, I could probably get through near instantly, but my way is vulnerable to fluctuations in the mempool. Sudden bursts of transactions can push mine past the threshold. Still, my last transaction cost something like $2.50, forget the exact figure, for a simple one. If you have to use a bunch of UTXOs or addresses, it'll be more expensive.

If you want to argue it that way, no amount of on chain scaling will ever be enough.

Yes, they'd be an average of like 1.8-1.9 MB with universal adoption. The witness data doesn't really shrink, it's just given a significant discount when calculating sats/byte in transaction fees. I don't remember how it works, but I think the info can be stripped when sent to out of date nodes so they still see it as just 1 MB. I could be wrong on that part, but I know there's some sort of trickery to maintain backwards compatibility while still increasing size.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:30:11
I think you misunderstand my point, and maybe I wasn't clear enough. The HDD and fans produce kinetic energy instead of thermal to at least some degree. The fans in particular would be utterly useful if they produced nothing but thermal energy, as their entire purpose is to remove heat. The monitor and other lights generate, well, light. This leads to less than your given 99.9% as the kinetic energy alone is non negligible, not greater than 100%.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:17:14
Most coins are probably going to stay on LN nearly full time. The fees will always be prohibitive for normal, day to day transactions. That's going to be the case for any coin that sees the strain of large scale use unless they inflate their block size to the point of forcing significant centralization.
Particularly large transactions might stay on chain and other extremely important transactions that need to be immediately set in stone. For those on chain uses, confidential transactions are in the works, so we'll get there. Might take a year or two before it's ready, but we'll make it. In the meantime, those uses are extremely rare. Would I rather we were already ready for them? Of course. But it's not critical we have it this very moment.

I think part of the reason volume is so low is because you have to pay transaction fees, and last I looked, they were poorly calculated like in just about every wallet. Falling fees might help it gain some traction. Once LN takes off, it'll probably incorporate that, and then it'll have be even more attractive.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:39:16
Sending to a new address is still pretty traceable. It might get hard to say for *sure* if you maintain ownership, but I personally don't think change addresses, for example, afford much extra privacy at all, except for the fact that all your transactions aren't listed on the same address and require a little more work to plot out. It's standard procedure, so everyone just assumes the last output in a transaction is a change address.
A tumbler can improve privacy by breaking the chain of transactions, and this can be further improved by standard practice of not reusing addresses so that you're actually not sending to known tumbler addresses unless someone can learn all the addresses the tumbler used. You can receive funds in one transaction and send them back to new addresses in another unrelated transaction using unrelated input addresses. With no clear path, it's much harder to figure out where the coins came from.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:14:16
LN doesn't directly use Tor, but it does use their style of routing in that no individual node in the route knows if it's dealing with an end point in the transaction. It knows it receives coins in exchange for passing on coins, but it doesn't know if it receives them from the originator or sends them to the end recipient. Just that it was in some way involved with a transaction of at minimum the size it passed.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:18:24

Eh, the built in privacy of Monero is no doubt useful, but once lightning network fully deploys, it'll be nigh impossible to prove what happens to coins once they enter a LN channel due to the Tor style payment routing it utilizes.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:32:59
Will probably also be influenced by how much you put in the channel and how many connections you have to other hubs. Basically, how valuable are you as a routing path? If you help drive traffic through the hub, you help them earn fees.

Cryptographic signatures like those used to sign transactions work so long as the information is unaltered. Change just one bit, and the signature can't be properly verified. This means that nobody can in any way alter a transaction once it has been signed.

Yes, it does. It heavily discounts the size of transaction signature data. It's treated as if it's 1/4 the size it actually is, allowing block size to nearly double.

I want it to happen, and we're almost ready for it, but we're just not yet. Lightning network needs to grow, and the UX for it needs to be refined. The base blockchain can't handle that sort of volume, but the lightning network can.
However, it's not as polished since it's so much newer. It's functional, and for someone who's been in the space and already understands the basics of layer one, it's intuitive. For the oblivious public, the nuance of opening channels, connecting to good spots in the network, rebalancing channels, etc. is still just too much. We're getting there, though.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:42:07
With the way fees are falling these days, I might move to it soon. I looked into it during out fee peak, and it makes the seller cover a transaction fee determined at above average rate, so it was cost prohibitive unless you were moving thousands of dollars worth at the time. Might be looking a lot better now, though.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:23:49
Fair point, but I think the utility provided by LN is much greater than segwit's, so there will be much greater demand once it's field tested and the UX is streamlined. Since it depends on segwit, it will massively increase segwit adoption.

When I got mine, I wrote down my seed, checked my first receiving address, wiped it, reentered the seed, made sure I had the same first receiving address, sent a small transaction, wiped it again, reentered the seed again, then finally transfered the rest.

Did you use a lot of sending addresses? Sending addresses use significantly more space than receiving addresses, which means a higher total fee.

So there are perfectly legal ways to get money, but if you get too much at once, they operate from the assumption of guilt. They have zero proof, but they force you to prove innocence anyway.
Beyond that, the documentation isn't for the bank. It's for government agencies like the IRS. If they want me to provide that documentation to them, they can have every last scrap of it *if* they want to hire accountants to do my taxes for me. And not just bare minimum filing, they better go through and maximize my deductions.
I understand there are illegal things that can be done and that those should be prevented where possible, but we shouldn't be doing that from a presumption of guilt in any situation that doesn't include some degree of proof of wrongdoing. I don't let a bank charge me fees or hold my money to make more money with it so they can tell me what I can do with *my fucking money.* It's mine, they have no proof I did anything wrong, and they can fuck right off if they want to get nosy.

But Citibank doesn't know if I'm actually paying you or routing through you. They just know you're involved. If you go on to pass those funds on to an additional party, say because you're connected to two hubs, they don't know that unless they control both hubs. They also don't know if *I'm* just being used to route funds. This is completely ignoring the fact that Citibank *doesn't know if either of us are end points.* They can't make any strong assumptions about that.






Actively at this very moment? No, but I at least bother to learn what I'm talking about before I condescendingly talk down to people about shit I don't actually know much about. Lack of infrastructure is what people say will be the death of every new disruptive technology. They said it about cars and the internet, but if you have a job, you probably took a car to get to work at a company that to some degree uses the internet to make a profit. Without even knowing you, that's a pretty safe bet to make. Not guaranteed, but not risky, either.
You have to develop some degree of infrastructure to support truly widespread adoption if you want to maintain decentralization. If you don't want to do that, why not just use PayPal or Visa? Once you introduce centralization, you introduce opportunities for control.
There's more to block size than just hard drive space. There's also RAM, CPU, and bandwidth consumption. As soon as any one of them bottlenecks, you start seeing a centralization pressure. Suddenly, it's not feasible for average users to run their own node and verify the blockchain. Some say that's not necessary, but how else can Bitcoin remain trustless? If I can't verify the chain, I have to trust someone else to fully and accurately report the full state of the chain. We may not be able to guarantee that for everyone, but we should guarantee it for as many as we possibly can. Bitcoin isn't *just* the free flow of money (which centralization would threaten), its also a way to guarantee trust in a way that has never been seen before.




Please see above above where you completely ignored the part about not knowing if they're end points. There's little to be learned by the simple fact that we were used as a pathway. You still don't know who actually wanted to pay someone, who they wanted to pay, if that was even the whole payment, or why. You just know a tiny bit about volume transacted by the economy as a whole.

Bisq is a functional decentralized exchange. Funds don't go through the exchange itself, and the exchange works over Tor if I understand correctly. When a sale is made, payment is made directly to the other party. Coins are put through escrow to protect both parties, and if anything goes wrong with the fiat, the coins go back to the original owner.

It depends on how many buy/sell orders there are at that price point. If there's only one buy order for 1 BTC at that price and you sell 10, 9 of them will have to be sold at a lower price because nobody is buying at that same price. Selling 0.1 wouldn't move the price because there's still demand at the same price, but it would make it easier to push the price down with fewer coins.

Just because it will have to happen doesn't mean it should be taken lightly. If there's anything we can do to keep resource requirements for a node down, we should pursue those first. When we can't increase efficiency enough, then yes, finally allow more space. Until then, don't do anything irreversible if relief is available in other ways.

That's actually a pretty good point. While your coins might be dedicated to the channel, the only ones that should be allocated to the exchange should be the ones you've already traded away. In this way, the coins you own should never be at risk. That's actually an amazing development for exchange security.
Edit: and it has the added bonus of letting you control your withdrawal process, including the fee. They can never go down with your coins, forcing you to wait to withdraw. You can also determine how badly you want your withdrawal and set the fees accordingly when you close the channel.

There are no temporary fixes. A block size limit was implemented, and we'll likely never return to unlimited block size. If we increase the block size, we'll likely never take that space back. Any changes we make are most likely permanent, so we need to be damn sure it's worth it before we change anything.

To an experienced cryptocurrency user who is aware of the fork and the decisions of Bitcoin.com? Not at all.
To someone new who just keeps seeing these news reports and prices before deciding to jump in? Yeah. They might not be aware there was a fork or even be aware of that possibility and implications of it. They might see Cash and make a reasonable assumption that it's some feature of BTC. Then they send to it and cause problems and called retarded for not knowing the intricacies of cryptocurrencies yet.
A not insignificant number of people will simply go to Bitcoin.com under the assumption that's the official site. The domain name implies more authority than they really have and gives them great leverage against the new and uninformed.

If we're really gonna do this, it should be contingent on segwit adoption. If segwit adoption is high, say 70-90%, and space is still needed, then yes, maybe it's time to add more. If we're still not using the tools available to us, though, no. No increase.

I'm talking more about the Bitcoin community where it's true that full coin holders are becoming rarer, but we still have enough to make a fair number of nodes. I'm not sure how many users one coin could service, but even of the price stagnated right here forever, it'd be a decent few. If the price continues to climb, especially like it did this year, it'll be quite a few.


LN took a play out of Tor's book for this one, actually. Every step only knows who it receives from and who it sends to, and it already decided to associate with those people. It doesn't even know if they're the start or end points, just that it gets to collect its fee so long as it routes the transaction.


Oh, I didn't say that they were the majority and didn't mean to imply it. Nevertheless, the nodes will exist, and anyone who gets blacklisted or has privacy concerns will simply move to one of these nodes. Perhaps they'll pay a slight premium for it in transaction fees, but compared to blacklisting? Worth it. And keep in kind that Tor routing. Nobody knows anyone involved except their immediate neighbors in the chain.


Yes, today because we don't have sufficient adoption, which we lack because we don't have sufficient infrastructure. Now we're building infrastructure.


 Due to the Tor style routing I mentioned, this will largely be completely useless. You won't even know if you're dealing with end points or intermediaries. You might be able to glean a little about volume movements, but you won't know anything about who's actually sending and receiving. That means no profiling, nothing about involved industries, nothing but volume transacted specifically through you. A payment could still be broken up and sent through multiple routes for privacy or intermediary funding reasons.

You can do that with Diaspora*. It will let you control how your pod, your server, federates with the network. That is, who it shares its content with. You can keep it totally separated from the wider network, and I think you can have restricted federation where it only shares with a whitelist of approved pods, which could be your family members running pods of their own.

I think a lot of the exchanges and such that are "ready" for segwit but haven't deployed yet are waiting on core to finalize it in the standard wallet. Once that happens, I'm hoping we'll see an explosion of adoption. There are clearly quite a few that have announced they're "ready" but haven't made the final leap. I think that's the hurdle they're waiting to cross.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:12:32

Mempool has less than 1 MB at 100+ sats/byte, so a simple segwit transaction could go through for ~$2.15. ~$3.30 if you're still on a legacy address, in which case any transaction you make should include a wallet sweep to a new segwit wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:59:21
Lightning network is still secure and trustless. If we insist on everything staying on chains, we're gonna have to spread out over a lot of chains, even with bigger blocks. Someone claimed 1 GB blocks would be enough to process as many transactions as Visa, but to keep that all on one chain and propagate it at any reasonable speed, you'd need a dedicated gigabit line to a dedicated machine so it can store, verify, and then spread each block. Since that's not feasible while maintaining decentralization, how many chains do we have to spread that over assuming there aren't major advancements in broadband speeds in screwed markets like the USA? 10? 25? 100 would mean 10 MB blocks, which would probably be doable with today's broadband speeds. Are we going to fracture into 100 coins so we can STILL not address the micro and nano payments we have the potential to provide? Off chain scaling is an unfortunate necessity, and it has the added bonus of giving instant transactions while remaining trustless.
Edit: and that's not directly mentioning the processing power required to verify 1 GB of transactions in a time efficient manner. Remember, it needs to do this fast enough to then spread the block to multiple other nodes well within 10 minutes so it can still be used to mine. I can't comment on how much power that would be, but I'd guess it'd require at least more than the Raspberry Pis people are using to host nodes now, so say good bye to those nodes at the very least.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:18:42
Your employer won't start today or next year, but in 5 years? 10? 20? I think the day will come when it will be an option. Likely after mass adoption and the price stabilizes significantly.
As for eating the fees, what if it costs all of 10,000 sats, but then they charge 1 sat per transaction and market research indicates you'll likely perform 20,000+ transactions? Remember, we may see an explosion in micripayments or even nanopayments. Your job might pay you for every hour or even minute worked. You might do the same for your electricity. The self driving car that takes you to and from work. Your internet. Your MMO gaming subscription by time played instead of a flat monthly fee. A penny here and there for each upvote on Reddit or YouTube video you like.
With the way the economy functions today, no, it'll never be worth it. With the incredible transaction volume this allows, though, it could become feasible *for certain users under certain conditions.* Maybe not everyone gets this deal. Maybe not even close to half. That doesn't mean its ludicrous to suggest it might happen for at least some significant portion.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:43:39
You'll pay a fee for it just like any transaction. A lightning network channel requires an opening transaction and a closing transaction, and both of those are treated like any other transaction by the miners. Pay a fee appropriate to their size, and they'll include it.

Don't not HODL.
Three would be to get a hardware wallet if the idea of losing your coins is more than just disappointing. If you're not hodling enough to make that worth the money, and if you don't intend to transact regularly, put them in cold storage. Paper wallets are one of the more common ways to do that. A wallet on a device that never connects to the internet us another.

@_date: 2017-12-31 19:35:18
Not that I'm aware of to the level that cryptocurrencies could allow. This tech could allow us to pay by the hour, minute, or even second for things. People could generate thousands upon thousands of transactions a day. Just one stream of transactions at one per minute per person generates 1,440 transactions a day. In terms of *simple* segwit Bitcoin transactions, that's over 200 KB of transactions a day for just one person. If anything tries to transact by the second, that grows 60x.
If you're aware of anything that can handle that kind of load for millions or even billions of users, I'd be happy to learn about it. I don't think it's feasible to resolve that sort of volume on any chain, which means we'll need 2nd layer solutions like lightning network offers. Even that might not be enough. Maybe we'll need another layer or two on top of that. But I don't think a base chain can handle it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:52:23
You don't have to have *massive* capital to deploy a node. A small node could service a handful of users and connect to a few other nodes. Anyone holding just a few coins today could afford to set up a channel. Dedicate the a larger amount to connecting nodes and a smaller portion to funding channels with only users who expect to be getting paid on that channel. Such a service could come at a premium, while spend-only channels could be established cheaply or even free. Even at today's prices, most people wouldn't need the node to dedicate the liquidity of a full coin unless they were running a business that had a lot of Bitcoin traffic.
In fact, in the event of heavy centralization, more privacy conscientious users will begin to favor smaller nodes. A few connections to other small nodes and maybe one to a major hub, and you could serve a small but still significant number of users with out bank-level funding. Once this node connects to the network at large, it's just as useful as a major hub unless you're trying to buy a house, but sales of that size might end up being on chain.

I will trust exactly none of them. LN maintains the trustless nature of Bitcoin. I don't have to trust the node I open a channel with. I don't have to trust the person I send money. I don't have to trust the intermediaries who route my payment around the network. I can open a channel with any mode at any time, and if they try to cheat me, I get the full contents of the channel that BOTH SIDES dedicated to it. That means worst case scenario is the funds get time locked for a period dependent on how the channel was set up.
As for registering my name, maybe I'll have to. Maybe I'll just connect to another node hosted in another country where I don't have to. Either way, it'll be mostly pointless because they can't prove origin or destination of any transaction that occurs on the LN unless they control every other node involved in routing the transaction. If anyone at either end has a connection to an uncontrolled node, though, how do you prove that what you thought was the end point wasn't just another step towards the edge of your domain?




First, we'll do it with price like we are now. People see profit left on the table, and they want their cut. Then, once we have infrastructure, we'll do it with utility. This technology, even if Bitcoin isn't the form of it that goes fully mainstream, is going to radically change a lot of things.
Don't think about this in terms of how it fits into the world of today because it's not going to leave things the same. Imagine you get paid at work as you work every day, hour, minute, even *second.* No more waiting two weeks for every paycheck. Then do the same for your home utilities like electricity. Imagine self driving cars come, and you take them to work, paying as you go by the mile. Imagine instead of sites being ad driven, you pay a fraction of a cent to read an article or every time you upvote a post or like a YouTube video. Imagine you pay your WoW subscription not flat rate by the month, but actually as you play by the minute.
This is just what could come of things as we understand the world now. That's not even including the industries that will evolve from this. Things will change in ways that we haven't even imagined yet, and those changes will spark even more changes.

Once the lightning network spreads, one-off transactions can still happen on the lightning network. A lot of people seem to make the assumption that you have to have a direct connection on the lightning network, but that's not true. If A has a channel with B and only B but wants to pay D, they don't have to open a direct channel necessarily. If A is connected to B, and B is connected to C, and C is connected to D, payment can flow down this pathway while remaining trustless. If anyone in this path falls out, they can be seamlessly routed around.
There may come a time where you never actually have to pull your funds off the lightning network. The blockchain itself might be relegated to only opening and closing channels and processing particularly high value transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:59:37
Huge increase in centralization with BCash. Their protocol changes will encourage centralization once they start pushing their limits, and they're *already* seeing significant centralization of full nodes. I think it was 80% were found to be hosted with the same host? Could be wrong, but was definitely over 50%. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has a much more varied distribution of full nodes. Since nodes control the consensus rules, that's a problem for them.

I think most mempools drop the transaction after 14 days, so if the fee is super low, I hope he didn't already get what he paid for.

We could have plenty of space for the moment at least if we had segwit use widespread and batch withdrawal transactions from exchanges. Segwit would increase block size to I think ~1.9 MB, so that would add a lot of space. Exchanges drive a lot of traffic on the blockchain, so they could free up block space by bundling withdrawals in one transaction because it uses less space than multiple individual transactions.
We could make enough room for current use *right now* if we could just implement an already existing feature and get efficient usage from those who generate the most transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:02:11
If one side of the channel publishes an old transaction, the other side can instead publish a more recent one and claim the entire channel's contents, not just their remaining balance. I want to say you have like 3 days to publish your more recent transaction to do that? Could be wrong there. So people can try to cheat, but they risk losing everything in the channel if they get caught.

Full nodes are arguably more important than miners because they set the rules miners have to abide by. If miners try anything too shady, nodes have the power to consider their work invalid. Small manipulation is likely to be ignored, but if they tried something like a 51% attack? It would succeed at first, but we could just opt to ignore their chain.

If people want more block size, they can get that right now by switching to segwit. They can do that right now, and we'd have almost 2 MB blocks. That would relieve a looot of pressure right now, and it would prepare everyone for lightning network.
Are we going to have to increase eventually? Sure, but we should investigate off chain first.  On chain solutions impact people's ability to run a full node, which is the only way to verify everything yourself. Not everyone has to do it, but anyone who wants to should be able to. There will be a limit, I'm sure, but we shouldn't raise it unless we absolutely have to.

Depending on how you're being funded, that cost might not be passed on to you. If you're getting paid in Bitcoin, for example, your employer could be reasonably expected to eat that fee. Some nodes might take it upon themselves under certain conditions, such as intended usage, desired funding, and current fee rates under the assumption that it will be more profitable to make you a customer.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:12:45


No, exchanges almost always set the fees very high. Even higher than is really necessary for fast transactions usually. I'm not sure why. Might be in case your coins are spread across many internal wallet addresses, might actually be paying all those fees, might be skimming a little off the top.
You can control that fee with your own wallet, though. If the transaction doesn't need to go through immediately, I paid less than 50 cents for a transaction a couple weeks ago. Even if fees are exploding from that, maybe a dollar or two. Maybe. You can probably still get by on 50 cents, though
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:33:42
Completely cut out the what if at the beginning of the sentence, but sure, lemme just whip up some market research for a market that doesn't fucking exist yet. Both numbers were made up. Even the fee to open the channel could vary wildly depending on transaction volume, block size at the time, and developments like Schnorr signatures.
In terms of traditional payments, no, you'll NEVER reach that volume. But when you can get paid by the minute at work? 480 transactions for an 8 hour shift. Do the same to pay your electricity bill at home? 1,440 transactions a day. Rent a self driving car and pay by the mile? A 30 mile commute to work is another 60 transactions a day. Rent a server and pay by the minute? 1,440 more a day. We're up to over 3,400 payments a *day* during the work week so far. 
Entertainment might add a decent bit more. Pay a penny to read an article online? Give a penny for every Reddit post you upvote or YouTube video you like? Pay your WoW subscription by the minute played? Stream a movie or TV show and pay by the minute watched? Read a book and pay by the page?
Screw micropayments, we're opening the door for nanopayments in bulk. From this perspective, 20,000 transactions could easily be cleared in a *week.*
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:12
It's probably a lot more work to implement it in such a way that users can do it. They basically have to implement it as a currency at the exchange to give you the choice. Or they could just import all the keys to a wallet client one person is managing actually sitting at a desk, trade it, then add the resulting BTC to the system and credit it according to the exchange rate they got for it.
Maybe some people wanted they choice, but if they don't want to implement BCH, it's probably a lot more coat efficient to credit everyone this way. Everyone gets the value, and the exchange doesn't have to put in extra work. It's not perfect for every customer, but if you want to control the outcome, you should control your keys.

Yeah it saves a ton on fees. A minimal one in, two out transaction is like 225 bytes on legacy addresses, but I think the segwit transaction I recently made was considered something like 125? Maybe 20-40 bytes more, but still a large savings on fees.

Why should I care where the node is based? Again, this fully maintains the trustless nature of Bitcoin. Even a node in the shadiest recesses of the internet can't rob me unless I let them. But even if I do use a local node and give my name and other information, it's largely useless unless they know 100% for sure that I don't have any channels open to another node. As soon as I open another, they have no clue what my relation to any payment is.




I even specifically said it might not be Bitcoin that is the one that goes fully mainstream. This is like the third time you've disregarded things I've clearly said. Do you even bother to read my whole posts before you act like I'm an idiot while you agree with me?
And actually, LN has a good chance of doing it, even if the Bitcoin implementation isn't the one that does it. It prevents blockchain bloat with what would normally be called dust transactions. It won't be fully free transactions, but satoshis are currently about 70 to the penny of I'm doing my math right, so if you pay 1 sat a transaction, that's less than 2% of a penny. I've heard LN supports fees as low as 1/1000 of a satoshi, although I'm not sure how that would work. Probably rounding at channel closing. So you can get an instantaneous transaction for 1/70,000 of a penny by today's prices. That may not be free, but it's damn close.

Bigger blocks isn't scaling, it's increased capacity. The difference is whether or not it addresses and avoids bottlenecks. I've pointed some of those out in my other post.

That would leave their blocks only partially filled. They could include their own spam transactions moving their own funds and collecting their own fees to offset this, though, I suppose. A couple pools willing to include the remaining transactions will eventually clear it out, though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:31:57
The mempool has been holding steady at 175 MB for the last 24 hours. 144 blocks a day times 0.9 MB of extra space means about 130 MB of throughput in a day. That means about 32 hours to completely empty the mempool.
So yes, segwit can fix this real fucking quick if we'd just use the damn thing.

No. Those wallets don't come from some group who implies authority over Bitcoin itself, and while I've only used Ledger myself, it makes the distinction between them much clearer and presents it in a way that makes it seem more significant. I want to say Coinomi  makes it fairly clear, and I can only say I suspect Trezor does as well.

Actually, I don't think so because ToS on games like that often stipulates that you don't actually own any of the in games items or currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:12
That actually sounds like it might mitigate the risk without completely destroying it. If my understanding is correct, the coins are locked in the channel until it's closed, so while the exchange does own them, it can't do anything with them until the channel closes. This means that a hacker couldn't immediately transfer them out. However, given enough time on the system, he could close the channels, and then send them out. So it depends on how quickly the exchange realizes there's a problem, but it does buy them more time to realize it's a problem.

So we have the room to grow if we just use it. That's exactly my point. Adoption is low, but fees are increasing pressure to adopt. Pressure here on reddit has shot through the roof in the last couple weeks. We shoud hopefully start seeing progress soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:20:41
Fees have spiked significantly and recovered several times before. They will likely fall again, but it's difficult to say with the influx of users. There has been a clear downward trend in the last couple days, though, so I'd say they're likely to continue to decrease. As others have said, some wallets let you set your own fees. You can look at the mempool and see what people are paying and determine fees for yourself depending on how quickly you want the transaction to go through.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:10:37
Are you moving tons of inputs and outputs? I sent a simple transaction for like $1.50-$2 like two days ago, and looking at the mempool, the same should go through at no more than double that now. If you can't transact on less than $25, you're either doing something wrong or using a LOT of addresses in the process.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:20:13

I'd be more inclined to stop calling it Bcash if they weren't trying to say they're the real Bitcoin and using Bitcoin.com to push it like that. It's causing a lot of confusion *right at* that critical moment where we're getting a lot of mainstream attention and getting a flood of new, uninformed users. People need a way to quickly and *clearly* differentiate the two right now because we're not just dealing with the highly technical enthusiasts right now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:45:46
The thing about being ASIC *resistant* and not ASIC *proof* is that it only lasts until producing them becomes worthwhile. If hardware costs plummeted or the coin's price skyrocketed relative to its mining difficulty, someone would make an ASIC for it. Basically, ASIC resistance only succeeds until the coin itself does. There are alts doing pretty well for themselves, but if they were as valuable as Bitcoin? Probably would get ASICs.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:02:50
Look at the part that measures transactions in MB. At what fee point is there less than 1 MB of transactions paying a larger fee? The block limit is 1 MB (ignoring the small gains from our slight segwit adoption), so if you want your transaction to go out immediately, you need less than 1 MB of transactions paying a larger fee. If you're eager to get it gone fast, look for even less like 0.8 MB or maybe even lower. Miners are going to pile on the highest fees they can, and the block limit is 1 MB (ignoring extra room from slight segwit adoption), so under that threshold, you should get through quickly.
Might be worth it to consider if transactions are clearing out or piling up. If they're piling up, you might want to be cautious and put more transactions between you and the 1 MB threshold if you need it fast. If they're clearing out and you're not in a rush, you could take a chance and set your fees so there's more than 1 MB of transactions with higher fees and hope it clears out soon to get to yours.
If you're gonna take chances with your fees, I recommend a wallet with the replace by fee option so you can increase your fee if it doesn't go through and you get impatient. Electrum is one that supports it. I'm sure there are others, but it's the only one I know for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:52:42
I don't think it would work. When you transact on the lightning network, you set up a channel by dedicating coins to it. You say something like "I'll set aside this 0.5 BTC for transacting in this channel, and I won't touch it until one of decides we're done here and closes the channel. Those coins *exist and are backed by the blockchain.*" Then, when you send a transaction across the lightning network, you find a path that has enough coins at every link and say "okay, I'll give you X amount of my coins if you give the same to someone else who will give the same and so on until we pay the guy I want to pay, so long as *everyone is using coins that exist and are backed by the blockchain.*"
Since it takes a transaction on chain to open a channel and fund it, it's necessary for each channel to actually be funded with real coins. Anyone who failed to do so would fail to produce a usable route in the network.

For lightning network? I'm not sure if there's anything official or not, but I want to say current forecast is Q1 of next year, so sometime in the next 3 months. Wouldn't be surprised if it's delayed to Q2 just to be sure it's ready and safe. They've already successfully tested it on mainnet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:47:48
We could probably stand to do that, yeah, but I think block expansion should be the last step we take when approaching scaling. It comes at significant cost, often a linear 1:1 relation. Double block size, double bandwidth, double RAM, double CPU processing, etc.
I'd like to see us adopt other measures first, see how far those take us, then act accordingly about the block size. As it stands, we've got segwit, which will nearly double block size, but nobody will use the fucking thing while they still complain about the block size. Then we'll have lightning network dropping soon. Estimates predict Q1 next year, but I wouldn't be surprised by Q2. If those don't combine to fix the problem, I'll gladly support bigger blocks. But it shouldn't be our first response if we have other options, even if we have to wait a few more months to get those options.
Edit: and remember that we want Bitcoin to be usable in less developed nations if at all possible. The more we can decentralize, the better. That means keeping participation requirements manageable for poorer countries with less advanced infrastructure. That means they'll have less bandwidth and less powerful machines to run nodes on.

Even with segwit support, you'll have to move the coins. Segwit is part of the address, so it can't be retroactively added to an existing address. But then when you have to make a transaction, you can just dump the rest into a new segwit wallet.

It's not about marketing for LN yet. It's not quite ready. We've only just recently seen the first shots of it being used on mainnet. This is just a blind guess, but considering we've seen seemingly fully functional prototypes, we'll get it ready to use in the next 3 to 6 months.
Not only will it result in an explosion of potential transaction count, it will also revolutionize security in trading on exchanges. You can open a channel, and the only coins that will be on the exchange's side of the channel will be the ones you've already traded. Instead of having to send all your coins to the exchange and withdraw the remainder when you want out, you'll be able to just close the channel, and the exchange will have never at any point controlled the untraded coins.
Unfortunately, this will mainly apply to sellers, I think, because it will likely be unreasonable if not outright infeasible for exchanges to open channels on the upper bounds of your potential buy limits.

What's going to happen, then, if we end up with 5x the transaction volume, but the block size doesn't increase? We're already filling blocks at least some of the time. What do we do when 80% of transactions can't be put on the chain? Fees may let you force your way up in to the top 20%, you don't make room for more transactions, you just made sure *your* transaction had room. Bitcoin doesn't make a good store of wealth, asset, or currency if it's infeasible to transfer it to anyone else. We need miners, but we need miners that can and will support enough transactions. How many is "enough" will vary with adoption, but if "enough" is ever more than "what's available", we have a problem that must be fixed, or people will use an alternative.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:07:48
You throw ifs at me like I'm the only one depending on then, but you're depending on if the chain can support huge growth. There have already been complaints about the fees rising. How much more traffic do you think the chain can support before people seek an alternative? People pay that premium fee because it's not unreasonable yet, and they can still ensure their transactions make it to the chain. What about when the fee gets too high? When the blocks get so full, most transactions are excluded? Who's going to pick up that slack? If not us, my money is on another coin rising up, growing into space we refused to take for ourselves.
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:41:49
How does Bitcoin handle explosive growth from here, then? Do we just stay with our current limits and try to cram 10 gallons of shit into a 5 gallon hat? Do we introduce some sort of off-chain solution? Do we let alt coins rise up and challenge us? Do we finally, as a last act of desperation, capitulate and raise the limit? Do you think this will simply never be an issue?
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:58:23
Okay, I'm gonna try something different. I'm going to start with what's obviously known and progress to my logical end point, expanding the block size. Please let me know when you feel like I've made a mistake.
To begin, Bitcoin is a digital currency (as it says in the sidebar, "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet"). A currency is used to facilitate trade so that we don't have to depend on bartering. If a currency becomes difficult to use, people are likely to look for an alternative. Bitcoin is capable of handling a finite number of transactions given the current block limiting scheme. We are already approaching the current transaction limit. If its popularity continues to grow, or if it is ever formally recognized or even adopted by a government, the number of attempted transactions will significantly exceed the limit. If Bitcoin cannot process more than a tiny fraction of the transactions people want to make, it will fail in its job as a currency and be used as a store of value instead. If it fails to perform its job as a currency, it will lose popularity and value while another coin comes in to fill this void in the market.
So, that said, from this perspective, a block size increase is crucial for things to stay close to the way they are. Either Bitcoin ceases to be a currency and becomes a store of value, or the block size expands to allow the transaction capacity it needs to do its job, or Bitcoin peaks in popularity in the very near future so that raising the block size is never an issue. To me, this is a very logical progression of facts, and it must lead to one of the three conclusions I've given. I strongly doubt we're approaching peak popularity, so I would suggest that Bitcoin must either learn to grow or learn to fill a different niche from the one it's attempting to fill right now.
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:22:39
I can't just go out and prove it. It's not something you can prove without enough transaction volume, and the only way to get that volume is with popularity. The only way that I see for another coin to get that popularity is if Bitcoin severely limits itself so that an alternative must step in to fill the gap.


What I'm worried about is significantly more people trying to pay for it and use it exactly the way they are now. I'm worried about us doing the exact same thing we're doing now, except a lot more of it because there's a lot more people trying to do it. It's simply *not possible.* We can't get 10x the users and still have them using it the same way they do now. 
You're happy with the way things are now, but a critical part of the way things are now is the number of people using it. Over time, it's either going to go up, or it's going to go down, and that's inevitable. If we know something is inevitable, it would be very reasonable to do what we can to adapt to that before it actually happens.
And really, doing nothing is itself an experiment on Bitcoin, something you claim affects you.  It's an experiment on the impact of substantial growth on the system as it stands now. It's running that experiment and making your hypothesis the idea that Bitcoin can handle that growth. If you're wrong, the cost could be as great as complete failure of the coin as popularity begins to slide and starts a fail cascade until it's a shell of its former glory. If we increase the block size and *that's* wrong, miners can demand higher fees to artificially lower the block size, and there may be some centralization as the size of the block chain makes it harder to run a node with enough space. However, the problem of centralization due to block chain size is one we're going to run into anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:52:58
That would be cool to see. How would it distribute coins? You could do a free IPO of sorts for whoever signs up and let them distribute it as they see fit, or you could have wallets open with a baseline amount of Bitlesscoin, but people could and likely would just generate tons of wallets and pool them together which would massively inflate the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:38:43
I think some people would mine it for a while, but probably not a lot and not for long. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:03:52
Okay, now I understand your point. I disagree, then, because that leaves transactional security to another party. It's another potential weak point between me and my coins.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:38:58


No, it really isn't. There's also the power to band together and alter the mechanics of the system, which is the exact discussion we're having. Just because you don't *like* the option doesn't mean you can pretend it's *not* an option.
The use space is unclaimed, ripe for the picking. It might be space we don't need quite yet, but I think it would be best if we take it before we need it, and I stongly believe we will need it. As I said earlier, there's little value in a wealth storage mechanism that doesn't allow for transfer of that wealth.
And you're not answering my questions. You're insisting that making more space is foolish or unreasonable, but you've done precious little to back that point up other than claim it's fine *right now.* I'm not worried about right now because you're right, things *are* working out fairly well right now. I worry about in a year or two. I worry about if a nation decides to formally recognize and legitimize Bitcoin. How do you think we should best handle that growth? We could maintain the block size limit, and that would likely force people onto other chains until an equillibrium is met, but those chains need miners of their own. People that could be mining and securing Bitcoin are instead going to be doing the same for other coins. What would an exodus of miners do to Bitcoin? What happens if 5% of our hashing power leaves for other coins? 10%? 20%? At what point does it trigger a downturn that will be hellish to flip around again?
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:46:15
Technically, OP said they couldn't *bring* coins from the past or future. I think he means that you couldn't change the amount in circulation, even with a time machine.
True, though, someone with time travel could easily just buy coins when they were significantly cheaper and hold them. When they return, though, the same amount will be in existence, s/he'll just have a bigger cut of it than they would have before.
EDIT: And doing so with a large enough chunk of coin could seriously affect the value until either mined coins dwarf it or the coins are dumped in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:17:57
You want to maintain a low block size so that everyone can audit the blockchain? And you would like to do so by restricting size below potential future, or even current, demand? To do so seems like it would push transactions off block somehow or another, depending on how users adapt, which will remove information from the chain itself, making it harder to audit.
@_date: 2016-03-26 21:31:36
So blocks must be further restricted so that other options may flourish, not on their own merit, but to fill a hole left by such meddling?
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:02:32
I'm saying the limits have consequences, and one of those is making it difficult to move Bitcoin from person to person if the transaction count rises high enough. Reaching those higher transaction counts is a consequence of its growing popularity, and it's one I fully expect us to have to deal with. If that can't be remedied, Bitcoin is only going to be good for storing value, not as a currency. There's no indication that the block size was intended to be premanent, and Satoshi himself even commented on possible ways to expand the block size in the future.
This is a bridge that we've known we would have to cross since the very first day. I can't think of any good enough reasons to maintain this limit forever. Changing it isn't to be taken lightly, but that doesn't mean it's never to be done. Everything else is forced to adapt and evolve to changing circumstance, so why shouldn't Bitcoin?
EDIT: And remember that it's valuable becuase of its uses, and a restrictive block size will limit its uses, which will limit its value.
@_date: 2016-03-26 21:16:30
Why would miners need to be prevented from publishing big blocks? Bigger blocks would diminish their own chance of distributing a block before a competing miner could publish one. They have their own reasons to *want* small blocks, so I don't see why they'd need to be restricted.
@_date: 2016-03-26 21:37:51
My point is I don't understand why the block limit is for miners. I asked why, you said these other two things exist. I don't understand why miners need to be restricted from including more transactions simply because these other things exist.
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:45:56
And you think if the transaction count goes through the roof to the point where it's simply impossible to handle all the transactions people want to make, it's going to be okay? So Bitcoin is perfect just as it is and should never be altered again?

I have absolutely no idea what your point is here, **and you're still dodging the questions** so you can brag about how right you are. Do you think that the very first version of Bitcoin was utterly flawless, never needing a single touch to improve or fix it? It is change *resistant*, not change *proof*, and that's likely the ideal balance. Bitcoin certainly needs to be difficult to change, but nobody who helped design it was clairvoyant, so we still need the ability to change it. I'd compare it loosely to the US Constitution. It's a big deal if you change it, but the need for the ability to change it was recognized. If we enough of us can agree a change needs to occur, we can make it, but we have to convince enough people.
And you've still made absolutely no mention of your growth plan. How does Bitcoin handle explosive growth from here? Do we just stay with our current limits and try to cram 10 gallons of shit into a 5 gallon hat? Do we introduce some sort of off-chain solution? Do we let alt coins rise up and challenge us? Do we finally, as a last act of desperation, capitulate and raise the limit? Do you think this will simply never be an issue? You've made a lot of disparaging comments about my opinion, but you've done your best to avoid offering any alternatives.
One of the biggest reasons I've heard against raising the limit is the impact on block propogation for miners. Would it not be plausible, then, for miners to demand higher fees until some balance of risk and reward is found? If fees rise enough, transactions will be discouraged, and the block size will naturally fall. If transactions aren't discouraged enough to reduce the block size, miners will be given extra compensation for the extra risk.

If you're doing a lightning network transaction, yes because there's no real confirmation on the block chain. A path of instant transactions carries the funds from sender to recipient, and each node only confirms when it closes the channel, and it only confirms the balance change, not an entire history of the transactions that caused that balance change.

Most merchants already accept fiat. We want them to accept bitcoin. Bitcoin still doesn't have enough adoption for merchants to want to keep it, so most who do, sell it for fiat.
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:14:49
I don't think it's ready for constant everyday use quite yet, but I think lightning will and is drastically changing that and opening up the possibility that it really is ready for it. In the meantime, though, it's unfortunately best suited for high value, infrequent transactions where waiting for confirmations isn't a big deal.
Another unfortunate factor is price volatility. On the shot up to $19k in 2017 and subsequent crash, a lot of merchants stopped accepting it because the price could oscillate too wildly just in the time it took to get a couple conformations. Lightning will help significantly because merchants can receive it and sell it for local fiat nigh instantly, removing risk of either receiving too little or receiving too much and having to possibly refund the change.
Edit: of course, we would prefer those merchants not sell it instantly, but we gotta start somewhere.

Well... Considering the post we're talking about... I'm gonna guess fees. It's a secure payment method faster than cash or card with no threat of charge backs and virtually no transaction fees on lightning. They don't care about bitcoin itself, but they definitely care what it can do for them.

Unfortunately, you need a wallet that lets you set your own fees. In many cases, even wallets with just simple fast/normal/slow confirmations speeds set the fees higher than necessary. In some cases, even the slow setting should go out in the very next block judging by the state of the mempool.
Exchanges don't typically give you that much control, though. Coinbase, for example, uses a fixed fee that is usually far higher than necessary. I think they do it partially because if it confirms asap, they don't get support tickets from people who don't understand these things and set their fees way too low.
Some exchanges let you withdraw for free. GDAX does free withdrawals and is run by Coinbase, and you can transfer funds from Coinbase to GDAX to take advantage of those free withdrawals. Gemini is one that gives you 30 free withdrawals per month. Bitstamp is another, I think, but I could be wrong. I think there are others, but I don't know the whole industry. Withdrawal fees are a good thing to consider when picking an exchange, especially when dealing with smaller amounts.
Once you withdrawal coins to your own wallet, you want it to be one that lets you control the fees and uses segwit because segwit pushes down your necessary fee even further. Electrum supports both. Ledger Nano S supports both. At least a few other wallets do, too, but I can't think of any names right now.
Once they're in your own wallet and you're trying to send them again, you'll want to check the mempool to see what sort of fees are being paid by transactions waiting to confirm. Remember that a block is about a megabyte and there's a little bit devoted to headers and such, so a little less than 1 MB of transactions will go out every block, maybe more with segeit adoption, but I only depend on the 1 MB. [This site]( is fairly popular for checking the mempool. When you hover the mouse over the graph or touch it if you're on mobile, it shows how many transactions are offering to pay that fee *or higher* at that point in time. Note that each lower fee group as at least as large as the one above it in the box that pops up because it's all transactions in that range *or higher.*
So if you look at the mempool for right now measured in MB, 0.869 MB of transactions are offering to pay 220+ satoshis/byte. If you pay at least 220 satoshis per byte of transaction size, it should confirm quickly assuming there's not an immediate flood of higher paying transactions. You can set it higher if you're anxious. A simple non-segwit transaction with only one spending address and two receiving addresses (one you send to, one to take the leftover change) is..  I think about 225 bytes? I think a transaction that spends the same way from a segwit address is close to 150 bytes.
If you look at the graph and consider how it's trending and are willing to be a little risky, you can make some assumptions. If transactions are confirming faster than they can pile up, you might assume you can get away with an even slightly smaller fee that will still confirm soon. I've tried this and sometimes get transactions waiting for 6-9 hours, but they went through. On the other hand, if they're piling up faster than they can confirm, maybe pay a slightly higher fee so you don't get pushed out before the next block.
One other useful feature in a wallet is the option for a *replace by fee* transaction. This lets you change the fee you're willing to pay if the transaction gets stuck. Electrum is the only wallet I know 100% for sure supports it along with segwit and fees you can set yourself. I'm sure there are others, but again, can't name them off the top of my head.

I'm beginning to think this cycle will repeat until we reach a point where it's ready for mainstream adoption. People start paying a lot of attention to bitcoin, they try it and find it more complicated than they can/will put up with, and then things start to slip downwards. People get all hyped up about it, but it's just not ready to live up to that hype.
We need a significant boost to network capacity and ideally transaction speed, both of which can be provided by lightning network once it's fully ready for mass deployment. That adds some complications to using bitcoin, though, so we'll need wallets with really good UIs to make it easier for nontechnical users to user it, and from my understanding, good progress is being made there.
Once we have a network that can support orders of magnitude more people and make it easy even for the ones that don't know anything about technology, we'll see one of those climbs that doesn't peak so quick, maybe even just levels off. We may end up needing more than just lightning, but there's a lot of good stuff in the works that will help, so we'll make it in due time.

It has the utility, but it also has significant centralization issues, both in terms of node concentration (and I think miners, but I'm less sure about that) and pressures to further increase that centralization. If it centralizes too much, it becomes ripe for abuse and control, and then it becomes little better than the fiat banking system.

To simplify a lot, basically two people agree to lock some Bitcoin up in such a way that they can change how much each gets many, many times until someone decides to finalize it by publishing the latest balance state to the blockchain. Then, these people can connect to a network of people that did the same with other people, and they can all agree to pass Bitcoin along the chain of people to the intended recipient, and it's done so that it only works if nobody cheats. If anyone tries to cheat, no Bitcoin gets passed around.
So it's basically a network of people who have made Bitcoin transactions but haven't actually published them so they can update them instead of making a new transaction. This network helps each other pass money to people they aren't directly connected to, and it's done in a way to prevent cheating. At any time, anyone can just publish their transaction and take their portion, but then it can't use this network until it starts the process over.

It mitigates it by running software. Software you're putting on a machine you don't control. You can trust that proper bitcoin software will properly validate, but you can't guarantee AWS will in no way tamper with the machines they control and rent out. This could vary from tampering with unencrypted communications between your rented machine and its destination  to directly tampering with the software on that machine because they physically control it, and physical access trumps most forms of security.
Now, do I think AWS is likely to do these things? No. At least not right now. But I still have to put some trust in them. Such is not the case when I run a node on a machine I have 100% full control of.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:15:17
Let me preface this by saying I'm not an expert on this subject, so anyone can feel free to correct me.
A pruned node basically gets the whole chain, uses that to calculate the current state, then discards most of the chain because it already knows how that went and doesn't need to reverify immutable blocks. This means you have an accurate understanding of the current state of things, but you don't keep the *proof* on hand. So you know you're right, but you can't prove that to others, limiting the benefit to the network.
However, and this is where I'm less certain, you should be able to determine that a new received block is still valid, so you should be able to pass it to other nodes who can and will independently verify that the block is legit.
So will it help you by letting you verify the chain yourself? Yes, definitely. Will it help new blocks propagate across the network? I'm pretty sure, yes, but my understanding of pruned nodes is limited. Will it help new nodes get up to speed? No, because you can't give them the opportunity to independently verify the current state of the chain. Yo can only tell them what you believe the current state to be.

Only for two weeks. Then the difficulty adjustment completely nullifies it. Or, if it came in late in the period, nerfs it before fully neutralizing it in the second readjustment.


I don't know Ethereum, but if it's adjusting every block, that makes it even more useless. Instead of being neutralized in two weeks, it'll be neutralized almost immediately.
Any blockchain that difficulty adjusts for hash power cannot be meaningfully sped up by more hash power. You can get a temporary boost, but it's very short term, and it can only be gained with physical devices that must be produced, sold, shipped, and set up. It's infeasible to do on any sort of long term scale beyond one or two difficulty readjustments in Bitcoin.

Microsoft was cooperative with the PRISM program and is historically prone to monopolistic practices, and there was a huge stink about Intel's ME that essentially *is* a backdoor, so... It really isn't unreasonable paranoia.
As for AWS, the host machine is king in a virtualized world. Keylogging would be trivial. As would most other forms of access. I know you can encrypt the machine, but that only helps until you boot it up and have to decrypt it. I'm not aware of any methods to completely prevent the host from tampering with anything, but I'd love to learn about one.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:38:46
is mistaken, more hash power would be a very short term temporary fix at best. Every two weeks, the difficulty of mining adjusts based on the current hash power, negating the speed boost from that extra power. You can mine more blocks and therefore process more transactions until that adjustment is made, but then you go back to 10 minutes per block even with all this new hash power. And if any of that hash power turns off, it actually *slows down* block production until the difficulty readjusts again.
Edit: so it's best to consider 10 minutes per block a constant. You can't speed that up for long in any sort of meaningful way. Instead, you have to do what people have spent the last year and a half doing. You have to either fit more transactions in a block (either make them more space efficient (lots of work on this one) or increase the amount of space per block (the Bitcoin Cash method, which was rejected by Bitcoin)) or you move those transactions off chain somehow (like lightning network and the various side chains being developed).

It's definitely disappointing, and I wouldn't mind a small increase AS LONG AS we studied things and ensured it wouldn't have these consequences. Even if we did guarantee it, though, you initially interpreted his argument as bigger blocks leading to increased adoption. How long until that spoils it and we're back to square one again? Maybe it would last long enough for us to get these more long term solutions implemented, but with the explosive growth in price we've seen this year, I worry it won't.
In the end, block size increases just kick the can down the road, and I'm not a fan of those kinds of solutions outside the most dire situations. If you don't absolutely have to do it, you should avoid those kinds of solutions. It sucks right now, but we don't *need* it.

Net neutrality in the states has a complex history, and from what I can tell, was stuck in a sort of legal grey area once we moved to cable internet until that was passed. Dial-up and DSL used phone lines, which subjected them to some equality regulations that don't seem quite as strict.
In the past, they HAVE throttled or outright blocked BitTorrent traffic. They HAVE blocked VoIP services. When they get caught doing things like that, though, they have a tendency to end up paying a fine, stopping the practice, and not having to admit any wrongdoing.
So yes. They have historically blocked protocols they found annoyingly competitive. If they decided Bitcoin was one of them, without net neutrality, they could really hamper miners and nodes. Or if someone paid them enough to think that way. Or if it consumed enough bandwidth that they might have to actually invest in infrastructure otherwise.
They don't seem to have tried to charge for special access, but I suspect that's largely because they didn't want to rock the boat too hard. With Ajit heading the FCC and them getting a big, obvious sign with net neutrality's repeal, I strongly suspect they'll try to start.

If you keep your rules simple, you shouldn't leave them very much attack surface. From my understanding, firewall compromisation is *significantly* more likely to be from poor configuration or from other services it leaves exposed being compromised than it is to be from a flaw in the firewall itself. If you're also opening your firewall to a variety of other services, you might have a point. I would consider that more a flaw in the other exposed services rather than the firewall itself. Still, if you're running those services, it does expose them to collateral damage from their interest in the node.

I don't like it for the network as a whole because it creates a centralized point for nodes. If it becomes popular, AWS now controls some sizable portion of the nodes.
I don't like it for myself as an individual because it interferes with the trustless model. I now have to trust that AWS has in no way tampered with the machine, virtual or physical, that validates the blocks or the software the machine uses to do so.

You've never been threatened with it because it's illegal. Without net neutrality, it would be perfectly legal to charge you to allow your Bitcoin protocol traffic to flow freely. They could also decide it's not even worth letting the traffic through, although I don't think that's very likely. But once they don't have net neutrality regulations holding them back, you think fucking Comcast is gonna pass up any chance they get to milk you for more money?

While that's an understandable wish, unfortunately, splitting the community without a very large majority support is a poor idea. Barring a disaster of some sort that ONLY impacts Bitcoin proper, the smaller offshoot is going to face an extreme challenge. Bitcoin isn't under enough pressure to fracture into two successful pieces yet, and logical or not, the original chain has the popularity and recognition to prevail in all but the most extreme circumstances.


Because they have power and try to wield it. Centralization pushes that power into even fewer hands, making it even easier for them to abuse it. Decentralization keeps individuals weak and forces them to work with the community at large.


I actually wasn't, so I'll be looking into that, thanks. Depending on how much of the chain they're forced to store, that could alleviate that issue.


Yes. Yes, I did. But then potential issues were realized, and preventative measures were taken. Which is exactly what I'm advocating. Look for potential abuse or unintended consequences and mitigate them.


Well no fucking shit. Now you're just being a smug twat. You still have to propagate blocks quickly to nodes and other miners, and you still have to store more than one of them at a time.


And until then? How do we check the power people may obtain in the event of increased centralization? If a bad actor gets too much power, they could damage Bitcoin's community or reputation in a way that could be very hard to fix, possibly irreversibly. What if that person wasn't just greedy but actually wanted Bitcoin to fail? Or was simply susceptible to bribes from those who want failure? 
There was already a big stink about miners trying to force a fork on us, I think 2X, although I may be misremembering. If they had more power at the time, they might not have been denied, and their success would have proven Bitcoin could be bullied and destroyed a lot of confidence in it.

Dude, you were the fucking one who started with the hoses.
And home bandwidth is still a factor because the bigger the block is, the longer it takes to propagate around the network. Is it a huge one? Probably not, but it still is one, which means it should be considered. Anything that might encourage centralization should be considered carefully before it's changed.
Not to mention ISPs are just dying to implement data caps. They already have them in some areas of the States if I'm not mistaken. So yeah. There's a limited amount available to people, even if that limit is 100% artificial.
the storage space definitely could be an issue, too. The chain has grown almost 50 GB since the turn of the year. That would be 100 GB with double block sizes. That's still not a ton, but the bigger the chain gets, the more dedicated hardware you need to run a node, which encourages centralization there.
So this change can encourage centralization of nodes *and* mining. Will it be enough to be dangerous? I dunno, maybe not. Probably not. But it's not a good habit to get into. A tweak here, a change there, and a dozen steps later, things are heavily centralized.
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:01:37
It'd have to be a pretty damn big transaction, and you'd have to be in a hell of a hurry.

The amount moved in a transaction is irrelevant to the fees. Whether you sent it to yourself or another party is not just irrelevant to the fees, it's not something that can be discerned from the transaction. The only factor that really counts is block space consumed. The only way two different transactions can differ on that matter is number of inputs and outputs.
Segwit does a lot to help reduce those fees, but its use is not yet widespread, so yes, fees on the whole are still high because they're not using readily available tools to reduce them.

Yes, but there are other consequences. Bandwidth and storage availability will further concentrate mining power. Whereas metaphorical public transportation increases capacity without the unintended consequences.

@_date: 2017-11-15 21:05:43
No, I'm saying there are consequences to achieving your goals. Sure, you'll get more transactions per block and therefore faster confirmations after clearing the backlog, but in the process, you will making mining and running a node more resource intensive. We may have to eventually make those resource intensive changes, but we should investigate viable alternatives, and if they're available, use them instead.

It's certainly the most extremely likely outcome, but a huge advancement contained in just a few hands could be bad. It could concentrate 51% or more of hashing power in a select few hands. Not saying it's remotely likely, but someone who makes such a breakthrough, sees the potential abuse, and has more flexible morals... It's within the realm of possibility, but not probability. As it stands, I think the hashing strength is too great for anything but an earth shattering breakthrough to compete with.

The other issue nobody seems to mention is any threat to the core hashing algorithm. Is it likely? I can't say. But if a flaw is discovered, or if hashing is suddenly somehow made  significantly easier through hardware or, less likely, software, it could cause a catastrophic blow to trust. I don't find this terribly likely, but it is something to keep in mind when discussing things that could end bitcoin.

Sure, they can use those options, but in a discussion of centralization, that's a moot point. Light wallets are wholly dependent on nodes that actually perform validation. So these people can participate in the network, but they're unable to help ensure it stays decentralized, which is the entire point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:42:00
There's a lot of concern that their chosen path, on-chain scaling, will create heavy centralization pressure. When blocks got full, they decided to just make the blocks bigger, and some of the discussions I've seen over in suggests that they're willing and even eager to just keep ramping up block size whenever it becomes an issue. This creates centralization pressure because it means more processing power to check that blocks are valid, more bandwidth to send and receive blocks, more storage space to store the entire blockchain, etc.
If your goal is to maximize decentralization to make Bitcoin difficult to control, this is a terrible idea. If your goal is to increase capacity as quickly as possible to handle adoption rates and you don't really care about that centralization pressure, it's a decent idea. Some downplay the centralization pressure this would lead to because of things like hardware costs, but I have *never, not even once* seen someone try to make that argument from the perspective of someone in an impoverished nation. Sure, an enthusiast in a nation with a high standard of living and wages will have little problem affording it, but non-enthusiasts won't spend the money, and huge chunks of the human population simply *can't*, no matter how much they may want to if cost of a node increases much.
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:40:08
I'm gonna disagree with that being safe on the grounds that it means there's an amount of hashing power floating around that's equal to network hashing power. If just half of *that* congregates anywhere... bad things could happen.

I'm missing the distinction still, then. If cash is still considered credit, what do you even consider real money? Coins, cards, and cash are the only used forms of money in day to day life in modern countries. Cards and cash are out by your definition. Coins I guess are made of legit valuable metals, but even some coins are actually poorly valued. Like an American penny costs more than a penny to produce, but it's only worth a penny. I don't really see a point at which you are 100% in the realm of "real" money unless you count things that aren't standard currency, in which case I feel like you blur the line even further.

They still have to give me money when I get the loan. I gotta pay the person selling the house or car or whatever, and that guy wants real money. If that guy doesn't use the same bank, his bank will want the real money, so they can't just totally swear the money is in his account. If he does use the same bank but has the audacity to try to spend the money... Whoever gets it wants real money. At some point, this chain hits someone who won't just take their word for it and demands a legit dollar.

The problem with Coinbase here is that it takes a week to get your coins, and if you only bought enough for this present, price might fluctuate wildly in that time

Ianal, but I believe since it took place on a US server, it was effectively committed in the US, regardless of your remote location.

It does matter, though, because eventually, however many people down the line it takes, someone goes to an ATM or gets cash back. Maybe it's half a dozen people down the line, and maybe it's been split into chunks every step of the way. Eventually, someone asks for a dollar and gets it. They might not ask for the entire loan's worth, but it splits among more and more people, and more and more of them will need cash for whatever reason. If you trace it far enough, people will get parts of it out in cash. You think Wells Fargo trusts Bank of America not to try to screw them? There has to be some actual money flow at some point, even if it never fully reaches 100% cash.

...and those humans are notorious for fucking the seller hard and often.

Well, bitcoin wouldn't be your point of failure, but you still have to gain access to a file that grants access to millions of dollars. There's gonna be some monitoring involved.

Yeah, there'd totally be no investigation if $80 million worth of coins poofed.
