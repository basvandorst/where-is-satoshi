We provide open source software for our operators. This is optional functionality for those who need it.

This is Zach, from Lamassu. This thread was posted by a friend of the purchaser’s, so it’s understandable that some important details were missed. I’ve carefully reviewed the 37 emails that were sent back and forth with this customer.
TL;DR We feel this post mischaracterizes the relations between Lamassu and the customer in question. We cannot ship before receiving payment.
The customer could have had his machine in early May, as promised, however he accepted an offer for an at-cost upgrade to our improved screen, which he acknowledged would delay shipment to late May. We requested payment for the remaining 50% of the purchase price repeatedly through the months of May and June, but the customer never forwarded the funds. Finally on July 17, he asked for a refund.
Yes, we are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. We do have a full purchase agreement, which the customer acknowledged he had read. As machines are currently made to order, we can not accept refunds. We make that very clear, beginning on our order form. We’ve shipped about 200 machines, more than any other Bitcoin ATM manufacturer, and we’re proud of our track record.

Love your enthusiasm. The US is a challenging jurisdiction, but you have the advantage of only having to worry about one state, not all 50. Of course, FinCEN registration is a must. Please contact us to discuss this.

Yeah, that's it. You have to register first.

We don't need donations. We have significant investment interest already. The outpouring of interest from the entrepreneurial community has been incredible. We are currently evaluating our hardware options for producing a commercial version of the Bitcoin Machine. Progress is being made on both technological and business development fronts.

In the Wild West world of Bitcoin, I understand the skepticism. We have an aggressive timeline. We should be getting our enclosure next week, and we'll be showing off a fully operational machine at the Bitcoin 2013 conference. Also, an earlier prototype has in fact been operational, and [dispensed over $5,000]( worth of bitcoins to the public.

It's still there, in the coming days it will probably be a BitPay checkout.

It's a 3D rendering, but it's not fake. This is a polished version of the actual CAD file that was used to create the metal enclosure. We'll have photos as soon as we assemble the parts in place. That will happen next week.

For those of you who are not familiar with DSB, they are considered one of the best breweries in the universe.
From Wikipedia: In 2008, RateBeer declared Struise to be the best brewers in the world per their annual members' poll.[4] This was met with mixed opinions in the world of beer enthusiasts.[5] Many of those critical of the award cited the recent founding of the company as well as the fact that DSB did not own a brewing facility at the time.

It would be impossible for one small company to comply with the regulations in every state and country, so we'll be selling the hardware, and relying on our distributors to figure that out. Some of them have already engaged in the process.
