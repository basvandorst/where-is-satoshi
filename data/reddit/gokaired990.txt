What exactly does this do for you if you already have you BTC stored on a hard drive? What exactly do these do?

"May" be the government's fault? I'm all for avoiding talking about politics in threads like this, but come on.

Just note that this claim is made by a woman who lied about  her ancestry to get a job...

They'll probably put him on a USD denomination as a **** you when he dies, like they did to Jackson.

I'd assume no public exchange is 100% safe from losing your coins. When you buy enough, I'd move the keys to your hard drive with backups asap. Buying them IS holding them, as long as you don't sell.
Litecoin doesn't seem to be moving as quickly as Bitcoin in terms of gaining value, but is supposedly better to use as an actual currency. Ethereum was created by admitted communists, so take that into consideration when judging their grasp of economics, and whether you want to invest in anything from them.

Not being a citizen doesn't give you an excuse not to celebrate it. &gt;:L

Feels bad, man. I have a little over a tenth of one. Even if it eventually hit 40k, I'd still only have about $4,000. Not bad for a $500 investment, but the days of insane gains for newcomers are probably long gone. I doubt it will ever get to more than 40k, but I guess you never know. Longtime holders probably never thought it would hit 1k.

I'm a complete noob to all of this, but I'm assuming it is better for transactions. If you hand someone a paper wallet, they probably know the private key, and can take the funds out between the time that you verify and accept and you actually sweep the funds from the paper. With this, nobody knows the private key, so you can wait months before actually taking the btc off of it with no risk.

Dude. gtfo of here. Next you are going to tell me this guy thinks he doesn't have to celebrate the 4th of July.

Yeah, it is best for me to feed my government that blows my money on welfare and wars that I don't want. Great.

Damn, it is almost 9,100 already.

This is really troubling. Is there any better exchange I can use? I just got into bitcoin when I bought the recent dip to 5k. I don't want to have to rely on Coinbase for the next big dip after they have proven themselves to be unreliable now.
