You should ask this question in r/btc just to here the otherside. Not that they are wrong here, you would just hear the other side there.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:52:45
Like being able to actually use it lol
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:45:00
Fuck off
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:19:05
So you have nothing to back up your claims?
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:10:14
I mean bcash as you guys call it here just had 2 million transactions in a day so clearly your last statement is false. I’d love to see lightning network work as much as the rest of you, but clearly if none of you can open up a wallet and quickly send some then it is not fully functioning. If you cannot recreate it, it’s useless. Now, Can someone also please explain to me and show proof that bitcoin cashs nodes are centrally located on alibabas servers. That would actually be useful information
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:22:23
Sure. I own more btc than bch. I think they both serve a purpose but the constant mudslinging back and forth betters neither side.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:01:53
Why is it a scam?
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:18:01
That’s so short term though . If we test that 5800 support level again volume should increase soon afterwards and I’d imagine we’d bounce back above 6k. But at the end of the day your guess is as good as mine
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:27:22
Send some to me first, I’ll test it out for you

No miners secure the network in order to turn a profit. It is not volunteer activity
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:33:58
You have a choice to go to work every morning. That doesn’t make it volunteer work.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:01:46
I am not. I don’t get what you are getting at. All acts are voluntary except for those forced upon you by the state (ex taxes, subpoenas). Of course mining bitcoin is a voluntary choice but that is not the same as a volunteer activity. Mining bitcoin requires an investment in hash power with an end goal of turning a profit on that investment. It is no different than voluntarily investing in a company hoping to see returns in capital gains. Both are voluntary actions but not volunteer activity.
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:07:29
It works both ways
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:30:59
I’ve never heard a more nonsensical statement. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:59:16
Even if someone is spamming the network shouldnt the protocol be able to work? The fact that you think one person can spam the system shows an inherent flaw in the system itslef. Is a blocksize increase even in the roadmap for bitcoin as harddrives increase and bandwith increases?
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:15:09
But why would a restaurant only have seating for a 100 when there’s enough space for 1000? Would you rather have 1000 people order $50 entrees or 100 order $100 entrees?
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:04:56
Your world view is the reason the 09 collapse happened. Oh yeah the bankers are some of smartest people let’s not question them. It’s quite pathetic honestly. Learn to think critically bud.
@_date: 2019-04-20 00:52:04
My bad you are correct
@_date: 2019-04-20 00:59:26
It all comes down to a balance of decentralization, scarcity, and low fees.
Bitcoin is no doubt the most decentralized and most secure cryptocurrency but has made compromises in scalability and low fees to achieve that.
Having the most hashpower makes it the most secure cryptocurrency as well.
Volatility is irrelevant but also a problem currently but all new markets start off volatile especially in the tech industry. Volatility will decrease over time as bitcoin finds it fair market value which is hard to determine at this point in time as the user base and people who accept it is so hard to determine.
@_date: 2019-04-20 01:08:55
Lightning network can’t feasibly work with a 1mb blocksize at scale. 
Thought experiment:
In 5 years the bitcoin reward in each block is down to 1.75 btc. Everyone’s coins are on the lightning network. Closing a network channel would have to cost 1000s of dollars to incentivize the miners because no one will be using the main chain and the block reward is so small. The only people willing to close a channel will be centralized large bank like companies. It cannot work. 
Would love to hear how that situation could work.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:08:25
You don’t own bitcoin bud
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:58:37
Very dumb
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:09:37
As of now yes
@_date: 2019-04-20 00:39:21
That is almost definitely not true lol
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:01:52
Big scalability issues
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:44:06
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:09:45
What kind of question is this
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:26:45
Mine is not backed by emotions. It is backed by a solid understanding of economics and people’s use of tech.
You’re too ignorant to understand that.
Tell your mom to use lightning and open a channel. Do you honestly believe what you’re saying or are you just a follower of the herd?
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:44:39
I would say so without a doubt but would like to hear why he says otherwise
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:48:55
You’re not. Good luck though with your failed project route. Still rooting for bitcoin, but with its current trajectory I’m sure a lot of people are going to come out as big losers.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:21:30
Like I said sad logic, the value in bitcoin is the blockchain, taking verything off the blockchain makes it invaluable and will make it so that only large actors will be able to afford closing channels because the fees will have to be so high to incentivize miners and keep the blockchain secure.
You are a sad human being who has been played. Sorry for you
You want adoption to occur when people can barely use bitcoin as is now you’re telling them to use lightning. It’s honestly palpable that anyone actually believes this is the best route for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:54:48
This is a about one of the worst thought experiments I’ve ever heard . Why don’t we just take away your coins
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:21:41
Sorry been away for a while, why would you arbitrarily set it at 1 mb? i understand why you pay higher fees but moving everything off chain disincentives miners from entering the game to begin with. What average person is going to be opening and closing a channel when it is going to be soooo expensive. The thing is bitcoin is going to need to become more secure to see mass adoption. Security comes as a result of an increased price of bitcoin which incentives miners to mine. Bitcoin can currently do 9 tps on chain. That cannot change without a hard fork, maybe it could change with a soft fork and slightly increase. But what you dont understand economically speaking is that 9 tps is not enough to incentivize miners as the bitcoin reward decreases. Imagine 20 years from now the block reward is next to zero.  777600 transactions per day will be all the transactions possible to incentivise miners. At an average fee of $1 that is $777,600 a day to incentivize miners. We need more incentive which would come from more fees on chain from more transactions, wed have to see where the equilibrium is, its obviously greater than 1 mb, otherwise the fees are going to have to be so high to incentivize miners and get decent decentraliztion, and the only people who will be able to close channels will be rich, centralized hubs. Bigger blocks will allow for more transactions, and ultimately more fees for the miners. I dont know where the perfect spot is, but it is certainly higher than 1 mb.

And their you have it . You want bitcoin to be gold? You are a sad human.
We were trying to better humanity and all you wanted was to make a quick buck. Bitcoin is and always was supposed to be cash. Peer to peer cash will change the world and provide freedom for humanity. Gold online will do nothing to better the world. Digital gold is worth nothing but digital cash will be worth everything.
You’re a sad man. You have no idea what was trying to be achieved here. I’m done debating you as you have your mind made up. You want bitcoin to be gold, but you have no understanding of economics and don’t understand that digital gold is worth nothing compared to digital cash. Have fun stifling the growth of what was once a great project.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:45:06
Pretty sad on your part honestly and disingenuous
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:25:12
How so? You control your keys.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:58:09
Haha I’m aware. Always trying start debate and get more people thinking though. Good day to you
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:39:41
Maybe if bitcoin maximalists spent more time explaining why 1 mb limit is better and why the lightning network is feasible rather than labeling dissenters fraud this space could grow. But instead we’ve got high fees and a network that can’t keep up with the demand we all hope to see.
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:53:10
That is pretty sad logic
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:25:27
How so? You have your keys.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:31:00
So bitcoin was made for the rich?
Do you not see how horrible of a system this is?
I’ll stick with visa.
People will never adopt a system with high fees. You DO NOT UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS
Bitcoin is more than technology.
Bitcoin has failed and turned into an investment vehicle for the rich. Big things we’re trying to happen here. People were going to achieve more freedom. But greed got the best of the protocol.
