Is it true that once you do a Replace-By-Fee, you can't do it again? So if you mistake the fee the second time you are screwed up.
There are transactions stuck for more than 3 weeks now. Who know if they will ever be forgotten by the network.
Seems like the nodes are re-broadcasting the transactions forever and that's a shame.
If you send thousands of bucks in a single TX and you mistake the fee twice, it's over

This is not forcing, it's preventing the gov from forcing things the other way around. That's what they are trying to do.
Educational material has been posted by other people like us, but it's too little compared to fake news. 
Now we are facing adversaries like the gov that try to discredit crypto , they are flooding the net with too many FUD, that the good edu material you talk about gets unnoticed (at least by non-tech people that is not already a Bitcointalk member).
We can only counteract that if we collaborate against them, by spreading positive info.
I don't want to drag in speculators, if it means scalpers, but just buyers and holders.

HODL = buy and hold long-term (years), without selling at price drops which are assumed to be temporary.
About education, yes that was a better term ;)
"stand by its own merit".. mmh, but the merit is only there if people knows about what BTC deserves, and what really is, instead of reading all the FUD news by the gov.
If the gov is the only one informing the people about BTC with negative news, the "merit" automatically gets defeated because people will start believing crypto is a scam.
So we must prevent this from happening, by spreading the truth.

When i have free time once in a while i post some positive thought/news about crypto in various communities.
I will start posting on non-crypto communities as well
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:03:33
And many fail even at hodling because they invest too much then they panic because the price temporarily dropped.
We should educate them to invest what they can afford to lose.
Like max 30% of their life savings, not more
So that they can resist to price drops because they can keep living  without that money in the worst case.

"are aware". It's not enough, if you mean they just heard its name.
Now many non tech-savvy people believe BTC is just about speculation, it's a Ponzi scheme, and is dangerous if you're not a pro, bla bla.
These negative thoughts are there because of the gov's fake news. They want to hinder the crypto ecosystem because it's against their evil business.
We can inform those people that the truth is different. That BTC has been made to end the gov tyranny and business that is damaging us.
We can ensure them there's no need to worry about volatility the Fud news talk about, because they can all be HODLers for a few years and they profit anyway, even if the price drops temporarily like it did every year.

Yes it does. The fake news from other sources based in Western countries have the same taste as this ad campaign. 
The polish central bank is just one that was blatantly caught with bloody hands, but the same misinformation tactics are used by American and Western european gov institutions as well, not just polish.

3 questions: 
- if it starts from Bitfinex and propagates quickly to GDAX, then if you play on other exchanges like Bitstamp, you have the time to take action after Spoofy makes a move, right? So when Spoofy pumps the price by 10% on Bitfinex, you buy on Bitstamp as the price there is still low for a few minutes because it takes time to propagate there.
- These daily pumps &amp; dumps caused by Spoofy are 10% price variations , right? Is it possible to profit from them? If you try to buy low and sell high or vice-versa when Spoofy is in action,  you have to take into account not only the money you lose in trading fees, but especially the difference between the buy book and the sell book. If that difference is near to 10%, you earn nothing.
Not sure if i was clear. I mean, the actual difference between the price you bought at, and the price you will be able to sell at after the 10% dump. Because a 10% variation of the price is a variation of the *average* between the buy book and sell book, so it doesn't mean you are going to earn the 10% with this operation.
- How much can you earn with this daytrading job, compared to HODLing, per each working hour? You need to stay 8/10 hours a day in front of the screen to do this job, while if you buy $5k worth of  BTC and HODL for 12 months, chances are you earn 50% or even 100% in 12 months , but having actually "worked" just 10-20 minutes :) In those 12 months you do something else and wait for the market to levitate.

"crypto is high risk" is what these criminal govs want us to think.
The banks are losing total control over our money, thanks to Bitcoin. That's why they want to hinder BTC with those FUD fake news they are spreading
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:26:02


What? If you mean those thieves want us to put money in their banks, so that they have control over it, then yes, they "worry about our money".
Bitcoin is hindering that and it will benefit us,  and they don't like it

Govs are not gonna arrest themselves

Banks &amp; gov are scared of BTC because crypto is our saver, it can take common people out of poverty and slavery, and they don't want us to save ourselves.
Gov is also trying to eliminate normal cash, not just crypto.
They want people to put money in the banks so that they actually have control over it and can steal it ( and they are doing that, as you can see ).
But with normal cash or crypto, you have your money in your hands so you eliminate that problem.
Many people is realizing that.
It's one of the very reasons why crypto was made
HODL and wait a few years ;)
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:16:26
He probably did.
Lol at Goldman Sachs that used to talk shit about BTC while they invested in it themselves..
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:21:31
Why are the govs paying mainstream magazines &amp; youtubers to discredit BTC so aggressively?
Because they fear Bitcoin, as Bitcoin has been made to help the people get out of poverty and slavery, and govs want us to get poor more and more.
The govs fear BTC to the point they invest in fake news against it, that's a strong signal! It means BTC is gaining popularity and has potential, so it's a good investment :)
I am going to buy some more and HODL it a few years ;)

IMO that's unnecessary mental masturbation you can avoid if you just buy crypto, having invested the money you can afford to lose, and go to sleep a few years.
You will make profit passively without wasting time getting nervous. 
In these years,while you wait for your investment to grow, you can learn/do something more useful for you :)
No need to ruin your eyes looking at the screen for nothing.
The people like you, who want to make profit short-term, is the real reason why you see these "mountains" in the graphs.
Not that Spoofy guy you talk about.
You emotional guys **need to learn to HODL for at least 1 year**.
That's the way to play the crypto game, daytrading doesn't work here!
