The most valuable thing on the planet right now. How can it just be that Kraken can do nothing to retrieve it?  There is always a way.

Kraken has withheld my bitcoin, ignored my tickets and offered no solutions after I contacted their support a number of times offering solutions.
My bitcoin is sitting in a friend's BCH deposit account.
Any other crypto exchange would credit me the coin or transfer the coin back to where it was sent from, transfer it to that friend's BTC deposit account.
If a bank did this with your money would you not open a case against them?
Is this not theft? 
It's not just me this has happened to, Kraken admitted on email to me that a few of their clients are in this same situation.

Haha, it could very well be or made from clay either was I dig the symbolism (pictures can speak a 1000 words).

I sent my BTC from my wallet to my friend's Kraken account. Why?
I was in Europe at the time and she had an account with them. I needed to turn some of my bitcoin into cash. Kraken does not support South African bank cards at the time so I had to use a friend's Dutch bank account which was supported.

Why cant Kraken simply receive full access to Alice account which she is willing to give. Kraken does not have to give Alice the private key. Kraken can create a wallet if that is really necessary or use a wallet that is already created which they have full access too, send the bitcoin to the wallet and then send it from the wallet to Alice BTC deposit account, give back the Amin over Alice's account again, therefore, No private key was given to Alice, security is still fully secure, Alice has the Bitcoin in her BTC account now. Alice pays Kraken for there services. Kraken is happy, Alice and Bob are happy.
Why is this plan difficult?

She would love to send it back but she can't access it causes its sitting in her BCH deposit account. We have asked Kaken to move it to her BTC deposit account but they chose not to. They have the private key, they govern her account, why can't they just move the bitcoin from the BCH account to her BTC account?

Thank you for your opinion and insight. We really appreciate it. Funny how Kraken wants us to send in a support ticket again. They have already received three from us. All "resolved" in their eyes by simply stating it is not in their policy to help us. Through one ticket we are still waiting for a manager's reply. . .

Hi Kraken_Adam, I am sure we still have an open ticket in your system. I will hit the reply button and open it again. We were put "on hold" by one of your support employees who told us he was going to ask a manager to look into it. I can give you the names of the support employees we had contact with if you wish.
