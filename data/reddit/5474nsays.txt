Yes. I told my husband that if he wanted to get me flowers he could pick them from the side of the damn road, there are better things to spend that money on. For instance books, or a bigger hard drive. Most of our holiday B.S. is overpriced, but they pressure people by implying that you don't care enough if you don't participate.

No wuccus, it's not a very well known phone, but I love it. I appreciate people like you who make lists like these so I don't have to. Thanks!

For one, The LG Optimus G Pro (not that same as the optimus g, or the g pro 2) should be on that list.

If this is something you are truly interested in, check out [Worldbuilders]( They go through charities like [Heifer International]( to provide education and livelihoods to third world countries. Even when the lottery and auction aren't running, like now, you can still [buy]( cool things and the profits go straight to charity. To see if they will accept bitcoin, I would contact them or perhaps get in touch with [Pat Rothfuss]( directly, as he is the founder of Worldbuilders and loves to find new ways to promote it. 
Note: Pat Rothfuss is an (awesome) fantasy author. Most of the cool things sold in the store are fantasy/book related, such as signed or foreign editions of books. They are pretty sweet, but possibly something you wouldn't consider as cool as I do. You should still check it out.
