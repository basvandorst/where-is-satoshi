What an angry little elf you are. I did not weigh in on whether it would work. It is plausible that people might pay .001 Ether for an application that doesn't sell their data. It is also plausible that they will not and this will not be conducive to this type of application.
One thing I know for sure, the guy who built a 600 billion dollar business and has stockholders who depend on his every word is eyeing this space for a reason. The reason is that he sees this as a possibility and like any good CEO of an industry leading company he needs to take every potential disruption seriously.

This is purely a self-preservation play by Zuck. He knows that blockchain 2.0 technologies like Ethereum provide people with the capability to create a decentralized social network app.
Whatever he is doing, he is likely trying to ensure that Facebook is ready to outcompete it, and that he still somehow maintains control over it.

They are different exchanges that do not interact with one another. Each of them calculates the price of Bitcoin based on the supply and demand of their separate user bases. They remain relatively close in price because of shopping and because if there is a major discrepancy, people will rush to buy from an exchange where users are offering a low price and sell to an exchange where buyers are offering a high price. Before you get too excited, the fees and wait times make this practice minimally profitable and time consuming.

Probably about as fucked as I was when I bought at 1k in 2014 and then it dipped down to $400 and stayed down there for 3 freaking years. I hedl and look at me now. patience my man.
Very few people here have had the price of Bitcoin exceed their buy price for their entire time investing. We have all been shitting bricks at some point. But we shit bricks together. That's what makes this community so special. Now are you in or are you in?

Not just you. This was a subtle hit piece. The whole time I was like uhhh...why this guy? This guy isn't obsessed with btc...he didn't talk about the technology at all...just about how his emotions swing with the price.

I get what you are saying, but this is inevitable. Greed is built into the system. It is a deflationary currency for a reason. You need a way to attract laymen to the space.
The main incentive for techies will be the tech, for altruists will be the idea of enabling value storage and cheap, easy transactions for those that need them most, and for 99% of the population will be what you call greed, but what is really individuals acting in their own self-interest. You can hardly use it for cheap transactions at this point, so a large number of the people in it are speculative investors. In the future when it is more stable it will be people looking for a mechanism to make cheap, efficient transactions.
The price is the draw at the moment, and that is ok. Draw them in with the hype and the promise of ROI, then when you have their attention, educate them about the promises that the tech offers.

What was his last post if you don't mind sharing?

No problem man. The question that you should be asking yourself, and this goes with any investment, is do you believe in the tech? Do you believe that BTC is here to stay and will emerge as its own asset class and gain a wider adoption over time? If yes, then you should invest (only what you can afford to lose) and hodl, because the price will increase well beyond 19k if that happens. If you think the risk is too high that it will crash and burn, which it very well may, then you should listen to yourself get out. Constantly try to envision both futures and determine which one is more likely to you. You probably already know this, just think I should add it.
