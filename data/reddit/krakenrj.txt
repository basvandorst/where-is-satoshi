Hi [u/jurble](
Kraken Support here.  
If you are based in the US, you should be able to send us a wire transfer instead of a ACH from your bank M&amp;T.   We do see that M&amp;T is a member of the Federal Reserve Fedwire and provides a wire transfer service.  Perhaps you can check with your bank again to see if that is possible?
Alternatively, another way of funding with fiat is to use our partner Etana Custody.  
Here is more information about them: [  As long as you can send funds to Etana, you will be able transfer between Etana and Kraken at no additional cost.   
As some other redditors have mentioned, you may also consider exchanging your fiat for crypto on another exchange and depositing crypto instead for trading.
Thanks for your interest in using Kraken!  Hope the above is helpful and have a nice day.

Hi Scott,

Hi Scott, 
We are still in communication with our payment processor about your case.  I believe you have also received an update on your support ticket.  We will continue to monitor and will apprise you of updates as we get them.
Thanks again for your patience, I understand how frustrating this must be.  What happened is highly irregular and we are still investigating into what happened.   Most likely there won't be another update until Monday at the earliest as our banking partner operates during US business hours only.

Hi, Kraken Support here.  Yes, please see the youtube video that was shared above.
To simply put, to enter a short position, you must sell an asset in a leveraged order. You can do this by entering a sell via the Trade -&gt; New Order -&gt; Advanced screen in your account. Make sure to select an amount of leverage using the leverage selector on the right side of the order form. Remember that only some assets may be traded with leverage. 
For more reference: 
Please feel free to reach out to us at  if you have any further questions.  Cheers!
