Good on you man, whoever you are.  You’ve given me some faith in humanity again in a world full of horrors.  Good people do exist and there’s a special place in heaven for people like you.  Remaining anonymous really makes your motives unquestionable.  You really will leave this earth as a person who made a difference.  And you’ve inspired many others (me being one) to follow in your footsteps.  
Cheers to you bro.

Welcome back my old friend

30% in art????  Huh?
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:31:52
Apparently some people know, but I didn’t.  Surprised this isn’t promoted everywhere honestly.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:58:44
Overstock I knew about.
Are there any other noteworthy companies I’m unaware of that accept it?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:23:32
Nah.  I was in a rush and driving and they were promoting me with “7 people viewing now, limited availability, don’t lose your ability book etc”... So I just went cc because of convenience and time crunch.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:23:53
I have no idea how I had no idea?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:44:38
Not for nothing, but they actually don’t have to tell you a reason.  That I can tell you for 100% certainty.

That’s super cool.  I’m gonna do my next vacation with bitcoin through Expedia. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:47:28
I’m shocked I’ve never heard about it and found out on my own by stumbling across it.  Super cool
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:39:12
Hey thanks man!  I got on a rant and didn’t even know where I was going lol.

I haven’t seen a single thread really going in any sort of depth in regard to human psychology relating to bitcoin (or crypto in general).
It’s been interesting to watch, and a playground for more seasoned investors.  I’d love to get some hard data on sentiment, because that’s what really shifts this market one way or another.  The smart big money players who know the system just move it back and forth gobbling up the weak hands.  
I personally have noticed the sheep mentality.  And also how short people’s memories and attention spans really are.  It’s really an interesting age and I attribute much of it to the way we are connected and so heavily reliant on the internet, social media &amp; the ease of 24/7 communication.  Now with 24/7 market places, it allows for rapid market shifts based on single tweets whereas back in the day things moved so much slower.  When they say a week in bitcoin is like a month in the regular markets, it’s almost true.
To make a long story short, people are idiots and easily manipulated.

It’s really crazy because the general public is just kind of along for the ride while big smart money takes advantage of sentiment.  And these people/groups aren’t mind readers nor do they probably even understand it in a psychological aspect...  They’re working numbers that are published for everyone to see in the form of long and short positions.  And they’re using relatively small amounts of money to make these plays in comparison to wallstreet players, all while raking exponential gains and pushing it back and forth over and over again.  All the while, Joe Schmoe Coinbase “investor” doesn’t know which way to go and starts fomoing and panic selling all of over the place because he’s operating purely on emotion and has no knowledge or experience in investing and no clue wtf is going on.  
What sparked this last run was a deliberate short squeeze on a bunch of shorts, then whaddayaknow... the sheeps start following.  The memes begin.  The news spreads on tv social media etc and more lemmings come in.  Even some of the guys who bought high sold low and swore off crypto are back.  Because of the unprecedented 24/7 nature of crypto and because we are all so connected online, things happen rapidly.  
I think we’ll continue to have this volatility until institutions and government formally embrace bitcoin.  I think there will be one decisive time period where something huge happens.  Amazon accepts bitcoin, big governments embrace and formally regulate, top tier financial institutions integrate etc.  At that moment an unprecedented surge happens and we never look back.
As I see it now short term, smart big money will continue to swallow up dumb money.  It’s become especially easy for them with all the newly accessible big leverage trading newbs are doing, makes plays swift and easy.  
The good news is, neither Joe Schmoe or big money want the gravy train to end so the same people causing these dips will make sure not to let bitcoin die.  Whales might get greedy and let the sheeps drive the price down quite a bit (all while continuing to nudge the price up/down at strategic times), but we’re all long in the long run. Government really is the only thing that could put a serious hurting on this space.  Assuming there is no negative interventions by multiple big governments, I see no where but up in the long term.  In the short though, it’ll be a wild ride up full of lemming bubbles and big Willy’s moving this market on a slow and steady incline.  
Adoption and awareness continue to grow each and every day.  I see bitcoin in the news literally every day.  This is NOT beanie babies or pogs.  This is 10 year old revolutionary technology.  It has attracted some of the greatest talent in the world who’ve investing their lives personally and professionally into it.  This technology is the logical progression of the digital age.  It solves multiple existing problems.  Like the internet, we haven’t conceived even a fraction of what this technology will be used for or where it will go 10-20-30 years from now.  The biggest block chain projects that will ever exist are decades away from conception, the people who will make them probably in diapers right now.
Wow that got long winded, but back to my original point which was market sentiment...  It’s really and drives the interim between whale plays or other large unforeseen events.  I’ve found it interesting to watch and has taught me a lot about the human psyche in relation to finance.  My conclusion is that holding and accumulating the dips and having patience and discipline is my way to the lambo.  I don’t think it’ll be long now either, few years worst case.  Crypto and Blockchain have hit the mainstream.  Imo now is the best time to invest.  Least downside risk and a ton of upside.  Hats off to the OGs because you all were nuts having big money in this 5+ years ago.  That was a risk and you deserve your rewards.  To the new investors, this is a cakewalk.  Buy it forget it and buy more when you can, especially on dips.  Get educated on your investments, be disciplined, don’t invest a dime you need anytime soon and most importantly do your part to move adoption forward.  Ask every business you frequent to accept crypto.  Accept crypto at your business.  Give crypto to your friends and family for Christmas instead of Visa cards.  Comment on articles and twitter.  Every word spoken or written moves us one step in a positive direction.

This is one of the most accurate yet concise answers imaginable.  
It sounds far fetched.  But 100 years ago people would have laughed at you if you described the world today to them.  Who knows?
