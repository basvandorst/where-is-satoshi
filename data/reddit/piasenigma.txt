the same seller than wanted the buyer to meet him in a dodgy part of town the buyer had never been before..? The buyer mentions the seller had sold to him previously, so why the sudden change of location to such a shady place? Robbing, thats why.

Public Location:
Public locations are like Local Trading 101: it is always better to meet in a public place. Scammers and muggers are a lot less likely to try anything with witnesses around. You can usually find these people early on by simply requesting a public meeting place: they want to meet their victims alone.
this 100 times this.

no it doesn't. BTC isn't illegal at (so you have zero obligation to speak on what you intend to use them for), and youre dumb if you plan to annouce to anyone, especially the police- if you plan to use them illicitly.

thats a pretty fair margin at that. after what?6-7 weeks(?) the owner is turning out full profit.

since doing math became profitable.

which makes things all the more likely he got robbed.. much safer/easier to rob someone you have some foreknowledge of.

still rockin' upward.

cant stress this enough. very VERY likely the seller was involved. 
op and seller have done transactions in past.
seller changes location to area buyer has no foreknowledge of
turns out to be shady location
buyer gets robbed.
just seems too shady, why the location change at all?
