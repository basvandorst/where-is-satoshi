I would say that it did dip on 11/29 &amp; 11/30. It went from a high of approx. 11400 down to approx 9300.  Of course it recovered, and is now doing better than that ATH on 11/29, but a loss of 18.4% value in two days could definitely be called a dip or a correction if taken in context with the overall gains that proceeded it.

Seriously? You're on here begging and you make $700-$800 a week? And then you have the balls to try and play it off like its some sort of test of this communities generosity?  Fuck you sir
On a side note, this is like the 4th begging post I've seen today. Is this possibly in response to the public donation to Andreas Antonopoulos?

Some of the coins listed on there are just ridiculous; I mean 0xbitcoin, Qubitcoin, Bitcoin SV, BlakeBitcoin.  Who would buy these silly coins?

I don't really have a moon. Although 50k, 100k, 1 mil, will be nice I wont pull out until I see it as no longer a good place to have the my money that I currently I have in it.  Im constantly monitoring the overall crypto-situation and evaluating where it could go.  Today's forecast calls for increase in public awareness and adoption, though the talk of futures has me worried.  But who knows, bitcoin could reach 35k and then perfectcoin comes along and dethrones it or the government wages war against crypto.  But again who knows, that may not happen until 236k.

That's just the way it is now man.  Im a BoA customer and it takes 3-5 days for my transaction to process.  Same thing on transferring money to and from Robinhood.  Maybe someday in the future it wont take as long, but there's not much you can do about it now.

flash crash, it will recover to 10K in a few mins but it might keep going down at the same rate that it has been showing since 10am this morning (CST)
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:37:32
Seriously though. 20% gains in a single day is reminiscent of the day it hit 20K before toppling back down. 1-5% growth is so much healthier gains like those tend to last; plus you can get away from a lot of the "bubble" talk.

Are you challenging me to make a Challenger joke?
Because it's too soon and too sad and I really don't have a good one

This article is from 2/11/18
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:28:48
So this isn't an article that predicts which cryptos will do the best in 2018, this is just an article that reviews the top 10 cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:30:30
That might be but I have heard enough people saying that it also could mean hold on for dear life.  Really its up to consensus.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:00:05
Also this author really makes some brave predictions by making 9 of his 10 picks the current top 9 coins by market cap........
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:01:32
I say that, but that is mostly because i gage the success of my crypto portfolio by its value in fiat

Bitcoin - the new slavery
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:29:52
this dip has brought around the use of "sodl" a lot but would'nt "sadl" make more sense? Sell All for Dear Life?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:28:18
I wouldn't necessarily say that this is FUD.  The acceleration of the drop and the momentum it carries could easily bring the price down to the 6 or 7 range.  That being said I am hodling because I know that as soon as I sell is when it starts going up.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:14:10
I don't understand bitcoin -&gt; therefore nobody understands bitcoin...nobody...if you say that you do then you are lying
