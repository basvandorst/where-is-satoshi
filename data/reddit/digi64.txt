There's no borrowing, only printing. Wasting resources on killing people and blowing shit up is never going to net you profit and there's always the chance that you lose the war so who exactly is going to loan you money in that scenario? What does work is for you to issue your own paper IOUs that are constantly but slightly unnoticeably depreciating the more you give them out to the people supplying labor and resources you need. This printing is what can not be done by bitcoin.

Whenever the state takes a dislike to someone the illusion of personal property begins to dissolve very quickly. They can take anything they want and claim the item was somehow attached to the commission of a crime with no need to actually prove that statement with supporting evidence and that property is now no longer yours. It's called civil forfeiture, welcome to the USA.

Unfortunately pointing to an amendment doesn't carry as much validity as it used to. Check out how well the 4th is doing if you don't believe me.
There have been a couple cases where the judge saw fit to force a password to be revealed on the basis that they already had "a suspicion" of what might be encrypted. As insane as that sounds it's not too far from common practice. The drug dogs are pointed at your car, trained to react on command, and now you must unlock the car and allow the search. The difference here is they can not ultimately force you to unencrypt the drive, giving the decision makers the incentive to lean towards a decision that gives them power in a powerless situation as opposed to upholding an amendment. The doublespeak they have come up with to try and justify this garbage is pretty amusing, but what it comes down to is if you won't incriminate yourself at their command then you are by default a criminal.

I would recommend against storing raw private keys or writing them down. This puts bitcoin on the level of cash in that if someone finds the key and takes it, it is now theirs. This is unnecessary as we all know bitcoin is better than cash, lol. Don't be afraid to use some old school crypto on your paper copy of your private keys, ciphering with a password shouldn't be too hard and it will keep common theifs and probably anyone short of a cryptographer from grabbing your coins. Make a wikipedia run and you will find all sorts of fun ways to obfuscate your private key while still being able to store it in the physical realm. The obvious drawback here is you will need to remember your method, but if carefully planned this should be no harder than remembering where you stashed the keys anyways.

All they have to do is make some false claims against you and then get a court order forcing you to reveal your password. If you refuse you can be held in contempt of court indefinitely. This encryption stuff is a relatively new technology for the public and court precedent is all over the place.

Uhh, this is somewhat pointless. So you have a list of IP and BM addresses? Big deal. All messages on bitmessage are sent to everyone at once with only the recipient able to decrypt. By being sent to everyone at once you inherently know who is sending messages but you have no idea who they are going to or what their contents are. What's being "pointed out" here was already a well known fact by anyone who has studied bitmessage even slightly. Similar to the blockchain, public addresses are just that, public.
To make an analogy, this guy is standing across the street from the post office watching people go in. Wow, huge security breakthrough there. Once again, he doesn't know who you are sending messages to or what's in them. None of you're contacts can be associated with you. He simply knows you are a bitmessage user.
What's being shown here is actually more relevant to bitcoin than it is bitmessage. The potential exists to connect your bitcoin address with your IP address if you are running a full node and an attacker holds enough nodes in the network. Bitcoins are also sent to everyone at once, but with a particular address listed as the recipient of the funds. Your wallet is pinpointed to your physical location as well as who you are transacting with and if they send funds in the future their IP could be discovered. This could be very bad.
To sum it up, if you are worried about people finding out what bitcoin addresses are attached to your computer, use tor and mixing services. If you are worried about people finding out that you run bitmessage on your computer, and absolutely no other useful information, use tor. If you could care less about people knowing you use bitmessage and just need the messages to be secure and untraceable, you are fine as is.

Buy them locally in person using localbitcoins.com, this is as close to anonymous as you are going to get as the only guy who will know about it is the person you bought from. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "physical wallet" but I'm going to assume you are referring to some kind of cold storage. This is still somewhat technical and might stay that way for a while so you might have to put forth a considerable amount of effort to do this right. But my summary suggestion would be to...
1.Boot into a linux live cd and install Multibit
2.Make a new address and export the privatekey
3.You now have the 2 things that make up your bitcoin, the public address, and the private key.
4.There are a lot of options at this point, you can simply write this info down on a piece of paper and store it securely, or encrypt a text file and make backups of it all over the place, usb keys, cds, online, etc.
If all this sounds too much and you aren't willing to risk getting hacked for 10BTC I would recommend you either wait for the ease of use of bitcoin to increase or possibly set up a computer that you only use for bitcoin and never browse the internet on it or even have it connected to the internet when you arent planning on spending the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:23:30
So the market becomes divided and you have silkroad coin and regular bitcoin, so what. Since they can both still be traded p2p who cares. Fungibility is usually only an issue when quality has a huge range of possible values like in the quality of livestock or when it is difficult to determine the quality as with precious metal mixes. This is not the case here, your coin is blacklisted or it isn't, and that fact will be clear.

It should be pointed out that this is not "how bitcoin works" as a protocol, but how bitcoin-qt has decided to work as a client. Multi-bit currently seems to be returning it's change back to the original address as opposed to making new change addresses.
This raises some security concerns in exchange for easing key management for the user. It is more likely your coins could be stolen once the public key to them has been revealed via you spending some portion of the coins in that address if computing power drastically increases or there is some other failure in the implementation as recently seen with the android wallets. By creating change addresses for every transaction the unspent funds are placed in a new address where the public key has not been announced to the blockchain.

The person you are buying from is not transferring you ownership of his account, a.k.a. his private key. He is transferring you the ownership of the coins. You will give him your fiat in exchange for him publicly announcing to the blockchain that he is moving 10BTC from his account to yours. This is irreversible and his privatekey is now no longer attached to those bitcoins, yours is. And, you therefore now control and own those coins, not him. The only safety concerns you need to worry about are him running off with the cash before the transaction has been confirmed on the network. This is no different than any other large cash transaction such as purchasing a car in cash. You make sure you are going to get the keys to the car before you hand over the cash.

Theft shouldn't be an issue as bitcoins move forward and gain value. Don't allow your coins to be stolen. Simple as that. This is not a huge request. No one is asking you to store large amounts of physical objects and prevent scary people with guns from taking them. You must protect an arbitrary number encrypted with a passphrase of your choosing. If you can't handle this most basic of tasks you probably shouldn't be dealing with money in any form, let your mommy and daddy or big brother take care of it for you.
