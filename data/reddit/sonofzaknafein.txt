I guess I can't make a really dry joke and expect a juicy reply.

What a long, strange trip it's been.

Like when you stop yourself from blowing your load?
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:02:54
Well isn't this exciting!

I've only got .67 BC. I didn't get more than I could afford. I'm fine with the hover. If I see a good rise, I might hodl and I might sell. It depends on my immediate needs. Let's get it straight. Whether you are hodling or selling, you are gambling. There is no such thing as a psychic. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:51:48
We do not deny the possibility.

Harvest moon?

Thanks. I pride myself in my smartassery.

My dog one ate three hundred of my dollars. Three Benjamins. The great part is that there was no intact serial number on any of them, so I couldn't redeem any of it.

This is pretty cool, man. I wish that I lived anywhere close to these locations, or that I traveled for a living. Good luck, hunters!
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:34:12
I'm OK with this right now.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:25:09
It feels like I'm only going backwards now.

@_date: 2018-08-01 09:22:55
Happy birthday. I think that this is the "wild ride" that I was warned about. Patience really is a virtue.
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:13:53
These changes just go to show you that nobody knows what is going to happen in the short term. I'm still convinced that BC will be good in the long term. The people shorting their BC are not wrong. They're just gambling. It can be a good strategy if you're lucky. But it's just that. Luck. I'm dead even right now. I'm OK with that. Hang in there, people. If you're trying to make a quick buck, I believe you can if you sell out when it gets high. The question is, do you sit on it? You probably should. I may not. I have some debt that I would like to pay off to make my life smoother in the immediate. That's OK, I think. I'll tell you this, though. I will damn sure keep buying. Banks fucking suck. The US government fucking sucks. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:58:17
It depends on of you're in the red or not. I guess it's get in or get out.
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:16:35
It's been a while since we reached $6,900.
@_date: 2018-08-18 10:49:44
It's just kind of dancing around 6500. I'm not sure if I want it to drop so I can buy more, or if I want it to moon.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:44:40
I feel like it should have been a moon.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:23:27
Nice pun. How did you pull that off?
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:49:20
About thirty grapples. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:25:06
You beat me to it.
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:31:51
I had a dream last night that bitcoin rose to 25K. I'm going back to sleep.

I think I made less than a hundred bucks on 24,000 in savings on a money market account last year... I need to talk my wife in to this.

A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:49:35
Yes. Yes. I'm doing my part as well. Hodl. I know. I know.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:37:46
Good luck, my friend.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:26:21
Well, it's sitting at 11900 this morning. I'm not even mad. I wouldn't mind another dip.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:46:16
I don't mind being corrected. Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:19:01
If only I didn't become broke and have to cash some out. :-(
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:43:35
Nice. What state is this in?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:32:38
That is fucking funny. You have a gift.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:17:51
Say that ten times fast

Who knows? 11K may be the bottom now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:57:58
They see me rollin...
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:42:15
I don't think so. I know a few, only a few, folks that have been watching and too scared to buy in. This leap might be when those unfortunate folks buy at a high, which is good for everyone, maybe even good for them. Who knows. I foresee a lot of people jumping on a bandwagon. That's what happened before, and it will happen again I think. People see dollar signs and lose their fucking minds.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:39:48
I would bet my left nut that Warren actually has some bitcoin and won't say that he does until it's an even more huge success.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:06:32
I wouldn't touch that shit with a ten foot pole.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:19:23
I think I prefer "plastify."
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:27:46
If we go back to 4000, I'm going to dump half of my life savings in this shit. I don't know why I didn't do it before.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:11:41
Everyone here is speculating, but if you just look at the history of bitcoin, there is a great chance that is a good investment. We're all counting on a dream. It's revolutionary, really. The more people that adopt bitcoin and USE IT, (Key words here. Use it as currency. Buy things with it.), the more it will grow. That's the only thing that I worry about. I worry that most people will just treat it like a slot machine and not integrate it into their lives as currency. I've been making a point of buying things with bitcoin. Even if my purchases are small, I think that it's important. These are just the musings of a regular dude.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:32:18
Now where did I put those moon boots?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:26:09
But mah money market account...
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:49:35
And I used that opportunity. As a matter of fact, I just bought $100 USD right now, because it won't break my bank and I'm certain that in the long run, that one hundred bucks is going to turn in to a lot more. It feels dumb to buy at 12,500, but I don't think that it is.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:36:13
I hope there is one
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:56:46
This is true, but there are a lot of new buyers in at the moment. A lot of new folks just jumped thousands of dollars in a few weeks. They are going to be walking on sunshine and others are going to want some sunshine. I won't be surprised if it corrects and drops down a bit, but this is going to light a fire under a lot of people's asses.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:25:03
Holy shit, guys
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:30:32
If you have to spend some, you have to spend some. It's okay. Take care of yourself and be happy with that of which you can keep in the market.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:07:05
I wish I could say the same
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:20:05
Holy fucking shit
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:29:42
So this is probably going to hit the news a little hard, because a lot of people are making good returns at this moment. Is this when the people who have been resting on their laurels start to buy bitcoin at the high? Isn't that what happened last time?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:56:17
Have you turned it off and on again?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:34:16
Hey guys. Bitcoin is for losers. "You need to start investing in gold and silver." - My dad. LOL!
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:02:22
I did as well. I'm numb to the bullshit at this point.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:23:20
Just take some out if you need it and don't beat yourself up for it. I had to spend .3 a while back. I regret it, but I just had to.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:21:53
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:14:38
Wait. Hold the door. Are you telling me that we will be at 40k by the end of the year. Are you the three eyed raven?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:40:49
I just bought some today. I still believe.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:46:05
Link that shit. I love to read.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:23:56
And my axe!
Edit: Don't spend silver on me. Buy, you fools!
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:05:14
I do love the virtues that you described. It truly is revolutionary. It could be currency one day, though. There are some giant hoops to jump through. Taxes come to mind. We would really have to reinvent what we think money is. It wouldn't be the first time in history that people did just that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:28:35
I would welcome a drop. I want that cheapy cheap.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:50:16
This is fact, but many of us will fold for that sweet cash, especially if some of us are in a hard place, like I am. I'm still going to hold, because I've already decided that that money "doesn't exist." God damn, it's hard, though. It's hard for me.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:00:59
I'm with you on the lump sum buying. A little here and there isn't going to bring great returns. You just have to remember not to spend all of your damn money. I'm not wealthy by any means, but I buy $300 or so at a time when it's "low." I'm not selling any time soon, for sure, but I'm not going to put twenty bucks in here and there. It feels pointless. On the other hand, I'm scared to put $10,000 in because my wife isn't on board with it. :-(
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:19:55
And that's the way the news goes!
@_date: 2019-04-27 10:23:50
Tudo Bem?
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:55:26
Agreed. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 21:17:50
No, that's the magnet bracelet. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:37:49
I'm glad that I didn't invest too much to ruin my life in times like this. It still gives me anxiety to see it go down. I have faith, though. I still think that Bitcoin is a great idea and I stand behind it. Hell, I've even been making purchases with it.
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:04:54
Anything can be a butt plug if you try hard enough.
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:08:30
Until it goes up in value, then everybody's views change all of the sudden. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:53:16
It's true. That's why I take this shit with a grain of salt. I still wish for a rocket to the moon, but I'm certain that
 at this moment, I'm basically gambling.
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:56:00
I would definitely be happy with a couple hundred gain a day, but we'll see.  I'm already educating all of those around me. I feel that that is the first place that all of us should start.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:07:21
I want to believe.
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:29:38
what about the people who have a ticker implanted in their brain?
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:58:48
I'm still buying. I still have faith in the idea of bitcoin. I feel like there are a lot of people on this sub with a shitload of cash in bitcoin that they've been sitting on during this whole dip. I can totally see why that would get you down, but bitcoin is too good an idea for us as a society to let it die. I truly think that people will see this. I also would like to be rich. HODL!
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:57:27
We've already bumped up to 8215, so that's nice.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:51:10
Jesus Christ. I'm going to have an anxiety attack.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:47:51
Bitcoin's starting up like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang these past few days.

Go for it. I'm learning every day.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:03:59
Yes. I can see by the charts that there is no real reason to panic, but human nature I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:02:28
Hey, moderator. I like how you delete the fluff. Even if it's my literary vomit.
@_date: 2018-07-20 07:21:42
I've never thought about this before, but I wonder if Bitcoin is the beginning of a one-world government. Obviously, that sort of change would take a very, very long time, but it's interesting to think about.
@_date: 2018-07-13 17:22:22
I confess. I'm no dummy.
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:52:15
My feeling comes from watching the charts, not from my gut. Also, I have faith that people will see the value in crypto currency, even though people as a whole are stupid as hell. It will take time, but it's a sound idea.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:40:54
Back AWF!
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:19:18
Shit. I just dropped another G at 8,245. I've got a good feeling about this.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:16:35
I didn't know that. That's fun to know. Maybe it will rain cash.
Edit: Rain bitcoin
Edit 2: Umbrellas are intrinsically British
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:59:44
I'm getting there. It's almost back to where it was anyway. Good thing I didn't put ALL of my money in it, otherwise I would actually be having a panic attack.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:35:03
Agreed. We've almost hit yesterday's high at 8:30 eastern time. Good sign.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:45:57
I bought at 8150, damnit. That's OK. This is temporary.
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:43:55
Oh yeah. I'm a total noob. I guess at least I didn't buy more bitcoin than I could afford to hold onto. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:17:46
I just bought some at $7,436. I have a good feeling about this, even though that doesn't mean shit in reality.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:36:38
You're a fuckin' programmer named Christine Gontara. You fucked up.
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:48:11
The high today is 7570. Gooooooo Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:41:33
Wow. It's just hanging around. I wonder what the next movement will be.
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:56:14
First time bitcoin buyer here. I've been buying small amounts of bitcoin of which I'm willing to lose since it was around $9000. I researched it for a while before I decided to start investing. Nobody really knows where this is going, but if I wasn't investing this money, I would be spending it on some bullshit or something. I do have high hopes for it, though. Our currency is built on built on quicksand and I like where crypto is going. I'm going to keep holding and dropping a couple hundred dollars in when I can. Let's see where this thing goes.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:07:37
I just saw redditer for 5 days and was skeptical.
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:36:50
I'm in the green as well! Just a little, but a little might get mo and mowoe.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:04:15
Yup. I've already talked two people into putting in 2000 each. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 19:53:52
Thank you for replying. I certainly don't want to perpetuate bad business. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:25:16
I'll take your filthy bukkake goggles.
Edit: Bukkake goggles. That's a mouthful.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:35:44
Word. So what are the specs on this scavenger hunt?

@_date: 2018-07-17 19:08:02
To the moon?
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:03:04
I hear you. I have all that I can afford in BC right now. It's not a lot, compared to other holders. I'm just investing small amounts here and there even if the price is up a bit. As long as I'm not tying all of my money up, I'll still buy.
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:39:37
Sorry. Didn't mean to be discouraging. I just remembered a Sublime reference from my younger days.
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:35:38
I know that I'm speculating. Truly, I'm just glad that it's stable at this level.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:07:16
Oh. Well that's cool.
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:17:03
I understand now. I'm new to this, and wasn't ready for this recent drop. I got all excited. I'm hodling for sure, but I need to get used to this.
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:27:26
I was a bit naive by proclaiming that it would hit 7800 yesterday. Actually, I'm quite pleased to see it stable today. That's what we want, right? More people will adopt bitcoin if it's a bit more stable.
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:28:26
It's fairly stable even at 7362. That's a good sign, a good sign that it probably won't drop too far.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:06:50
If the trend continues, bitcoin is going to rise considerably this afternoon. Everybody better get in. There's a storm a'comin'. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:24:31
Seriously, guys. 6500 might be the new bottom. I think that we will reach 7800 today, considering the trend. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:31:50
Ha! Thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:13:30
I didn't know what that meant, so I looked it up. I saw the definition as "chiefly British." I'm confused.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:44:33
Fucking funny.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:23:48
Do you need my social security or seed number?
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:27:04
I just want to apologize to everyone if my bitcoin boner was showing this morning. We might just stay at a healthy level today. I just couldn't help it. I was listening to [this]( and got a huge crypto-shaft. A raging gambler's erection. Maybe I'll just have a nice, safe investment in the future.  I hope everyone has a nice night.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:46:20
I'm green again!
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:24:49
It's fun to see everyone getting excited again. I'm being more reserved this time. I'll get excited when it hits 8000 and keeps rising. In the meantime, nice gains.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:43:04
I"m holding and I've kept quiet this time around. I bought all the way up until it hit 8000 last time. My excitement has been deadened. I still think bitcoin is going to kick ass, though.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:37:08
8,755 right now. I'm interested.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:47:56
This post made me check the price. I went twelve hours without checking. Oh well. Thankfully, I don't have my life banking on bitcoin. Would be nice to moon, though. Lets go out and have a good Friday night, folks!
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:00:33
I don't know why I love this line so much.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:51:26
I think that it will be quite vertical when it happens.
