Maybe if large routing hubs (Bitpay for example) were forced to shut down due to regulators we'd see 1000 small hubs spring up as they'd then be profitable again? Throw Tor into the mix and you'll have a regulators worst nightmare.

OB launched..

I'm really excited about LN but it's complexity worries me. Hope it doesn't disappoint

In my opinion OB can be the killer app for bitcoin if:
1. It's as easy or easier to use than Ebay. That's a big ask because most people don't even use/understand bitcoin
2. It works over Tor
3. The review and reputation system is sound

He's alive and well. Just working on other things not bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:32:21
What about reviews and ratings? Do you store your own for other peers to see but with no way of altering them?

Cool idea good luck with it
@_date: 2016-02-10 22:52:07
I agree. I wish Core set an approximate date for a 2mb bumb (Q4 2016 for example). I think it would have been good for the whole industry
@_date: 2016-02-07 01:07:33
Is it possible for your node to route payments through Tor? If so regulation is going to be a problem. The same if there are nodes in a different geographical location with different laws. Regulators will be doing a lot of overtime. There's also Confidential Transactions...how can a node record whats being transferred if only the sender and receiver know the amounts? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:11:08
Im all for a fee market. I think bitcoin is waaaay too undervalued and i should be paying more for the things i can do with it
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:21:17
Same with Open Bazaar. They both need to be idiot proof to survive imo. LN would be fantastic if it worked  (especially with confidential transactions) but it's still up in the air.

Probably forgot to use Tor. Should have just got a McJob instead but i guess it was worth the risk to him

I might be wrong but as i understand it an immediate jump to 2mb and then increase in capacity brought about by Segwit after could cause bandwidth and propagation problems. Its not a case of added storage requirements for full nodes and decentralization being jeopardized at 2mb. The devs must take into account data going in and out of China also. Bitcoin is very cheap to use (perhaps too cheap) for the average user and will stay that way for the next year in my opinion. In 6 months time we will be fitting significantly more transactions into our current 1mb blocks due to SW. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:33:09
Some great improvements there. Well done Core
@_date: 2016-02-04 22:42:29
I don't think it will ruin bitcoin. It will just be another entry on 
I expect people will just use it less if the fees are too high and there will be more pressure to do the hard fork to 2mb (so more widespread support than now). It probably won't come to that however as we'll be fitting more transactions into blocks from April.

Chill. Blockstream requires on-chain transactions to open payment channels on Lightning
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:42:35
They are probably just assuming instant moon the day it happens
@_date: 2016-02-05 00:12:16
Im not denying it. If SegWit isn't enough THEN we do the hard fork. Core know full well the blocksize needs to be raised eventually to accomodate Lightning Network etc and i personally think they are right in choosing a soft fork
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:28:44
I see your point but personally i think the slow rolling out of Segwit over the next year and then increase to 2mb blocks in Q1 or Q2 of 2017 is the safest way to go (it would be great if Core could at least set a provisional time frame). Personally i don't mind if fees are raised slightly but i will do if they start becoming detrimental to bitcoin for the average user. I'm behind Core because Segwit is an enabler for numerous other improvements but i won't be if there is clearly an urgent urgent need for bigger blocks which right now, in my opinion, there isn't.
