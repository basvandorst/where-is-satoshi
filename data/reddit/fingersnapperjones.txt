Here's some advice.  Quit slandering the best damn bitcoin company on the Internet before they sue you and I bear witness on their side you fucking dick.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:39:01
I'll tell you what you can do with a Satoshi.  You can give him a Nobel prize.

As I said, and I'm not being a bigot, it just is true.  Jewish controlled banks and media are going to attempt anything and everything to discredit bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:09:46
Well btc theoretically should go up in value each year because no more are being printed so it if the insurance was far less than this appreciation.  It would be worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:37:23
Guys...a lot of coins are going to make it.  Get use to that.  The fact is, it's not bitcoin vs alts, it's p2p cryptos vs fiat.

Just like Ripple, it's a scam.

Personally, I like GoldCoin.  It's still under a penny, only a few months old, has a unique 51% protection, brilliant programmers and a great community.
It's also in the top 20 already.  coinmarketcap.com

Bitcoin is the petition against the Jew controlled banks and media by the way.  Looks like you're protesting your leaders afterall.
Are you sure bitcoin is for you?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:01:11
This is where I got the brute force discussion from.  There are many:
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:13:00
You sell a bitcoin every time you give it to someone for something else.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:24:20
This isn't the same at all.  What you did is like investing in a new wallet implementation at Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:57:42
It's a great idea.  I've thought of it before too.  Democracy could be done this way as well.
Dare to dream my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:23:54
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:11:47
Then why again are you worried about your money being stolen.  Lol
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:47:20
Actually it does.  Poor people get a fair shot at the table with bitcoin.  In fiat land, the top .01% are essentially given free money.  Not the top 1% mind you but the top .01%.
These people never pay back loans, file bankruptcy under various business names, get loans from their banker friend that they all know will likely not get paid back.  They also get bailed out by the taxpayer.  
This free money is not only an extreme advantage, it also waters down everyone else's money.
In a bitcoin world EVERYONE will have to work for money and if you run out of bitcoins, your friend can't simply print more.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:27:21
It seems to be Jews and Jewish owned organizations.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:24:49
No. We need to know this.  Are we talking about a Jewish group here or not.  Is this some giant Jewish thing.
I mostly see Jews bad mouthing bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-21 22:51:22
Yeah...you really, really have to think of it like cash.  If you give cash to a stranger, it's gone.

Know...I don't know precisely.  It is partial speculation.  However, those company names are known and I have seen them in the past.  I do not know the families but I see one pattern.  Jewish controlled businesses are definitely attacking bitcoin.
Like I said, I have no problem with Jewish people.  They should rise up against their theistic government and these banking elites.  Just as we should through bitcoin.
If they were Russian, Mexicans, or good ol' redneck honkeys, I'd say the same thing.  As a matter of fact you can hang all those colluders you mentioned above and I'd just laugh.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:03:04

Dude...then fucking leave.  You're plain wrong.  I'm not going to go over this shit anymore with morons like you because YOU WILL NEVER GET IT!  GO FUCKING READ.
Bitcoin will be at 10k inside of 6 months and 100k inside of 5 years and you'll still be saying this same stupid shit.

Actually what you say sounds absurd.   I believe there is a group.  It's also not a static group.  However there is a group.  
Dude, just start looking at the leadership and counting the jews.  It really is as simple as that.  I'm not making this up.  Also, watch how many jew based organizations attack bitcoin.   It's not a coincidence.
I'm done with this conversation though because it's not productive for either one of us.  You believe you are right because it's what your education has told you.  I believe what I'm saying is right because I've moved passed that same education and I actually look at the situations and notice the patterns.  Sometimes where there's smoke, there actually is fire.

Please stop posting this Jewish banker/media attempt to besmirch bitcoin.  We are going to see this time and again from the Jewish bankers.  This will not be the first time.  
I'm not being a bigot here.  It's just true.  I have nothing against the Jewish people but their leaders are corrupt as hell.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:11:34
I'm not out to win friends and influence people but you should know who the enemy is.

Also, there's nothing wrong with my phrasing dumb ass.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:01:36
Assuming a figure of 50+ trillion total dollars on the planet.  Divide that by about 13 million bitcoins and you have about 4 million per coin....so probably somewhere less than that.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:00:20
Yeah we know.  Expect a lot of smear campaigns to come from Jewish based magazines.  Jewish leadership controls the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:39:24
That has nothing to do with bitoin itself.  That's an investment instrument for dumbasses.

You'll have to read the white paper.  I think you are right though.  I don't believe it's a complete prevention but I'm sure it makes it that much more difficult.

There is no bubble.  This is the beginning of a massive movement of fiat and general wealth into a universal, uncheatable currency.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:07:17
Off the top of my head I could see an insurance service you could elect to get.  The bank could offer it separately to you if you choose it and you pay x amount per month.  This service would could be made to all banks IF they are inspected regularly and abide by certain compliance standards--percentage of offline wallets, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:00:50
BTC is stolen when people are dumb.  Don't keep your BTC in online wallets.  Use paper wallets generated from a non-internet connected machine and you are golden.  
In the future online wallets will be far better with regulations on storage and insurance.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:42:57
Bitcoin itself is NOT insecure.  What is insecure are the current online banks (wallets) and exchanges.  It is also difficult to secure with your personal computer for someone that really chooses not to understand it.  
It will be made far more secure with cheap hardware wallets and quality online banks.  It will be dumbed down to the point of sucking money out of your hardware wallet and blowing it into your bank.  Suck and blow dumb.  Lol.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:03:39
It doesn't have to be FDIC insured.  There are other options.

Holy shit!  That's brilliant man!  I wish I had thought of it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:39:19
This is utter bullshit anyhow.  Once it is universal, it won't be "deflationary" so much as set.  It will be a true currency that can't be manipulated.

I'm telling you there is a central Jewish leadership that controls the banking system, a lot of media in the US and has political/financial ties back to the power structure in Israel.  I don't have the resources to determine the exact connections.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:14:17
You dumbass.  You just listed the fucking employees.  WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?  WHO OWNS THE FUCKING FED.
This is like a compiled list of janitors.
You've listed the figure heads.  Now go back and look at the companies that are on the board of directors for almost all the major banks, you'll find about 2 or 3 companies.  Of these companies, you'll find one or two families behind them.
Do you really think you're going to find this information so easily?
What you have listed is like saying Mike Duke gets all the Walmart profits because he is CEO.  Come on man.  Try harder.

@_date: 2013-11-27 23:58:01
In order to spend money sent to a Bitcoin address, you just need to find a ECDSA public key that hashes to the same 160 bit value. That will take, on average, 2 ^ 160 key generations.
Supposing you could generate a billion (2 ^ 30) per second, you need 2 ^ 130 seconds.
Doing this in parallel using a billion machines requires only 2 ^ 100 seconds.
Getting a billion of your richest friends to join you gets it down to only 2 ^ 70 seconds.
There are about 2 ^ 25 seconds per year, so you need 2 ^ 45 years.
The age of the Universe is about 2 ^ 34 years so far—better get cracking!

1BTC=20 Current 200K homes
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:42:33
You need to learn basic MATH.  Everyone CANNOT do this and bitcoin retain it's value.  If JUST 200 million people bought and held onto 100 dollars worth the total current market cap of bitcoin would be 20 billion.  Each coin would be worth 1,667 dollars.  
You do understand that there are currently only 12 million coins and there will ever only be 21 million coins right--EVER.
STFU buy a coin and thank me later until then...just leave.  You and I know you're just debating with yourself on whether you should buy or not.
I personally don't give a shit what you "contend" and whether you buy or not.
By the way, every damn thing on this planet is speculation.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:07:17
Great job.  I think you're right.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:09:49
Hey, I don't hate Jews.  You just can't argue with facts.  Jews control the media and the banks.  That is fact.  Does that make all Jewish folks bad...no.  The bottom line is the Jewish leadership will not like Bitcoin so they will tell the Jewish puppets not to like it.
Would it be better if I said a group of Jewish families because that is more to the point?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:44:10
Lol.  You got the wrong guy.  I'm not complaining about Jewish people.  It's the Jewish leadership that's clearly hating on money they can't control.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:56:55
Owning a lot of bitcoins is not a big deal at all.  Unlike traditional currency where the top .01% can print money and give loans to their friends that never have to be repaid (literally what's happening now), with bitcoin you MUST work or provide services to humanity or your supply will dwindle.

No one can hold onto their bitcoins forever because they have to eat and unlike in the world today where if you're in the .01% not the 1%, you can't simply have your buddies at the bank print money you never have to pay back.

You need to STOP.  Stop what you're doing and stop over thinking.  You don't want to understand it.  No one can help you with that.
What I can tell you is this.  You ARE going to be left behind.  The double spend problem that bitcoin solved will win the nobel prize.  Do you truly think you have the intelligence to understand the code that does this or sha256?  You don't.  Smarter people than you figured out how to make a decentralized currency with no King at the top.  
Stop playing this game with yourself and buy at least a fraction.  You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin.  You are going to keep doing this shit and miss out on a revolution in money.
Buy a small amount now as a hedge bet and if you lose it...who cares....it's 100 bucks.  If it pans out that 100 bucks could one day be worth 300,000 dollars.

This is a purist idea that I think is very damaging to bitcoin.  No coin is going to supplant bitcoin.  That's not the point.  They all are there to support it's adoption.  Folks ask all the time, "Can't xyz just make a coin and replace bitcoin?"  Sure.  Try it.  It's hard as fuck and already being done by TONS of coins.  Check out coinmarketcap.com
Also, anything that has value in any of these coins, bitcoin can just take.  That's the open source way.

I'm a cheese smelling honkey so meh...what do I care.  I'm just telling you that the Jewish controlled banks and media in America are going to be against bitcoin.  they are the ones printing the money.
I'm talking about the big boys not some branch bank somewhere.

You are really, really defensive.  I'm sorry the Jewish leadership is doing this.  Clearly you're against it.

Price in fiat, pay in Bitcoin.  Coinbase and Bitpay have those options.
The payments are converted to fiat instantly if that's what the vendor wants.

Well he is, at the very least, jewish.  Call it confirmation bias if you like but there seems to be a strong Jewish contingent that does not want bitcoin to succeed.  This group HATES honest money.
