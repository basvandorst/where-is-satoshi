Sure....so your saying long term up short  medium term down. But your headline is an attempt to suck dumb money in or at least make your own mind feel better about your position. Either way its not helpful.

Aaron Swartz once said, "It's no longer OK not to understand how the Internet works."
She's an idiot. It is understandable that she responds in a way to safeguard her country. What she's doing though is displaying extreme ignorance of the tech. That also applies to her advisors.

The problem is there is a crowd eyeing a 7k or 8k entry so in my 30 odd years of gambling....that says they won't get a taste.
OR .... we've all been duped into believing a fairy tale and its headed to zero. Its either a million bucks or zero. We shall see. But fun to watch.

Well said.
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:37:00
What is not seen is the marketmakers manipulation. They know where everyones stops are so takes nothing to push something relatively illiquid all over the place take out everyone's stops and walk away with ALL the money longs and shorts. And no one is the wiser and no one investigates. So DO NOT leverage (that way they can't auto close you) and DO NOT set stops. Stops are just easy meat. Traders die because of leverage. Believe me, I've tried it all over 30 years. Trade with patience and always without leverage. One problem you have though is when this takes off again....and it will....its only started....the chance of timing a short will not be easy. And maybe a single btc held to a million is a better play for most.

Where is that if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:30:35
It would just increase price by increasing demand, effectively exacerbating what they were trying to control.

What happens if they.....you know who they are.... physically target the developers?
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:04:12
I agree. Its mad. But the negative rhetoric surrounding crypto  is mostly governments trying hard not to lose control....specifically control of their revenue from tax. In the end in my mind its definitely better to hold for 12m and pay the 25% or do it through a smsf and it drops to 7.5%
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:40:01
Its strange isn't it to be barracking like this. I hope if this is real it makes the world a better, happier place. I'm not sure it will, even if that was the inventor's intent. Most here just see it as a way to  get wealthy, myself included. But doing something to help others....well that's really what its all about. That's really why this thing was given breath. I hope it works.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:02:57
The most annoying thing is I knew I should have waited AND I knew about bitcoin at $100 downloaded the mining software but never used it...worried about malware. Doomed to hold from close to the high. But fuck it I still believe its real and know if I sell it will be a million in a few years. So kiss my arse if you'll squeeze mine from my death bed.

Thanks for replying but I don't quite understand. Do you mean you bought them direct peer to peer.

Its in limbo because its still not being used to buy pizzas and cafe lattes, because its not on phones everywhere, and exchangeable to fiat on the fly. Because of hacks and con artists. Everyone wants it to work but secretly knows it isn't working well. The market is also alive my friend and feeds off pain. That's how its always been. It will rise when everyone capitulates and looks the other way. But so we're clear, this is the bottom.

Translation of the relevant German tourist board website pdf
GNTB accepts cryptocurrencies as a means of payment
Frankfurt, 5 March 2018 - Effective immediately, services and services can be provided by the German National Tourist Board (GNTB) in cryptocurrencies, e.g. in Bitcoin, to be paid. The GNTB would like to test the crypto-currency underlying blockchain technology in its financial system and, if necessary, use it in the medium term in international payments.
Petra Hedorfer, Chair of the Board of the GNTB, explains: "As part of our digitization strategy, we are constantly reviewing the latest technologies and trends for their applicability in our company. With the acceptance of crypto currencies as a means of payment and the potential medium-term implementation of blockchain technology in our finance business, we want to set an example as a global player as a driver of innovation and a catalyst for the tourism industry. "
The blockchain technology offers interesting perspectives in terms of speed, transparency and security. Experts see enormous potential for improvement and savings, i.a. in international transactions.

On a possibly positive note the down volume spikes are getting smaller...so maybe the fall is running out of fuel.

Stockmarket crashing 7 days later.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:35:19
anyone calling a stockmarket crash? because like it or not its all connected.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:52:53
I remember the 2000 crash well - money moved to realestate as interest rates dropped and realestate was considered a safehaven. Then this evolved into the 2008 crisis as unregulated banks made fraudulent realestate loans to anybody who could breathe then these were wrapped into default swaps etc and sold to the world - boom. Banks should have failed but were bailed out with taxpayers money and no one went to prison. This was a fairly global phenomenon. Ten years later, interest rates are still around zero and stocks have soared. IF this is it and we are at the start of a stock market crash again (and I'm not sure its true) then money pours out initially to cover leveraged positions then later to other safehavens. But this time interest rates can't go lower and realestate is toppy as shit. Certainly in Australia the major cities are maxed out. Personally I reckon if Bitcoin can recover a bit, then many will pile back into it. However, many will still be put off by the storage issues. Its a strength and a weakness. No doubt someone will make it easier but who wants to carry around a Nano with a million bucks on it.

A bot told me to move this here...so I did....Wtf its falling and again and again and again.....it was all bullshit wasn't it.

its the stockmarket. ES futures tanking bigtime. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:10:59
I agree. Buy and keep for 10 years until you can spend it without converting to fiat. My main concern is that storage remains a serious risk for most of the world's idiots. Their phones seem the most likely storage facility with biosecurity. But even then there has to be a back up. Nanos and Trezors just won't cut it. Its going to take several years of work before the hardware catches up.
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:03:03
not according to EOS. its forming a base again and it led this imo.

I am absolutely convinced just about everyone way understimates whats going to happen. But one small part of me, the old sensible part, worries that it might cause uncontrollable chaos. Because if you take this revolution to the end, it wins. And if it wins, governments will go broke I think. And if that happens its a shitfight. Or war.

you can't see the revolution that is staring you in the face. Its unstoppable.

You're WAY undervaluing the concept.
