I have personally found the coinbase people to be very helpful, but not super fast, YMMV.

Really? On which exchange?
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:29:30
bitcoin varies a lot more than 10% in price in a given day. Because of the way options work on the major btc exchanges you'd have a very difficult time ensuring that all of your bitcoins are bought at the same price. There simply isn't enough depth, now that I am thinking about it. If someone just went "I am going to push a button and buy $20,000 USD in btc" that would move the price on mtgox for sure. And finding some dude on the internet, meeting him in person and giving him a check for whatever thousands of dollars AUD sounds extremely dangerous to me, but YMMV. Again, you should look at the price volatility of btc seriously before making a transaction of this size.

Looks like Gentoo did its job :D

Firstly, I can't imagine this is actually easier/safer/cheaper than doing a traditional bank transfer or just writing yourself a check or just getting a bunch of Traveler's cheques. 
That being said,  You would need to buy the bitcoins in AUD and then "simply" sell them in USD.
Also, if it's $10,000 USD or more, you will need to talk with your bank about it in the US. But I assume you've already talked to your bank in the US?
I would look very carefully into setting up an account on coinbase, as a means of selling the bitcoins in USD. Maybe you could use bitpay or another processor. What you don't want to do is expose your money to the price volatility of btc exchanges. 
I am curious to know what solution you actually go with.
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:20:14
Yeah, this is exactly the sort of thing the vast majority of people don't want to do with $10,000-100,000s of USD. Are they going to make that localbitcoin transfer in cash?

Note they are different wikipedia pages, for different terms.

I really shouldn't be shocked that the mod for can't tell the difference between an investment and a wager...

[Say what?](
Ironically, I already addressed this point...
Good job being a day late and a dollar short.

I am realizing that maybe I am using too many big words, so let me simplify:
A wager and an investment are two different things, that's why two different words are used. Equity applies to investments, not to wagers.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:07:00
The term equity simply doesn't apply. Equity as a right, is deterministic.  The difference between an investment and a wager is the non-deterministic nature of wagers, by definition. Between placing the bet and the bet being completed, at best you have a promise from the house. But ultimately, they pay at their discretion, it really isn't the same thing as equity. But of course, you being a scholar of these matters, I am sure you will posit a robust and well formed counter-argument, I can't wait to read it.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:19:49
You didn't actually specify the commodities in question. Comparing a whole class of assets (stocks/real estate) to bitcoin is unfair and given the vagueness of your statement it does not contradict the above... You also don't point out if you are physically holding the gold/silver, so in fact that may be lost as well.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:23:37
As a former dealer, I can say with extreme confidence that once you place your bet, it's the house's.
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:50:29
He's talking about speculative investing, which people call 'gambling'. This isn't it's Even if you understood exactly what you mean, the statement is unnecessarily at cross purposes to the rest of the discussion.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:57:18
Incidentally, equity *in the context of poker* is talking about investments within a system of wagers and is logically consistent. So congratulations for figuring that out on your own? You must really be a genius.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:47:32
This is what "placing a bet" actually means. It means the player is giving the house money in exchange for a chance to win a wager, the only way the player can get their money back is if the house gives it to them, and it is at the house's discretion to do so.
In defense of your rudeness, the terms here are somewhat ambiguous, but clearly, "spent" is equivalent to "placed bet". Once a bet is placed (and acknowledged as such by the house), either the bet is won, lost or canceled. In any of these three cases it is the house giving the wager back to the player. If you model a simple slot machine in your mind, you can see how it supports my argument.
The alternative would be people losing bets and the house not getting paid and having no recourse to get paid, does that make any sense to you, genius?

But isn't the profit locked in when the cross-exchange btc transaction happens? If you have money sitting in both currencies can't you turn a profit with a n weeks lag between when you made the money and when you receive it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:46:56
Considering the deltas between spot prices on the exchanges, aren't most people willing to wait a week or two to realize these sorts of profits? This seems like a no brainer to me... it's not better than just holding btc, but it seems better than entering into mining, at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:02:34
Yes, I do. But taking delivery of the beans can be tricky, they are magic after all. Give me currency of the future and I will send you some beans.

A VPS is not a secure place to store bitcoins.

What? I have some magic jelly beans, let me know if you want to buy them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:13:17
Thanks, you have come to the same conclusion I did.
