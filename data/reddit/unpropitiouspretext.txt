Time stamp? I’m not going to watch a 2 hour lecture.

Besides for the low price of bitcoin, I think we can expect this eventually.

@_date: 2019-03-20 00:37:33

@_date: 2019-03-19 19:00:22
The former, focusing on the limited supply store of value

Twist, Bitcoin is named after Bitville because it was invented there in the story

I wrote a story book for children and adults.   “Bitcoin Money: A Tale of Bitville Discovering Good Money”  It’s meant to introduce someone to “why Bitcoin?”  It will be full color, about 30 pages. We’re working on illustrations now. Release next month!
@_date: 2019-03-20 13:03:38
This book is not investment advice, It is an allegorical fictional story to illustrate the history of money. It is not a detailed guide on the intricacies of financial investment and risk
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:37:36
He’s a very legit guy. He gives his opinion, he’s very bitcoin maximalist and he has one time payment if you want bonus materials and extended seminars, but he’s not scamming anyone and he is honestly hustling for bitcoin. He has admired when he’s wrong and has been right a lot. I have learned a lot and enjoy his content. I give him props.

Its written for children, the phrase “sound money” doesn’t mean anything to them. What does “sound” have to do with money?

This is incorrect. Node operators run the rules they support. If miners deviate from those rules, their blocks will be rejected.

There will always be competition for the cheapest electricity, most efficient mining. Maybe electricity prices will drop and miner prices will drop and people can use miners to heat their homes.
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:32:30
So glad to hear that!

You can order a copy at bitcoinmoneybook.com using bitcoin/lightning!
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:40:46
I hear you that it seems complicated, but the instructions are basically “download this app, click the buttons in order”
There is no coding, no dealing with routing. I think that with the video, anybody that is familiar with using bitcoin, but not with coding would be able to follow these instructions
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:11:23

I think the interface is basically the same, the download links in the video description al have windows downloads as well.
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:45:13
thank you!

You are asking very good questions and the answer is that all of the things you are saying are in development. This is al still very new and mainly for test purposes and playing around with bleeding edge technology.
All the bitcoin I put on my lightning channel, I would be fully comfortable losing.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:45:20
Thanks! How do I redeem this?
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:13:34
It doesn’t make a difference what people interpret the white paper to mean. The fact is that the network works that if the miners hardfork and define consensus one way, no users have to follow their rules and can invalidate their blocks and follow a different chain.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:34:22
I’m sure there are still issues being worked on with lightning. I am not technical and don’t know those answers, but there are lots of very smart people working on these things at a very rapid pace.
Miners don’t vote and don’t decide the rules of bitcoin. UASF and NO2X proved that. Increasing the blocksize would require a hard fork which would require near unanimous consensus to not split the chain, which there is not.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:29:59
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:10:58
That’s why it’s hard to get consensus. That’s why we haven’t had a hard fork. When there is no consensus, then the default is to not change.
Why would we want the system to work that only miners get a say in the rules of bitcoin? What if miners all vote to give all miners more bitcoin?

Thanks for the constructive criticism. It’s my first video tutorial like this, so I’ll try to do better next time!

I’m excited to see my first halvening. I think this will get a lot more attention than the last 2.
