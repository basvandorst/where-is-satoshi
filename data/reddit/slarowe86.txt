How do you figure Coinbase isn't an exchange? It's quite easy to buy/sell BTC from there. Their current value price BTC/USD $639.95

Good point. maybe that's the problem with these other exchanges, they all got affected by this glitch. Coinbase is able to hold it's value somewhat. Granted since this whole incident happened it fell $200, but when figuring out BTC price it is now one of the main indicators.
The point is that Mt. Gox shouldn't be in this business, I mean hell they weren't even made to be a digital currency exchange, I believe it stood for "Magic The Gathering Online eXchange" They should just go back to that, they've screwed over so many people. There is a lesson to be learned here tho, never store your bitcoins online

Mt.Gox is going to be wiped out, let them go back to their Magic The Gathering Online eXchange lol

It's causing a firestorm, no one should buy or sell after news like this, it makes it so much easy to trace the thief

I haven't seen any kind of lag from bitcoin.clarkmoody.com which is a realtime stream for Mt. Gox, if you're in the US check out Coinbase, won't get charged crazy fee's either

I agree, it is a bubble, a healthy chart will have gains and losses, this has been on a runaway gain, granted I don't think we are going to see that HUGE of a crash like last April but, if the exchanges along with every other bitcoin adopter wants to see it grow, they all need to work together to prevent stuff like this from happening. I mean Mt. Gox has shutdown for a day here and there during DDoS attacks, I think theft is a tad bit more serious

You could, but also too how much has the thief actually sold off? Compared to the 10's of thousands that as you put have followed suit. I'm guessing this individual probably has 20+ addresses and is disbursing them as such, but now all the exchanges need to get together and find out who the bulk sellers are since the story broke. Freeze the bitcoin network and send back the btc to the users that have been stolen from. Send out a email that there is say a 24-48 hour window to acknowledge the transaction and then continue as normal

The bitcoin users decide it's market value, just like a company that issues shares, the investor's determine it's value. I'm not saying that bitcoin is over valued, I think it's undervalued greatly, BUT it shouldn't take off like it has, you see charts like this all the time in the penny stock world. Only difference is this survived the first crash, and it's accepted enough that some people aren't going to let it crash now. Bitcoin is essentially a stock that you can purchase parts of a share with, it runs the exact same way. Can't say it's a full blown currency yet until the world starts accepting it as such, we know it's a currency, but until the governments accept it as such, it's just a product that people are willing to pay for that grows or shrinks.
