Why does the 8k price point look like the price before the hype to you ?
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:49:29
You have to report your gains like any other investment 
Edit: if you sell or swap for a different crypto
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:09:42
Yeah look under your transactions to see how much $ you put in for x amount of btc
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:39:06
There are apps you can enter all that info into and they'll track for you. Delta or blockfolio are good IMO
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:50:49
That's every exchange though?

Coinbase has a referral program as well but it's just $10 up front. I don't think gdax has order limits just withdrawal 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:50:18
"Patience" it's been like 3 weeks lmao 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:26:31
Most trading done even in traditional markets is on "margin".  Thinking debt is a bad thing is pure financial ignorance.

@_date: 2018-01-18 01:42:26
You can only trade 4 coins on gdax. I know binance and kucoin certainly have those things and other exchanges have their own coins as well
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:48:15
Alts are more volatile typically sell to btc/fiat during downturns and spread out in alts during pumps 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:41:45
If the resistance is solid it's likely to go down from here. You mean to say support*
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:50:27
It's 2nd layer so no fork needed.  Massively benefits bitcoin if successful

@_date: 2018-01-30 07:55:11
Dude the fees are like 5 sats right now lol 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:43:01
Nah get a job and buy more with your paycheck 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:42:35
Gdax pays your transaction fee for you homie, check it out! If you already have a coinbase acct you can transfer free/instant between them 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:44:21
Don't forget you'll owe a lot of tax come next year. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:17:08
You can, just set up your gdax.com account and stop paying transactions fees as well
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:21:16
Why not?
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:03:19
For stocks they also give you instant access to your cash upon depositing up to like 1k. Not sure if they'll offer that for crypto as well but I don't see why not. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:43:39
4 dollars?

When you accumulate enough that you fear losing your holdings you'll want to buy a hardware wallet. Then simply right down your recovery seed on 2 pieces of paper. Keep one in your house and 1 somewhere else.

I would believe so 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:07:01
I think you mean fractions of pennies 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:32:28
Rises 1500% in a year then drops 20%. Yup bubble totally burst.

@_date: 2018-01-26 00:05:06
Nah most merchants build the credit card fee into the price anyway 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:57:46
It's only btc and eth for now 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:47:03
It's pretty straightforward IMO
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:29:00
Nah just use gdax and it's free 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:31
It does. they're either ignorant or being purposely deceitful 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:49
It's going to correct to 17.7ish right now maybe 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:38
Better yet get a card with 0%apr for the 1st year 
Edit: chase freedom is 0% for 15 months and they'll give you $150 if you spend $500 by the first 3 months 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:16:29
You know bitcoin.com is pro-bcash right ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:52
Nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:41:19
Do you have a comfortable amount of money you're willing to commit to a long term investment? If yes then Sure. To be doubly safe split that investment in 2. Invest 1 half today. And 1 half in a week or so in case there is a big swing either direction. If you don't have money you're willing to potentially lose then no. Do not invest in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:27:35
If your account got hacked from coinbase that means there's a keylogger or something malicious on your computer/phone. Idk if a hardware wallet is safe in that situation. Certainly wouldn't recommend it to you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:02
You were the chosen one 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:15:13
As long as your amount of btc is the same it doesn't matter you're fine.  
Edit: if you want to know how much value your btc is just multiply the current price by the amount you own. Keep in mind prices vary wildly exchange to exchange 
Coinmarketcap.com will give you a good rundown
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:31:11
My limits are 2k cc and 15k cash maybe email them about raising yours? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:03:16
At this point 10k isn't even close to 1 coin lol. That's a large sum for this community good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:06:40
Have you been watching for literally 2 days??
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:00:57
Check with bitrex
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:17:04
If there is malware on your computer then no wallet is safe try using the offline version of bitaddress.org to create a paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:44:08

IMO cats bounce a lot. Everytime they get scared they do that frozen jump bounce. Maybe this cat is dead and just bounce once but maybe it'll be a scared cat bounce a bunch of times. We just gotta keep scaring the cat so he bounces higher and higher 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:05:01
Yes select buy with bank account.  I believe you won't actually hold the coin until the bank transfer clears so you would have to be ok with holding for 1 week or so.
Edit: I just remembered I did exactly this with ltc on the 13th. LTC is locked in at price I paid it says pending still so I assume once my funds clear it'll be good to go.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:17
Do you mean sell puts or buy calls? Also I thought it was the futures exchange opening not options?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:40
Prices are wildly different on each exchange. Gdax is slightly above average price typically 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:00:46
I'm not wearing any shorts.  I hodled the feline aids drop and am I currently loading more fuel into traditional rocket boost formation.  Plans are to trap the dead cat on the tip of the rocket which will hopefully give it enough momentum to launch us out of orbit. After that I'm gonna chill until we do a gravity assist around Jupiter 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:42:14
Yes if you bought over  $14.8k then converted you would've realized a loss
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:02
The downside is you have no control of the btc for up to 10 days 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:46
There was a dip ??
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:55:20
Gdax pays your fee I believe Gemini does too
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:59:09
Yes 
Edit: also use limit orders to avoid buying fees 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:13
You mean 19?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:56
Hope :/ I'm so close to a full coin! At this point the last tiny fraction will cost more than the rest of my bits!! I'm so conflicted 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:59:34
Hardware/paper wallets highly recommended if you hold an amount of btc that would hurt you If it went missing.  Anything left on an exchange is capable of being taken from you 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:24:33
Yeah if your bank is linked it'll just pull from coinbase so your pending transfer would still go through too
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:56:35
How much fees have you paid and how long has it taken you? Did you use segwit? If fees are an issue then the amount of btc you have is likely a non concern if you lose it so keeping it on an exchange is fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:26:06
ACH is not instant in the US 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:22:21
How much does that money mean to you? Personally I think btc is absolutely worth buying into. If that money is for food or rent this month then don't.  If you're ok watching it grow over months/years and potentially losing most of it yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:39:45
It won't don't worry about it
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:42
If you believe in the technology and can afford it then putting in 100 a month is a great plan. Don't worry too much about catching dips.  Even if you bought in once a month at the monthly high point your bitcoin would have gained value 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:46:02
Which is what hardware ledgers use 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:24
It could be.  But it could also not be.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:11:31
Whoever bought the contract will pay that price for 1 btc at the end of the contract(no matter the actual price). On the other side someone sold that contract hoping btc would stay below that number.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:02:10
 why not just buy like .78 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:23:15
Andrew Left went on cnbc and tried to argue against bitcoin by saying what if you could buy aapl on blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:55
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:10:32
Then come aboard! It will be a wild ride so buckle up. Expect daily swings of 20+% and try to look away from a price chart at least twice a day.(it will be hard to do so) if you haven't already take some time to read up on blockchain tech if that interests you at all. aantonop is a fantastic YouTube channel to watch instead. Understanding the tech isn't necessary to invest though.  Have fun good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:03
Well he said hodl so I assume he means to hold his btc long term. You shouldn't hold any bitcoin on an exchange or online wallet really for too long. If you're actively trading day/swing whatever then yeah you basically have to leave it on an exchange but be aware there is a risk with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:09
You can market order from Coinbase and lock in the price. You'll have to wait till the transfer goes through to access your btc tho 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:35
Hurry up and make one
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:47:31
It's clearly a reverse triangular cat trap dude.  The dead cat bounce occurred now it's going to fall and get caught on a rocket booster and get launched into the stratosphere 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:49:00
Transfer from coinbase - gdax - anywhere completely free 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:03:15
Welcome to the world of market orders.  Use gdax.com if you already have a coinbase account 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:03:47
Consider using eth or ltc to transfer if you need it quicker than ~45mins 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:58:05
I can't answer that I'm not familiar with the vault. I imagine you're still trusting them with your private keys but idk
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:02:51
But if will be sweet if it settles at €200000 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:46
You should've had that bcash months ago 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:04
Because he's orchestrating it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:31:17
You should never hodl any amount of bitcoin on ANY exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:32:19
Like in chemistry, or physics?, when your teacher had the 2 black balls that weighed/felt the same except when you dropped them one fell like a rock and the other shot to the ceiling.  We gotta stuff this cat inside the bouncy one and drop it off the roof 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:37:21
Yeah you're more correct I keep forgetting futures are cash settled I only have experience with stocks and options. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:25:54
No idea.  If it works though it sounds like you'd be gaming their buy limit idk if they'd find out and get mad or something. I assume the purchase limits are some kind of law/rule they need to follow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:36:55
Yeah it would be pretty gutsy just don't get fired from your job and make sure you have an emergency fund available to you 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:44
My account is 1 year old. no idea I wasn't even aware I ever had a limit that low so idk. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:00:54
This number is way lower. I alone have 4 separate bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:53:56
But a market without shorting does? Why?
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:30:04
It hit 10k today already
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:54:16
Binance. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:45:40
It DID hit 10,020 creep 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:00:44
Look at everything in your total btc amount not $ value it'll be easier to understand. You're likely not realizing placing a market order on coinbase executes above the price it shows so once you buy that way you're automatically down money. 2k worth of bitcoin will be like 1.95k worth right off the bat 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:51:15
Well you can bet on tennis matches using crypto so there's that
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:25:29
Think he means get paid your income in btc not fiat
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:44
50/50 either it will or it won't 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:42:02
You can use a credit card on coinbase to buy instantly.  They charge a fee though I think it's 4%
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:34:33
10k Boyz we makin noize
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:59:51
Just click the sell button dude 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:49:17
I imagine he buys on the cheaper one then sells on the higher one 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:20:41
So it's a dividend with the added hastle of having to go and sell the thing lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:44:31
Forks are sorta dividends 
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:20:11
Yes if you sell them your cost basis for those coins is $0 and you pay tax on the entire amount 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:58:00
Not yet
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:01:28
I forget exactly but i think the TA guys wanted it to hit 5.5k
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:53:35
Yeah it split 91 to 1
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:39:40
If you have 2 mil invested in crypto and you don't love your life you're majorly fucking up something 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:58:10
I wish one day I could know what it feels like to lose 200k on a &lt;10% move :/
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:54:27
Wanted to upvote but you're at 69 so hey man, I liked this thing you wrote. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:11:28
I'm still on the waitlist for options trading and I was in the first 200k on line so don't hold your breath 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:40:15
This abortion of a convo started with me saying my life would be a breeze if I had 2 mil in crypto and you telling me no. Tagging you as "miserable millionaire" and moving on. Hope you find peace dude maybe take a vaca or something and clear your head until the market rebounds. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:26:21
Ah true it was in the 11s. If he bought at the absolute top that'd unfortunate 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:27:03
I stated how I would feel and you disagreed with me..?lmao I don't want to imagine what kind of miserable sap can't be happy with 4 mil. I'd be chillin 
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:13:18
What the hell are you going on about all I said was my life would be the tits if I could afford to lose 200k lol. Sure losing money sucks but if I had 2 mil invested in crypto my other investments would also total at least 2 mil and I'd keep maybe 500k in cash so life would be fucking glorious 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:02:51
Don't make a note of this dribble
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:27:17
People responding lol bank stocks are from the US
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:13:03
Cause I looked quick and saw 10.6k-9.6k looks close to 10% but it's actually less so fuck off 
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:38:49
Yeahh TA is just recognizing levels where lots of volume supported or suppressed the price in the past. Sentiments change but if you just look at a chart you can see where the price is going to bounce
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:17:25
No I'm pretty sure I do lol having 2 mil invested in crypto would mean my life is a fucking breeze 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:20:05
If you hold &lt;1 year your gains are taxed as income. If you hold &gt;1year you only pay ~15% tax.  Buying crypto is not taxable. Once you exchange crypto for other crypto or sell crypto to fiat or usdt that is taxable.(This is only valid for US)
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:53:04
Wash rule only applies to stocks or securities which should not apply to bitcoin.  But I'm not a tax professional. You can export your coinbase transaction records for tax purposes. I used bitcoin.tax to do this automatically. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:02:53
You can trust this guy he definitely isn't Satan
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:30:39
Who says its uncorrelated? Bitcoin has only ever existed while the global markets were in a boom cycle. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:56:07
Ermagawd I had to spend 3 cents to move 5k the other day. The fees are brutal amirite?
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:35:24
You're the only one saying TA never fails... Investment banks aren't going/able to invest in an unregulated  market anyway..
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:07:39
Ignore this troll it definitely matters. Gdax you can use limit orders and pay $0 fee. You can also withdraw crypto to any address from gdax for free(They pay all tx fees). They are the same company so you can link your accounts and transfer free/instant between the two.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:48:12
Study TA, learn to minimize your losses and use appropriate bankroll management and you'll have a decent chance of making money. Or don't. Idgaf
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:53:17
For someone daytrading a 50% success rate is actually great it all relies on minimizing losses and letting your winners run
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:48:19
You believe it's impossible to make a living trading ? Why would you believe that lmfao 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:57:38
Gdax always dumps hardest cause there is no shorting 
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:31:01
The story is showtime ran around offering 10k to anyone that had something interesting about John to say. The one guy later posted a video on YouTube I believe  saying he loves John and he just made it all up for the $ 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:39:35
There are plenty of people that do just that though...like day traders are a real thing...say you had a 1 million fund then making an average of  1% a month would net you 120k. Obviously not a viable route if you don't have money. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:05:12
When you short something what do you do to close your position?
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:08:53
That's great for you dude! Most people here aren't using their bitcoin to short on bitmex though lol there is definitely bitcoin to be made in bear markets as in bull markets 
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:27:03
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:25:57
Where can I trade options on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:22:17
Simply using TA to short when bitcoin hits the downtrend line would make you wildly more profitable then buy-and-hold 
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:49:15
What's with the...is that supposed to be sarcasm? shorting creates buying pressure next time it dumps hard compare bitmex to gdax
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:20:36
Everyone trading with TA loses.  But if they know what they're doing their wins should outweigh their losses. Especially with btc it has been super TA friendly 
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:54:28
Because they're hedging risk,  not using TA to trade crypto on margin?
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:43:19
It was interesting until everyone in the video said they just made all that shit up for money 
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:54:09
Dude..you're allowed to realize losses can even write them off on your taxes
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:58:06
CDs pay 12%/year? Where ? Look it's a real thing people do for money, if you don't want to believe that because it's hard for you then ok. I'm out dude. Good luck. Don't forget to let me know about that CD tho
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:55:08
You don't have to know what it'll do you just set a stop limit in case it drops..you can also set sell orders to take profits before the next resistance line.
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:48:20
If people were closing their positions then volume would be up 
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:04:11
Yeah that sucks when it happens but if you had good reason to set the stop then it's whatever. You should never trade with 100% of your portfolio in a single position. Most trades I do are 1-5% Of my total crypto. If making trades is stressful you are way in over your head.
