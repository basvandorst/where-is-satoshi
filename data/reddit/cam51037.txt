Possibly that they think they'll receive lower payouts with P2Pool. I'm quite sure that by joining P2Pool, the payouts would be the same as GHash. Also it might depend on the way that they've set it up, it could be a lot of work to calculate earnings through P2Pool compared to GHash.

Ah ok I missed that part. For some reason I thought he was running the node off of his PC but using the NAS for blockchain storage.
But yeah in that case setting up an Electrum server would be quite do-able then.

Dave is a great guy. I've dealt with him before when I lost access to around 30LTC (worth about $800 at the time iirc) he tried to crack my password with the info I gave him but unfortunately he couldn't figure it out. I then tried a ruby script and found it in a few minutes of cracking. Even though he didn't crack my pass phrase, he was a huge help to me and a very very nice person. I'm so happy for services like his in this community.

Did you by chance import private keys into electrum after creating the wallet? If so, then they won't be recovered with the seed, and I'm sorry to say but that money will be gone forever, if that's the case.

This transaction could have actually been sent with no fee and have been confirmed quickly. Transactions as large as this one have priority even if they include no fees because of their size I read somewhere awhile ago.
But even if 4 cents was charged to move $82.7 million, that's pretty amazing.

Litecoins and other currencies can't be stored on a Trezor. However the BTChip supports other currencies such as LTC and DOGE. It's similar to a Trezor but is cheaper and doesn't have a touch screen or buttons. It's just a little usb key sort of a thing. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:05:25
You could purchase something small, maybe a gift card from Gyft.
Cashing it out to cash, maybe localbitcoins? I don't know how many people would be up for a $10 purchase though, it's a small amount, but still I'd try selling it through localbitcoins or kijiji.

**"How a bet made someone buy us 4000+ fake facebook likes"**
A couple minor things that don't really matter:
* Facebook could be capitalized in the title and rest of the post - everywhere that it's used it's in lowercase letters
* First paragraph - Fairlay could be capitalized
* Third paragraph, first sentence : happend -&gt; happened 
Not sure if these are worth being paid for, but my address is 13x83XDqNbbyWEp23eFiJ38DNJ8yS22YJP
**EDIT: I found a few more, so I might as well add them on.**
**"Press Release 09.05.2014"**
First paragraph, "Fairlay not only allows users to bet but to see public confidence "
could be changed to
"Fairlay not only allows users to bet, but to see public confidence "
**"Could you help us make a decision?"**
Bottom of the page, start and end dates have underscores between words, "Which front page do you like the most" has no question mark at the end of the sentence,
**"Beta Promo is over – real Bitcoin Betting starts"**

If you have upwards of 10 BTC I'd recommend looking into a Trezor. It might be difficult to justify for smaller amounts of bitcoin (less than 2 BTC) but if you have in excess of 10 BTC I'd definitely recommend investing in a Trezor. Then your private keys are safe, yet it's easy to spend some of your coins whenever you need to.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:32:48

I remember reading a staff member posting that you can lose hashpoints from downvotes... just couldn't find the official source of it.
Just found another source talking about losing hashpoints from downvotes: 
~~I can prove it to you with some test posts on HashTalk if you really want to go that far...~~
Actually, I don't even need to prove it to you. Look at ZenCloud update v 1.7.0. Under "Hashlets" it reads


So I'm *very confident* that the fact it's been posted in the change log of ZenCloud confirms that its true.
So, my post was completely true. Your go bud.

In that case I personally would recommend Slush's Pool. The first pool made, it's a small pool and pretty simple layout.

Are you using the same version of Electrum as your wallet was originally on? There's a slight chance that could be the reason.
Eitherway, I'd try installing Electrum again, preferably with the version the wallet was created with, if you remember.

@_date: 2014-11-23 22:45:59
Just to add on to what you said about their forums. They also have a feature implemented that allows users to upvote and downvote comments. These votes translate into HashPoints which are linked to your ZenCloud account. So this basically punishes people if they don't agree with the community in their posts. If you receive downvotes, you lose hashpoints from your account. If you receive upvotes, you gain hashpoints. 
So obviously people will want to post "good" things to the forums to grow their HashPoint balance. I think that along with shadowbanning is a major contributor to how biased their community is, and how they all view the CEO as a God.

I received one claiming to be from Cointerra a few days ago with an invoice and attached jar file as well. Gmail flagged it as a virus right away but I was surprised that it didn't send the email to my spam folder.

IIRC theymos has said that they're salted, and encrypted with 7500 rounds of SHA-256. So I'm guessing most passwords would be fairly secure, but obviously still a good idea to force users to change passwords when the site comes back up.

Ah, that's why. And you're right, the TX doesn't show up on Blockr, or Block Explorer. So it wasn't ever broadcast, but Blockchain.info says it was. Thanks for the answer!

Is there any chance of international shipping? I'm in Canada, and it looks like the Trezor can't be shipped outside of the States unfortunately.

There's a bitcoin ATM in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Their markup/markdown there is ridiculous. I went in once when the exchange rate was $600/coin CAD, and they were offering to buy my coins for $500/coin CAD. That's over a 20% fee, no thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:02:55
Good question, I'm not sure on the answer though. I'm going to assume that it doesn't help the hacker in trying to brute force the passwords, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:34:47
Nope, it's not subscription based. You pay $10 and that 10GH/s is yours for life. They take off 2 cents per 10GH/s a day in maintenance fees but other than that, everything generated is for your own taking.

Pretty much this, except I think any altcoin would be fine. Or, if you're really security conscience, you could go to Monero, then to another currency, and exchange it back to BTC then.

Litecoin differs from bitcoins in a few ways,

You can always mine alt-coins such as Litecoin and then exchange them for bitcoins. I've also heard you can make some decent money mining Protoshares with your CPU (it's a CPU only mining crypto) 
So yeah, if you're still interested in mining I'd recommend checking those two options out.

Lucky OP! I didn't order a KnC Miner but it looks like yours will pay itself off quite quickly, even if the difficulty reaches 500 Million, it would take 78 days to pay off (at a constant 500 million difficulty though)
But yay time to mine all the bitcoins!

I'd use your exchange as well, except I don't want to verify my identity with government issued ID. I would withdraw some CAD to my bank account instead of using cavirtex. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:05:55
Primecoin is pretty neat.
Mine all the numbers!
@_date: 2013-07-09 01:11:59
Hmmm good idea, maybe sign the message with make a new wallet, I know your private key! lol
@_date: 2013-09-04 13:14:47
Yeah I forgot to put that in. Whoops. :/
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:58:57
What's the power draw like on it? Is it very noisy?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:18:33
...until someone programs a script to sweep all the private keys and to send the funds to their exchange account and withdraw it all into cash.
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:37:55
It's up on my end!
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:41:19
yay now there's two of us.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:26:49
Well this sounds really bad I know, but maybe you need to take advantage of the bug to get their attention on the issue.
If it involves taking coins you can always take the coins, then return them and sign a public note that says that there's a security flaw with the site.
The second one *might* work but you'd need to take a wallet with a fair amount of coins. Very shady I know...
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:09:03
I sure hope this is true... I'll still be changing passwords though but good thing it wasn't a very good password I used on BTCtalk.
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:37:30
What are you using to mine with? Awesome display + nice programming! I like it! :)
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:50:57
I would like it! I'm looking to build a low powered RPi miner with one, check my recent activity on reddit. :) I also would be able to have it shipped to a USA address and then have them forward it to me in Canada.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:02:30
My submission is rendering now, hopefully up in 3 hours or so. :)
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:51:57
That's probably the easiest way and it really isn't very difficult at all.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:35:26
So another question, if I import the wallet into Blockchain, can I then select it to fund certain sources?
I've tried Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum and Armory and none of them seem to work at all to import, or are just too difficult to figure out.
@_date: 2013-11-02 13:28:54
Here's more information on it right from WTCR: 
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:34:54
It works! Just bought the bundle with bitcoins, and it worked great! Took less than 2 minutes!
@_date: 2013-09-17 01:37:30
But... BFL has done much worse than that, lol.
@_date: 2013-07-01 19:12:52
Is there a special item I can purchase to see these fairies? Something like a Google Glass?
@_date: 2013-10-11 13:35:35
viruses are still free too
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:01:37
Yes except currencies such as DGC and LTC have pulled ahead in the alt-coin race - sure there are hundreds of other alt-currencies that have just been abandoned and died, but these ones have been around for at least a year, which is a fair amount of time.
I also think it's quite possibly that with the rise of BTC difficulty that these alt-currencies will stand a greater chance of becoming bigger as well, as miners move to mining them, they will either A) acquire LTC/DGC/different currency to spend or B) trade it for BTC. If they hold their different currency and entrepreneurs know that they're waiting to spend it they will create businesses that accept these other currencies, thus building the currency bigger.
It's definitely a long shot, but there's a chance. As long as there's money to be made on these currencies they'll live IMO.
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:53:05
Yeah my life is very, very boring.
I enjoy challenging my simple mind with simple questions like this.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:32:08
And if this happens I will most certainly be mining alt. coins because if you're not a big miner, difficulty will kill you.
Not trying to be a debbie downer but this really will put a lot of smaller miners out of the game. :/
@_date: 2013-09-04 13:15:36
It's actually amazing that people are throwing so much power onto the network now when most of these ASICs won't pay themselves off anymore.
Maybe it's just the manufacturers "testing" their products before shipping them off.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:37:13
Awesome interview! When was this aired? I'm in the same province but didn't hear the story this morning? Awesome to see how Bitcoin is getting more "shout-outs" after the $260 price.
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:35:40
Well you could print some paper bills from here:  under the "Paper Wallet" tab.
And then transfer some of the BTC from your wallet to one of the wallets that is on one of those papers, and then give that to her. Cool gift idea!
@_date: 2013-10-27 23:52:16
OK then you have a problem...
OK no wait I got it now.
Heat your hot drink up on the miner while you browse Reddit early in the morning while you watch the sun rise.
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:08:40
Hey folding is good to do too, I do that as well!
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:23:50
Mine was lolnope.jpg
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:39:11
Yeah, if they tried to be competitive that would make sense, but it seems that they just want to get word out to people about bitcoin mining, and these are a neat way to do it, but extremely pricey.
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:24:46
Sniff...... sniff it...
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:20:29
Wow, these difficulty increases are heavy, like, way more then enough to put any GPU miners out of business.
This is getting to be a bigger game with every difficulty change, it's crazy.
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:50:15
Hmmm yeah that's quite possible. So it works with the price ticker disabled?
@_date: 2013-04-28 12:44:38
Umm, sorry to kind of destroy your math here, but I'm thinking he'll plug some ASIC miner type deal into his RPi and mine from that instead. Most people just use the RPi to be a host for their ASIC, instead of a desktop PC or laptop.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:58:09
Why don't you sell your computer or phone you're using? That should get you a bit extra.
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:49:27
Wait so this price is only for people who have purchased these before?if its that way then I'm sad.
@_date: 2013-10-21 02:19:32
It's all supply and demand, right now there's a lot of demand from the Chinese so the price is going up as well.
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:22:41
As a GPU miner, I agree with this video lol.
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:26:24
Oh that's really cool. The price is a bit high for me, but it's still a super cool concept.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:53:07
For me it's more like "Dude sell all your bitcoins now while you can! You're going to lose a ton if you don't cash out now, blah blah blah."
If I listened to their nonsense, I would have lost like $500 or so. Don't listen to your friends when they try and use your money for you!
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:21:51
Sorry to say but your bitcoins are gone. It was a learning experience, but an expensive one. If you ever decide to buy more bitcoins always use two form factor authentication all all websites where you store bitcoins. Passwords aren't necessarily secure, but with two form factor the chances of you getting hacked are much, much lower. They'd need your password and your phone, if you're using Google Authenticator.
@_date: 2013-09-16 23:00:59
So why did you refuse it? You turned down a free miner.
@_date: 2013-10-16 01:11:01
Yeah man the snowbirds are awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:07:18
524 Million!
@_date: 2013-05-11 22:46:36
Maybe add the address instead along with a QR code?
Some people don't have phones, or don't use bitcoins with their phones.
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:57:55
Sorry, I meant to say how long until accounts can be cracked with the vanity program.
Time to edit the OP.
@_date: 2013-08-24 02:16:50
Yeah I don't know why they haven't disappeared yet. They really need to be sued a huge amount, or jailed and then we'd see the complains go down.
That and something happen to Josh, everybody seems to hate him and he seems to hate everybody with a valid point against BFL.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:44:29
Like, I mean if I import it into an already existing account with a different wallet with some BTC in it, can I choose to use only the paper wallet account to pay for things? Not the other, non-paper account?
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:33:26
Well they've shown us a video of an FPGA a long time back. However, since then we've seen nothing. I think a video would be nice to have, just to show us that at least they've created a video along with a case and some fake plastic pieces with lights so it appears they've created an ASIC. But they'll be shipping in around a month and it seems that they've been a bit quiet. No recent news about their miners, or any information on shipping. Nothing from what I've seen.
But to answer your question, I think a video showing the insides of their ASIC along with proof of it mining would be sufficient to know that they've actually created a working product.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:10:25
Very doable indeed. If you could get CGMiner to work with Debian then there's a very good chance it would work out I'd think.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:09:10
Yeah I was wondering about that, I didn't know how the community would react to this ad thing though, but so far it's alright. :)
But yeah I'll change that and post an updated version in here.
@_date: 2013-08-24 20:40:34
Yeah I know, it was too big to upload to imgur. It was either crappy fps and imgur, or high fps and dropbox. :/ sorry about that.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:34:43
Was your computer connected to the internet?
USE A PAPER WALLET NEXT TIME.
Sorry for yelling, but really, this is the best way to be nearly certain you'll never get hacked, nobody except you has seen the password. Sorry for your loss, but next time use a more secure method.
@_date: 2013-10-08 00:45:20
Even though it may be "illegal" you're doing the right thing.
Keep it up!
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:35:16
$90 a dollar? I'm confused, someone please enlighten me.
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:54:22
I was planning on buying 3 of them to set up with a Raspberry Pi. Not trying to make a profit from it, I think it would just be a cool mining setup, what would take over 400W to do on GPU's, my RPi + 3 USB miners would take around 10W. :)
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:05:36
Now we need one in Saskatchewan, I'd so use it!
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:11:51
Add Vircurex to the alt-coins to bitcoins as well, it's a good exchange.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:23:25
If you give your money to me I can give you one that'll do 1.1 TH/s. And it ships in 2 weeks.
But in all seriousness you need to do some more research, and to my knowledge the highest speed miner you can get is 400GH/s or 500GH/s.
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:25:34
That's not an error, it's just DDOS protection on their site.
If it redirects you after 5 seconds it's doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing.
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:34:20
Let me edit that a bit, they "say" they'll be shipping within a month. Just wanted to clarify that.
*shipping in two weeks!*
@_date: 2013-09-18 03:28:26
Well I'd be fine with a small fine, like for small time transfer (like I'd do, probably $100 at most) taking a dollar off wouldn't matter much to me. It's the $15 or more ($50 winnopeg said) flat rates that are a deal breaker for me.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:59:23
Yeah but for mining to my knowledge you need to run a special operating system that is made for only mining.
@_date: 2013-09-08 15:09:27
I'd love to do that but honestly I only know bits and pieces of HTML. :/
I wouldn't be the one to talk to about coding it all, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:54:24
I phoned up their site, "This caller does not accept calls from your caller ID"
Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:50:58
Haha, well if you're looking to sell your erupter for a fair price (I'm thinking around 0.11 BTC or so) be sure to hit me up! Not sure if you want to ship to Canada though.
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:24:40
Earned them from mining, bought Sim City 5 ;)
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:05:09
I like them! Any chance you'd create some in 1440p? (2560x1440)
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:09:31
Well there's a group buy on bitcointalk, 0.45 BTC for the miner and the rest is in the shipping cost.
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:36:03
As a Canadian, yes please! Carvirtex is the only real place to exchange bitcoins and their costs are quite high. A $15 fee for a bank direct deposit if I remember correctly, on any amount of money, which is pretty steep IMO.
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:51:02
This is like the third time I've seen this same post on the front page of this subreddit, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:01:06
Not interested, but out of curiosity how many square feet is this property? Beautiful house as well. :)
EDIT: Sorry just read it's one acre, sorry for being an idiot.

I bought the Humble Bundle, like 6 times. Not exotic or interesting really though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:47:52
Thanks a ton for the tip! :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:27:22
I can't decide even after asking quite a few people and thinking about it all day, I needed reddit's help. :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:39:17
I use GUIMiner, but I've heard CGMiner has more features to make sure you don't fry components. ;)
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:43:01
I'd love to enter this contest but unfortunately my video equipment is all packed up in the moment and I can't access it until Tuesday, or else I'd so make a video, I entered the original contest too!
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:55:24
That's horrible. &gt;:( Do you have a website, or a bitcoin address one can send coins directly to? I haven't figured out bitcointip quite yet.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:27:29
I got the same message and was just about to post it.
Pretty lame right from the begging: "I'm the co-founder of Reddit".
Looks at profile: "New user" :facepalm:
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:53:00
Maybe not to investors, but to miners they sure do.
My miner that takes 450W would be costing me around 30 cents a day to mine with, so I'm losing that everyday with bitcoins.
If I mine DGC or LTC with it however, I can easily make $3-$4 a day, after power costs. Also their scrypt coding has a huge advantage over SHA-256 currencies such as bitcoin, currently it is ASIC proof, as it would cost a fortune to develop a high-memory ASIC for these currencies.
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:34:15
Oh that would be awesome! Thanks for this giveaway! :)
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:16:26
So is this powered by an R Pi and a receipt printer?
If so, that's a really cool idea.
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:26:24
Redditor for 9 minutes?
You were SHOCKED? And have no PROOF?
lolnope.jpg GTFO

Overclock.net - it's a small but nice community! :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:11:00
@_date: 2013-06-29 18:11:15
Well what company is this for?
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:27:01
Yeah, as pardax said, if you want to make any money buy bitcoins, or maybe if you feel like it do your research and invest some of it at BTCT, there are some good things to invest in there.
But if you want to see what mining is all about go for a block erupter, they're like what, $15? So not a huge loss, but definitely don't expect to see a profit from it ever.
@_date: 2013-08-14 19:49:35
This! And BF3 for less than $5 (if you're a cheap person!) is a great deal as well.
@_date: 2013-08-31 13:53:19
I just thought 10 minutes ago that time travel was impossible because I've never actually seen proof of someone going back in time.
:O that's kind of weird...
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:20:33
Redditor for 15 minutes?
@_date: 2013-09-14 00:24:18
Pfff, you've gone this far. If you get a free miner from them, screw BFL, keep it and don't tell anyone.
Maybe that means you shouldn't have made this post then. :O
But good luck, hopefully it'll work out for you in the end, and hopefully BFL doesn't have a mafia for orders that ship out but should have been cancelled. You never know...
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:35:11
I thought of putting that in the post when I first posted it, but then forgot and posted it without it.
I believe it was a ton of small transactions though that drove the price up.
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:15:07
Title seems a bit misleading then..
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:03:53
Seller has no feedback, I'd stay away, especially at a price like that. Chances are they won't deliver IMO.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:12:39
Don't complain! Just be happy!
But seriously, if you want the payments to continue bringing publicity to it might not be the right approach, haha.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:22:23
Oops, totally read that title as "I broke my BFL ASIC!"
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:38:29
Well I thought around a month ago there was proof on this subreddit of BFL doing so.
And so far how many actual "reputable" ASIC brands are there? ASIC-Miner is about the only one I can think of right now. BFL &amp; Avalon have both become quite shady..
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:06:57
Awesome! I'm about to plug mine in tonight, but not to mine, more to fiddle around with, try and see what neat inventions I can do.
And, if I get an iPhone sometime in the next month, which is currently sort of possible, maybe I'll try and see if Siri can open my garage door. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:59:27
Well I got a paper wallet all set up with Blockchain + Bitaddress. Thanks for the help everyone! I'm going to try and keep the wallets half/half kind of thing, so each wallet has the same amount of the other, unless I somehow get a huge amount of BTC, then the paper wallet will be getting some extra love. :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 13:29:24
There are those ASIC USB miners, $89 for 340MH/s, that might bring in a bit extra every month but it doesn't have a great ROI.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:12:51
I think when the majority of KNC customers start receiving their orders we'll really see difficulty increases, like much more than 30% every time. I'm thinking 40-50% for a couple weeks, but with the already extremely high difficulty that might not be accurate.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:23:29
Yeah same, only difference is I've mined around $45 worth of BTC so far.
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:25:56
Agreed. What a rip-off, at least IMO.
@_date: 2013-07-09 01:36:49
Not telling. ;)
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:00:41
Well I've heard some people say that they'll keep mining even when all the coins have been mined because there would be ways to access wallets with large amounts of bitcoins that the operator has lost the private key to or something along those lines.
Not sure how that would work out, but I heard someone mention it here awhile ago IIRC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:51:41
No, I never said that at all. I said they claimed to have hacked it. If I believed it I would have been like clean out your wallets exchange your coins! cash out, cash out!
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:32:36
I mined all the bitcoins I used to purchase it. The benefit? I think it's pretty cool, personally. In simplified terms my electricity used to power my miners paid for my PS4. In longer terms it goes electricity-&gt;miner-&gt;pool-&gt;wallet-&gt;Gyft-&gt;Amazon. Yes I did have to pay for electricity, probably $40 worth to make this much, but for me, it's worth it.
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:46:35
I'm trying to understand as well, but the way I understand it with that 51% of the network, someone can control the network, so if the actual transaction said the coins in this transaction are going to Bill Nye the science guy and 49% agreed on that, but 51% said no, the coins go to the NSA, then the 51% would win because of majority.
I think that's how it works, but I'd like an ELI5 version as well.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:19:56
Oh wow thanks never even knew about that site. Maybe I'll buy a single block erupter + 2GH/s there. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:17:34
Probably not, although a little USB vanitygen generator would be pretty slick, especially if it did like 500Mkey/second or so. But that's a long shot.
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:50:21
So let me get this straight, you filed a chargeback and they shipped it out - did the chargeback go through before they shipped, meaning you're getting the miner for free, or what?
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:29:21
I sent you an email as well! :)
@_date: 2013-06-16 20:04:36
I haven't played it in awhile either, that was probably 1.5 months ago that I bought it, but yeah I enjoyed it. I should play it again, although I haven't tried any of the mods yet for it.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:43:03
I've heard of 51% attacks, and if the governments really wanted to, they could. It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense though. I think how in Germany it's smart by calling it a real currency so they can tax it.
But good question!
@_date: 2013-07-09 16:08:07
I'm in the same boat! Except with GPU's instead of these USB ASICs. I've invested in a 7950 and already had a 7850 mining, so I'm hoping by mining different currencies (ones that I think will do well, I think price may go up) the 7950 will be paid off within 2 months! And then from there it's profit. :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 20:34:33
Much more reasonable price IMO, but I'll wait until they're $50 each. ;)
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:19:26
He's obviously Preet Bharara who is the famous Nicaraguan prince you've been getting emails from...
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:45:22
I live in Canada. Hopefully we'll see your work out in the wild soon enough - I think it would be really neat to use bitcoins at horse races.
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:14:42
Oh sweet thanks for the link!
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:55:41
Yeah it's exactly like a gold rush. Where there's money to be made in things like bitcoin mining, you bet people are going to figure out how to create massive efficient operations. And make money on them, on top of it all.
@_date: 2013-06-30 18:29:45
Well hello there Redditor for one hour, nice to meet you.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:17:02
I've been mining for around 2 weeks. First with a 7850 doing around 260MH/s, and then a 5970 doing around 740MH/s. I've earned around 0.17BTC or so, so around $25, which I'm alright with. :)
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:10:20
Damn I need to do some trading! Hope it's back soon!

I'd love to get a USB ASIC miner, but they're so expensive for their output IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:30:24
Wow thanks! My first ever bitcointip! :)
@_date: 2013-06-14 03:40:39
Thanks so much! Definitely saving them and going to use them! :)
@_date: 2013-05-25 00:11:56
Haha! That's hilarious.
*but seeing it does make me cry a little on the inside and lose a bit more faith in humanity too*
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:03:07
Yes it appears to be down.
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:55:54
Yeah exactly, I never thought of it that way.
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:32:58
Free virus here! Come and get it while it's hot!!!
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:14:43
Hey, it looks more realistic than BFL.
Ha. Ha. Ha *that was a horrible joke*
*crying a little on the inside*
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:14:40
Yeah not sure what he was talking about. The lowest I've seen one of the Block Erupters go for is $45 + ~$15 shipping.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:37:01
Hopefully if Paypal accepts BTC, the price of them will go up, but as previously experienced, bitcoin prices are like a yo-yo.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:13:07
We need more places in Canada. ;(
Canadian businesses! Accept bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-06-17 13:42:33
I'm new at all of this like some of the other commentors, so how do we know what block were currently on?
It will be interesting to see how mining changes with that reward drop though. By the year 2120 (I think that's when bitcoin is made to "die") will the reward for mining be pretty close to 0 BTC?
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:38:27
That's also an option. It's just that shipping is a flat 0.08 BTC plus 0.02 BTC per erupter at BTC Guild so I want to make it all in one order so I don't need to pay the 0.08 BTC again if I want more (which is very unlikely)
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:27:26
Oh awesome! :)
But yeah chances are it isn't real, nothing is showing up in your wallet + I think they would have fixed all the fake balances by now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:12:16
Amazing work, definitely saving this gif in case this post goes down. But really it's sweet. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:49:07
Sorry, had to downvote this post to get the one that says we need 32k votes to the top of this subreddit. Let's do it! I've already voted my 6 times a few days back!
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:47:18
yeah probs have already.
10/10 have lost mind

@_date: 2013-11-13 23:41:13
It has a horrible rating from WOT.
Thanks, but no thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:14:45
Yeah definitely don't be repaying him if the money is out of your account.
Scumbag bitbargain seller...
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:32:23
Oh that is a problem then.
What browser are you using, and are you using any add-ons with it?
@_date: 2013-09-04 13:25:53
Yes that's quite possible as well. But at a vertical rate? That's what puzzles me.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:04:34
IGNORE THIS GUY HE'S A SPAMMER! DON'T GET SCAMMED!
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:20:06
Heehee, this definitely deserves an upvote!
The Nigerian Prince will probably get this email while eating his grapes and drinking wine while he uses his brand new MacBook and think: "lolwut?"
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:18:07
* Try posting this to for more replies. 
* Do you use escrow?
* Any proof of the miner?
* Sorry but that email proves nothing.
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:29:59
DO WANT
@_date: 2013-08-19 20:20:27
Look at their pre-order terms, no Paypal accepted.
They have learned...
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:48:12
And this is what?
@_date: 2013-08-02 02:53:18
Let me rephrase that for anyone wondering: free virus!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:45:32
I thought so, but I've heard reporters are reporting that bitcoin has been hacked, which is lowering the price.
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:12:03
Oh. Well now this is awkward....
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:06:31
Man don't worry about it! It seems like he might be doing it mostly for fun. ;)
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:21:06
Thanks for the quick reply. I shall try this method and see how it goes! Thanks!
