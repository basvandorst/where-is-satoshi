You can't just think its true only because you said so. Did you never pass 3rd grade?

If you think of it as any other form of currency, except it is decentralized. Money backed by banks work because the government legitimizes its credibility. Decentralized cryptocurrency is the same thing. So if you play with the definition, it is only a scheme in a way any other currency is. Its like going to the EU subreddit and crying about how you are going to enjoy when the price of Euro falls down.

I think that mentality is just a projection of your very own thoughts. And there is more to it than what people who don't know much about a field can conclude.

You do know Asia isn't a country right? Its a pretty diverse continent with a lot of different nations and cultures. Its pretty obvious to see that you don't actually understand whats going on. Hong Kong isn't the capital of Asia. Violence with police exist, but you lack actual knowledge of any police equipments or tactics. Police in many asian countries don't even carry guns. What protest against an empress are you talking about? Please learn what you are trying to talk about before spread false information and gross generalization of an entire area on earth. Ignorant fuck
