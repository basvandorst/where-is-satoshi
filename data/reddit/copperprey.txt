When will people wake up to the fact that Coinbase is a bank?  They-are-a-bank.  They want depositors.  They have disguised themselves as a bitcoin company to gain traction and market share in the bitcoin space by making it (mechanically) easy to acquire bitcoin.  If you want real on-blockchain bitcoin services (like billing) use BitPay or one of their partners (e.g., Paydici).

When you pay a BitPay invoice, BitPay will look for the tx on the network.  When it's found the invoice is marked as "paid".  Depending on "Risk" setting... one block changes status to "confirmed", six blocks changes to "complete".
If the tx doesn't show up on the network there is nothing BitPay can do - the buyers wallet needs to send the payment.  Sometime people use wallets that aren't really wallets (Coinbase).  When you pay with a Coinbase account the payment may not be sent right away.  In fact I've heard of times when the CB account has not sent the payment for hours!  That's not the fault of BitPay.  BitPay will update the invoice immediately when the tx is seen on the network.

BitPay has integration with several POS vendors (adding more all the time).  Two of those are  (also see  and   You can also use BitPay directly with or without using and POS.  The BitPay merchant account has a "Checkout Now" feature which allows servers to bookmark a URL on a tablet/smartphone.  The URL accepts and order id and a price - enter the data and click a button - then the BitPay server presents an invoice with a QR code.  Typically the order id is set to the invoice id in the merchants POS system and that system treats the transaction as a cash sale.  Works very well and is simple to use.  Can be accepting bitcoin using the BitPay merchant account same day as signup.  Free to sign up, pay 1% tx fee.

This is helpful.  The answer to the problem is actually in the post and this comment.


You're right, there's no need to alter the behavior of addresses.  The problem is solved when wallets provide complete support for payment protocol.  BIP70 includes support for what we need in the paymentDetails.  expires is "Unix timestamp (UTC) after which the PaymentRequest should be considered invalid."  There is a slight gap in that there is no definition for what "invalid" means and for whom; it should be interpreted by a wallet to mean "this address should not be sent a payment after this time" - and the wallet should comply.


True. This is the real problem. Community pressure could motivate wallet providers (though I've observed that this is not getting it done).  Idea: payment processors could agree on date after which they will only (at least by default) expose payment invoices that are BIP70 compliant (expressly not backward compatible).  This will materially impact the bottom line for processors since under, over, and late payments (all sources of cost overhead and poor UX) would be eliminated.  This would make it a pain for people using older wallets to pay which may motivate the users to change wallets and/or express displeasure to the wallet manufacturer.  I suppose the customer could also be unhappy with the merchant/processor but "we're doing it for the good of humanity" ;-)

Bitcoin doesn't need any marketing, it needs to add business and consumer value.
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:31:56
Thank you for saying that; Bitcoin is indeed a platform which needs value built on top.  Bitcoin is the financial and economic transport layer for networking.  It's not bitcoin as a currency that is transformative, it's the presence of the protocol and its future application in a greater context.

Create a free merchant account at BitPay.  Use their free POS Checkout app available in app stores.  You can be accepting bitcoin in just a few minutes.  Doesn't get easier..

Create a merchant account at BitPay.  Use the hosted checkout tools to create "buy now" buttons for your items.  Post the buy now buttons to a web page, advertise, and receive bitcoin.  Can't be easier..

Getting people to use Bitcoin is not easy. Advertising is not an effective strategy. Consumers won't move to bitcoin on their own.  The Bitcoin community is already saturated with all the bitcoin enthusiasts. Bitcoin has a real problem getting into the early adopter phase.  There is simply no consumer pain or motivation.  You'd have to pay people to use Bitcoin from this point forward; the other qualities of Bitcoin will not penetrate the early adopter community.  Paying people means spending marketing money to incent and motivate.  There are at least two problems with this strategy - you'd need to spend an enormous amount of money to make a difference, and paying people (without a long term consumer relationship program) does not create stickiness.

Bitcoin mining is not a specific skill, it's a commodity operation that requires no real human attention.  Companies like Intel and Qualcomm are already investigating doing simple things in hardware like providing bitcoin wallets embedded in microprocessors or micro controllers.  It's not a stretch to imagine that all devices could provide (at least simple) mining services in return for being a bitcoin consumer. Let's see what 21 has in store - I'm willing to bet they are taking a step in this direction.  The IoT will be composed of billions of devices that will all be network participants. They will all require financial system participation (DAC) as well as providing a small contribution to their primary system function.

Create an account at Bitpay.com and provide your name, address, business name, business owner, phone and you will be able to process $100/day, $500 lifetime without further verification.  If you want to receive 100% bitcoin in settlement then you obviously don't need a bank, you need a Bitcoin wallet.  To raise the transaction processing limit you need to provide additional documentation.  This is all part of BitPay's KYC/AML policy.

Why would Circle, or any bitcoin company want to spend a huge, and that's what it would take, amount of money to encourage bitcoin use and adoption?  (I said that like that's even possible).  They will likely use it to advance their own position over Coinbase without handing more business to Coinbase (and everyone else).  And even if they did use the money for encouraging adoption -- it won't work.  You need hundreds of millions of dollars over many years  to move the peg on consumer adoption.

A couple of points to feed the fire: (1.) in the future people will conduct fiat currency transactions over Bitcoin rails without knowing it (there will be a series of new network service businesses that compete directly with and ultimately replace V, MC, ..), these network service providers will surface the value of Bitcoin to be directly applicable to each fiat currency.  Since bitcoin is also a store of value their will be no need for banks, and (2.) mining as you know it today will be unrecognizable in the future, it will disappear into the ethos.. The IoT will provide an opportunity for orders of magnitude more miners to exist, each running at much lower power and hash rates (though the total network hash rates will continue to increase).  This super-decentralization of miners will drive the price of bitcoin down significantly - but bitcoin will never disappear/go away, it just won't be something that people do in their barns in Greenland ;-)

Our BitPay/Ingenico app fits into any aforementioned POS architecture; it can be used stand-alone or as a slave to a POS.  For merchants that have existing relationships with PSPs (nearly all that have a terminal/POS) we will work with their PSP to integrate our app (given it makes business sense for all parties).
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:21:24
We can either depend on a high res display or the presence of a printer.  Display seemed a better v1 choice since industry trend it toward better/bigger displays. Only a few terminals have a printer.

One of the big challenges for bitcoin, generally and in the US especially, is that it [bitcoin] tends toward security when people tend toward liberty.  It's not the monetary component or the ownership component or the privacy component of Bitcoin that has to provide value for it's users.  These components of the solution must be made invisible and frictionless, yet that's where the emphasis is placed within the Bitcoin community.  It is what you can do with Bitcoin that exposes it's value.  The Bitcoin community lacks the necessary tools to make Bitcoin (a highly secure and personal experience) usable by people who don't put a high value on these primary qualities (the masses).  Trezor and Ledger and multisig wallets are complicated technology, too complicated to go mainstream.  The Bitcoin community is fundamentally out of alignment with the values held by its intended users.

BitPay team member here. Answers to some questions:
Summary of the solution at [Slide Share](
The solution is available immediately for Ingenico's North American region.  We can service terminals in other regions on demand however we need to obtain the appropriate application signing kit from Ingenico to make the application available in other than NA terminals (there may be a delivery delay here but we are scaling to other than NA geos on demand).  This is a global solution with only our need to sign the application for use in terminals not specifically setup for the NA region.
BitPay can source terminals for your business, install software and configure the terminals for your BitPay merchant account and ship the terminals to you. Each terminal will have a cost associated with its acquisition and setup.  The cost is based on volume; please contact us for specific pricing.
Steps to get setup.
1. Setup a BitPay merchant account.
2. Contact BitPay to order terminals.
3. BitPay ships installed and configured terminals to merchant.
4. Merchant requires a hard wired Internet connection and power at POS locations.  Plug in, power on, accept bitcoin!
There is no requirement to engage a PSP or agent but if your business does have a PSP then please inform us and we will attempt to work with your PSP at your request.  
There is no requirement for the terminal to host any other payment method (e.g., credit card) or for a CC processor to even be involved (this, of course, may depend on your PSP).  The Bitcoin solution works stand-alone.
If your terminal is a slave to a POS system then we need to know if the POS/terminal can be setup such that the terminal can obtain a direct connection to the Internet (bitpay.com). The terminal must have a direct Internet connection (terminals may proxy through a host).
We think the best, most cost effective solution is to use the Ingenico iCT250 terminal.  It has good screen resolution for QR code scanning and has an integrated paper receipt printer.  At the conclusion of a sale you can optionally print a complete receipt for your customer.  The receipt has everything the customer needs to reference the sale and request a refund if needed.
* 3 steps to complete a sale, (1.) key in amount of sale, (2.) issue request for payment from BitPay, (3.) customer scans QR code to pay.
* Optionally print a customer receipt at conclusion of sale.
* Highly configurable customer receipts (e.g., print your store name, etc.)
* Print a listing of all sales for the day; great for reconciliation without having to go to bitpay.com (optionally go to bitpay.com to access your order history).
* Handles multiple local currencies simultaneously (tx 1 in USD, tx 2 in EUR, ...)
* Accepts customer tips using amount or percentage of sale (just like the BitPay Checkout App).  Very usable for restaurant sales!
* Employee safe; pin protected setup/configuration.
If you're using a tablet or mobile phone hosting the BitPay Checkout app then the Ingenico terminal may be a great substitute.  The terminal is easier to use, easier to secure, and less likely to grow legs or be used for gaming ;-)
Hope this helps everyone - and thanks for your interest and support!

Checkout "child pays for parent" transactions.  The idea is that the stuck transaction can can be associated with a new child transaction.  The new child transaction can have a fee (to get it picked up) but the child cannot be processed without the parent being processed first.

Gavin Andresen.  When changes to the network occur, 80% of the network must agree (update to the new version) before the network will accept the change (this voting behavior is built into the software).
