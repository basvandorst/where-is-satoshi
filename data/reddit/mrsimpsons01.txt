That’s what I was hoping for. So I could basically buy 0.20 bitcoins? Because I’m not super rich haha!
Can’t afford to pay 6k atm so that’s really good!
Thx man

Mostly thought about the simple solution.  
Maybe I should actually invest by buying actual bitcoins. 
Thanks for the input

Thx a lot for clarification. Appreciate that a bunch!
Will definitely dig deeper into this. Seems like a very easy way to get in with the xbt! Might be a good way to start as I try to gain some more knowledge about the whole thing. 
Much appreciated. 
Bless you

That’s what I’ve read, a lot. 
Do you happened to understand the stock? Aa I understood you are buying a “certificate” which they say is worth one unit. 
But one unit is worth like 6k right now?
Really big newbie but seeking out for some knowledge. 
Thanks

Thank you all for the help. Very kind of you all. 
See ya laters!

I just googled a bit further. 
Basically what it means is that you buy a certificate. Same way as when you buy gold on the stock market.  
So it’s based on the value of the currency. 
Just checked and the stock was worth 1 euro / share 2years ago
