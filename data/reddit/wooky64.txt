This post is not about mining (I know I do shit but passion is devouring and irrational) 
This post is to make you UPDATE THE CORE ! BUT passively nicely openly wise =)

Not helping the network ?  GPU reconfirm the old transactions, it's may not be the most gratefull task into the network but it has to be done ...  You right about an old asic miner would be working with more efficiency.
