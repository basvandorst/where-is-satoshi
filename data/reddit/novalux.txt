Yeah I opened a new account just for Bitcoin. Not worth the risk.

So this is why the price is nosediving? Gross.

BRILLIANT. Using his brother's name, no one would ever suspect him!

Namecheap.com can do domains and webhosting and some other stuff. You can fund your account through Bitcoin and they immediately convert it to USD.

This is cool and all but what the fuck did that guy just say about Batman?

Ah not sure. They have a ton of TLDs I figured that would be included.

It's very interesting and reassuring that now a "mainstream" publication like Forbes would write something like this:

This needs to be higher. It's the only thing that is direct quote from Mt. Gox so far.

Sure, I'll bear with you.

A Christmas miracle!

Do new buyers get the benefit of the previous months since the start of the mining period, or do you prorate the price? If neither of those are true, it's a scam.

She keeps confusing "the Bitcoin community" for "normal people that don't appreciate shoddy journalism that disrupts an old man's life."

One more try.

Yeah even though Mt Gox was for trading, it's a good idea to not let one single entity control a large number of your Bitcoins. This is of course the best example. If the entity messes up, you lose your Bitcoins. If you only kept a small percentage of your coins on MtGox you would be hurting less than if you used it as your main wallet.

I'm of course holding most of it, but I make a few purchases with Bitcoin. All digital things so far. Once the USD conversion price goes back up a bit more I'll start buying a few things on Overstock or anywhere else that starts accepting Bitcoin.

He's joking. Excrement is feces (poop).
