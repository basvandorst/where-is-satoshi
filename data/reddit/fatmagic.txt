Man I loved my soaps. I used to carry a big stick of wax around for guardrails. Made it super fast grinding! I miss my soaps :(

I've been purchasing Humble Bundles with Bitcoin for almost a year now. It definitely is a good currency to purchase games with!

Whoa. The one thing I've been hoping for is a good service that would allow me to get a Visa/Mastercard prepaid card.... if this can emulate that, I'm all over this. Thanks for this homad :)

Bitcoin Newb here (just started mining a day ago) - As soon as I get more than a penny's worth of BTC in my wallet, I'll try this neat tipping thing. I like the pay it forward idea! Thanks!

Yeah. Nintendo will probably have an issue with the usage of "Mii". INB4 it's renamed to "MeeCard"

Thank you Gyft. Been using your service since the day you supported Bitcoin. And you continue to get even cooler.
EDIT: 2190 points, so awesome. Thank you :)

Yeah the 512 model pulls about 3.5W - 5W - ultra low power.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:37:58
103% agree
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:14:25
Yep my version of Malwarebytes Pro blocked it.

Very low power consumption. And it will be usable with ASIC's for mining if you want to go the BTC route. I picked one up a few weeks back just for this reason, and i've already started using it as a web server to pull in LTC Pool API's so I can check the status of my miners from my smartphone.
EDIT: Oh and I have [this version of the Pi]( has the clear case. Very useful.

Right on!

Wait, what, really? I was looking for a path to LoL using Gyft... seems you found it... thank you, and curse you! (because now I'll spend it on LoL!)
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:31:00
Hooray! Thanks Blarg :)
Now to try this out...
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:57:16
Wow that is wild! Then I went back and right click again... and saw the trick. That's a mean one!
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:30:59
Wow these are great! Using the "swirl" one as my desktop on my miners.
Any chance you could make a few backgrounds for Litecoin like this (and of course post it over on :-)

They'll arrive eventually. The first Avalon was ordered in September, and arrived in February. BFL will get them out, just longer than Avalon took. Basically an arms race.

Does anyone know if the [3V Visa Cards]( they sell are like prepaid Visa cards? Could I use it on any online site that accepts Visa? I know the page says it does... just leery and not sure. I've been looking for a service that sells Visa prepaids...

Again, mining on a laptop is very risky to your CPU/GPU &amp; mobo. Be wary. Laptops don't deal very well with heavy GPU loads &amp; heat.
I build PCs in my spare time, so I have lots of extra parts laying around, and put together two systems with a couple GPU's. Nothing spectacular in the slightest. One system has a Radeon 4870x2 running at about 110 MH/s, and the other system is running a Radeon 6770 that gets about 190 MH/s - total 300 MH/s that I'm running on the BTC Guild pool.

Be very wary about using a laptop, you can easily cook that thing if you run it too long/hard. 
I flip flopped on this as well when reading about for a couple days, digesting it all. There is going to be a huge "bitcoin rush" when the ASICs all hit the market (Avalon 1st batching actively shipping). I might as well get in now while I have a chance, mine up a few BTC, and then get an ASIC myself for the long haul. Might as well try and start now before the difficultly gets so insanely high, that even a 4.5GH will be like your 40MH laptop :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:17:38
I definitely signed up. Now I need 3 referrals to try it. (p.s. if anyone wants to try out the service, please use my referral! 
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:26:03
Ditto Khao8. I hear you. I started looking into it around 2010, and should have dove in head first. Oh well. I'm not looking back now. I'm going full steam. Although full steam for me right now is only 300 MH/s, it's better than nothing.
I've preordered a Jalapeno, and will be getting two used 5850's in the meantime to bring my hashes up close to 1GH/s until the Jala arrives (if ever). Here's hoping.

Great idea and execution. Fun part is, it looks like Geocities from 15 years ago :)
