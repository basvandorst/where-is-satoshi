That's not inherent of capitalism, that's just how it worked out with our form of capitalism. With proper regulations and laws, that wouldn't happen. Just tax rich people proprtional to how much they make and we would have a much more thriving society since that money could be used for education, infrastructure, Etc. As long as we can properly redistribute the wealth, capitalism is actually better than any other system because it spurs innovation.

The bitcoin economy is vastly more complex than "hey, you should invest in $1000 in this fake internetz money, trust be bro". That's like getting mad at someone for not buying Google stock or Apple stock when they just became public. 
I'm all for bitcoin and decentralization, but the theory of economics tells us that people aren't going to use a currency if it isn't valuable to them. Large corporations are taking advantage of their wealth to invest some of it in BTC to take the availability away from people that don't have the luxury of investing. That's not fair distribution.

Historically, after a spike, there's a downtrend for about 2 years. If you trust that analysis, you should sell now, and buy in when it's lower to increase your position. If you don't, then hold. If you are paranoid, sell at a loss right now, and never buy back in again, or buy back in when it goes higher and lose part of your position.

You don't get it, do you? Even financially responsible people are subjected to this mess. For example, minimum wage was designed to pay for a comfortable life. Buy a house, get a car, start a family. Good luck doing even one of those with minimum wage today. I make more than double minimum wage, and can barely afford maintenance on my car. I can forget about hospital bills if I run into health problems. 
Banks are increasing interest rates faster than wages can increase. The price of goods also increase faster than wages. Young people are opting out of having children because it's too expensive. They know that the population won't do anything about it. They'll keep gouging everyone right up to the point of starvation. There are damn near half a million homeless people just in America. 1/5 of American homes have children who go to bed hungry, yet we're the richest country in the world? Where's that wealth? 
I don't want victimization. I want realization of what's happening.

Is it not true that banks gave out bad loans that caused the 2008 financial crisis? There are plenty of people that have little or no financial responsibility. The entire alcohol, game, and casino industry is built on it. The entire marketing industry counts on this psychological "hack". 
The culture, especially in America, is to spend your money as soon as you get it. This culture was created by the marketing industry and political leaders in order to control the populace. As long as we can blame other poor people for our problems, and as long as those poor people think that they are higher in the socioeconomic ladder than they actually are, they won't realize their situation. 
Although this was one of the themes of the video, it wasn't the only one. You're not disputing the part where the federal reserve fuels fractional reserve banking to the point where it's unsustainable. I'm not saying FRB is bad in essence, but rather it's bad in it's implementation of it. 
Do you not see how predatory banks are when it comes to advertising credit cards and loans to individuals who don't know how credit works? Hell, I'm pretty cognizant of it, yet I still get letters in the mail every month asking me to get another CC. 
No part of our education system teaches people how money works. I'm not saying people are generally stupid (although many are), but rather they are mislead by every large corporation. Many people think that they can afford things, but eventually bills pile up, and foreclosures happen. 
On a tangent, but slightly related topic, much of the population believes that Trump has been doing America a service. They've been brainwashed by the powers that be in the same way that they've been brainwashed to think that their current financial situation is okay. 
Even people that are very responsible with their finances are eaten up and abused by this system. So your argument is invalid in many ways.

Inflation isn't supposed to fix income inequality, it's just supposed to make sure that rich people can't hoard, and that they're forced to spend that money (which goes back into the economy) on stocks/real estate/etc, or lose it to inflation. It puts money back into circulation.
The biggest problem we face today is income inequality, as you mentioned. Every economist is talking about how we can have a fair distribution of wealth. If you have a proposal on how to do that, be my guest. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:58:17


Do you have any actual argument for this, or is this just your opinion? I would argue the opposite based on my previous posts. 


Again, you offer no actual argument, just speculation. Why do you think this would be so? Just saying that "some business would have gains and some would have losses" is like saying "bitcoin will either go up or down" "It'll either be heads or tails". That has no reasoning. 
The only thing I can agree with you on is:


This is what caused the 2008 financial crisis. The banks knew they could just throw out loans to anyone, even to people with bad credit, and eventually would have to get bailed out by the central banks, which in turn, would have to be bailed out by the Fed. This is not an inherent problem with fractional reserve banking or inflation, it's a problem with implementation of it. 
If we got rid of fractional reserve banking, how would you buy a house or a car? Where would you get a loan to do that? Many places even finance furniture. Our total money supply in the entire economy would immediately be decimated, literally. Our economy would crash like crazy. 
We need a way to regulate the banks in the system we already have. The fractional reserve system wasn't just set up the way it was, it organically happened through hundreds of years of banks failing time and time again on older systems. We should know better not to go back to those older systems. We need to improve our current ones.

The majority of economists agree that a very small amount if inflation is good for the following reason:
If we have 2% inflation per year, that means a person with $1 Billion in his savings will have $20 Million less purchasing power at the end of the year. Compare that to a person with $100K. They will have only $2K less after that year ends. Even though both people lost money, the billionaire is at a huge absolute loss. If the billionaire doesn't spend that money on assets like stocks, bonds, etc, it will continue to disappear. That money goes back into circulation in the economy. 
If we didn't have that 2% inflation, then billionaires could just keep all their money and continue to hoard, significantly increasing income inequality. Sure, the little guys may lose a little bit here and there, but the net gain of the billionaire putting his money back into circulation vastly outweighs him keeping it all for himself. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:30:03
o really?
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:03:59
Example: 2% inflation over 1 year.
Person 1 - $1,000,000,000


Person 2 - $100,000


If both people keep their money in savings, the person with 1 billion loses $20 million the first year, and the person with $100K loses only $2,000. 
I'm saying that this small amount of inflation is good because it highly incentivizes the billionaire to invest his money into the economy instead of hoarding it. Putting more money back into the economy is better for everyone because then there is more of a chance that the money will find it's way to another person's hands. 
This doesn't address the issue of income inequality. It's a separate issue. When that money goes back into the economy, it should have a higher chance to be distributed to poorer people. That's the problem we face. We have a problem with wealth distribution, not inflation.

No, that is a separate issue. That is the issue of wealth distribution, not fractional reserve banking. If that new money was distributed equally, we wouldn't be having this argument.

That's just one problem. If we were to abolish fractional reserve banking, our entire money supply would literally be decimated. The economy couldn't handle that. I want bitcoin to succeed, but it has to co\-exist with fractional reserve banking.

I agree, wholeheartedly, on all of your points except on inflation. 


First of all, the vast majority of economists agree that a small amount of inflation is good, as I mentioned before. However, inflation doesn't have to do with equal distribution of wealth. What we need is more and larger regulations on Big Pharma, insurance companies, and landlords. That's where &gt;90% of the money is going. Why are those entities allowed to raise prices whenever they feel, however much they feel? Those things are **necessities** in a society, and **they know it**. That's why they can keep raising prices, because they know people **have to pay it**. 
If you want income equality and equal distribution of wealth, look to those places first. That's where the majority of your paycheck is going towards, is it not?

Yes, but it's still a blockchain...

I don't know why I have to keep saying this, but inflation not the problem we have, it's the **distribution of wealth**. 
Where does most of your paycheck go to? Rent, food, and insurance. Landlords, farmers, insurance companies, and big pharma. Minus one of those (farmers), all of those entities are taking all of our money and needlessly raising the prices every year. **This is the problem of distribution of wealth**. We need a way to regulate these entities. *All of our wealth is going to them.*
When we print money, that money goes into the economy, which goes into our paychecks, then to **them**.
You have a fundamental misunderstanding about bitcoin. We don't bitcoin because of hoarding. We bitcoin for control over our money. When we spend it, how we spend it, whenever we want to spend it, to whom we spend it. No one wants to sit on a pile of money. They want to spend it to have a good life, with some left over for emergencies. This is about freedom, not getting rich. 
Bitcoin is about freedom, but it isn't going to fix our **distribution of wealth** problem. That needs to be solved in another way.

Fractional reserve banking has nothing to do with wealth distribution. It only exists to immediately expand the available total wealth of an economy. 
I think you're barking up the wrong tree. Income equality is important, but we need to fix it by looking at other aspects of the economy, like proportional taxes, tax loopholes, hiding money overseas, money laundering, etc. 
How else are we going to distribute the wealth fairly?
Do you have any suggestions?

That's literally what I'm trying to explain to you. Inflation incentivizes rich people to spend their money and put it into the economy. If we didn't have inflation, then rich people would have no reason to put their money into stocks/real estate since they wouldn't lose any money to inflation. They could just keep it in a pile of cash, and continue to hoard. 
More money in the economy is good. That's why just a little inflation is good. 
Now this doesn't address the issue of income inequality. When that new money is created, we need to be able to distribute it fairly. This is the problem we need to solve.

congrats, you've just invented fractional reserve banking!

Regulations that were made because of bribes to the SEC by pharma companies.

@_date: 2018-04-16 22:54:59
Yes, but there's more incentive to have that money in stocks, bonds, and other assets like real estate in times of inflation.

Isn't the whole point of a small amount of inflation to make sure that super rich people will put their money into the economy like stocks and other assets? A small amount of inflation isn't that bad for people making &lt;$100K, but it's pretty bad for people making millions. Hoarding money in vast quantities stagnates the economy and makes it worse for everyone, no?
I want to make it just like the rest of you guys, but we have to be realistic here. Without inflation, the top 1% of the top 1% will just keep hoarding and keep us all down, increasing income inequality like never before. I'm not saying that a lot of inflation is good, just a little. That's something most economists can agree on.

I agree. I love some of the shitposts that come out of here, but this was the most unfunny shit I've seen since Nam.
