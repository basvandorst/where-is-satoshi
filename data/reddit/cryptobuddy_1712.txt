He is the owner of one of the worlds biggest conglomerates and had been praised for giving his shareholders dream run at stock market since 90’s when there was no internet no mobile phones. His biggest stockholding are still on Apple, IBM and other techs.  He can’t put his shareholders money in something until the world see mainstream acceptance. Even though he personally likes crypto world he can’t publicly state that since he knew his shareholders doesn’t want to risk in something that’s quite amateur. 
Also can anyone guess what’s Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock price is ? Of course I am not talking about supply here but it is currently 1 Berkshire Hathaway class A stock = 20 BTC

Yep there is no fee but the price seems to be little inflated compared to coinbase btc price, hope this gets better.

1) Transfer to Gdax which is Coinbase Exchange so no fee for transfer to Gdax. And then transfer btc from gdax to exchange, no fee again.
2) Transfer ETH from coinbase  to exchange and convert it to btc, this way you can get around with less fee.
Hope this helps

It’s about choice of million dollar per life time or million dollar per decade.

Why do some one has to deposit or withdraw bitcoin right from today when they are launching it on September 23rd ?
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:21:31
10 now . Does it mean 10 bitcoin or 10 contacts?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:42:07
Crazy 8k 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:42:53
Compare alts and btc with their ATH. Both are more are less at the same % of their ATH.  Once ALts Run is over we might see a btc breakout and money might flow into btc again

Next bull run ��‍♀️�� 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:51:29
Don’t jinx it guys we are just getting started, let’s put these when we touch 20k again.

How do they buy ? Since it looks like banks doesn’t let them do so. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:58:35
I think the reason is government is worried about people who hide their money with crypto and doesn’t pay taxes
