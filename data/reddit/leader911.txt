I've tried that before, it only sends an email to the recipient asking him to register on coinbase to finish the transaction :-/

Coinify accepts debit-/credit cards! 
Not sure if the fees are more than coinbase.

Ok, cause I keep getting this error msg "you can send at most 2.500,0000 BTC" 
I have no idea what's supposed to mean :-/

Do you guys recommend blockchain.info's wallet? And what kind of wallet is it actually?

I think you're right. I just changed it to EUR (it was in USD and I live in EU) and it accepted it this time. No error messages. Thanks! 
But apparently I can't receive any BTCs to my coinbase wallet right? Can't see my wallet adress, or at least they don't have this feature :-/

Guys, if I have Bitcoins in my coinbase wallet. Can I send them to another wallet? Or pay someone with it? 
Is there a limit for sending Bitcoins?

all i could find is "request". If thats what you mean I can only enter an email address there which will send an email to the other person (wallet), asking it to register and complete the transaction.
See screenshot:
it says here enter an address, but it doesnt accept anything but an email.
