I think no. Cz coffee guy could not settle his books of accounts as making ( also receiving) payments in bitcoin is said to be not allowed. 
Though the government has not banned it completely. Therefore buying/selling/trading/investing can be done.

Yess... expecting bitcoin price to saor once, bitcoin futures gets listed on CME, world's largest futures exchange... imagine how many investors could easily and  legitimately invest in bitcoin, thus increasing the market cap. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:44:05
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:59:58
thanks buddy!
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:39:48
Why do you think so? If bitcoin futures trading gets started on world's largest derivatives  exchange, wouldn't it attract more investors than today? Won't it attract more heavy investment which inturn would increase it's demand, price and market cap??
What are your views?
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:57:26
Bitcoin mining is consuming a lot of electricity which is not eco-friendly.

exactly. imagine, the government pays the salaries and other expenses in bitcoins from the btc tax collection. Would not that be awesome..
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:48:56
Bitcoin will take time to become stable. As of now people are getting into it to make money. Meanwhile, the bitcoin network will also improve where the transactions will happen in the original 10 minutes time with low fees. Also, when countries like Japan start accept Bitcoin as legal tender
