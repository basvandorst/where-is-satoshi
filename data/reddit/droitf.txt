Actually you can say both bitcoin and bitcoins for plural as well as you can use both coin/coins, dollar/dollars, euro/euros for plural and you would be right. 
E.g. One hundred dollar wine / This wine costs one hundred dollars a bottle.

I am so sick of so called and self proclaimed experts on bitcoin price who try to be smart after the price goes up or down. Especially when they try to predict the bitcoin price in future. I haven't seen anyone with right prediction about the price. People are going crazy with fantasis, like the stupid trime traveller posts. The only thing which is most proabable about the bitcoin is that long term the price goes up because we can see that this was so from the beginning of bitcoin. However is it sure, who know. I don't think that the future is predictable and anybody saying this or that is just a speculator and not an expert on anything.

Are you still a big cryptocurrency ethusiast?

In my opinion the easiest way is to find a BTC ATM and withraw your Bitcoins.

Hopefully one day soon it will be normal to see BTC everywhere, on any cards as the preferred method of payment.

Sure it is!

Unwise. Invest only your own money, don't loan it.

By this logic any other altcoin with the similar or scarse issuance should have some special value only because it is scarse? Bitcoin and Monero for example have completely similar issuance but the price of 1BTC and 1 XMR is so different so there is much more to explaining why something is valuable than only one factor!
