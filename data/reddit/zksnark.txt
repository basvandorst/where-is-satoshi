I was under impression lowest bidders get their money back.

There were multiple companies who were developing SMS based bitcoin payments back when it used to thought of as a payment system before the whole block size controversy.  Smart phones were never necessary.  And yes, most of the world's poor actually do own a cell phone of some type.

Mobile phones are everywhere, and early on when fees were cheaper, there companies creating SMS based bitcoin payment systems for those people.

You know if you start pulling these appeal to authority "ive been here longer than you so I know more" arguments... you have already lost.  
If you really think you have an argument against the poor using bitcoin based on the limited exposure they had and the resulting limited acceptance, you are insane.  For bitcoin to work in a poor low tech country, the populous needs many many years of constant access to extremely low fee transfers and a fairly robust infrastructure system developed around their limited technology.  Since this was even close to a reality before the fees became insane, you can't even begin to say that it didn't work because of other reasons.  
If lightning works without losing a bunch of people money, then maybe bitcoin can start to pull actual use cases back, but I am pretty sure that like every other piece of software in the world, there will be bugs discovered that might loose some people a lot of money while it is growing up.  By the time lightening gets its kinks worked out, it will likely be too late.

$1 is not an acceptable fee for 90% of the people who really need bitcoin.  The poor an unbanked make only $2 a day in many parts of the world.

You are full of it man.  The reason 3rd world countries didn't get into bitcoin isn't because they didn't want to or had other priorities.  It was because they were priced out of the market.  Plain and simple.  Nobody ever said anything is free, but a billion .1 cent fees adds up to a lot and serves a lot more people than a couple thousand high fee transactions per block.  Pricing use cases out of bitcoin was never a good idea.  Justifying it by claiming there wasn't money in that model is an even worse idea.

Think about what properties of bitcoin make it awesome.  The fact that it is peer to peer and not censorable is what people who have despotic governments need.  The fact that it is not inflationary is something that everyone needs, but moreso people who live in countries who's governments are willing to debase their currencies. The fact that it used to be cheap to send is what people who are willing to take risks to send money back to their families in other countries need or people who are trying to escape an area with their wealth need.  The fact that it is not counterfeitable is again something that everyone needs, but is especially important to someone who makes the equivilent to $3 a day.  A counterfeit payment to someone like that is devastating, whereas to me, I'd just throw it away and get over it. 
There are plenty more of these use cases which would really benefit the poor that bitcoin was serving and still could serve.  I think it needs sub penny fees for this to be practical though.

Compare that to the loss they face when their currency is debased or stolen from them by their governments.  People now in Venezuela would 100% take the somewhat extreme volatility over their own currency.
I haven't had a bank account since 2013 and I have been just fine with bitcoin's up's and downs.

Man, I needed those this past semester!

I have about 2 weeks of time on my hands before summer classes!

I think that these moronic plans are probably gonna be everywhere before long.  This is the land of the free after all, so the government has to get in every ones business. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:51:57
Too man bitcoin for me!
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:30:24
Doesn't hurt.

you mean zkSNARK's?

I think it is obvious, and many others know it is obvious, but who is going to do something that changes the situation in NY?  That is what needs to occur.  What exactly can we do, and how do we do it?  We should figure this out.
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:21:18
You think that is enough?  I doubt that New York cares if the businesses leave.  As long as there are businesses willing to deal with it, New York could care less if some or even most leave.

You don't know when to stop!
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:19:53
Nothing really.  Just that I am impressed by your perpetuation of this giving for so long.  It's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:10:37
You are a kind soul.  Thanks for doing this.  This is the kind of public face bitcoin deserves.

Wonder how many changetip / tip posts are part of those 1145?
Maybe those don't count?

I hope this scumbag disappears.  I'm tired of hearing about him.

How do you target shareholders if the company is designed to not keep records or provide that information?
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:43:18
It could be implied that they actually already had everything they needed against everyone they thought it was possible to get.
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:13:35
Interesting.  I think I made it.
