had 100. got hacked on mt gox. fuck keeping money on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:47:20
What? This is old bro. Fake news.
EDIT: I'm retarded and didn't read. Yah he was driving the price up for himself so he could sell off some bitcoins at a higher price, that's what I personally think. Then once a drop happens buy more. Which happened as he probably planned. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:30:25
OMG coin is pretty good right now and is on the up. So is monero and ripple. But don't take my advice. That's a lot of money, do your research and invest your money how you want to not how others tell you. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:43:10
who says I waited till 6k. hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:05:21
I'm probably just going to Hodl, I was just thinking about it but the more I think about the more I thinks its a bad idea aswell haha.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:53:25
yeah ur right. but if you do buy at market price their is a small fee. just a disclaimer.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:55:31
That's awesome that there no fees. And cool thanks for the answer, that's not horrible timing. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:17:00
I know what I'm doing. When did I ever say I didn't know what I was doing. MY plan is to have 1 bitcoin at the end of two months...Called investing. Your just a troll ass bitch. If I didn't know what I was doing I would have kept my money in an exchange. Also not split my bitcoin cash and sell it at its peak, oh and then I would keep my bitcoin in an exchange when segwit2x happens and not sell off those coins either. Oh and I strictly only buy high and sell low.. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:16:22
But yah I was right 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:35:45
Everyone disagreeing literally did not understand the video. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:57:10
better than I could ever explain it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:48:35
Actually I profited around $2100 from selling some of my bitcoins to receive some of my profit at 7380 and bought back in at 6700
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:55:36
I literally have only been buying on dips. And was lucky enough to catch this $600 dip. Feels good when you time it just right and get more bitcoin for your buck. Just bought at 7,070 and instantly made profit!
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:41:31
GDAX aka coinbase. Buy with a limit buy and there is almost zero fee and buy at the price you want (aka lowest trading price). Coinbase exchange rate is based off of gdax but coinbase does add to it on the coinbase website. 
Edit: as  said their is zero fee.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:30:36
I know I'm just frustrated I didn't sell at 7900 and buy back in now . Still holding 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:56:03
Automated clearing house 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:58:48
Large investors of bitcoin were dumping their bitcoin for profits at low prices causing the price to sink.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:58:24
I said I'm pissed I didn't sell at 7900 and buy back in, I bought at 3,600
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:50:34
Right! Theres not much info on withdrawing from GDAX, only coinbase. I know there the same company but like do they process different with time and fees?? Why is their no info on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:35:04
Every fork is an attack to bitcoin. I agree. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:24:03
I know its value and I know how block chain works and how the technology is our future. Ive been watching bitcoin since its inception..i just wasn't ready to invest, now I have seen its value increase thousand fold. So you clearly have no clue what I know.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:19:01
Soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:31
Too many sell walls not enough buy walls. Support will be around 6500
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:16:28
For real lol. If you don't think the best coders are behind bitcoin your fucking retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:43:31
Whose Pete 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:49:36
bitcoin is meant to be a store of value. Once you can use it with large retailers it will be de-valued in the end. Its like gold, its a finite resource and when you don't spend it, it becomes more valuable. Bitcoin is modeled after gold. At first it was easy to mine but now its getting harder and more expensive to mine, just like gold. Keep your bitcoin, and try not to spend it.

ur trezors telling you to hodl. goto a library?
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:55:59
watch this video please.  . It gives a great explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:24:28
I simply wanted to see if others do the same, and they do. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:57:44
What u got like .02 bitcoins hahahaaa 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:42:29
now that the whales are done taking their profits its rising very fast =)
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:19:14
Haha I cant buy Gucci with bitcoin, buying some stuff with bitcoin seems to be a challenge
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:43:24
I didn't I just sent it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:38:30
how did it work
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:10:07
please watch the video. Its just my theory but I do believe blockchain and bitcoin were made to create stores of value, maybe other applications can be used to trade money to retailers but there is a reason there only 21 million bitcoins and it works as a great store of value. I personally think volatility of bitcoin can not be in favor of using it at retailers.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:40
I think it'll keep dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:26:45
This is just a guess and my opinion, people tend to need money near holidays, not buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:17:29
I want to get out at 150% ROI on $1,800. Id say that's a good number. 4 grand would be nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:35:20
Interesting and makes sense. Everyday at I'm starting to think it's a bubble more and more. If it keeps decreasing at this rate it's going to drop very low. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:30:52
Also are you looking for a short term profit or long term profit?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:45:42
I'd say ripple, bitcoin, litecoin and etherum for long term gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:34:36
no it will not. Its market cap would have to grow tremendously. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:14:22
I said it in my original comment retard. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:58:17
you do not want this to be faster because than it is cheaper to mine which in return makes it less powerful.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:44:00
feel ya. but its market cap says other wise. being 10 billon more than goldman sachs
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:45:53
no segwit is bullshit. just a copy cat of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:25:48
Okay just watch it keep dropping, people are getting out of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:40:12
That's sweet how much 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:02:11
yah they need to buy lambos for their kids
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:45:20
yes. It works.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:19:54
Don't buy from coinbase. By from gdax (coinbase exchange). Your buying at a higher price and large fees. Use a limit buy on gdax to get zero fees and buy at a lower price. Nice though, welcome. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:48:39
HODL and then Sell to Korea lol
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:59:49
that's not GODLY!
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:09:06
It was a joke, y'all took it serious. So, yes...I deleted it. But I didn't mean it when I said fuck you, just messing around. Just HODL, okay, good?, got it? Great.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:52:06
Haha i feel you! I just don't wana have to work when im 40.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:49:24
I'm just planning for the future to make it rain at the strip club with bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:29:40
inboard motor. He would be fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:26:00
this guy is dumb! haha jk man, this is awesome though. its reached its All time high. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:48:00
Lmfao that made me actually laugh
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:32:35
lol watch how fast it will rise in the next 24 hours...im saying 6,500. I hope I just bought at 5,648 =) 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:25:28
I just don't trust the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:26:20
Exactly, not saying its 100% happening but just a theory. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:19:36
RemindMe! [65 years] [“Buys car”].
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:31:43
pun: HODL GODL
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:08:50
so 1 point = 1 dollar.
and the lambo is listed at 160,000,000 points.
160,000,000 million dollars for a lambo. 
Seems reasonable. wtf is this shit?
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:45:32
chill out man. don't burst a blood vessel
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:56:41
No !! we are at block 491382, the fork occurs at block 491407
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:47:45
I'm feeling like its a good choice. So you have to go with your gut. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:36:01
When you mine the last bitcoin know to man kind, you instantly are the boss.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:37:57
The deep web...and I mean deep web...use to be a wallet for a lot of people. Hundreds of millions were lost due to just hackers and exit scams. What makes you think a exchange wont pull an exit scam and steal billions of dollars from some people that don't even know what bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:42:59
These exchanges are banks too though except you cant find some of these people that run these exchanges. I agree though, time will tell. For now HODL, as I'm interested to see what happens. I have half a bitcoin, I'm hoping the price increase is just because bitcoin is awesome.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:31:57
Potentially both if you really think about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:59:07
right back at you, fuck you!
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:23:47
depends how many fake orders haha
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:05:12
Yes, because we have ATHs everyday which is crazy at this point. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:22:35
buy buy buy
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:00:51
its not tanking, its revealing its true current value. Market Correction.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:05:31
Good for you that's awesome. We are doing the same thing. Looks like you made out well!
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:18:51
I know this may be a bad comparison. But I use my exodus wallet as a savings account expect I gain crazy interest !
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:57:44
The fork will happen today or October 24th not on the 25th. Check the block height on blockchain.info and bitcoins golds website for yourself!!! Secure your keys right now! We are at block 491382 only 25 more blocks to go!! Secure your keys!
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:23:06
for sure
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:10:53
also will my BTG be on my BTC private key and public key? Sorry Just kind of confusing.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:28:19
Just to clarify, I just don't trust keeping my bought coins in the exchange, I have no problem buying them from places like coinbase/gdax. So yes agreed 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:26:36
We all did
