That would be priceless
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:19:20
That's the theory that makes most sense to me

How about the massive amount of energy and the carbon footprint from mining lithium used in electric car batteries?

People get lambo in their head here every time we breach 7k

That's the anger/denial phase
We're still in it heading towards depression

The man who bought at 18k
And sold at 3k

He is FUCKED if he doesn't have those already 
@_date: 2018-11-01 04:24:53
 This is a market cycle. This is when you buy. It probably won't go under 5k. Either way it's going to rebound sooner or later. Just look at how long it took the USA to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. 
Gartner cycle I believe is the chart. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:30:49
Well in my opinion we need trolls like you so we can sit back and think. I'm pretty sure you can use BTC in more places than gold though, and gold is pretty valid as money. 
Your points aren't completely invalid though.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:46:07
He sold at 9k

This is a good thing tbh. I like that it's a stablecoin.
More value as a store of value. Keeps get rich quick people out of the picture [at least until the next run]
@_date: 2019-01-03 00:45:57
Great fucking tweet bro
@_date: 2019-01-03 00:40:59
Big if true.
Great fucking tweet though
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:49:50
I agree with this guy 200%
Basically he says that the technology and coins and alts would be around a long long way. This is an international shift in currency and transfer. Big companies with international money transfer will happen this way - no bank holding money or third man. As for people not choosing crypto in case of a stock market crash is unsure at best. It has its technology, improving securuty, transaction is simple. 
This is long term. Just wait until the whales hodl 
These original coins 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:55:19
Can't eat gold either. Families still but that. There is a lot of price manipulation going on right now just be patient until the financial institutions and business (especially international) see how they can but when crypto hits a low
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:23:14
One step towards progress
@_date: 2018-11-01 04:22:05
Waiting for the economy to crash just to invest lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:22:24
Can't use gold  either but people invest in that. Bitcoin and other coins hufest kicker because it is a limited supply. Investors fucked Bitcoin but the tech that BC and things like ETH are built on isn't going away 
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:23:15
I remember when they were 20 each... should've jumped on that train earlier

I don't like what you're saying, but you're not wrong. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:46:24
I seen something on RT a long time ago which showed people in Malaysia lined up to buy gold. Maybe Malaysians just trust crypto and gold over their own currency. Or like diverse assets. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:34:48
That's awesome. When businesses see competition outdoing them even in a niche market they will adapt
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:03:47
The only thing I know about Venezuela is that they are the main ones farming gold on OSRS. I feel like miners get in trouble because they use too much power
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:57:48
I thought it was supposed to be like 2040 or something more like that?  But tbh 2140 does sound more realistic I guess.
This is why I post and lurk. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:12:45
This guy knows what's up. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:31:17
Exactly.  I agree with this post so much. I think we'll see that effect several times over before all bitcoin is mined and it skyrockets
Hodl.

This post gives me hope. Maybe I, too, will be a free man
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:45:56
Is crypto getting to be well known there?  Like among middle class people
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:28:09
I think when everyone is completely P2P and exchanges are a niche that it will help the problem. Not solve it but it helps. Exchanges are basically controlling the market at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:33:00
I've seen businesses online PREFER crypto offering incentives  (discounts) for using it. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:19:06
Lawyer tf up then
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:56:15
Still though there's all kinds of reasons not to let people know how much btc you got, even on Reddit.
Enough bad luck and social engineering can put you in danger. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:23:14
The thing is, there's even discussion in the meme posts. Just look at this thread
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:55:17
I mean there's thousands of intranets, p2p networks, tor network
Or do you mean IPv4/IPv6 ?
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:28:38
The real motivator here. 
Also if you don't have your own bitcoin in your own storage, are you really enjoying the technology to the fullest?
So two motivators here
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:34:38
Second this. Most of r/netsec is more paranoid than someone up for 7 days on a meth fueled binge
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:21:25
Then what? They DDoS him? Port scan him?  Get his general location and ISP?
Even if he gets hacked,  which is highly unlikely,  his BTC is most likely in cold storage by then. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:39:41
 Apparently the original Pokemon protagonist was "Satoshi" according to an above poster
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:37:49
I mean if you mean literally attacking him physically your IP would *at most* give away your city and state. 
Mine isn't even remotely close, my IP says that I'm in another state 50 miles away. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:38:52
I'm just gonna post this, I do not believe bitcoin was made by a single person. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:13:55
People here never cease to amaze. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:24:04
I recommend seeing a therapist. I'm totally pro btc, but you know,  it's a pretty uncertain future right now
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:40:36
Agreed. I think he was over sentenced to be an example but he's no hero and he's not innocent
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:22:08
I hope that comment got gold
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:06:13
**Little** is the key
I think we're near the bottom
But i said that at 6k.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:05:30
I thought it was Secret Service or some other agency?
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:33:23
He's joking.
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:42:26
I fucking love this response.  Thank you,  i will use this in the near future
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:07:11
I'm ok with investing in BTC. I wouldn't be here if i wasn't. I like to think we're hitting bottom to be honest. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:55:50
I'm with you. It reeks of sketchy even if it seems innocent. That's how most scams start
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:39:02
Yeah i don't think facilitating the sale of drugs like fentanyl is a good thing. 
I'm cool with nearly all drugs, but not drugs that can kill you in doses that are micro grams. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:25:14
Yep. It was believed to be fraudulent to begin with.
