If government regulates prices and scrutinizes bitcoin and stops the free market it will no longer be anarchy.
How are you going to force someone who bought and stored offline, say a big sum like 10,000 bitcoins to give their share in taxes for the universal basic income? Centralize the block chain? That's why a lot of people hate bitcoin cash isn't it?
Trace them back whenever they make any purchase and take it authoritarian like? 
 I mean why wouldn't I just go back to trading physical goods on the black market, if there is a hierarchal will being imposed on me with a microscope over the internet? Like a drug dealer, would go back to trading with physical currency. That could be a good idea but I can't see how it would work. I doubt the people that trade bitcoin want that.
How do you plan to go about developing that system using bitcoin, without ruining the reason people are drawn to it?

If you look at the big picture. They are right. Well we have a couple extra new 'rich' people. (Who do not equate with people like warren buffet still). The people who have gotten the most out of bitcoin are the people with capital, like how the Rothschild starting buying up bitcoin. If you don't have capital, you can't make capital. Early adopters have made a lot of money off bitcoin. There are also a lot  (And they outweigh the early in volume) small investors from 11-18k that have gotten burned. For someone to make money and realize it, someone has to lose money.

You obviously don't understand what anarcho capitalism is. lol. 


This is the nature of bitcoin ownership, it's a free market, which highlights self ownership and having one's own property, aka you can buy and own those things forever, you can be your own boss with bitcoin, and trade your goods using it, for whatever you like. No one can stop you charging x amount of bitcoin for y thing, because it's decentralized and unregulated(Currently). I'm sure you'll nuance and disregard meanings to fit it to whatever dream revolution you want though. Because that's all you ever do when ever I see you. I'm out, bye.
