For bigger income, with less maintainance fees choose p2pool.
If you sell 50 gh from ghash, you can byu one ant s1 - and it consumes 15€/ month with power when pencil modded to 150gh.

How to connect my miner to a p2pool node and start mining? First choose a good node, you can change anytime without loosing anything 
Then just
cgminer -o pooip -u walletaddress -p anything will do
Serious miners put up their own node - its easy too

"STEP 1- CHANGE THE MINING SOFTWARE TO MAKE P2POOL AS EASY AS ANY OTHER POOL."
cgminer -o nearest p2pool -u yourbtcwalletaddress -p any
feel free to use few at any time and make your choice with results.
While youre running cgminer or whatelse try to learn how to install bitcoind (aptget or emerge if youre using gentoo)  and download p2pool to your computer, go to that folder, in linux cd p2pool - then you can type make and it installs all depedencies.. Theres plenty of users in forum if you get in trouble..
rpcallowip=192.168.0.* or whatever is your lan
fire up p2pool nohup python run_p2pool.py --give-author 5 -f 0 -a walletaddress rpcuser rpcpassword/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;

P2pool with namecoin is no problem with gentoo, but ixcoin-qt seems to need some old boost. Cant compile it here with boost-1.55-r1 installed, and the headles seems to loose peers allthe time. Merged mining those two is actually like solomining...

Theres a good list of p2pool nodes too -

Why are miners so stupid? Why not use brains and split power with multiple pools? Are eveyone from russia?
