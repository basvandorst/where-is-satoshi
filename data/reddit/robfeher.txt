That's not what I'm saying though and it's almost like you're ignoring me. I'm not talking about direct price manipulation. Any crypto with people personally holding their assets is vulnerable to the people's weaknesses. Like it or not, most people will buy / sell based on emotion, and if they read a couple of news articles about how much bitcoin is tanking (whether or not it's true), they will sell. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

You're missing the point he's making though. They can't own your assets but they absolutely do have influence on how much your assets are worth.

How is this a conspiracy? I never said it's specific to crypto, and I agree with you - it's the same issue with stocks or any assets. People sell when other people sell, and bad news can create an avalanche of collapse. This happened on a small scale with the Dimon / China stories from last year. I think bitcoin / blockchain holds a lot of potential, but it would be unwise to ignore its weaknesses.

Touché :)

I mean... bitcoin isn't as decentralized today as you imply, but either way, I think you underestimate the power of a few well placed media stories to sow some FUD. It's easy enough to make the prices tank for a few days with the right resources.

Exclusively serving children with cancer, Camp Oochigeas is an entirely volunteer-run and completely free overnight camp that offers onsite chemotherapy IV treatment and blood transfusions. They are an incredible group of people that have a tangible impact on children who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend camp.
I know it's not related to bitcoin / crypto but I couldn't think of a more selfless and deserving group.
