It sounds like you're investing on something you deeply believe in. Even if you lose some money, you've trusted yourself. and there may be nothing more important than that. 
One practical thought: Tax planning. If it goes up, it's worth putting in some work to optimize the tax treatment. If you want to pay less $$$ to the gov't, planning can help. Some of it is very simple: Buy. Hold for more than 12mos so that any profits are treated as long term gains. 
I've seen too many people who made huge paper profits but didn't think about taxes until it was time to file. and then needed to write much bigger checks than they would have if they'd planned for taxes in advance. 
Best of luck!

often in life it's a battle between ugly and uglier. and that might be what happens here. 
I do agree that clean consensus among the developers, the way it's been done for most (all?) of the history of bitcoin, is the best way forward here. And I hope that's what happens. 
But if they can't agree and that continued disagreement starts endangering the network. then it becomes an ugly contest.

but people will run the code they want.
that's the nature of freedom. 
people can do what they want. What are you suggesting as an alternative? 
In a properly incentivized system people will run code that benefits themselves and the community. So far people in bitcoin have generally chosen to run the same software. but looks at a list of the software running on nodes - it's not all the same. it's the same enough. but people can start running XT. or some old version of bitcoin core. or a cracked fork of iOS. 
that's just the way it is. 
Incentives are what keep people in the lanes. and there will likely be times when key players interests will be sufficiently conflicted that we'll have a rough (or rougher) code transition than what we've seen in the past. I think Bitcoin is robust enough to withstand that - I don't welcome it, but if it happens, bitcoin will survive. 
And existence is a very large playground. I doubt this is a One Coin to Rule Them All kind of universe. People can go create some other coin if they want. More power to them. I might like that one too :)
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:50:07
To start: hard to know.
But this list is useful - 
Some of the top 20 can't be right anymore. But let's say a good portion (I calculated 3M-3.5M) is still held by those ~20. 
Then say the next 80 (20-100) own an average of 5,000 coins each. That's another 400k. 
And a good chunk is lost forever: 200k? 1M? Here's an effort to track lost coins ( Let's be conservative and say 200k. 
So we're at 4M coins either lost of held by the top 100. Leaving 11M for the rest of us. 
No idea where to take it from there.

Two IFs:
1. If the Grexit happens
2. If a rise in the price of bitcoin roughly coincides with the Grexit.
then, there does seem like an opportunity to drive some of those withdrawn Euros into bitcoin holdings. 
There are some practical issues, like what do you do with bags full of Euros? Are you going to show up at a Bulgarian bank with 100k in euros? or drive to London? that aspect would need to be solved. but if that gets figured out, i think this could be interesting

I would gladly pay more in fees for the features of Bitcoin over the existing alternatives. $0.50/tx seems ok to me for on the block transactions. set up other channels or sidechains for cheaper payments. 
High value, high priority TXs are what the main chain should be about. And even at $0.50/tx (and no % fee) you're still beating most of the existing offerings by a wide margin in terms of cost and settlement time. (Not to mention positive political externalities). 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:09:57
It's true. We don't know what the final split would be if an XT vs. Core kind of scenario played out in the real world. 
Question: When does the ratio get dangerous to the future of 'bitcoin'? 
99 adoption w/ 1% dissenting?
And, if we hit 75% how likely is it that we get to 76%? and then 77%? The pressure on the holdouts would seem to build exponentially, leaving only those with the deepest ideologically entrenched positions. I agree that those people do exist but do they matter much? Even people like Amir have proven to be driven by pragmatics (see the Wikileaks donation story from Digital Gold) and I suspect many people currently registered as dissenters would switch over when faced with the reality of a consensus avalanche. 
I bet there's some game theory analysis that would back up the idea of a Consensus Avalanche, thus making the 'dangerous split ratio' scenario not very likely in practice. 
If someone knows of relevant research pls post :)

Masters has proposed different types of ledgers for different situations. What is wrong with people choosing which kind of ledger they want to use? There's a strong libertarian vibe in this sub, but if someone freely chooses to use a centralized ledger, then people start throwing rotten tomatoes. 
Better I suppose to let r/bitcoin choose which kinds of ledgers people should have access to and which should not be allowed. It's like outlawing intranets. and only allowing public networks (obv stupid). 
The logical inconsistency is painful. It's worse than LA traffic. 
Here's the bottom line: Decentral isn't always better. It's that fucking simple. 
And to the extent it is better, bitcoin (or an analogue) will win. And anyone who wants bitcoin to win, do something about it. Start working to create that future. 
but all this whining about other blockchains - ugh, please slap yourself in the face for me and just stop.

true, any buy pressure is felt. But there are definitely ways of structuring the buys to minimize the impact those pressures have on price. 
this is very well known in other markets. Look at someone like Icahn. He'll buy shares through many different legal entities and spread the buying across many brokers so that he's not giving away his position. If he telegraphed his intention to buy a major stake in a company, then the price would immediately go up. So he structures the purchases in a way so as not to tip everyone off (until required by disclosure laws or when it suits his interests).
If there are people or organizations accumulating large positions in bitcoin it's a safe bet they have a base level of sophistication to actively manage their purchases so as not to spark a bull run. or allow a collapse. 
Last thought: We've been in a very tight trading range recently. There are only 4 other periods in the history of bitcoin when we've traded below 2% volatility (btcvol.info) for an extended period (2+ days) and in three of those we saw 100%+ gains shortly after we entered the non-volatile period. 
I wouldn't be surprised if there's an effort by some to purposefully keep the price in this range. It's a relatively thin market and still easy to push around if you've got some weight. At some point we'll break out of this trading range, hopefully to the upside...

But avg tx size is less than 1kb.
That being the case, the relevant number is then transaction fees for 10MB or bigger blocks.  
at 10MB the chart says 0.0025 @ 25BTC mining reward. So... that's $0.58 at current prices. At the next halving it'd be just over a quarter. 
re network effects, fewer users than what? Fewer users than some imaginary and financially unsustainable unicorn product? Or fewer users than an actual competitor product in the relevant market? Using the $0.25-0.50 fees Bitcoin still beats existing payment platforms on almost every count AND those fees don't include the ability to use lightning networks and other methods for settling micropayments or other tx with even lower fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:20:43
this is so true. people who are exceptionally well qualified are almost always conflicted. 
The key, with respect to managing conflicts of interest, is transparency. And the conflict raised here is already well known. It's fine to point it out again, but just acknowledging the existence of the conflict doesn't resolve the debate or any particular element of the debate. 
It may be preferable to to have all the core devs to be positioned more like Gavin is, above the fray. But even this arrangement is accompanied by a different sort of concern, where independence can turn into disconnection. 
And, as a practical matter, the group of core devs aren't likely to change their professional allegiances anytime soon...
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:44:20
Commit access means little. It's hardly even part of the formal consensus mechanism imo. 
Devs are going to disagree. That's fine. As Wladimir said, "As a developer I work on improving the technical aspects and fixing bugs, not on 'governing' it."
This idea that developers are a key governance mechanism is flawed. That's not even their role given the way Satoshi set up the system - miners, nodes and other system players decide what code to run, what coins are 'real' bticoins. 
Devs can argue all they want and it won't matter much. At some point, if enough miners, nodes, exchanges and users want to move over to a version of bitcoin with a larger blocksize they won't care what a few devs want - they'll run the code they want. They'll just start doing it. And the process of switching, once the tipping point is passed, should eventually turn into a full stampede toward perfect consensus (or close enough - there may be some outlier holdouts who refuse to cross the bridge. And to them I say, Farewell)

wrong with respect to price.
and wrong w/ respect to adoption.
bitcoin has ~5M users right now. so 11M is significant. even if only a small portion of greeks start using bitcoin. 
there could be an important speculative/price effect if it there was a meme going around that Greeks were turning to bitcoin in some way. that story has proven popular in mainstream media (it got picked up w/o a shred of supporting evidence a couple weeks ago). And in a thinly traded market, that's enough.
Re adoption, Greece could be a proving ground for adoption in a chaotic economic environment. Serving as a model for other countries. Even 50k new users could be a significant addition given where Greece is economically and the fact that bitcoin is still at such an early stage.

wow. such rhetoric.
over what exactly....? That she played a key role in creating credit default swaps? 
Here's my main point: There's a lot of name calling on this sub and not enough substance to back it up. 
I don't think the case has been made that she's an economic terrorist. She *is* a financial innovator creating new tools (similar to what you're trying to do at Augur). She was at JPM for 20+ years. And yes she created CDS. but the idea that these --people-- are all devils does not serve us well (bcs we're no angels).
I just don't think we create anything of value when we engage an issue this way. 
If you meet Blythe at some point, are you going to walk up to her and throw paint on her and scream that she's a financial terrorist like you are doing here? Let's give a person the same respect we would if they were here in person (and she may very well be). 
here's my take: She's an inventor. an entrepreneur. and someone to be reckoned with. If you think she's creating the equivalent of Financial WMD, then don't waste your time screaming 'Terrorist' here. Start working to make sure the dangerous tools you think she's creating get the scrutiny needed to 'protect' the public.
And if you're not sure what she's working on, maybe withhold judgment until you know more. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:46:48
this idea that everything that is public knowledge is "priced in" - basically the efficient markets hypothesis - is just that, a *hypothesis*. 
It's interesting stuff and there's some impressive support in favor of some version of the EMH being true, but it's still very much an open question as to how EMH applies to mainstream markets, what edges cases there might be, etc... 
So, this debate over whether it's priced in or not is like pushing a string. Some people are going to come to the table believing in EMH. and some don't. But I doubt that reddit is the place where we'll see EMH definitively proven to be true/false. 
Believe what you want and place your bets accordingly.

Every product or service has constraints. My point is that the constraints of bitcoin need to be measured against the constraints of other market options. Bcs one way to increase user base is to offer a comparable service at lower cost or improved on net overall.

Maybe there's been a level of imprecision (at least from Szabo's perspective) when asking Nick about whether he is Satoshi or not. If Satoshi was more than one person and he was part of that group that might allow for a truthful flat denial to the question, "Are you Satoshi?"

Yes, the private key issue is a challenge. But coins have been issued with tamper-proof/resistant seals over the private keys and a set of production controls in place. 
Those coins work for what they're designed for. And I think BitBills would work too. I'd have concerns about storing 100 coins on a BitBill with the tamper-proof approach, but $10 or even $500 would be ok with me IF the production protocols and the team running the show are sufficiently trustworthy. 
It's a risk management issue - not fully trustless (but that's not always the goal) and would work within the domain it was designed for: a physical instantiation of bitcion (a bearer bond) that could be used for exchange and a way to introduce new users to bitcoin. And as a collectible I suppose. The collectible market is dominated by metal coins. Seems to me that there's some room for a well done bitcoin banknote

This kind of analysis is useful. 
But, to not include a variable that accounts for new customers is a mistake. 
That's the bottom line. 
And the question of 'how many new customers will I get' is the hardest thing to predict. The other variables are easy, just fill in the blank with hourly pay, number of employees, etc... But number of new customers is harder to figure out.
You ask, "Are brick and mortar business expanding their customer base by accepting bitcoin?"
Just because you don't know the answer doesn't mean it's right to ignore this variable and leave it out of the equation. And my expectation is that you *will* get new customers in the form of bitcoin fans who want to support businesses that accept bitcoin. The % of local bitcoiners who are already customers of yours is probably pretty low. Maybe 0.  So every bitcoin customer may be a new customer...
Post should be updated and the 'new customer' variable should be added.

the problem isn't Jeff being cheap, it's the lack of an easy way for people add to the bounty. 
There starts to be a coordination problem (how are payments triggered). and an arbitration problem (when are payments triggered).
Maybe there could be a conditional changetip approach: where if some condition is met (like /jgarzik posting "UI fix complete, pay bounty") that automatically triggers the release of funds from all those who pledged. 
It could be time constrained too. W/ a light weight multi-sig even (where both /itsjoeco and /jgarzik have to post the same message). 
In the spirit of bounties, I'll offer a $50 bounty to whoever builds this... Feel free to pile on.

Moore's law is not the law you're after, it's Koomey's Law. 
Moore's law is the fifth paradigm to bring exponential growth to machine-based computing (electro-mechanical, relay, vacuum tube, integrated circuit- per Kurzweil). Moore's law is about the transistor density of integrated circuits doubling every two years. While this trend may have implications regarding energy efficiency, Moore's law isn't focused on that issue. 
You're after Koomey's law, which captures the trend of exponentially increasing energy efficiency, specifically that the number of computations per joule of energy doubles approximately every 18 months. Pretty nuts actually, "If a MacBook Air Were as Inefficient as a 1991 Computer, the Battery Would Last 2.5 Seconds". More on Koomey here -

props to Lawsky. There is no question that he likes bitcoin. and in a world filled with deeply misinformed people, he's helping to push our cause forward - this video is clear evidence of that. 
Overall, given the reality of the total situation, the bitcoin regs couldn't be any better than the ones proposed by Lawsky and NYDFS. and they could have been a lot worse.

Agreed. Clarification is in order. 
The guidance of the community rules is quite broad, the use of modifiers like "usually" and "mostly" implies a degree of openness ("articles that don't contain 'bitcoin' are *usually* off-topic" and "submissions that are *mostly* about some other crypto belong elsewhere").
The normal approach in this forums feels close to anything goes,. And I like that. Voting wins. I see all kinds of postings that are either highly repetitive (Dell. Dell. Dell. Dell. Did you hear about Dell...?) or are at least as unrelated to bitcoin as ethereum. And I've read about ethereum in r/bitcoin many times before and it felt appropriate to find those pieces here. 
So why the change? Why suddenly target ethereum posts for removal on a day when there's big ethereum news?
It's weird. I don't like it. It deserves some explanation, certainly more than the out of hand dismissal given in the post by Here's my take: Bitcoin is a currency and a protocol. It's the genesis of all blockchain-related tech. As such major developments in blockchain tech should be posted here. And Ethereum could represent a major advance in blockchain tech, this makes it something that is worth following. and worth following here - on r/bitcoin.

It's fine to educate people on the potential downsides of spec work, but it's not obvious that it hurts the industry - that's a hugely speculative claim given all the variables at play. 
What is the alternative in a situation like this? Where you just want one thing done? I get how this challenges the shape of an existing industry, but it's not clear that the industry or society at large is better off committing to a NoSpec approach (at least not in the absence of a solution to situations like this)

well, by that metric, if every presentation is OK, then it was (tautologically) OK.
but that is (obv) an absurd metric, one that even you don't really use. There's a quality spectrum - the vast majority of presentations may be OK, some are actually great. and some are bad. This one was pretty down in the bad end of the spectrum, why are people sticking their heads in the sand on this instead of owning it and committing to doing better?
Bottom line: The presentation did not go well. To say otherwise is to miss a learning opportunity. As it stands the BTC community lost a chance to positively frame bitcoin to 5k people in the payments industry. That's a relatively big deal.

this is the right answer. 
bitcoin requires miners (or some way to issue new blocks and secure the chain)
miners need to be incentivized
right now they are well paid (overpaid?) via block rewards
we're going to have to find an equilibrium between diminishing block rewards, mining fees, blockchain security and the number of transactions. 
solvable. but let's not pretend that this isn't a real issue. it is. and it needs to be addressed at some point in order for bitcoin to scale...

Thank you Marc! 
great PR. this is the message that should be going out about bitcoin. the judo-counter move to SR. and in reality, he's right. and not right (and he knows this). 
Right: bitcoin can be more transparent than cash. most users will, at least initially, use bitcoin in this kind of ultra-transparent way. 
Not right: the door to a new era of privacy and freedom is being opened. dark wallet and zerocash are 0.1 versions of blockchain-based privacy protection / digital freedom. Bitcoin and its blockchain powered descendants will make high-powered crypto easy to use and ubiquitous (finally).
People will have a choice, they can live in a digital world without compromise and choose to have privacy/freedom or to be transparent. Over time I think people will increasingly choose freedom. 
But by framing it the way he does, Marc helps get bitcoin established sooner, avoiding an early crackdown while the user base expands and expands and expands. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:30:59
your argument only works as a tautology. which then reduces its truth value - all bachelors are married.
but it's not actually tautological because there are tons of networking protocols (real and theoretical), so bitcoin could ride on top of any of those. or on top of morse code. 
so... no, TCP/IP is not greater than Bitcoin, at least not for the reason you state.

It sounds like this is *not* simple to integrate into bitcoin. Technical and political challenges.

I'm on the verge of buying more, but would have a higher level of confidence in this chart if Rainbow Dash were shown leading with both front legs (this was the form that allowed her to achieve 'Sonic Rainboom' and save both Rarity and the Wonderbolts). 
While practicing she only put one leg forward and, as you would expect, was not able to achieve Sonic Rainboom. In this chart she is just standing still, which makes me think this current trend might be an Elliott Wave (wave 3), and she'd certainly need both legs forward to avoid a full retrace down to Wave 1. 
Which would suck for longs.

First: Thank you for all the good work you've done in this space. Very excited about the COIN ETF. That will be *HUGE*
Second: The presentation delivery needs work. Public speaking is not easy, esp on a big stage. Proper prep is critical - I recommend bringing in someone from the TED team to help dial in the next presentation - both the content and the delivery. Even if it costs $25k. You two have the potential to be a critical force in the next stage of bitcoin's evolution. If you nail the public speaking aspect, you could be showing up at every fintech conference and become one of the top voices of bitcoin, powering us forward. 
The Money 20/20 talk was definitely a missed opportunity. I was in the audience and people were streaming out after just 2min in. and they just kept leaving. I was walking back to my room (and had my bitcoin-related badge off at this point) and a random guy came up to me and said it was the worst keynote he'd ever seen. I'm not trying to be mean, but that was the reality of it. This has to be recognized if we're to learn from this (not just the Winklevii, but anyone who has the opportunity to speak on bitcoin - we all have a responsibility to represent our beloved BTC well).

love this idea - 500 bits
one alternative: define eras by the number of coins minted. every 500k coins = an era. Or # of users. perhaps even price/value? or some mix of the above.
Benefits of your approach: simplicity. 
Other approaches might more accurately capture degree of adoption - the extent to which blockchain-tech is impacting society, which seems relevant. Maybe those aspects could be captured by way of periods/epochs/ages?
See how geologic time scales are broken into:
1. Supereon
2. Eon
3. Eras
4. Periods
5. Epochs
6. Ages
A broader view would allow us to place bitcoin/blockchain-tech within the history of currency/finance, human society, evolution of life, etc.... No clear ideas of where to take this at the moment, just throwing it out there.

Certainly it's an improvement over most wallets with this level of mobile usability.

Who knows what set of conditions would lead to envy-like mental states or behaviors? or what "a set of instructions" could experience or not? 
Re envy: There may be alternate routes to that outcome beyond a willful effort to code for envy-like outcomes. 
This kind of conversation brings us to a place that is outside our normal comfort zones: our standard approaches to thinking and predicting don't work well in the atmosphere of extreme change. Perhaps it's analogous to the way newtonian mechanics break down at certain scales. 
Why adopt a position with such certainty in a discussion about a future world where we're really not well equipped to know what will happen. We can't predict the weather a week from now or the price of bitcoin or much else of any importance with any success, let alone what an AI can or can't be like...

Initially I thought of paper wallets only as a cold storage option, but I've had a few meetings introducing people to bitcoin and I brought some of the bitaddress.org-generated paper wallets with me and gave $10 of bitcoin to everyone. 
People *loved* them. So then I started carrying them around with me, loaded w/ $2.50 and giving them out to people. And the response is almost always positive. It seems easier for people to understand when it's right in front of them - pub key here, priv key here. In a format that they're used to: a paper bill.
Over the last few weeks I've been thinking about a project I've been calling BitBills, where we'd print a few standard denominations (perhaps 10 / 50 / 100 / 500 / 1,000 millibits) on high quality banknote paper. This paper is NOT easy to come by and intaglio printing is not cheap, I've been trying to work with paper suppliers/printers to see how to best do this.
And then there's the security side. Matched serial numbers on the bills and a holographic sticker covering the private key? BIP38? Depends on whether these are designed for exchange vs. personal storage. Maybe there are two versions???
But how great would it be to have a banknote with a truly exceptional moon landing image - Satoshi planting a Bitcoin flag on the moon! 
This is a very early stage project, maybe it becomes a crowdfunding exercise if there's enough interest. PM me if you're interested in helping.

we're still figuring out how a decision like this should be made. We're doing it partially blind. A large number of threads distributed over a variety of forums. There's no way to accurately take the temperature of these various groups. It's great to have all this discussion and debate, but the process of *deciding* what to do is the challenge. 
It comes down to nodes, miners and exchanges. It would be interesting if (a) nodes+miners could broadcast their positions on an issue (before making an actual software change) and (b)  there were low cost ways for stakeholders who are not currently node operators or miners to voice their position by way of virtual nodes or cloud mining where stakeholders who buy in then have the power to vote with their nodes/miners. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:35:20
Easier to get a laugh than to propose a solution to a fundamental social problem - how to make decisions at scale. 
My take: Decisions are going to be made one way or another. There will either be a process or it'll be ad hoc at every decision point. 
I think we're best served by coming up with some plan for how we make decisions re the future of bitcoin. 
If you dislike centralization, then you should also dislike the current process because it gives more power to five core devs with commit access and miners (who are increasingly centralized) than to other bitcoin stakeholders. 
In my view Arvind's recommendations create a more decentralized decision making mechanism than we have right now because a broader range of stakeholders are brought into the decision making process.
But... many people seem to be fighting against something else: Formalization. 
The current process, outside of core devs w/ commit access and the miners, is very informal. Certain voices carry reputational weight and there is discussion in a variety of forums, but it is a deeply informal process. 
But informal does not equal decentralized. It mostly means, imo, disorganized. And this disorganization is at odds with our shared goal of improving bitcoin and turning it into a platform of value exchange that is accessible to all. 
Any moon mission requires planning. The decision making process powering the planning can be distributed, but I don't think it can't be disorganized and still get us safely to the moon.

My take on this whole thread (and discussions about bitcoin and regulation in general) is the concern about the total regulatory regime - whether it specifically calls out bitcoin or not. 
The overall regulatory regime should be the focus because we care about the net effect. and because:
1. A law that specifically targets bitcoin is not necessarily a bad law. (Ex: a law that defines bitcoin favorably for tax purposes.)
2. A law (or set of laws) that target money laundering might not specifically mention bitcoin, but may impose unworkable requirements on bitcoin companies. 
So, all my discussion is about regulation that impacts bitcoin, not regulation that specifically calls out bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. 
And beyond that, even European countries and the European Union have made legal rulings on bitcoin (see tax treatment). These rulings are law - just like when the IRS issues a ruling. Try not following it and fighting it in court and see what happens... 
So even under a more specific standard (where a law/regulation has to specifically mention bitcoin), Europe isn't a wild west. And I suspect it'll be less wild in the near future as more countries adopt BitLicense like regs....

'93 feels about right to me too. I was in a dorm room in '92 roaming around usenet, ftp, etc... and then Mosaic came along and it clicked. the future felt obvious. same with bitcoin. 
When I tell people about my interest in bitcoin I start with this, "I haven't felt this way since I met the internet." 
bitcoin is definitely in that '93 transition stage - not sure if that Mosaic moment has happened yet, but we're on the cusp. the pace of adoption will very likely be faster than with the internet. Two main reasons imo: (1) The installed base of high powered computers is so much bigger - everyone is already carrying a bitcoin capable device (NOT true of the net) and (2) bitcoin is money. it's like if every user had an equity stake in the net. When bitcoin hits $10k it's going to get seriously nuts. Adding 1M+ users a day kind of nuts.
The float is so small ($500M?) that when the next run up begins and whales start jumping in the pool (and all of us just hodling), bitcoin is going to make a new B-shaped crater on the moon.

no one here knows what the price is going to do. 
but most believe (hope) it will go up. 
Here are the basics:
1. Do you own due diligence - understand bitcoin, why people believe in it and why the detractors don't and then make up your own mind.
2. Define a strategy - buy X amount and sell at -Y / +Z.
3. Understand that bitcoin is a high risk investment, analogous to an angel investment in an early stage company. downside risk is substantial, i.e. you might lose it all. So don't bet more than you can afford to lose / put stop loss in place. All that said, upside is potentially large too...
4. Make your move and stick to your strategy.

I would like to be able to pay in bitcoin at my farmer's market, but there are a lot of hurdles. I offer the following thoughts as someone who would love to see this happen but I'm worried about overcoming the challenges...
Cash is so easy. (and easy to not report). 
Bitcoin does create a trail. and for most vendors they'll want to move it back to USD, which given the likelihood that the avg Farmer would use Circle or Coinbase to do the conversion *really* creates a trail. 
And in terms of accepting payment, they're either going to hang out a QR code (in which case they're trusting your screen (and your word) to verify that they've been paid OR they need to move beyond just having a cashbox to having a device to accept payment on. 
It's relatively easy... BUT it's not as easy as cash.
And where's the win for them? Maybe more customers? A few Farmer's might be convinced to do it if you could get a 10-20 (or more) new customers to pledge their buying power. Other than that, I don't see it happening.

you've got a different definition of pointless than I.
maybe pointless at the edges, where Stallman-esque geeks roll their own keys and read machine code. but for the *vast* majority of the world, regulation matters. It makes a difference if a bitcoin company can't get a banking relationship. or if it's illegal for a person or company to openly accept bitcoin. or download a bitcoin program. or host a bitcoin service.
There is some entertainment value in rhetorical escapades like yours, but they are deeply untethered to reality. and they are dangerous because these fantasies allow us to be confused about the abilities of our adversaries and where our focus should be. 
This line of thinking reminds me of the early discussions around the internet, 90-95, the period from which your Gilmore reference dates (which he said in '93). I was guilty of buying into the hyperbole. The internet is not some invincible force - it is a human creation, subject to the same failings that we are subject to. 
And this was proven to us over the course of the last 20 years. Many times.
The great firewall of china. the off switch in Egypt. Snowden. 
There was censorship and total surveillance. 1B people in China don't have Gilmore's internet.And what did the internet do to stop it?  The internet is still a force for freedom, but only to the extent that PEOPLE fight for freedom. 
It's not about technology, it's about principles. and action. and courage. 
If a major terror attack was partially paid for by bitcoin, the world would be a *very* different place in an instant. 96% of the companies now accepting bitcoin would stop. VC money would stop. Banking relationships would stop. The New Patriot Act that outlawed bitcoin would come a few weeks after. People who used bitcoin would be targeted, tracked, persecuted. 
And the nature of the technology behind bitcoin would *not* stop all of that, just like the nature of the technology behind the internet did not stop the Chinese, Saudi Arabia or the NSA.
I consider many of bitcoiners to be freedom fighters and I see their efforts as part of a larger battle in favor of freedom, the right to assemble, to privacy, to speak freely (anonymously if they wish and $$$ is speech). And more than any piece of software, it is this mindset that needs to be spread. It is this mindset, if widely adopted, that will allow us to protect our right to use bitcoin and other freedom-enabling technologies when the crisis hits (and it will hit).

the level of certainty in your response is indefensible. 
We're talking about future events of a type not seen before and you're offering unqualified predictions about the "cost of a war"... 
And what would a human vs. AI war look like exactly? Remember, if we accept Vinge's singularity hypothesis as the starting point of our discussion, then we're accepting a continued acceleration of technological innovation/capability. 
The moment where human intelligence = AI is a blip in time. The rate of improvement is the important variable, does AI quickly accelerate away from human intelligence? If yes, the cost of an AI vs. Human war may be similar to the cost of you waging war against a few ants invading your kitchen. Effectively no cost at all. 
And more than that, the whole point of employing the term "singularity" is to describe our inability to do what you're attempting to do - see beyond the event horizon. The nature of the change, by it's very nature, means the effectiveness of human predictions falls into equivalence with the predictive power of a coin flip...

I do think there's massive value to setting a floor. 
If you had a bunch of wealthy people combine forces, this would be pretty easy. Set it at $150 or $200. Something relatively easy to defend. And then set up a line of credit from a major bank that would be tapped whenever purchases needed to be made. 
If they had access to a $500M line of credit and said publicly they'd use it to set a floor of $200. They'd probably never even need to tap into it. 
The psychology would shift in an instant. And it'd probably only cost $500k in lawyers and bankers fees. 
It would be nice if there was a way to crowdsource a Bitcoin Defense Fund. Where people put up money (and it only goes active once it crosses some agreed up threshold) to protect the price.
At this point it'd be much easier to get 6-12 billionaires together and set a floor w/ a credit line... Let me know if you know any billionaires and we'll start working on it.

"decently accurate"??? 
measured how?
here's the thing: Trading is a domain where it's *very* easy, trivial even, to measure success. You show people your trades. And total return shows whether you've done well or not.
The good Dr. doesn't give us a total return to look at. Absent that, he could at least go on record as saying something concrete and measurable: 
- Price will go up over 24hrs. 
- Price will go down over next week. 
That kind of thing. And we could track where he was right or wrong with those specific predictions.
As it stands now, he hasn't done those thing. There may be value there (I doubt it), but who can tell???

Political regulation is inevitable. and in large part it has already happened - bitcoin in the US and other countries is *at this moment* heavily regulated. 
And that's fine. 
It is better to have a regulatory scheme (like the current one in the US) that allows for cryptocurrencies to be widely used, than a draconian approach which outlaws cryptocurrencies entirely (no open use allowed). 
Bitcoin is the tip of the spear. It opens the door to a powerful set of new technologies with downstream effects that can not be tightly controlled. A moderate regulatory scheme now creates the possibility of major crypto-induced changes in the next 5-25yrs. 
And in the current environment, that's the best we can hope for. Because there never was a scenario where the U.S. would openly embrace a full unregulated bitcoin evolution. So it's fine to fight to make the regulations better or to fight against them entirely, but it's unimaginable that a modern western government would let a new form of currency/digital asset run completely wild. 
In closing, we're right on track. The seed has been planted, it is growing and change is coming.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:00:32
this is one useful piece of info, but it really doesn't say much about how much capital would be needed to push the price to $1k.
There are many exchanges. 
Coins can move. Orderbooks can change - if we started to move up to $1k or even $250. the orderbook would change. (Obv)
And then there's the challenge of assessing psychology, if people start riding the bull, it can become self fulfilling in a way.
A potentially instructive historical event: The Hunt Brothers attempted to corner the silver market in 1979/1980. They drove the price up from $10/oz to $50/oz in 4 months. It started at $5 when they began accumulating. 
They eventually accumulated, using $1B in capital, approximately 200M ounces of silver. Which, according to the source, represented either 50% or 77% of the total silver market. So a market size of approx:
At $5/oz: 1.5-2B
At $10/oz: $3-4B
At $50/oz: $15B-$20B
And they moved the price 10x. with $1B in capital. and it was probably a more liquid (more difficult) market to move/corner than BTC would be. 
Based on the above and given that we're looking for a 5x increase, I'd guess that you'd need to be willing to commit on the order of $75-250M to engineer a rise to $1k. 
EDIT II: Some relevant academic research on the history of large traders. 
Bottom line: bitcoin (as many suspected) is uniquely prone to manipulation. it's an almost perfect market to manipulate and given the right amount of capital. someone could (maybe already has) make a killing.

"Actually, if..." you lost me.
IF mining stabilizes, then unicorns will dance on the head of a pin.
Applying a prediction about a future state to the present state is usually (and is in this case) a recipe for being wrong.
Newsflash: Mining is NOT stable *right now*
And would you like to enlighten us, Bitstradamus, as to when it will start to be stable? and what that will look like exactly?
As for mining 3600 coins being equivalent to selling 3600 coins - I'm flabbergasted. Sure, the network is incentivizing hash power via block rewards. But we're talking about the market price of a commodity. That's the whole point of this exercise. 
What a miner pays per coin includes both fixed and variable costs (capital costs for equipment and then variable costs for electricity, administration, logistics, etc...). And for smaller scale miners, their actual financial investment (like buying a few antminers and running them in your basemant), won't include an exhaustive accounting of other relevant costs (like their time). 
So... the amount a miner "invests" per coin does not have a direct and immediate impact on the spot price of bitcoin on a real-time exchange.
That should be obvious. 
Of course, over time, these two do correlate, but it's not the direct and immediate relationship that you imply. and the investment needed to mine 3,600 coins daily is most definitely not equivalent to dumping those same 3,600 coins onto global exchanges daily.
@_date: 2015-01-24 15:57:39
I wouldn't say it's a good baseline, it's a good outer bound. 
Obv miners can't sell more coins than they have. So that would be the maximum. 
But using the 3,600 number as our starting point just doesn't make sense to me. Everyone here knows that all miners don't sell all their coins. I know miners who don't sell coins. And I suspect they are not the only ones.... 
So using 3,600 as a boundary on one side is fine, but using it as the base for our discussion seems to ignore the fact that we know from the start that it doesn't reflect the number of coins miners are actually selling each day.

This is a real opportunity to introduce btc to thoughtful people, people who do not have the political or compsci background to be in the first few waves, but are open to new ideas.

I just bought multiple copies to send to people and I'll include a paper wallet with each copy.

I'm in. 
A few thoughts on parameters for finding the right project:
- Something that will generate a certain threshold of media attention. Basically stating a clear goal, whether it's major attention within a specific geographic or demographic market of interest or a positive blip in the global news cycle. Or both
- Something that highlights a unique capability of bitcoin. 
- Something good: good for bitcoin / good for the world.
- Build on top of a proven strategy 
After a little brainstorming I have an initial thought for a project: 
*7 Continents - Currency for All*
Building on top of the MIT airdrop (which, 9 months in, looks like a clear win) we distribute $5-10M in bitcoin to a specific community (probably a major University) on each continent (not many people in Antarctica, so maybe all of them get some BTC). 
- $100 to everyone who signs up (this is a jackpot for people in non-OECD countries)
- Get local business on board to coincide with launch, cafes, restaurants, bars, book stores, etc... Make sure people have places to spend their coins
- Track the results: If it succeeds, we can use that data to convince other retailers to accept bitcoin in areas with sufficient user densities. And learn what didn't what so we can improve next time around.
- Work with major bitcoin companies to (a) raise the money, (b) get the local businesses set up (including any necessary hardware), (c) connect new users with the software they'll need, (d) (maybe 21 will give everyone a "free" phone...)
- Work with major bitcoin holders to fund campaign
- Create an onboarding platform with videos, FAQs, etc... to help people get up to speed. 
- Work with local bitcoin enthusiasts to offer support during the initial launch period - working hard to make sure that people can use and understand bitcoin
- A global tour where bitcoin thought leaders visit each campus. Andreas, Voorhees, Ver, Gavin, Balaji, etc... 
- Work with the team responsible for the MIT launch to learn from their efforts and improve on what they did
- Launch in Fall 2015. It's a tight timeline, but achievable. 
I think this would get significant media attention and would do a lot to push forward bitcoin adoption. Young people, especially college students, are the tip of the spear.

Matt Miller has clearly had his faith shaken. 
And this is good news for the following reasons (or at least could be):
a. The near term expectations on bitcoin were simply too high. The infrastructure in terms of companies providing useful bitcoin products and bitcoin as a payment network were just not able to support the hopes that bitcoin would go to $10k in 2014. 
It's good that expectations are being re-set. Now most recent converts (like Matt) half expect Bitcoin to fail. 
b. This eases the pressures a bit. and true bitcoin believers have been working diligently and will continue to do that throughout 2015. 
New products and services and core improvements will continue to roll out. This is obv good news. The ~$400M in VC money invested in 2014 will be turned into products in 2015, there's a latency involved, but they are being built. New use cases will come online. BTC remittance services may start to gain real traction. 
And a shake out amongst miners, exchanges, wallet companies, etc... is good. The strong will be left standing. 
c. When the next wave of interest hits mainstream media, who expected BTC to die, will eat up the new story that it's alive and well. And users will a lot of ways to actually use bitcoin vs. Nov 2013 when the only thing a person could do is speculate and buy alpaca socks. 
We're in the despair phase (again), but the fundamentals haven't changed much. 
And when bitcoin rises again, it'll be ready.

It does worry me. Given the level of violence in modern society, the scenario you paint seems reasonable. 
Bottom line: it's time to stop being so violent. and to start solving our problems peacefully. across the board. 
MLK offered this: 'The choice is not between violence and nonviolence but between nonviolence and nonexistence.'
And I think that properly captures our situation as humans. If we don't choose nonviolence, we're sowing the seeds of our eventual extinction. 
Fortunately, if you believe Steven Pinker's research in Better Angels of Our Nature, we're in the middle of a dramatic decrease in violence in human societies over the last 5,000 yrs. Ancient human cultures used to be massively more violent than those of the 20th century or today. 
And the ability to put a kill switch in anyone's hand, is more reason to continue along those lines and to fully embrace a non-violent way of living - every aspect of our lives, from food to conflict. Each of us can start choosing a more peaceful way of living right now, we don't need to wait on anyone in Washington to do it for us.

these types of governance issues that face bitcoin are a major issue and are not discussed nearly enough. 
What happens when bitcoin has a market cap of $100B? The politics of development when only miners have a vote is a concern.
I've been thinking about the benefits of an altruistic mining operation which doesn't have short run profits in mind and commits (legally / cryptographically) to operate by certain principles. 
- Decentralized mining operation that is more difficult to shut down
- Voting power of the pool is distributed among users (an architecture like congress? 1P/1V + Board)
- Adhere to core ideas behind bitcoin
We'd still be mining bitcoins, but we wouldn't be doing so in the most profitable way (as measured in the short run, we'd be investing in bitcoin by helping to solve a core issue - architecture of governance). Other massive centralized operations would be more "efficient" - but they also might not have the long term interests of bitcoin in mind (short term profit may undermine miners desire to stay true to bitcoin - see mining centralization as proof of this).
Anyway, altruistic mining wouldn't be a charity operation, if the price of bitcoin goes up, it'd still be very profitable. It would just trade some short term gains for bigger long term gains.
And if the Altruistic mining group got to be big enough, it could really improve the way bitcoin evolves. and reduces threats to its health.

thanks for the answer, but this is not what I was after.
I was interested in a risk analysis of the bitcoin blockchain - what are the various sorts of attacks that could be lodged against it and at what cost? and how many petahashes (and what level of decentralization) are required in order to secure the network at a given market cap? 
Right now I have the sense that 300 petahashes is more mining power than we 'need' to secure $3B in value (in that the expected economic return from an attack is low enough that an attacker wouldn't waste their time/money to attack, or the attack would fail). 
But I haven't seen anyone address this question in a detailed way.

"to keep the price stable at $1,000.... must purchase $3.6M USD."
This is only true if you assume that every coin mined is sold that day. 
Which is a weird assumption (and very likely to be false, since it's not even true at the current low price where sell pressure is higher (need to cover costs...)
And the assumption is even less likely in a giant bull market racing to $1k. 
the fact that ~3,600 coins are mined each day does NOT mean that the same number of coins need to be sold every day. 
So... then we'd need to enter into a complex analysis to determine how many newly mined coins we'd expect to sold each day given all the varied conditions (cost of mining, future BTC price expectations of miners, etc...)
I'm not going to hazard a guess except to say that it's insane to assume that every coins mined would be sold.... and equally insane to assume every coin mined would be held indefinitely, it's somewhere in the middle, but where, who knows.

I don't agree.
Profitable to whom? If someone wanted to undermine the network for whatever reason, to drive the price down or to decrease trust in bitcoin altogether, there are any number of attacks that could be launched.
- Run miners that purposely leave out transactions to clog the network
- Run miners that double spend
- Run miners that fork the code
- Legal attacks on mining operations
- DOS attacks on miners / nodes
- etc.........
These would all have some short/medium/long-term negative consequences for the network and judging the profitability of the attack depends on the cost of the attack and the benefit for the attacker...
There are many scenarios where an attack could be profitable (or would create a rational expectation of a profit). 
The network is not so perfect as to make any attack theoretically and practically unprofitable in every possible scenario. 
Ex: If a government views bitcoin as an existential threat, then an expenditure on an attack that hobbles bitcoin and protects the value of fiat (for X amount of time) could easily be seen to have a positive return on investment. 
My initial thought was along the lines of, 'how expensive would it be to take control of a substantial portion of mining power, such that the attacker would have some market power to negatively affect BTC?' And specifically, what is the cost of the attack relative to the expected negative affect on BTC (as measured in price/total decrease in market cap). 
i.e. You would need to spend $200M on mining equipment and electricity in order to get control of 25% of the mining power, which would then allow you to do X... which would decrease the price by Y.

not mad, just curious why you don't employ a mechanism for tracking your own results and sharing it publicly. Seems like it would even be useful to you in honing your skills - determining which methods are working and which aren't.

Perhaps start with one or two schools, with a plan (if things go well) of getting to all 7 continents. 
Stanford is the first one that jumped to mind. Placement within a hotbed of bitcoin activity and tech innovation makes it a good target. and everyone in the valley, perhaps Stanford students more than anyone else, is buzzing with the entrepreneurial / future thinking fervor. 
And... there are many, many bitcoin millionaires and bitcoin companies in the area who might be willing to fund the airdrop.

public safety? like keeping people safe from vicious altcoins? or full node fires? Unless I'm missing something there is no way a bitcoin node project is going to get 501c3 approval for promoting public safety. That works fine for orgs like the American Fireworks Standards Lab, but not running bitcoin full nodes...

Every company operating in Europe that is doing bitcoin to fiat conversions has compliance requirements.  
Pure bitcoin, non-software, non-black market companies that are operating without regard to existing/pending law are small in number. 
- If you've got VC funding, you're tuned into compliance issues
- If you want a banking relationship, you're tuned into compliance issues
- If you want to avoid getting subpoenaed, you're tuned into compliance
So it's a fantasy to think that Europe is the wild west. 
US regulation may, over time, prove to be worse than some other jurisdictions, but I doubt that there is a single jurisdiction on earth where there is ZERO regulation of bitcoin.

BIP75 doesn't directly threaten fungibility imo. 
 BIP75 does provide a standard for sharing information about who sent funds, but that information is only seen by those involved in the tx. And it's not obvious to any outsider exactly what information was exchanged via BIP75. Such that BIP75, by itself, doesn't decrease the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin - people will still have to rely on blockchain analysis services that already exist (e.g. Chainalysis). 
And BIP75 does open up a number of interesting new features, from sending address/shipping info with a payment to sending certified identity information (which would make traditional financial institutions like banks more comfortable accepting bitcoin payments directly). I'd love to be able to send bitcoin directly to a traditional FI. Sure I'd prefer to not have to deal with standard banks at all, but my reality still involves a good amount of Wells Fargo and BofA and all the rest. My hope is that a direct bank integration (made possible via BIP75) is net-positive for bitcoin.
The longer term fungibility implications of BIP75 aren't obvious. 
As it stands now bitcoin isn't perfectly fungible. Companies and miners have the option of blocking transactions. That's not the norm now, but some government could decide tomorrow that they want miners to stop mining txs from Alphabay, mixing services or exchanges that haven't obtained the 'CountryX-BitLicense'. 
All organizations and individuals with a footprint in any jurisdiction and some link to bitcoin are subject to that jurisdiction's enforcement actions. 
regardless of BIP75. 
And you don't need much knowledge of cryptocurrency systems to understand that something like BIP75 (or something with much greater impacts on fungibility) is possible. 
My belief is that BIP75 is the best of breed option here. And that if bitcoin is ever to see mainstream adoption something like BIP75 is inevitable. So... we're probably better off choosing BIP75 vs. having something more onerous imposed on every exchange and wallet service. bcs there's a chance that BIP75 could get us through the next 10+yrs, letting us avoid a real fungibility crackdown. 
Anyway, there are definitely trade offs here. More users --&gt; more pressure to regulate. BIP75 feels like the right balance to me. In part because I believe that the cryptoasset cat is very much out of the bag. Which means that for those people who want to ride the edges, it's easier than ever (and getting easier). Bitcoin is the tip of the spear - it's not perfectly anonymous or perfectly fungible or perfectly decentralized, but it's still the most powerful freedom enhancing technology of the least 25 years and the more bitcoin users in the world, the better. even if that mainstream version of bitcoin does not meet my (or your) platonic ideal. 
and for those edge cases where bitcoin is not be ideal, other coins will emerge that can meet those needs (zerocash or whatever they might turn out to be). Let's keep being passionate about this technology we love, but let's also remind ourselves that we're all riding this great cryptowave to greater freedom together.

your position is analogous to saying that you're not an Oil user unless you're actually pumping or refining Oil. while this perspective has some logic to it, it is also plainly absurd. 
Under any logic, I'm an indirect user of Oil and Bitcoin. and I can't use bitcoin, without using Bitcoin. so how indirect is it really?
Your logic essentially serves one purpose, to support your belief. it does not stand on its own.

^ This is a useful comment because it shows the prejudice of u/Luke-jr perspective. 
I work for a bitcoin company, get paid in bitcoin, buy many, many things with bitcoin, give bitcoin to friends and family, hodl bitcoin as a speculative investment. 
But for u/luke-jr, none of this makes me a bitcoin user. 
Which is, on the face of it, absurd. and offensive. 
I admit there is value in running a node/mining, but certainly a community that claims to favor freedom should have the ability (and courage) to welcome a diverse range of users, even if they don't meet some arbitrary standard set by an elitist insider. 
This comment, more than any other in the blocksize debate so far, reveals the flaw in perspective of the Evolution Deniers. But this is getting ridiculous:
- Redefining what an alt-coin is
- Censoring a main communication platform
- And redefining "bitcoin user" so that less than 1% of bitcoin holders are anointed as 'Real Users'
Enough already. It smells like tyranny, it looks like tyranny - it IS tyranny. And Bitcoin, more than any other community, should overthrow this flawed attempt at governance. 
Remember, bitcoin works through *Consensus by code.* Not consensus by CODERS.
The last two sentences in the white paper: "They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism"

so... there are incentives to running a node.
the claim then becomes that running a node involves non-financial incentives.
but all incentives are (directly or indirectly) financial in nature. This is tautologically true of any economic incentive (something that motivates a life form to do one thing vs. another). And incentives that are not first order financial incentives can be given a monetary value by way of assigning a value to your time or to a specific psychological state that you value or pretty much anything else.

inflation is indeed hard to measure well. this is why there are different tools for measuring inflation - all of them are of course imperfect on multiple ways. 
but, while some goods have gotten cheaper, other costs of living (some essentials and some non-essentials) have, in dollar terms, gotten more expensive. 
Also, it's not clear that profitable companies don't get cheaper and easier to produce. the cost of creating a startup, particularly a tech-oriented one, has gotten cheaper in some important ways. Spin up an EC2 cluster vs. doing that in house. And numerous other examples. 
stock markets are, imo, a very bad measure of inflation. peaks and troughs are in part (maybe in large part) driven by emotion and speculative trading, not underlying costs of living (or even the costs associated with running a business). The consumer price index, though flawed, is massively better as a measure of everyday inflation than something like the S&amp;P.

Not that it's tremendously relevant, but I used to work at Coinbase.
Also, I'm not saying what they do or don't do. But the idea that they don't have the *option* of tracking payments from your Coinbase wallet to wherever is wrong. 
Here's one scenario: 
 Your CB wallets --&gt; your Blockchain wallet --&gt; your Coinkite wallet --&gt; LBC buyer --&gt; ISIS-linked address
Do this 100 times and see if they cancel your account. Put as many 'anonymous' addresses in between your CB wallet and the ISIS wallet. 
10. 100. 1,000. 
It really doesn't matter, the issue is that there is a link between YOU and ISIS. And they can see it. 
Even if it's an imperfect link, where they *know* they could be wrong, why would they risk losing their banking relationship when they could cut you off w/ basically zero cost... 
That's the crux of this analysis: Combine known bitcoin network analysis tools w/ CB's undeniable business interests and you get a very straightforward result.

They don't
But they don't need to. If they know that BTC that you control is routinely ending up in a wallet they don't like, that's probably enough for them to kill your account. 
This isn't 'beyond a reasonable' doubt level of proof. And, given their position and the difficulty of getting and maintaining a bank account, I can understand their extreme aversion to risk here.
They are not going to take many chances, if there's a linkage they don't like I suspect they'll close accounts and ask questions later. 
That said, I have no idea what their actual policy towards Backpage is. They may be fine with it.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:28:44
this is probably not true. 
there are many known blockchain analysis tools that could give Coinbase visibility into what happens to the coins you bought through their service after you buy them. 
If you don't purposefully obfuscate your TXs, then it might be trivial to link your purchase on Coinbase to a Backpage-related TX. And if they see a pattern of these emerge, they *may* decide to terminate your account. 
I have no idea what their actual policy is, but if SVB doesn't want Coinbase interacting with Backpage, then they'll do what they can to stop those TXs.

$35 in 1971 = $206 today.
so a 5x gain when factoring inflation in.
For reference the S&amp;P 500 was at 75 in 1971 (2100 right now) - which, oddly imo, exactly mirrors the unadjusted gain for gold over the same time period: 28x. Interesting.
(Edit: I'm not including any dividends in my calc - just using the raw index number, so the 28x number does understate S&amp;P returns)

first thought: Write about something you are passionate about, regardless of what the thesis advisor thinks. Find another thesis advisor is necessary. 
But note - all of your thesis advisors are unlikely to know much about bitcoin, so they may be reluctant to have you work on a subject that is basically unknown to them. 
In college I initially wanted to write my econ thesis on Linux and economic incentives involved in free software and distributed online projects. No advisor wanted to touch it, mostly because they didn't understand it. and had never even heard of Linux (this was in 95). So I switched to how the CPI accounts for technological change... moderately interesting, but it would have been much better to work on the Linux paper. 
Bottom line: Write about what you want to write about. Winning the support of the advisor is part of that process, don't let them dissuade you - win them over. 
I've worked in Bitcoin for 3yrs, I'm happy to be a resource for you as you write this. DM me if you have questions.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:53:10
In my view: Your ability to win them over is a measure of how well you can write a paper on *any* subject. 
Part of it is framing the situation properly. First, spend some time explaining your belief that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are likely to be an important part of the future of money. To do this I would: (a) say this in your own words and (b) provide some compelling support (I've listed a few options below). 
Second, explain that the writing of the these will provide an opportunity for you two to explore this space together and understand it better. Sure, there will be some challenges in covering this relatively new ground, but the upside makes it worth it...
That's my take at least :)

and the cost of those coins might be well below market price. which makes a difference with respect to an analysis of the inflation rate's influence on price. 
basically, we want to know what the supply curve looks like - how many bitcoin are for sale at a given price point within a given inflation rate. 
as the inflation rate decreases, we *may* see MORE selling pressure and lower prices. miners need to cover the same variable costs each day/week/month. Payroll, leases, electricity, etc... 
say current variable costs are $180k/mo. and increases at the rate of inflation, moving to ~$185k/mo in a year. If the price of bitcoin stays the same or goes lower, they would have to sell more coins to meet those basic costs which allow operations to keep going.  
Point being: there are many variables at play. I'm hopeful that the next halving will help power a moon trip. but the belief that the halving *requires* an increase in price is pure fantasy.

This is a challenge.
In short, it can't be done where you directly convert bitcoin held by the MMJ company/dispensary to USD. 
Why? Any company that is seamlessly converting to USD has a banking relationship it wants to protect. And MJ endangers that banking relationship. Bitcoin by itself is dicey enough. MJ+BTC = not going to happen.
At least not in the no hassle way that Coinbase and Bitpay allow. 
There may be ways to do it, but the complexity adds expense. and then it becomes a question of whether integrating bitcoin is a sound business decision. 
I've thought about this a fair amount. Happy to discuss at greater length, just PM me and we can find a time to talk.

1386600 shares. each share = 1/10 bitcoin. 
so 138660 bitcoin / 61,915,960 = $446.53
Not clear if every penny raised has been turned into BTC though.

I agree that Buffett is aligned with legacy financial institutions, but is $117B the right number to use? 
Market cap for Berkshire is $360-380B and total assets (as of end of year 2013) were $484B.
Berkshire is effectively a holding company, so I think the "portfolio" should include the entire company, not just the stock holdings. Those four companies you single out still make up a big % of the portfolio (9-13% depending on what number you use), but it's a lot lower than 40%.

agreed that there are other important events on the calendar. ETF would be HUGE, but the halving isn't dependent on approval from the SEC, so barring apocalypse, it's coming. The ETF could be another 2-3yrs out. really. 
Bitcoin is *way* more accessible (easier to buy) than it was during the 2013 run ups. and at least an order of magnitude more accessible than LTC. So that seems to favor a bubble scenario. I agree that if we start seeing 100% gain headlines in MSM, it'll get nuts. fast. 
The last bubble really put bitcoin on the map and I believe that the speculative frenzy of late 2013 was an essential part of what made Bitcoin/Crypto-ledger companies a compelling VC investment. Bubbles obv have their downsides, but in terms of establishing bitcoin a new bubble would help power the space for another few years. 
So, for the good of bitcoin, I'm willing to endure another bubble.

anonymity isn't a prereq for a crypto equity project. 
I agree that it'd be nice to have. Also, it's not clear to me that there will be heavy ID requirements under Reg A+. But even if there are, these new regulations represented a significant loosening of the regulatory regime, it's certainly not gone, but it's better. and that's a good thing.

people who know nothing about technical analysis will say that this can't be valid.
even people who know something about TA will say this is worthless. 
which is funny, because the predictive power of a model like this is obvious. The laws of rainbow bands are inescapable, any asset can't stay in the blue band for very long. Plot any asset on a rainbow trendline and you'll see this. 
Bitcoin will eventually bounce back to over-valued or even very over-valued and then, as the strength of the bounces dissipates we'll settle into the yellow band*.

this is a big deal. 
nowhere near perfect. but a HUGE improvement on the current system and it will make it easier for crypto-related efforts to raise money for equity. 
it's a big improvement on the earlier version. This law will make a real difference for bitcoin and crypto-related projects over the next few years. 
Law goes live 60 days after it's published in the federal register, so companies can start raising money under Reg A+ by June 2015. 
A recap of main points (borrowed heavily from Kiran Lingam - see my link below for full article)
- Raise up to $50M in a 12mo period
- Anyone can invest
- Self-certification of income/net-worth (vs. onerous requirements to verify income/net-worth under Title II)
- Ok to advertise offering
- Requires SEC approval of offering circular (this is an abbreviated prospectus)
- Reviewed financials if you're raising under $20M (Tier 1), reviewed+audited financials if raising between $20M-50M (Tier 2).
- No ongoing reporting requirements for Tier 1. Scaled back reporting requirements for Tier 2 (less than standard IPO). 
- State Preemption - Tier 1 introduces a new "coordinated review" process, supposedly a faster way of getting all 50 states to approve an offering. For Tier 2 there's no need to get approval from all 50 states (as prev Reg A required)
- Securities are unrestricted - freely transferrable, opens up the possibility of second markets in these securities

the marijuana industry is a community that could accept a good portion of their revenues as bitcoin and not have to worry about turning those coins into $$$ through a licensed MSB. 
There are a number of options that would be appealing that aren't available to them now:
1. Safe and lower cost storage of savings - they could park X% of revenue in bitcoin and keep it there indefinitely. If they don't want to take on volatility risks, they could use a hedging service (Coinapult or BitReserve)
2. Spend coins - they could spend a portion of their coins at companies that accept bitcoin. Via gift cards, Purse.io, NewEgg, etc... 
3. Pay employees and suppliers - the MJ community is philosophically primed for bitcoin use. MJ retailers could pay employees in bitcoin, those employees would then have an easier time turning that BTC into USD. MJ retailers could offer incentives to their suppliers to accept bitcoin as payment. If they're buying the weed they sell, then the growers might happily accept bitcoin. And if enough growers/retailers start wanting to spend bitcoin, the companies that service them will learn to start accepting it (esp given how easy it is). 
So... I think that there is real potential here, it's not blind evangelism. The facts favor adoption.

downvoting the truth doesn't make it false.
I know you downvoters don't want to admit the power of rainbow logic, that's ok. For now you can keep your minds in the blue band, slowly, as a matter of destiny, the full rainbow of your consciousness will bloom. and the price of the asset that is your mind will go lunar.

So is your primary contention that the cultural (and related political issues) is the main hangup? I admit that bitcoin certainly carries some baggage.
The proposition might best be viewed as trading old headaches for new headaches. but there still needs to be a comparison of which headaches are worse. And I still think that bitcoin offers some improvements over the current headaches and that the bitcoin-related headaches are likely to decrease over time as the service infrastructure around bitcoin evolves. 
There have been examples of pot shops trying to accept bitcoin, but it was slowed by three things
1. Coinbase shutting down the pot shops account
2. Volatility concerns
3. Lack of understanding among consumers
Issue number one still exists and will persist, but a store could use a Blockchain merchant wallet instead. That can't get shut down. 
Issue 2 still exists, but can now be mitigated for a 1.5% fee via Coinapult Locks. 
Issue 3 still exists, but I think that can be overcome too. The combination of educational materials + financial incentives (in the form of discounts) may be enough to induce skeptics to try it out. 
As for your concern re culture, that's legitimate but I don't think it's a showstopper. One successful implementation could be a spark that sets of the fire. Nationally state-licensed pot sales are well over $1B. It's a huge market. 
I've contacted a few people mentioned in the article about exploring bitcoin-related solutions. No responses yet, but I'm convinced there's something here...

Yes, block reward moves from 25 to 12.5. 
miners will always be able to mine, it's just a question of what kind of ROI you're going to see. as new miners become more efficient, old miners become slower/more expensive. The slope of the future efficiency of miners curve is a subject of some debate. Some people think the gains from new miners will continue to level off - so that older machines would degrade into useless bricks more slowly...

A little harder to track and secure than btc imo. 
This is not to say there aren't serious headaches involved for a marijuana business to start accepting bitcoin, but the idea that there's no fraud/theft in a cash-based system is lunacy.

oh yeah, this is super straightforward... not.
this is straightforward to a few bitcoiners obsessed with the idea of paying with bitcoin. no one else will find this straightforward. It's a user-experience nightmare. and the bare inclusion as another payment option is nothing to celebrate. 
Payment experience matters. Each extra click is another opportunity for a sales to drop off. As a community we need to get realistic about what is a formula for winning - and this is not it. 
It's nice to be included as a payment option on Adyen, but this walk through really shows how misleading a headline can be. How easy it is to get excited about a new integration, but how it's really not much more than a headline in the current implementation.

I just looked at the litecoin price chart. LTC spent most of 2015 bouncing between 1.50-2.00, basically mirroring BTC. 
Then, 3 months away from halving, it begin to rise. From ~1.50 to ~1.80. 
Then, ~2 months out, it jumps to 3. settles at 3 for two weeks and launches to a high of $8+. Spike lasts all of 3 days and comes back down to around $4 for about a month. 
Then, a week out from the halving it gives back another dollar and has been steady at about $3 for the 6 weeks after the halving.
So... in the end it basically doubled, with a lot of speculative action in between.

Following up w/ a few choice quotes:
- Dylan Donaldson, 30, knows the hidden costs of a bank-challenged business. He has nine 1,000-pound safes bolted to the floor in the back of Karing Kind, the dispensary he owns in North Boulder. At any given time, they hold $80,000 to $100,000 in cash.
The safes didn’t help, though, when audacious thieves busted through the wall of an adjoining business in the middle of the night in June and took $250,000 in marijuana plants.
- Now Dylan Donaldson pays $100,000 a year for armed guards provided by Iron Protection Group
- Kristi Kelly, owner of Good Meds, which grows and sells medical marijuana. Since 2009, Ms. Kelly has had 23 bank accounts canceled
- Now Ms. Kelly relies on what she calls the “Bank of Kristi” — the proceeds of Good Meds are kept in a safe and delivered to the tax man, employees, lenders, trade associations and utilities in whatever is discreet and handy, paper bags included
This is a group that is primed for bitcoin. They're frustrated with the government, they can't access the normal banking system and they have a shit ton of cash. 
There is a HUGE opportunity here. 
1. Offer consumers a sizable discount to accept BTC
2. Use that BTC to pay expenses (like employees)
3. Keep savings safely in BTC - no need to transport money or have a dozen safes.

I like the approach of coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index. They've created a methodology that follows standards set in other industries that rely on indexes for pricing. The model they're using will allow their price quotes to remain relevant no matter what happens to any individual exchange. Right now they only include data from BTC-e and bitstamp, but over time this will expand. While it's obvious that there's no clear winner in the pricing space, I think coindesk is well positioned for 2014 and beyond.
Here's an explanation of their approach:

Love the core idea. Feels like the timing is right for this to happen. 
I've been working on internet voting for a while and am in the process of pivoting my nonprofit, Restart Democracy, to focus on a bitcoin-inspired solution. So I'm fully on board here - ready to pitch in any way I can, join weekly hangouts, schedule a live meeting/conference at some point, etc...
A few initial thoughts: the system should allow voting on anything, not just formal "elections." Voting on political issues/elections is the starting point, but the system should, in my view, support voting on restaurants, movies, people, ideas... anything. There's an opportunity to create a platform for general reputation / web of trust here. Not only would this create an ongoing use for the system outside of formal elections (something people would use on a daily basis), integrating reputation/web of trust from the start also has the benefit of creating what might serve as an authentication tool for the voting experience. 
Lots more thoughts... Thrilled to find this thread and ready to make this happen!
Also, here are some of my earlier thoughts on internet voting systems and the potential power of that kind of platform.

It took me a while to recognize this same thing - first heard of bitcoin in late 2010 but didn't spend too much time thinking about it. It wasn't until October that the full potential hit me. 
The ability to monetize open source or... really any productive activity, is huge. Especially given the fact that coins represent a kind of pseudo-equity stake in the venture/idea. I've started stating that the protocol allows for 'self-funding distributed universal computers' (in the Turing-sense, where a universal computer can do any computational task). 
The transaction costs of these 'decentralized applications' (to borrow David Johnston's term) is dramatically lower than all existing alternatives. It's a *big* deal.
(link to DJ's white paper on Decentralized apps
