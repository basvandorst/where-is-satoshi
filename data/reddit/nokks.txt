Yes I was also recommended Bitonic for buying bitcoin in Europe it has an excellent reputation. 
As alternative options for Dutch bitcoiners: 
- for the Netherlands there's also Anycoindirect. 
- any of the larger exchanges that operate in Europe using SEPA transfers (Kraken, BitcoinDE) or credit card (Bitstamp, Blockchain, Coinbase)

Looks like an informative site at a quick glance. I'll take a deeper look later this afternoon and update, but I really like that it shows local currencies (USD EUR etc), separates cryptocoin exchanges from their bitcoin counterparts, and there seems to be some excellent guides on how to use each site. Thanks for this one.

Hi, I'm currently traveling on business the US, and the front page is only showing me one site: Bitquick. Is this normal? But looking through other pages, this seems full of reviews for the best sites, which is nice. I also see Poloniex, Kraken, and LocalBitcoins. Although I would prefer a simple list, this could be useful to send in the case that someone needs further detail. Saved for later.

Sounds good. I'll link my reply and this reddit discussion to them on twitter.

A nice comparison of the largest bitcoin exchanges on an international level. While this list is more oriented towards people wanting to find a good site to buy btc, the simplicity of how information is presented makes it really useful as a quick reference. I see good sites to buy in the UK, USA, Europe, Asia, and even Australia (currently interviewing two contractors from Melbourne - one is very happy to be paid in bitcoin). It's nice to see that cryptocurrency exchanges are included.  
It would be nice to see more exchanges from latin america included though. This seems a logical move as it's the fastest growing market for bitcoin to fiat at the moment.
