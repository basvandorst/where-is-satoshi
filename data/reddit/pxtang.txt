If people want to pay rent with Bitcoin, we give them that option. If they don't want to, they can use cash too.

Hi there! I'm an intern at Rentalutions right now, and we're all pretty excited about this. The bitcoin landing page is 
If there's enough interest, I can try to get my boss to do an AMA, and if there's other small quick questions that I can answer, I'll definitely try to do so. Major inquiries should be made through our website, however.

Whoops, my bad. I must have thought there were more than there really were for some reason.

Every subreddit starts suffering a decrease in quality once it gets bigger. The ones that haven't have very vigilant mod teams (e.g. and their 100-mod strong team).

I'm currently interning at Rentalutions and actually worked on the bitcoin project, so I can try to take some questions.

Yes. If you use billpayforcoins for rent, you have to inform your landlord and explain to them, etc. This is streamlined for tenants and landlords to minimize friction between the two and make it seamless for both parties.

Rentalutions isn't a Bitcoin startup - We've been around for over a year and our product has been in service for a few months.  We offer online property management services, and collecting rent online is one of these. Allowing tenants to pay via Bitcoin is one of the newest additions to our service.
In terms of the fee associated with Bitcoin - that's to cover the additional cost (for now) of transitioning Bitcoin to cash from tenant to landlords. We're aiming to reduce this fee to 0% as soon as we can.

No need to apologise, it was a misunderstanding after all.
I'm off work now so I can't run the answers by the cofounders before posting onto reddit, so I'll try to answer as well as I can.
Like you said, Bitcoin is a supplemental service that won't make/break the company. We're primarily in the business of helping landlords and tenants be able to conduct things such as signing leases, paying rent, etc. online so that there's no need to meet in person (and thereby waste time/money) to do any of that. Bitcoin as a concept has been intriguing to us, and starting to accept Bitcoin is something we're doing to expand our service and offer more options to our users.
When a wallet like you mentioned appears and offers lower fees and is easy to use and implement, I believe that we'll probably integrate that into our system. We do want to lower fees as well.
I've actually never heard of Pizza for Coins until you mentioned it, and it does seem like that kind of service won't last long once an easier way of paying with Bitcoins appears.
It was a good question though, feel free to keep them coming.

Hah, if only I had that kind of money.

We are trying to reduce the cost by lowering the fee as soon as we can.

You can't.

If there's enough interest here, and if they have time I will definitely try to do one.
