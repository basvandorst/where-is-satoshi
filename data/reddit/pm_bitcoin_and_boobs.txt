The initials are similar, but no, LN (Lightning Network) is not LTC (Litecoin).
Instead, this is something that runs on top of Bitcoin. Litecoin should probably be able to do the same thing, though.

Upvote for one hundred pound nerds.
I'm, like, half a nerd.

Mauled ... by a ... bear? I don’t care how clever a blockchain is, you can’t code around that.
I don’t even need to know the whole story. The one in my imagination is good enough.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:48:09
Just the one. Bitcoin was not involved.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:23:52
Hey! I'm in my early fifties and I'm hodling bitcoin! It's those late fifties geezers that are out of touch.
How much do I have? Not enough.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:26:24
Just take your stupid upvote.

D'oh! I forgot my color combination theory! I'll got hang my head in shame for the rest of the year.

That would make a green pill, wouldn't it? You would either end up as Kermit the Frog or the Hulk.

Fixed that for you.

I've seen a lot of screen shots lately of people googling "bitcoin ceo", and a bunch of people show up that should ***NOT*** be listed as such, like Warren Buffet. And Roger Ver.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:54:15
Yeah, the pic should read "Ledger" and "knaB".
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:27:08
There's no need for name-calling. Just say the name of the documentary.
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:16:17
Off topic much?

**Denarian**: Between 10 and 19 years old.
So, that was just a fancy way to say "teenager." Almost. (I know how old Bitcoin is.)
I'm as bull-crazy as the rest of you, but using an obscure word like that makes me not trust the rest of the report.
"Windows moment." Sheesh.

Don't by at ATM either.

What a good little bot you are!

Are you making fun of my word choice when I’m making fun of someone else’s word choice?
Because that’s hilarious. Upvote for you!
@_date: 2019-04-19 22:08:02
Huh. TIL. Thanks for the context. I knew about currency inflation due to shaved coins, but if I ever knew the name of one of the coins was the  denarius, I have forgotten.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:53:40
Me too! But I don’t watch it, so I had to look it up.

How does the bank foreclose if it has failed and is no longer a business?

I was with you right up until the Trilateral Commission image.

Hey, I was just reading a book about the creation of the Federal Reserve.
Seems to me that a country with a well-run central bank is essential to having an economy where the boom and bust cycles are smoothed out. Before the Fed was created, economic downturns were common and harsh. (Now they are not nearly as common.)

But he killed all those kids at Crystal Lake! Definitely malicious intent. Did you not see all those documentaries?

The whole book is available on GitHub. You don’t have to type in the sample addresses by hand.
Will have to read it again.

There’s an old joke; what’s the difference between capitalism and communism? In communism, man exploits man. In capitalism, it’s the other way around.

@_date: 2018-04-05 21:03:57
Whew! I just read a good book about the Fed, but not that one.
I read this one:
America's Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve
by Roger Lowenstein
It is clearly pro-Fed, and probably not full of crazy stuff.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:18:50
Except for Dash.
jk. I don't know anything about Dash.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:22:10

Hmm. That address has over 16 BTC in it, many sent this month (December, 2018).
Aren't transparent ledgers great?
