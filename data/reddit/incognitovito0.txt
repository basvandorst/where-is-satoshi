The argument here is not against the existence of fractional reserve systems, they serve a vital purpose in society. It is simply for a hedge against centralized set of institutions that have convinced individuals that they are the only "safe haven" for their wealth. Centralized banking in some form will always exist for lending to continue, but if individuals can adopt an established decentralized alternative to store and access their wealth, the healthy competition would keep banks in check.

Although traditional banks may not have directly inconvenienced you in any way, the government bailouts to banks in 2008, totaling to about 4.6 trillion dollars in tax payer money affected everyone, this money would have otherwise gone towards affordable healthcare, roads, disease prevention and other programs.

I think it runs a little deeper. A centralized company may solve the problem in the short term, but poor decisions could radically affect vulnerable people that chose to bank with them. If PayTM for example takes on loans to make poorly thought out acquisitions forcing it into bankruptcy, I would expect that the PayTM account for each person would be dissolved. Hell, even countrys have been forced into bankruptcy because of over-borrowing causing currencies to drastically inflate. This is the problem with centralization.
