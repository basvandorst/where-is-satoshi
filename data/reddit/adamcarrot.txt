If you don't control the private keys, you don't control the bitcoin. Make sure you get a wallet like Electrum, or better yet a hardware wallet like Trezor or Leger nano s so you have full control.

LN isn't Bitcoin. Even if there's any centralization using LN, Bitcoin itself stays decentralized on the main chain. You don't have to use LN if you don't want. Go back to r/btc

you bet! I've used it for years with no issues, Just realize that it's not quite as secure as if you were running the full Bitcoin software yourself. And remember a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S are far more secure than both.

@_date: 2019-09-17 19:32:28
You don't have control of the wallet if you don't own the private key. Using Block chain.info you rely on the website to do what you want it to do. That is why it's not safe to keep large amounts of money on any online based wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:44:11
What you are failing to understand is that the Bitcoin was not stored on your phone. The app just accesses a wallet that exists on the blockchain.info servers. Your phone didn't get hacked, the blockchain.info account did. You can access any blockchain.info wallet from any device as long as you have the user name and password. Seems that your user name and password was compromised in some way. You will likely never find out how.

@_date: 2013-04-23 12:40:22
It's pathetic how many people still claim they are being ripped off by Coinbase. How about this, understand the risks of using Coinbase before using it, or stay away.. If you decide to use Coinabase and have an issue, use their Email, PM Frank here on Reddit, tweet them and make the issue known. It's very likey they will whitelist your account if you are a legit customer. It's not that hard.

There is another version of this router without the external antenna port that has t regular power supply. It works good in my home. I would suggest having that one available if customers want it as well.
Another Great router to check out is the MikroTik RB751. We use those for a router rental program and don't have too many replacement issues. 
Also, the company I work for uses Ubiquiti almost exclusively for wireless P2MP and P2P. For the price point it's great.

It wasn't all for the charity, He wanted us to email the organizations that we donated to with a quick explanation of bitcoin and letting them know that taking bitcoin is an easy way to accept donations. So part of it was, indeed, for charity but part of it was to help spread the word about bitcoin in an attempt to get more people involved and spread the usage of the currency.

You just misunderstood. The problems that MtGox are causing to Bitcoin will possibly, over time, be alleviated by people going to alternatives and other means of buying coins.

This. 
Even if the Government was causing this, there are 9000 people in the queue on Mt.Gox waiting to buy. If it drops to $10 or something Those people will be extremely happy to buy cheap. 
Everyone Is buying and selling; I'm just sitting here holding.

Its pretty typical. But yes the run ups make it worse.

I believe your reading comprehension skills are lacking.

That's just the next fork. Be ready folks!

It appears that they may have updated the wording recently.

I had them before I saw this post, but I was kinda pumped when I looked at my phone this afternoon at about 3:00. Looking forward to see what Mt.Gox does and how it will affect the prices.

I just meant a few more days untill I get all the Transactions to get up to 100 started. At this time on coinbase I can only buy 10 at a time.

A great old typewriter I grew up playing with. Picked it up from my parents place in order to use it for this purpose.

I just managed to pull some from Coinbase about 30 seconds ago. If you want to buy GO GO GO! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:26:28
I too experienced this

Anyone using Coinbase should know the risks of using Coinbase before relying on them completely for something important. 
There have probably been around 100 of this same post on in the past. 
Email them, Tweet them, Make the matter known and if you are a legitimate customer they will whitelist your account.
I Highly recommend Coinbase

The lower case "L" works as the number "1" on this typewriter.

He just put up text that said something along the lines of "No there's no gif because I didn't see this one coming"

I'm sorry you feel that way, It really happened.

Knowing I sold 30% of my coin, doubling my investment and can now sit with popcorn for the next few years is comforting.

Reddit started offering Reddit Gold for BTC. That opened my eyes to BTC after hearing about it vaguely around the time it started. Decided that I wanted to get some coins.
Bought in using Coinbase during a 2 week period from late February into early March. 
Diversified a very small fraction, maybe $60 worth, of my BTC into litecoin not long before the April 1 LTC explosion. That gave me somewhere around a 50% return on my initial USD investment. I put quite a bit of it back into BTC.
Thoughtlessly sold about 20% of my BTC around the April crash due to emotion. Haven't really touched it since. 
Paper Wallets.

Really? gambling? all that I can lose now is unrealized gains. I can not lose my initial investment. I am no longer gambling. whether its $1 or $1,000,000 I can only win. There's nothing emotional about it, it's logic. Im in this for the long haul. I'm not going to sell anything else. And I've lost a LOT if unrealized gains today, it's not nearly as bad as losing the initial investment.

The Liberty Dollar was backed by silver and other metals. The ones holding the precious metals were arrested. I know bitcoins aren't physical coins, but I could see the same thing happening if there was a precious metal or other commodity backing the bitcoin. Keeping everything anonymous is probably the safest bet at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:31:18
It was 10 coins purchased on the 27th 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:12:52
I almost did the same thing, but the touch screen on my phone didn't register. Then I had a moment of doubt and didn't buy. In the long run you will be just fine :-) 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:45:18
I feel that over time we will adopt things like " μBTC" and "mBTC" as the standard. That would make it look more like you're actually buying full units.

I live near the Fatwallet offices. If i wasn't so introverted maybe I'd go talk to them in person! haha
