We will be looking into this. However, email records only show account creation and verification, and no transaction confirmations, so there is unlikely anything there.

Thank you, I haven't thought to do that. Isn't that a pretty insecure storage method though?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:29
Without disclosing details, we know for a fact there is a balance, and there is no indication it was meant to be a secret. The phone was actually wiped after he passed, by the way. I don't see it as a "trail of bread crumbs" situation. If you take the time to read the post, it's more that he set everything up and died before he could properly secure it all.

We are working on finding that, but also exploring other routes of recovery in case we can't find a seed.

I'll be sure to post an update down the road if anything changes. Thank you for your interest.

Good idea. What information does one need to access a cold storage wallet? Are they password protected?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:34:24
I may try this, but as I said, there's no evidence of account activity other than an account creation email.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:13:11
What exactly do you mean by safeguards? Like a "self-destruct"  protocol in case of unwanted access?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:19:35
Thank you. I will definitely try this.

No offense taken, it's definitely something I would be asking. To answer your question, I guess there's really no way for me to prove something like this. Especially not without disclosing any revealing information about him, his family, or myself. For what it's worth, I can't imagine that a thief would seek help from the public for this kind of thing.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I will only consider professional help as a last resort to avoid the associated fees and retrieve the full amount for his family. This whole ordeal has been a huge learning process for me, and I have resolved to research and understand the suggested methods so that I may do this on my own. 
In any case, I appreciate your input on the matter.

I will look into this. As you may have read, I found a loose HDD in his desk. If i were to back this up as well, do you recommend backing up both on the same HDD, or a separate one for each?

Do I risk losing access to files encrypted with windows if I reset the password? Similarly, do I risk losing access to files encrypted with some client for which I may have a key?

SSD over spinning media?

Could you explain what you meant in the last sentence, why it is important, and point me towards some useful resources on the topic?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:48
Will this allow me to access files with administrator privileges? I understand that some of these kinds of software just let you access the user account, and not necessarily reveal the password in place. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:19:14
I've considered this, but I only want to use it as a last resort. My friend taught me everything I know about computers, and we used to do tons of little coding projects when we were kids. It would give me an immense amount of closure to unravel all of this without going through a service, as if everything he taught me had some purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:37
Thank you haha. I can assure you that nobody will be given the wallet file.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:46
That's a great idea! I do do fear though that if they know their phone is linked to a coinbase account that they may be able to take control over it. Am i being overly cautious by thinking that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:03:43
Thanks. Is it possible to access the wallet file with just the private key without the password, seed phrase, or wallet address?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:35:22
Thank you. I will keep that in mind
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:41:06
If a dictionary attack on the wallet is successful, will it tell me which password was correct?
Are there ways to perform a dictionary attack on the desktop login screen as well?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:56
Is there a way for me to see whether or not the drive is encrypted? Additionally, would the user password be the one to decrypt it, or could it be something else?
