do you even do your own taxes? Are you unaware of the SALT changes? State taxes absolutely affect federal taxes.

for real, i've been around long enough to remember how convincing the people on bitcoin talk were. The ones that were making good arguments after the 32-&gt;2 drop off, that the bubble was burst, that bitcoin wasn't even worth a dollar. To think bitcoin could be worth thousands of dollars and there would still be people taking these arguments seriously makes me just laugh.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:28:53
So was your total tax bill more or less? You keep talking about tax returns like they are relevant to total tax bill. Once again I point out that if you did not just your withholdings this was entirely expected. 
You really aren't helping yourself here, saying your state taxes and federal taxes are never related when you needed to be educated on that not being true. If you did your own taxes you would know more.
The State tax deducion was changed so that it was capped. So if you live in a high tax state you would owe more on the federal return. Is that the case or not? The deduction is capped at 10k now I believe.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:17:57
The projection is strong. At the least you admitted you don't do your own taxes. So yeah, you confirmed you didn't know what you were talking about. Your tax return was not high because you were not withholding as much as you had been before.You confirmed for us you did not know what you were talking about. I don't need to "prove you wrong". You did that for us

hate to be a dick but this is a really bad question for numerous reasons
first of all there is no way to trust these kinds of records in a bitcoin blockchain. You would have to have faith in a trusted 3rd party "oracle" to submit this data to the block chain.
There is absolutely no way to keep track of a non-digital asset on a digital block chain without having to trust an oracle.\`
Simple example: "Someone broke into my home! they took my shotgun!"
"well that's not what the block chain says...says here you still have it. I guess the criminal hasn't certified he owns the gun now to the ATF. "

if there was a competing coin that had undeniably better features bitcoin could most likely just fork and steal that change, with consensus. the idea that there would be consensus in the market that shitcoin A would be better (worth more, sustained) than bitcoin but that there would not be consensus in bitcoin to steal shitcoin A's advantage is illogical

I want to talk about hard fork dynamics, specifically contentious hard forks.
I have spent time thinking about it, and it seems like the winner of a hard fork is determined very, veery quickly. It seems that since the miners have to go where the market value is (which is of course set by you, me, and every other user of the currency) and therefore they cannot risk mining the losing chain. It seems like this is determined within a week at the longest - if not sooner. 
Am I wrong in my conclusions? It just seems like the longer a hard fork goes, and the 'flippening' does not happen, the more unlikely it will ever be to happen.

Nah it's definitely censorship. They are not doing the same thing for the stock market equivilant to this. 
This is hardly a surprise, anyone who uses YouTube often should have been able to see the various ways they have implemented more controls in the previous few years.
They get all the scammers at the same time as legitimate youtubers so that way people can say "nah they just get the moonlambo fuck boys". When presented with evidence of the contrary the narrative shifts to "those were mistakes that YouTube will rectify". 
They start with censoring those everyone despises so that way no one says anything.

 This is a repost of mine to continue the discussion:
So can we talk about the clogged mempool in 2017? I know it's been forever ago but I just really am curious what are the theories to why it was so clogged.
I refuse to believe the nonsense that the mempool was clogged by normal usage and all those transactions have now gone to junk altcoins. That sounds stupid as hell.
Do we have any significant evidence to support the idea that it was indeed mostly driven by a spam campaign? It seems pretty obvious to me that it was largely manipulated to drive people to bcash. But I lack real evidence. 
Speculation: If bitmain is financially hurting, it probably started with them wasting the resources to spam the mempool

Okay, so according to your private defintion it is not a shitcoin. To me it is.
If i call it a "coin that promises lots of things that are never going to be delivered in a way the investors want, and it will likely trend to zero" would you be happy?

I had to send them a bitcoin transaction twice to try and get a bitpay card. The first one did not clear "in time" so it didn't count, and never got refunded.
The second one went through in time. The card never showed up. They would not claim they could speak to me about a 8$ purchase without me proving my identity to them, despite having the email account registered emailing them and everything.
They tried to get me to show them a utility bill or some crap. It's like are you serious? 
Never will do business with them again. Horrible company.

says the guy unironically 'investing' in eth. Lol. Talk about stupid.
"fuck you guys that want bitcoin to maintain its value over years, bitcoin shouldn't be a store of value fuck you I want it to go to 0 like eth and bcash"
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:06:07
Why should I pay them with superior money (bitcoin) and it costs more for me also? That makes no sense for me.
If they want my superior money then they have to give me a discount for me to even consider it. This isn't even considering the hassle I have to go through to pay with bitcoin in terms of my taxes. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:45:06
I guesssss it's better than nothing and in that sense is a bit of a solution
But when I think of a deep fake I don't think of something that snopes could debunk easily by just linking to the already existing original video. I think of stuff far worse.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:47:15
Don't understand the downvotes. 
  
Eth is absolutely a shitcoin. It's centralized af. If Vitalik decides something, everyone agrees. That's not what I signed up for. Proof of Vitalik will not work.
It's kinda funny tho because Eth only has value because they are headed by a really smart guy that everyone believes is a genius.

I insulted you by pointing out that you saying "google it" is lazy? You said that blockchains can do something, I said they cannot, and you did not back up your arguments. That is lazy. No need to get butthurt.

I love how people pretend that even a 10$ fee is suddenly too expensive to be a p2p payment method.
Where in the white paper is it specified what the maximum fee is supposed to be to be considered a p2p payment method?
I can send you bitcoin, p2p. It's p2p.

Just because I don't only transact in bitcoin doesn't mean I am not a user of bitcoin. That makes no sense.

Lolz get fucked kiddo, I've been around since 2013. How the fuck can you even derive this pointless comment from what I said? "
I believe you're projecting super fucking hard right now. You bought into all the roger ver nonsense, and you believe the altcoin bubble was caused because people NEEDED to send micro penny payments with no fees. You realize that the people autistically screeching for big blocks were just focused on the money right? Their (yours?) whole argument was that we NEEDED big blocks NOW because otherwise some shitcoin will rise up and steal all of bitcoin's value. That didn't happen when bitcoin had massive fees.
If bitcoin derived its value from low fees than why is bcash so worthless ? It is literally dying before our eyes while bitcoin is still worth thousands of dollars. The market has spoken, the value in the network has nothing to do with median fees.

So can we talk about the clogged mempool in 2017? I know it's been forever ago but I just really am curious what are the theories to why it was so clogged.
I refuse to believe the nonsense that the mempool was clogged by normal usage and all those transactions have now gone to junk altcoins. That sounds stupid as hell.
Do we have any significant evidence to support the idea that it was indeed mostly driven by a spam campaign? It seems pretty obvious to me that it was largely manipulated to drive people to bcash. But I lack real evidence.
@_date: 2019-01-31 17:56:22
Lol, so it's impossible for someone to take a recording with the express purpose of making it into a deep fake.
Unless you're insinuating that we need to enforce this, by law, so that recording software is forced to comply with this anti deepfake timestamping, then it will not work at all

If mining pools ran bitcoin seg2x and even bcash would have won the consensus wars
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:06:44
Yeah if anything its smarter for China to wait for the figure heads of the pools to get really rich in BTC then proceed with their state sponsored 5$ wrench attack.
Evil totalitarian states do not want to do the work. They want others to do the work, so they can then swoop in and take the benefits.
I'm also assuming that they haven't already "gotten" to these pools already - which is a massive assumption.

He never altered the emails. It was a translation app that changed minor words. People bought the story from Binance that doctored emails = no credibility. If you bothered to read the emails and saw the differences, you would know they absolutely changed nothing when put into context.
