Finally someone that agrees with me - all you have to do is look at the log chart and have a little faith in your investment
@_date: 2019-03-26 10:37:39

@_date: 2018-06-23 10:55:43
WOW WHAT CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE! THANK YOU FOR THIS INSIGHT LORD CRYPTO
@_date: 2019-08-28 07:05:38
dont forget this market is heavily manipulated so you have to factor that in
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:42:34
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:17:00
yeah they cant be bothered to do their own research on crypto so instead shout out what they hear on the news
@_date: 2019-02-26 10:33:47
Congrats bro!
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:11:41

Ah shit i just sent him my life savings in BTC! They had the same username and everything
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:02:20
yes it is, he’s lost loads of weight
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:28:14
16K will probably be achieved in the next few months lol
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:34:56
If Bitcoin ever reached that price i think that the % gains we would see during rally’s would be significantly less than previous years
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:03:48
Yeah literally, maybe even days at this point

I am as confused as you mate dw 
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:54:37
Rats and Bankers are synonymous
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:22:50
I think the bottom is a lot higher than that tbh, if BTC even hit like $3000 everybody would load up and price would recover instantly
@_date: 2019-04-18 09:02:28
Welcome to the club
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:09:05
the current sentiment doesn’t reflect any of your predictions.
Were gonna see increased volatility, as the news articles to come through so to do does FOMO, its extremely unlikely that we will trade sideways for Months
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:53:22
Lambo’s are overrated anyways
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:12:33
HAHAHA WHOS LAUGHING NOW BITCH THAT RESISTANCE GOT REKT,  and i made 200 pounds off of it . while u sat here and criticised others
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:46:36
you must be fun at parties
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:43:06
Yes i definitely see the power of charts (i don't see where i said anything bad about using charting????) , that is what i use as my info for TA, my point simply was that (excluding the hyper-inflated bull run in Dec) if an investor was to see the chart above then they would see the potential of the asset, the parabolic increase in volume also reflects interest in the asset.


you are however very condescending\^ This forum is for discussion, i am not 'learning' because i do not have to agree with what you say LOOL, i was commenting on the post above - this number means nothing to me i have been trading bitcoin for a long time and have invested at various price points. THE POINT i was alluding too was the fact that bitcoin has proven it has the potential to do crazy gains (183&amp; in a year whereas regular stocks may only see an increase in a few percentage points per annum. Please do not act as if you possess some form of esoteric knowledge on crypto or that you are 'teaching me' something lol
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:37:22
This really puts things into perspective, forget all the FUD that has been spread this year, as an investor if you were to see a commodity doing 183&amp; in a year then you know it is something special 
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:13:09
You were right my friend, look at how it obliterated that resistance 
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:43:09
Yes well done m8 for completely missing my point :) im saying if you were to look at the yearly performance of an asset which a lot of *investors* (not day traders) use as a main indicator of potential then 183% is a crazy figure.  
P.s I know what a chart is 
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:32:11
LTC will follow BTC bro
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:17:43
The bull never dies, he just goes into dormant mode
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:38:14
well its not but okay
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:39:56
ill wait for conformation once we break that triangle - at the moment every pump has been followed by a pretty large correction
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:39:27
Theres a couple dotted around, places like camden, brick lane etc...

Trying to write/re-write a constitution in todays political climate is asking for trouble. Think we would need to start from scratch if we want to actually have a system that can care for all facets of society, rich or poor.
What country are you from btw?
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:00:33
i get that you are trying to sound deep but it’s not working.
I understand the ‘pressures’ but it isn’t as simple as supply and demand, if there was a limited supply of money then you might have a point.
But Banks literally print and loan out money as they see fit. Methods such as Quantitive Easing disrupt the natural equilibrium of supply &amp; demand.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:41:58
agree 100% with what you are saying, personally i disagree on a moral level with charging 10% commission &amp; unfair rates - for something that can be done at very little cost (E.G Revolut free swaps). Especially, when the people that lose out most are workers who are sending money back home.
Other industries that can have inelastic demand such as Uber during peak times also use supply and demand (surge) which is understandable but when it comes to something as simple and easy as exchanging money i don’t think its fair on the consumer.
I think thats a reason why a lot of us support are behind Bitcoin because it doesn’t discriminate against any of its users
P.S i have no idea why you got downvoted lol its a pretty common occurrence on crypto subs
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:41:25
Greed and extortion*
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:20:39
the real question is, who here is taking profits?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:31:15
I agree but it definitely goes against the whole philosophy/ethos behind Bitcoin.
It becomes a problem when banks start manipulating policies and exploiting vulnerable people by dishing out ‘credit’ and loans they know people cant pay back.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:25:34
It was a joke my friend, they have too much control to completely disappear, i think we all know that by now :/
@_date: 2019-05-28 08:19:10
Fully, the rates + commission these scam artists charge is disgusting. Feel sorry for workers that bring back money to their families.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:28:52
I would never sell BTC cos i believe in the long term potential, however i think it is very risky to invest at this stage until we see a complete bottom out...
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:46:24
������ Lmao banks are gonna go extinct in a few years you’re all good bro
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:30:58
in 200 years we’d have probably bombed ourself out of existence or a meteorite lol 
don’t think we need to think that far ahead
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:01:57
*this is not financial advice*
imo its clear we’ve entered a bull market, if you buy in today however, you could see easily see a -2% to -5% in your portfolio in the short term. 
Personally, i believe that we are destined for huge gains in the near future (next 6 - 12 months) so if you’re day trading then id say keep buying the dips (that way your average price per coin decreases). Taking profits when we bounce and carrying on the process...
If you are a long term investor then this is prime time to invest. The tech is constantly evolving and improving. The market cap of CryptoCurrency is minuscule compared to other commodities/markets. We have got a lot of room to grow!
