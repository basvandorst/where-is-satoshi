Only a good idea if you know how far down it's going to go

I recently started a homeless outreach program : see here
We begin filming, donating, and providing gifts and shelter in a few months, this being a passion project funds are very, very tight. Debt tight.
Between camera and audio equipment, and the rest of the funds that come from charity work, we could use all the help and support we can get.
Even if its just a like on the page! Seriously, its appreciated.
Website is currently being worked on and unfortunately on the side of things where funds fall short, good websites are not cheap and I'm no programmer or designer.
But this will continue with or without any donations, but it could definitely help.
This isn't my first project, I'm an ex syndicated radio personality and I've had multiple successes in entertainment.
Major details of the project are not something I can come out in public to speak of, but have sent information in the application.
Currently forming the 501.3c required to solicit and distribute funds on behalf of the homeless, This is also unfortunately not cheap either.
I've already put over 10,000 into the project, and while things will continue with or without help, it will be much much slower and with far less reach without help, resulting in less  of those in need being helped.
I hope to hear from you, either way - what you are doing is fantastic! Much love and respect.

Website is currently being worked on (and unfortunately the side of things where funds fall short, good websites are not cheap and I'm no programmer or designer)
But this will continue with or without any donations, but it could definitely help.
This isn't my first project, I'm an ex syndicated radio personality and I've had multiple successes in entertainment, success being relative.
Major details of the project are not something I can come out in public to speak of, but would be more than willing to give full details in private.
Currently forming the 501.3c required to solicit and distribute funds on behalf of the homeless, even though I am not taking any profit or percentage. This is also unfortunately not cheap.
Things I can afford and have already paid for.
1. Film and Audio Equipment (5k worth)
2. Flights and Lodging (starting in the Philippines, where I've made friends with many less fortunate people, and getting people into homes is much more manageable)
3. Dinner, clothing, food, care packages. (Though more is always nice)
Things I need help with
1. Website development and coding (not a simple site, looking at 5-10k for something professional and secure. Not Wix, or Wordpress or the equivalent)
2. 501.3c fees (around 1000$)
That's pretty much it.
I'm willing to sign any necessary documentation that any donations would go directly towards said project.

Its pretty common in here

Right? Im surprised at the lack of volatility, and even more surprised no one is saying anything about it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:54:47
Thanks :) Now if only I can work my way past $1000 of bitcoin and eventually get a full coin! I wanted to put in at 4k but got distracted by life. Now I'm way behind!
But I'm here. Better late than never.

Use the website

Lol! I am pretty new, but it seems to behaving weirdly compared to what I had seen before futures. Including some odd stability.

I suppose you're right. I see the gains for me at such a low amount so minuscule I haven't even really considered that more than a pipedream ~ but wise advice none the less. &lt;3

Coinbase is a verifiable shit show right now

You don't know what a bubble is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:54:10
17,800 for me :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:13:03
the key definition of a market bubble is that prices rise materially above the fundamental value of the asset. Since there is no such a thing as a fundamental value for Bitcoin, the discussion is pointless.

Can't be verified with mobile app at this moment.
