You don't need to force them. They will switch pools by themselves to avoid problems, so their BTCs will not lose value.

A 51% pool is a losing one. And everytime a pool gets near that point, people move on their own to others till it gets down to 40-45%.

Yes, you have a higher chance, but a 50% hr BTC is worth more than a 51% hr BTC, since they are worth 0.
If someone controls that much, every transaction made from that point on won't be valid, they all could be made up.

To confuse bots upvoting threads.
When your account is silently banned you still see the upvotes but they don't count, so botters had accounts that just observe if the voting accounts are working. This way they can't know for sure.
There was a post talking about it on but I can't seem to find it.
