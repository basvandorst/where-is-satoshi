You're right, thanks for the hint. The code is still work in progress.

You're sending money to US from another country - you won't pay in USD. Don't forget about the exchange rate margin (~0.5-3%). Nice remittance cost breakdown can be found at the [World Bank website](

The funds are sent within 8 business hours. Yes, this could improve. However, the total % fee with Coinee is less than 2% and we hope this will be the deciding factor.

Good point. Will be discussing that with ATM operators.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:41:06
I like what you do. I run an app trying to calculate remittance costs with bitcoin ( It only uses existing bitcoin ATM network at the moment, but I'm thinking of extending this to services like yours. Keep up the good work guys.

What do you expect to be the most popular way of receiving money, personal pickup or bank transfer? And could you please elaborate on the last option - receiving the funds at home or office, how does it work?
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:01:18
These are the total fees for the end consumer. ATM operator keeps ~1% of the transaction, the other ~1% is taken by coins.ph.
@_date: 2014-10-14 10:15:27
Right, not any amount, I stand corrected. Also, you're absolutely right about the fees hidden in exchange rates. On the other hand, using the world bank averages can be misleading as we are targeting only a specific portion of this market. Again, I'm trying to do the same thing here: make it easier for ppl to send money back home. I just wanted to share my findings: the opportunity is not as huge and revolutionary as presented almost everywhere in the media.

There's been a lot of buzz around bitcoin remittances lately. I am a huge fan myself. But don't get overexcited before you see the numbers.
For example, you can send any amount of money to Philippines with Xoom for $5. Compare it to the cost of aquiring bitcoins, sending it to Phils, exchanging to pesos and delivering: ~2% (very optimistic estimate). That makes bitcoin suitable only for transactions under around $200, while average size is more than $300.
There certainly is market for bitcoin remittances, but it's much, much smaller than $400B. How do I know? I've been working on  Anyway, I like what you're doing guys, keep up the good work.

In the Philippines, the exchange and delivery is facilitated by [coins.ph]( It usually takes one business day when depositing to a bank account. Other methods (like door-to-door delivery) can take longer. This is not unusual.

The whole process of buying btc, sending it to Philippines and exchanging to pesos takes only a couple of seconds to complete, so the price change is usually insignificant. To prevent the customer from receiving less than we promised, we estimate possible price drop and include it in the total fee. Then when the price drops, customer receives exactly the amount he expected. If the price stays the same or rises, customer receives more money than he expected. Conclusion: customer is always protected.

This bitcoin ATM instantly buys bitcoins for you and sends them to Philippines to be instantly exchanged to pesos. It's super easy:

Neither remittance senders receiving salary in bitcoin nor remittance recipients spending bitcoin in a local shop will lift the cost of exchanging from/to fiat, it will only pass it to the employer/merchant (unless there's some kind of closed-loop bitcoin economy). What we need right now is easier access to bitcoin, 3% buy margin is killing these remittance initiatives.

Please, not again. For an automated exchange you need centralization simply because most of the liquidity is provided by bots who require low latency trading interface. I really don't get this "war on everything centralized" psyche here. Want to avoid banks? Use

There is a new website for hotel booking with bitcoin:  (currently covers Prague)

Let us help you understand then. What do you think would help you to get the big picture?
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:38:58
Interesting, I thought  was always full of developers hungry for bitcoin projects. Can you share your ideas publicly for anyone to comment on them or is a private conversation required?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:28:40
Fair enough. I also want them both, having choice is always a good thing. I'll try to be more constructive now and suggest you look into Mastercoin, they've already done that (sort of). 
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:50:07
Good point. Working fiat interface plus professional security and customer support is not very common these days.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:06:04
This is something ppl are already working on. The solution is called the "payment protocol" and it should be released in Q1 2014. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:18:16
It doesn't require a third party, but it's so much easier with it. The easiest way today is to use a payment processor like Bitpay ( In my city I helped several businesses start accepting bitcoin. We found then that although the bitcoin volume was not significant, it was a great marketing move. Hopefully that will change. Don't know about the physical card, I personally don't really like to carry my card around, but that can be just me.
