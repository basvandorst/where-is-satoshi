virwox works fine so far with paypal , you are not buying bitcoin with paypal here , you are using paypal to deposit funds to your virwox account usd/gbp/eur and then buy sll (second life Linden dollars) which you then trade for bitcoin and withdraw, 
first time you use them it does take around 3 days for your bitcoin to clear , but after your second or third time, its instant. 
this way it does cost a little more than buying from bitstamp , but it does the job if you only want to buy small amounts of bitcoin at a time.

yes i know i am not trusting bitcoin with bitusd, it is pegged to bts.
the reason i became a fan of bitcoin was because of the decentralization and independence. if bitshares can provide a fully decentralized exchange then their sevice has value and their pegging system can work.
i follow many coins, especially coins that provide a service.
nxt , namecoin, maidsafe, storj, skycoin...etc
the add on services bitshares provides to the bitcoin ecosystem are ones i am looking forward too.
and yes you are right there is no perfect pegging system, but the one i have heard from bitshares is the best so far.

glad to see a ubuntu phone finally comming out.
but will wait for the neo900, where i have a choice of what to install (i hope).
@_date: 2015-02-11 17:10:57
 its a open phone, no need to unlock.
would love to tinker with this thing. 
quote from website:
Most importantly, the Neo900 is an open platform, carrying on in the tradition of the Openmoko project. Neo900 will support all operating systems available for GTA04 (QtMoko, SHR, Debian, Replicant, ...) and should serve as a great platform for porting systems like Maemo, Ubuntu or Firefox OS - or even for writing your own one! We bring the hardware, you choose your OS.

i dont want to trust coinbase, the point of bitcoin is that it lets me hold my private keys, trusting coinbase is like trusting paypal.
