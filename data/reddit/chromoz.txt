I agree. Seems like MyCel is trying to figure out best ways to monetize. They seems to be coming up with many new stuff as listed here 
I'm keeping an eye on SAM and hopefully, we will see one solid BTC wallet in the coming months. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:24:09
MyCelium highly recommended.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:15:43
Interesting conversation..
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:28:15
Ahh..Apologies for the same. Was using a Mic but it wasn't great enough! Next time will be using better Mic.

Not so popular in India. Localbitcoins is your best bet!
@_date: 2016-11-06 08:53:39
They need more active users. Using it from last 4 days and yet to see volume game.
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:24:58
What's the best way to make my BTC truly anonymous?
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:50:19
Just tried Gemini. They don't offer accounts in India yet. :|

@_date: 2016-11-08 19:56:00
Yah going to Airport tomorrow for booking my tickets!
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:52:46
If you give them your receiving Electrum Wallet  address, it wont be any problem!
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:02:13
Even converting Fiat money to BTC takes time. But I like them coz of their conversion rate. Waiting for them to increase my limit.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:16:15
The only sad part is, now its way costlier to buy using cash!
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:52:09
This is not at all true.... 
I see no body listed name of companies/sites who are accepting BTC. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:18:40
Good days are over. U are late in joining the party ;)

@_date: 2016-11-26 18:51:05
Now the price is correcting its course in India.
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:33:31
Let me try Kraken.com
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:55:05
This will definitely foster Bitcoin market in India. Sad, I might not be able to get Bitcoins for cash anymore  :|

Had a word with Stripe team &amp; this is what my rep. from Stripe told me (IN short: this won't last more than a week )
We've done our best to push the boundaries and grow the mentality of our financial partners since the beginning. Unfortunately, our partners tend to be very financially conservative and decline working with any business that sells virtual currency. They classify this industry as high risk because it's very difficult to keep an eye on how funds are moving to ensure they're only being used lawfully and according to our partners regulations.
This particular industry is classified as "high risk" by our banking partners as it's historically been prone to a rather high chargeback rate in the past. For these reasons, I'm afraid our partners decline working with any business that sells virtual currency.

Ha ha..

@_date: 2018-04-12 21:17:24
Same issue. It says the transaction is rejected by the network. Any solution?
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:28:28

@_date: 2016-10-30 12:22:50

@_date: 2017-07-06 03:57:40
I have one Ledger Nano. I actually order this to review on my site... I do it out of passion :)
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:55:35
The fees are  35-40% of the invoice amount + Taxes + $8 to keep the Trezor in Custom for more than 48 hours. Insane! 
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:56:57
lol :p

I usually use my Bike to generate electricity.
I have 12 kids &amp; everyone work alternatively 30 minutes to peddle the bike.  It's profitable but they eat a lot! 
Not sure how I can minimize my food cost. Any suggestion?

@_date: 2017-07-06 03:56:16
