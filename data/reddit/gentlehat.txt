At least 50% quicker for me - the checkpoint seems to be the only thing in the change log that sounds like it could effect loading speeds.

It would certainly require careful planning - but theoretically the idea works. 
Like in this example situation, if there was potential that hundreds of players would die with "expensive" virtual items on them (thus loosing them to the game world) then there would be a near equal risk reward for going to attempt the task. The players have an opportunity to make money, as does the game. The balance between the two would be very important though.
MMORPG's implement various things to take virtual currency out of the game (to prevent too much of it being introduced and thus becoming worthless) - the same would apply here, except it's actually Bitcoins being transferred from the players to the game world itself - where it then has the opportunity to be transferred back to the players.

The internet unfortunately is controlled by the people who provide it, Internet Service Providers, most of which are large, law abiding corporations.

It is possible, however, for Bitcoin or any digital software/cryptography to become illegal (however unlikely) and therefore potentially stomped out of existence. If multiple governments were up against losing control of currency - it's possible.
