The day of the event!

Where's my 10 bucks.

January, I promise!

Which store is this?
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:03:05
Looking forward!

Hello you brilliant bitcoin people. I'm the organizer of the event and want to see you there. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make the trip easier.

These ticket prices are the lowest of any bitcoin conferences. 
It is very expensive to run a conference, get speakers, love broadcasting of Free Talk Live, audio visual, and more. 
Plus, there's a 20% off if you use the code "welovebitcointalk".

What about destinia?

When checking out using bitpay, the bottom right of the invoice shows the exchange rate. Click it to see the BTC/XXX exchange rate they use. Also check out 
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:55:09
Haven't checked.

@_date: 2014-03-02 18:48:57
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:06:22
We are refunding the people that paid more.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:32:52
I tried on bol.com, one of the largest.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:11:19
We've decided to make this the biggest community event in bitcoin. Feel free to share the link with all your friends!
@_date: 2014-04-25 07:15:24
I'll give you the five bucks for those credits if it'll help you stop posting complaints about good services trying to improve the ecosystem.

Cost for this conference is $100. 
Cost to produce conference is upwards of $150,000.

Hi there - happy to send you a couple for free.

Are you looking forward to the Chicago conference?

Hi guys, 
Unfortunately this is going to be too soon to arrange an ATM (I think), but I will have one in Amsterdam in early April which may be able to move around the Netherlands. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:32:13
So I have two accounts now. I have a xapo account where I can see the transaction history and conversion. 
I also have an account on the debit card's site which gives me the name of the merchant and the charge. 
About number 2, it is the same thing. The debit card site shows it all.
The third point, yeah. looks good. 
Don't know the answer to the other questions.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:17:00
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:29:46
Right now, there is no fee I am aware of. 
Didn't have a fee when spending, didn't have a deposit fee, and didn't have an issuing fee.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:06:09
Obviously haven't tested it yet. 
The guys at Xapo are working extremely hard to make this possible. I'm optimistic about them.
If this works, you can use your bitcoin **anywhere**. That's a big step for mankind.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:18:12
Hi there, it's Moe. Personal account.
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. 
The conference I organize has a controversial speaker on stage for 30 minutes, answering questions from the community, which seems to have many questions.
I am happy answering any questions, but my employer has nothing to do with this. 
For the record, I do not support Josh Garza nor Paycoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:26:44
Another solid partnership. factom knows how to collaborate to build our the market. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:52:48
Which is why I think it's so impressive that the Dutch even consider using bitcoin when their systems are so good. Like really good. Fast cheap and efficient. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:53:22
It'll work out. Where are you located, maybe someone here can help with buying locally?
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:38:29
Also they can't just deny your purchase. The banks put delays on sending and receiving so when you initially order, coinbase only had the money a few days later. Then they realize there's been a mistake and it takes the banks a few days to transfer the money back. Coinbase works instantly with the data they receive. The issue is in the time delays from the bank. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:38:51
I find it very helpful to just recommend people read about bitcoin online, and if they have any questions hand them a card. Many people think you may be trying to shake them down when you mention money and paying for things. It's useful to just come across as a resource of information.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:50:23
It's not a bad business. There was an error and you're getting your money back. As is often the case with the bitcoin community and bitcoin companies, there are not enough resources to handle the load. You were not scammed, you just didn't make the 200 bucks you could have by speculating on the price. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:24:55
From So you've heard about Bitcoins? Well, this type of currency is something you will assuredly never handle in person like the US Dollar, but you may eventually write checks for Bitcoin amounts in the same way that you currently do for USDs.
"What country are they from?"
Every country. People make them at home on their computer: each Bitcoin is just a bunch of digital data that exists on computers and the internet.
"So how do you stop counterfeiters?"
Well, there's a lot of math involved. And I'll be honest with you: I don't even understand it myself. But essentially, computers can check each Bitcoin to make sure that it isn't a forgery.
"That sounds too complicated for my people."
Not much more complicated than the work that goes into the modern printing press. Have you seen how intricate each dollar bill is? You could potentially use them without breaking your religious obligations if you could find a bank that is willing to allow you to write checks in Bitcoin amounts, but there is no need for that. I don't even use them. But, they are a universal currency that may become more popular (and stable) in the future. So if the US dollar ever completely loses its value like German currency after WW1, you can start trading in Bitcoins rather than dollars.
Edit: gramur an' wurds
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:49:24
I don't think there are any - and though it would be a useful service - maybe the press associated with "BUY DRUGS WITH BITCOIN IN AMSTERDAM" would be bad press indeed.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:06:35
bitonic.nl they don't always have coins available, but when they do -- buy buy buy ;)
ninja edit: It only works for people with a Dutch bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:42:44
9flats.com is really the only one so far. A lot of hotels are unionized and everything needs to go through layers upon layers of bureaucracy. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:10:25
It's NOT?!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:22:35
Just let them know that it's useful, can potentially save them money (as a merchant). It's like the Yen, the Rupee, or any other currency, but it's a currency that's meant to be used digitally. Like Paypal. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:41:29
Let me know when they start accepting bitcoin! Would love to give them my business / let's make a meetup there! 
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:06:32
Good idea. Send me an email, we could have it at the conference next month. m (at) theconference.eu
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:36:39
Hope it works out. Be patient. They're good people. 
Also, please don't spend money on bitcoin that you may need somewhere else. 
Good luck. I'm sure in a few months we'll all look back on this with fond memories of how hard it used to be to buy bitcoin.

Organizing a conference in Amsterdam next month. Could be cool to have these awards at the show, though there's little lead time.
