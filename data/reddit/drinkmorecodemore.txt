Congrats man!
You have earned it. Thank you for running an Electrum server :)

This post is how I know you have no idea what you are talking about.
It's not expensive at all. Advertising on Instagram has been integrated into the Facebook ads platform and it's easy as fuck to setup &amp; use. It's only as expensive as you want it to be.

They seized the servers and installed an exploit that phoned back home.
LE is not going to sell valid stolen CC info.
@_date: 2019-08-27 00:47:42
How will the fans defend this one? BSV should go straight to $0.00.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:36:29
Because LE cannot sell valid stolen CC info + vendors have reviews. A vendor with 100s of positive reviews of sold CC info is going to be legit.

 ONE SHOULD USE THIS WEBSITE
OP is a known scammer that uses multiple reddit accounts to shill these scams and bs marketplaces. 
For evidence of this you can see these two newly created reddit accounts that are now shilling this scam. Look at the two pinned posts at the top of each profile:

I know the PR is sorta dated but I just called and the receptionist confirmed they do indeed take Bitcoin! :)

Oh hey it's the scammer with another account. 
Thanks for making it so easy and exposing yourself! I'll be sure to get this account suspended/banned as well!

Mark is a shitty programmer and he should have never been allowed to be the CEO of Mt Gox. I cant believe he hasnt been assassinated yet.

Mark Karpeles is a shitty programmer and he should have never been allowed to run MtGox as CEO or make any decisions.
Just reading his name pisses me off.
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:37:41


They actually dont. They would subcontract out a 3rd party to do it for them. You highly overestimate the power and capabilities of the FBl.

Someone could just make a domain like LBCreddit.com that just 301/302 redirects to LBC main domain so it could still be used here.

This is not true. I smoked crack with him last year at a bitcoin related conference. It was awesome.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:15:09
I agree, I'm just saying how it was done in this situation was illegal.
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:15:10
Governments also hate it when foreign actors assist an active military employee to crack a password hash that then gives them the ability to exfiltrate classified data. So yeah that's where the conspiracy charge fits if proven true.
[The chat log here is pretty damning](
Manning gives Assange the LM hash of "80c11049faebf441d524fb3c4cd5351c" and then Assange goes "Passed it onto our im guy".
If there is additional evidence of Assange successfully cracking it and then giving it back to Manning who then used it to gain access and dump the classified intel. That's certainly illegal.

That was the FBI and dea manipulating the situation and getting their handlers to convince him he needed to do that.

How did this turn out for you? Are you still running a pruned bitcoind?
I'm looking into implementing something like this but only keeping the most recent block history going back 1.5-2 months. Using DigitalOcean and a rather beefy server so mem isnt an issue but hdd space is.
Additionally, are you running a wallet on your pruned bitcoind?

I remember getting into Verge pre-wraith protocol. I thought it was gonna be the next big thing, hooooboy was I wrong. The entire team and coin is a giant scam. I've enjoyed seeing it fall from the top 50 and now hovering around  I've been banned from the XVG sub for trying to warn others but lol c'est la vie.
Let's see what a cluster fuck it has been:
\- 51% attack (three times lol)
\- Copy and pasted code
\- XVGWhale and John McAfee meetup and shill
\- 2017 NYE and wraith protocol fiasco
\- Sunerok being a shitty leader and dev
\- PornHub "announcement" that was really just a pump and dump and marketing scheme
\- The sub censoring or banning anyone who criticizes XVG
If you want to read more about the dumpster fire that is Verge:

This is correct. You can use a CC to instantly buy bitcoin with Coinbase. I have my account setup to automatically purchase $50 worth of bitcoin every Wednesday. I'm always surprised when I login and see how much BTC I have accumulated. 
Since OP will have a new account, I'm sure CB has some kind of anti-fraud measures in place that might slow him down a bit but you can still buy BTC with CC instantly once you get all verified.
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:28:09
Damn. Sorry to hear that. I've had my CB account for a few years now and have never had any issues. I would suggest contacting support again (i know i know). They usually reply to my tickets within ~24 hours. If no response, maybe try creating a brand new account using a new email and setting everything up again w a fresh start.

They also make thousands of dollars per month off advertisement banner spots. $9/day is just someones whiskey fund $.

I hope so. That kid def frauded everyone and deserves prison time for it.
