Yeah but they launched the credit cards and made money with it. They cant control bitcoin, they cant charge you for anything. So they cry.

But how would you know the adresses of everyone? Each address would have to be linked to a validated identity. Which it is not now, unless I am mistaken? Else they have to voluntarily give them to you? 
For this to work the whole world would have to use the same currency as well. 
Because what’s to stop those people who have something to hide from exchanging fiat/BTC to hide their money? 
The people in power outside the west would never allow this to happen. And a lot of people in the west are against it. 
I love the idea, and I hope digital currency that has full transparency becomes the future. But right now I feel it is a pipe dream that is far removed from reality.

So you can see that 1 BTC goes from A to B but you cant know who either A or B is?
Seems like this system would be easy to hide ownership of money with. Unless we start requiring ID for every purchase.

Wow, great input. Really puts things in perspective. 
Is it possible to be more vague?

Hmmm okay fair points, but how would you know who owns what address? Whats to stop people from owning many adresses and not disclosing them?

Aha, thank you very much for taking the time to answer. Now I understand what you meant by «Know your Customer laws» which I have never heard of. English is my second language as well so its probably called something else here. 
So assuming BTC or a 2nd/3rdt etc generation version and know your customer laws we could see who buys what.
