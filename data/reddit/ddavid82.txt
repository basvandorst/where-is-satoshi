The question is valid if you want to discuss philosophy and the "human condition" or whatever. I just don't know why he picked a senator to ask. He can't change it or anything. 
The question is invalid /in this context/ because he doesn't want the answer. It's just a stage to make the man look bad, and that is an asshole thing to do. If Sanders or anyone else wants to look bad, they can do it themselves.

That's more what I meant. I couldn't even make out what he was actually after, he was just trying to bait Sanders into contradicting himself with philosophy. It seemed a valueless question, which is why I disagree he got rekt at all. 
If he had said "Yes, citizens can initiate force against each other," then he looks bad; if he says "No, we don't," then he just gets asked why we can delegate that authority. The whole line of questioning is just to make him look bad, which is nonsensical because he fights so hard for each and every American (except, maybe, a small, exceptionally rich minority).
I suppose maybe I just miss the value of arguing politics vs. philosophy.

He didn't get "REKT" at all... In fact, he clearly showed a more developed thought process throughout, and, while maybe he should have said "no" earlier and a little more forthright, he answered his question. As much as you would like to tote your voluntarism philosophy, the questions were entirely irrelevant, and clearly had the sole intent of discrediting the senator.
Sanders has an incredibly well thought-out and developed concept of democracy. While you may not agree with his viewpoints, as is your right, I think one can objectively say he was in no way "REKT by voluntarism philosophy."
