Are you implying the money for bitcoin based companies is fleeting? Then perhaps their name change and less direct focus on btc is indeed the right move.


They're doubling down on cryptocurrencies with the introduction of the new voxel and more to come.  If anything that probably scares off old money more than bitcoin does..

They are in the finance space covering all forms of value, including Bitcoin. Placing Bitcoin on the same level as all currencies making it seamless to convert. This post is a perfect example of them helping and including new users from all over the world providing a gateway to onboard to btc.  What better way than to help spread adoption? 
Your right about corps running from top down. Uphold is a startup..a corporation by law yes, but in its operations I seriously doubt. 
Like many startups with growing pains, their ethos is unset.  It's been a few months and so far they continue to support btc equally as all other currencies, and it continues to represent a large % of their holdings...If the CEO followed through or the org actually took that perspective to heart, btc would probably have been cut off completely already. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 04:22:55
Why do you care what the CEO had said? If you dabble in their service you can tell they clearly support bitcoin and make for an easy exchange/wallet.  All of these companies are riddled with different perspectives and thoughts regarding Bitcoin at one point or another

They're a terrible scam then... They have not only saved me money but have yet to take a dime from me. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:21:59
Yes, except for they enable people from all over the world who had previously not been able to access bitcoin, to convert their local currency to bitcoin at no additional cost, on-boarding new bitcoin users by the masses in untapped countries and being the first to finally bring bitcoin to the same playing field as all other currencies.  Besides this you are absolutely correct.

Buying gold is like buying real estate. It's an asset, which potentially could be used to transact, but not likely or highly used/accepted. Do you transact with gold?

Good sir you may be misinformed. Let's not confuse the people of the Internet.  Bitreserve mimics the blockchain traceability technology via what they call the Reservechain, while its feed of transactions with its users is called the Reserveledger. Both data sets can be downloaded from their [transparency page](

They are a Bitcoin company because they use Bitcoins underlying technology, many know it as blockchain technology. Mimicking Bitcoin and tying its tech to fiat currencies allows the cost of running Bitreserve vs traditional financial systems to fall so much that for the first time the scenerio of creating a bank without countless fees (transactions fees, currency conversion fees, transaction delay) and with transparency is practical. Before the blockchain existed, to do auditing of every transaction in real time and find a secure way to publish that information without compromising that database was extremely difficult, and doing so feelessly was near impossible.

I like money in the cloud and I like cash in my hand. What am I signing up for?
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:20:32
This may be true at the moment as they are only starting to ramp up however due to their reserve focus, their aim could potentially be holding all value outside of banks by means of cash in reserves (similar to how they hold gold bullion in reserve for users). 
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:49:05
Like a bank, they hold your value. However rather than issuing an insecure IOU with various fees and limitations attached, they hold your value denominated in various currencies/commodities of your choosing (creating liquidity in new assets), allow you to move this value frictionlessly (0% conversion/transaction fees) and instantly by way of bypassing traditional banking barriers, and always show a real-time proof of solvency of assets, creating a new standard of security that may riddle the banking industry with change - I hope. Traditional banking barriers which add fees and remove transparency have proven to work, obviously, as they provide accurate auditing of transaction and provide enough trust for the public. However, Bitreserve is on to something here as they are able to leapfrog other banks by offering the same service but with more transparency, less fees, less friction. I despise walking in to a bank to set up an new account, it's clear they want your money and more, and neglect your need of time. If I can find all, if not more, of the accuracy and security of tradition banks, while also paying less in fees, from the comfort of my own home, I am sold.

It = Bitreserve. The Reserveledger seems to be for off-chain transactions (value solely moved within their platform) and ties to the Bitcoin blockchain when using value from a Bitreserve account to send to a wallet outside of Bitreserves platform. Hopefully a rep from Bitreserve can chime in

Although they have the ability, they claim not and compare [their rates]( vs other exchanges.  Obviously its not in their best long-term interest to claim they don't while doing so, and everything they have done seems to be for the long-term.

Curious, what makes you think that Coinbase, Circle or any other btc wallet provider (or even fiat bank for that matter) isn't short at one point or another in any of their holdings?
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:29:17
It seems space and time have colided within the deep web. A Bitreserve user from the future, trying to withdrawal in our present day, but his past. I am curious how this plays out as I too have much of my value stored in Bitreserve, in the near future.

Everything that consistently works and is for the masses is centralized... Google, Visa, Apple, Reddit..Uphold
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:32:42
As they were moving towards it originally and this hasn't paid off, just like many other Bitcoin based startups, they're taking a step back and reevaluating bitcoins true value proposition. For Uphold, this value is that Bitcoin was the first use case showing that people are willing to hold their value in the cloud. I doubt they will completely remove it from their system as the $3.5 billion Bitcoin economy is still a sizable market.

Isn't this better? You no longer have to worry about holding .1 ounces of gold in your pocket and to physically shave off .002 ounces for a $5 cup, while still having all of the benefits of holding a stable form of value? Better yet now you can even send the gold around the world and not have pay for a service like a Brinks to manhandle your precious metal for you.

Sure. 
Which facts would you like backed up?
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:34:28


How is this any different then your standard bank and using your credit/debit card to purchase something?  Banks hold your cash in the bank and effectively give you an IOU of which you can digitally transfer to someone else when making a purchase or sending funds electronically.  Uphold does the same exact thing, just passing its savings onto the consumer as their expenses are relatively incredibly low. Not to mention the IOU banks give is not actually backed by its promised value, if everyone went to the banks at once to cash out the IOUs (balances), they would provide maybe the first 10-20% with cash and wouldn't be capable to provide value promised to the other 80%.  As Uphold holds its entire value of IOUs in a liquid reserve, they would be able to provide 100% of their members with the value promised.


There absolutely does have to be gold involved, and there is, just like how cash needs to be involved at a bank, you can't just print money by changing digits or promise to tie someones value to gold without actual gold behind...Uphold purchases gold on your behalf held in a vault in Switzerland, and when you use it to purchase or send to someone, they just adjust their internal ledger while still having ownership of the actual gold.  It's brilliant if you think about it, it reduces an incredible amount of fees for both the sending and receiving party - [see how Uphold holds gold](  
Before you start making these claims, please actually look into the facts behind your statements as the defamation many of these companies get is due to the uneducated speaking out prematurely.

Me thinks your numbers are off, they have $6,550,000 worth of Voxels, not Voxels themselves.  So last month they had 110,600,000 Voxels and now they have about 43,000,000 Voxels.  I suppose this means people are moving them around.

Dude, they did one better than a bank and responded right on this thread, within 2 hours of its post. I don't see any 24/7/365 bank support doing that.
