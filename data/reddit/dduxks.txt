Why no paper wallets? To me it’s the easiest thing to understand. One side secret the other public. The scary part is when you actually use your private key on a computer. Is a hardware wallet really superior to paper wallet? Is a hardware wallet somehow less susceptible to leyloggers or other methods of stealing keys?

Gresham’s law doesn’t define good money it merely predicts the outcome of two moneys in competition. 
Based on how it’s behaving it sure appears to be the good money in comparison to the dollar. It’s rare for people to spend bitcoin , it’s common for them to turn their fiat into bitcoin and hoard it.

If no one sold the price would be zero.  
Gresham’s law predicts that bitcoin will never be used as a means of exchange but as good money it will be hoarded.

Really?? Says the guy with no proof.  
In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.
Bitcoin is the good money. This is why hodl is the paradigm. 
You will soon see a mad rush to exit fiat as the malfunction of the dollar becomes more and more evident. This is the true role of bitcoin as a mechanism to capture global fiat inflation.

That’s a very narrow definition of good money. It’s entirely possible to extend Gresham’s law to situations that are beyond the conditions of the nominal values of different commodity coins. Good money can also have these characteristics. 
An ideal money material should possess the following qualities:
General Acceptability:
Indestructibility or Durability:
Stability of Value:

Secure your keys and don’t move any bitcoins to a new wallet until this seg2 stuff is resolved. If this is not a good approach I need someone who knows more to correct me.

Only use each paper wallet private keys once.  That’s what it sounds like you are telling me.

It’s not guns so much as its taxes that give fiat value. The usd is basically backed by future tax revenues and by the fact that it’s the only legal way to pay taxes.
