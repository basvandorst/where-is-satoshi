I remember that I started minning at .07$, it was almost 100 bitcoin everyday i think. Once it was .20$ I was selling them... 
It's as always... if I would known that, I will keep all my minned bitcoins but well, I keep some right know. It's not like the ~11000 I have minned(I think) but something is something.

Yes, that's what I was thinking about. It could be another type of attack.
That's why I was thinking if there is any emergency re-scaling in that cases.
I know I happened temporarily with bcash but seems B2X is much more supported by miners than bcash.
Maybe if every individual starts to mine we can supply some hashrate gone, but it too difficult.

I said to 2 of my close friends to buy when it was 6$ after down from 10. Neither of them bought because they said it was already downhill and it was worth nothing.
Now there is one of them that I can't comment anything about Bitcoin because he starts on rage so... I was no successful in convince them, unfortunately for them.

Like you are still in the EU, if you use Kraken or Bitstamp, they are both in the EU so you can do a SEPA diposit. Then, there is a fee for every transaction but I think it is 0.16% in Kraken(it's which I should use).
I don't know the fee in Bitstamp but there should be a FAQ to look for it.

You can buy it in the ledger official web. They are French and next bulk is estimated on October 15th. Maybe it fits what you want.

Aquarium of course. In an aquarium you can hold a mermaid, something a Bitcoin can't... yet.

I have used Kraken to exchange some crytos. I only have withdrawal in euros and I haven't have any problem. Haven't done any diposit so in that case I can't tell you about.
In any case, like I see you have linked the BitcoinUK subreddit, if you are from UK, I think Kraken has discontinued the BTC/GBP trade. Look for it before diposit some if it's your case.
