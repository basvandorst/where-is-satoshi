The part about the trade war keeping us out of real war, if anything collapsing their economy with a trade war would push us closer to a real war. If you continue to put pressure on an enemy he will eventually lash out. If anything the trade war has accelerated a conflict between the US and China. 
I believe that eventually no matter what our choices are their will be a conflict with China. I do not know if the trade war in the end will help or hurt us because a weaker foe is a weaker foe. And the longer we give them to build up the harder an eventual win would be. But lets not kid ourselves here eventually that whole nation of unmarried women is going to get real freakin restless and their is no way that XI is going to give up power. So the smartest thing to do is focus that anger and restlessness outside of the boarders.

Did you just throw out a word salad this makes about as much sense as those memes talking about being a navy seal.

I think they had security in place to keep a run on the bank from happening. Makes perfect sense considering MT Gox Let all their coins go to a hacker and almost instantly. Why wouldnt you slow everything down to make sure that nothing was going to go wrong. 
If you dont like it dont use them. I used them because I needed a vpn and they were only taking bitcoin. They are the ones in their instructions that told me to use coinbase. It worked then, and I now have more than the lifetime subscription to the vpn originally cost.

coinbase gave me all my coin. I transfered out on saturday.

Your right they charge a hefty fee to transfer it. But they came through I transfereed mine out on saturday, it arrived sunday afternoon. I have it in my electrum wallet now. What is funny, is I only bought the coins to pay for a vpn a few years back and I left them in coinbase because meh was only a few dollars. 
But when I withdrew them from coinbase they were worth many times more than what I had orriginally put in. :D
