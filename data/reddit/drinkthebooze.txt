Btrash is useless now with Segwit adoption and Lightning Network on Original Mainnet Bitcoin!

A Tokyo-based real estate firm is selling a small commercial building for 547 bitcoin, or $6 million. It is said to be the first building in Japan to be sold using bitcoin.

There is precedent with the Vericoin hack and The DAO/Ethereum incidents, to do a rollback or otherwise quarantine the problem transaction(s). This topic has provided a huge amount of fodder for debate. What threshold should be needed for such action? And what if the need is more controversial, such as a government cracking down on dissidents whom may not be evil in the eyes of the world community?

Tiny new digital currencies are offering profits far bigger than bitcoin and much more quickly,  I've personally made over 600% in one digital currency more than 1,981 in a second and over 3,500% in another, and I expect to make a whole lot more. Digital currencies is now one of the online investments where

Not directly from person to person. LN is a peer to peer encrypted network similar to TOR. The nodes have no idea where the value is coming from and where it is going. It's simply passing an encrypted message.

This is an interesting legal argument. One could say PoW miners aren't MSBs since a coin's entire network is built off of them. But are LN nodes MSBs if &lt;100% of Bitcoin processing rigs are LN?

Who would thought that the WEF  would just make another banking propaganda, starting from the title. Dinosaurs exchanging stupid opinions against technology advancements is just silly. Obsolescence is inevitable, and are already here.﻿

Thanks for making this feature available to your users!  I love the idea of the batch queue---I imagine that will make batching much more practical for a lot of users who would otherwise need to keep an annoying todo list of payments to make.

A degree in cs is great! Just not absolutely necessary. Contributing to open source is a great way to build skills, and put any projects you're doing github.

they think this is just Mr. Gates way of saving face with his pal Buffet!  He has been an advocate of bitcoin and this can't go over very well with his OLD WHITE FRIENDS!

Mind blowing that the head of the SEC knew so little about crypto. Just let Giancarlo run the show.
