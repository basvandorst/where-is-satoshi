i do not understand why bitcoin fog has the facility to generate new addresses as an output destination after tumbling, after the 8hr mixing process their fee is deducted and the balance returned to your fog account, 
(at this point i was expecting a summary giving detailed results including passwords for the generated wallets.)
at first i thort was to get double their fee, so started another withdrawal this time using an external wallet (as "Tectract" advised), left over nite, check this morning with no hopes at all only to find the full amount deposited, and no 2nd charge, result.

thank you so much for all your comments and suggestions, 
did look at dark wallet but couldn't find any resent reviews for it, with the amount of traffic that Bitcoin Fog has and the reviews, seemed a good choice.
living up to my name, Tectract hit the nail on the head, penny dropped, lol, did exactly what he/she said.
will let you know the outcome (worked or not) 2morro, if any one interested in this WTF bigass n00b mistake, lol, lol cant stop, lol.

thanks for you reply spottedmarley, 
my bitcoin fog acc still shows the full amount at the top where user name is, does this not mean the coins are still there ?
