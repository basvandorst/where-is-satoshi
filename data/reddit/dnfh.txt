just withdrawn 0.25 BTC minimum to test, went fine
their price was 1BTC:133$
mtgox at same time 1BTC:131$

So verified users can still withdraw bitcoins from balance? Is it still a minimum of 1BTC?

where do you see a paysafecard option in okpay?

Which is why we dumped bitpay, theres no reason to have that silly 15 minute limit, why not a day to monitor the address they created
Bitpay has your money not gyft

LR was useful as a hedge against bitcoin volatility, converting to LR when market was all over the place and back to BTC when things calm down

I have done better by going with blockchain.info api
For people taking longer than 15 minutes and if the exchange rate changes to the negative (for me) then the user is told so and how much more they have to pay to complete the order, or they can get a refund (minus transaction fees), their choice
If I can do it so can bitpay

filecloud.io already accepts bitcoin and offers more space + bandwidth (tho no desktop client)

They are trying to cover their asses so they dont endup like Liberty Reserve
