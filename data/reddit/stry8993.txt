They did that to be allowed on Chrome's Store, if memory serves, because they blocked absolutely everything. Its a simple toggle as well. Don't have them mixed up. Been using Adblock Plus ever since I found it on Firefox years and years ago.

Took me a second to get what was going on here. At first I thought he got delivered a phone he paid for with Bitcoin and received it smashed up. lol, silly me! Welcome to Android OP, may all your dreams come true.

Uhh... you should probably consider donating to the proper Adblock,  , not the one that started on Chrome and is more or less paid for by Google to allow ad's. Ironic that you don't see Adblock on anything else but Chrome, hey? If its got a hand, and not an acronym, do what it says, stop, and download Adblock Plus.

I've noticed primecoin isn't like a lot of others. I enjoy it.

Just curious, what's the reasoning behind this? Is it so they don't take a major stake? Like this 51‰ thing? So the miners are acting to distribute the coins? I'm just guessing, and really curious.

That... Is pretty significant. Oh dear. Well hopefully the Bitcoin Heroes come together on this one.

I think its a fundamental, underlying component to [Tails]( &lt;- *Link to it if anyone is interested or needs it*, the Linux Distro Edward Snowden used. Theres some other stuff going on in there, but, its a big part of that Distro.
EDIT: Yep, I was correct on that.

What is the legality for a run on the bank? As much as it would hit them where it hurts, I remember during Occupy Wall Street when a bunch of people tried this, and the police got involved.
Great idea though, just wouldn't want anyone to get into any legal trouble.

I've actually been considering buying some bitcoin from libertybit, what's a good android wallet (newb here)? I wouldn't mind a dollar in bitcoin to get started. Be a great way to get it all started. Good idea though by the way! 
Edit: All set up and very excited! Wish I had some BTC to help spread the love but I'll toss some donations once I put some in my wallet! Thanks for the idea. My friends are always wondering what bitcoin is and what it does, so maybe this will help!

I'm not sure if English is your second language, but it sounds like you, and another person in here are from Black Arrow, you really are not helping the skepticism.

Did you call it 'Breaking Beans'? Oh... it says in the title... one say! :'(

Well a run on the bank is when everyone does it, all at the same time. I'm not sure whether its illegal or not, but, in Cyprus for example, you were limited to 100 euros transaction per day, to prevent that, recently. And like I said before, the police stepped in during Occupy Wallstreet and were guarding a bank.
Pretty crazy.
