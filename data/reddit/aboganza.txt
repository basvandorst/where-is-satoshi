7% is the inflation adjusted average gains in the market over the past 50 years. without inflation is more like 9-10%.

since bitcoin is always going up you can correlate it with anything
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:13:35
it's like Netflix using up 30% of all internet bandwidth
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:48:37
too late its already at 10 billion market cap
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:47:17
if you bought bitcoin at $100 and its now $10000 it basically has no cost basis
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:14:12
interest rates are scheduled to go up again. also Japan has had negative rates for decades

anything remotely close to the ath will pass this test
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:09:01
you're obligated to claim gambling winnings and even profits from illegal activity (theft, drug dealing, etc), so i don't see how bitcoin is any different.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:11:58
depends how you got that money in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:14:39
traditional forex markets? even for a 3% fee it would be worth it
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:24
doesn't this end up stratifying bitcoin between micro and macro transactions? wasn't a point of bitcoin to allow the full range of transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:41:43
you lost 1/4 of your potential future earnings, but still are 200x above your initial investment 
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:04:29
My guess is that the exchange sent your transaction info, but likely didn't calculate cost basis for every transaction. you'd need to fill in that to get an accurate tax assessment with proof to the IRS that it's accurate.
otherwise it will look like every trade is 100% profit, and your tax liability is calculated off that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:06:21
isnt it only like 3%?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:35:57
it will make it rise even faster
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:35:20
even if you bought at the peak before each crash, you'd still be in great shape
@_date: 2018-09-01 22:51:49
the number gets smaller as bitcoins value improves
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:56:17
What messed a lot of people up was that they did all their trading in December and January of this year. Taxes are calculated on a fiscal year basis. So you might profit in December and lose in Jan.

ya, i was gonna wonder where i could get a loan at 0.05% annual interest (12BB / 22,000BB)
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:28:14
but it reinforces the adage "time in the market beats timing the market"
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:38:52
its not a transaction fee. its just lower 8% than the spot price, aka huge spread
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:35:02
real estate and tech stocks have had bubbles and yet they remain great investments long term

nvidia is going up because of bitcoin tho... hedge bet
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:48:04
as long as you are earning at the same rate. lump sum is slightly better than DCA, but you would need the lump sum initially
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:44:23
you will spend more on electricity than you get in bitcoin. so you might as well save the electricity and buy bitcoin instead

@_date: 2018-03-07 06:47:19

minimum investment is different than required net worth

tbh, i wouldn't really expect more from someone in this capacity
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:04:39
exercising or going to school can also be investments, just depends on your context

the world would probably need to become one jurisdiction first. not even fiat is universal
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:43:59
money you donate is considered money you never had as far as the IRS is concerned

i could imagine some sort of armageddon ransomware virus that encrypts everyone's (or lots of people's) wallet and throws away the key

caveats aside, market cap is like the only way to even quantify this question

not possible to calculate cuz the time horizon is not specified. you could make almost infinite dollars based off microscopic highs and lows.

nice to see we hit firesale levels
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:15:03
prolly for 'fiat' too
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:23:31
the dip is still higher than before the 'barts'. its more important to be in the market than timing the market.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:02:46
to at least 2300
