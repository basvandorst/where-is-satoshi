This league is full, sorry. We've been at it for 10 years, just something I'm doing to get my friends to see Bitcoin in action, we usually play for cash. With Bitcoin it will be easier for those who live out of state. With full time jobs and families this will be easier to exchange league fees and payments without having to "meet up","go to the bank", or by using "standard mail".

Here you go, professional study of the cost of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem VS. the energy costs of banking, paper money and minting coins!  Great read!

Just the Whales making/taking profit. I can see the new All Time Highs coming around Christmas! Buy the dips and HODL. This rocket is still headed to the Moon!

My son is off school this week, he has been playing since the release today. I imagine it is difficult... definitely helping him after work!

I've gotten a handful of withdraws, 2 being for $800 plus. It depends on the route of withdraw, getting a check took 3 days (twice), also the first time I got it direct deposited to my bank account it took 4 months...it was a pain.  
Hopefully a Bitcoin withdraw will be in seconds...that is the reason for the post, excitement.
