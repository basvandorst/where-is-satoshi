And they literally all mention Beats, so... ? I don't think I'm the one not doing any reading.

Yeah, not literally every one of them combine Beats/Airpods, but yes a lot of them do because Apple owns Beats. Anyway, it still proves my point. I googled phrases like "headphone sales", "most popular headphones list" and Beats were mentioned every time.

There's a big difference between **the** most popular and **one** of the most popular.
I'm not saying beats are the  best, or even one of the best. I'm not saying they're worth their price. But beats are most definitely one of the most popular headphones today.

Well these articles/statistics show otherwise:
Also, I see them all the time. Your relying too much on your perception bias.

Yeah fr. Everyone is either selling at a loss or holding for no reason. I've been loving this market for "day" trading - my average cost of entry has significantly lowered without having to throw in anymore fiat.
