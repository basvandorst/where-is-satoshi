Someone selling at this point must be a real idiot. Pump and dumps are now common in Bitcoin, but the price keeps rising. Why sell at the end of a selloff?

that's just speculation though. the actual uses of bitcoin make it clear that it's possible as a currency and could replace $USD$ in possible future economic crises. if it were pure speculation, it would be le tulips.

don't even joke, there are hordes of people who lost their savings by buying peak and selling dip, gambling, theft, mt.gox et cetera.
don't take out a loan for bitcoin. i think there's a good chance that the $2k mark is going to stick around, but it's still extremely volatile and high risk

lol i remember this shit from 2014... someone's trojan doesn't even have to do anything other than quietly wait for an address to enter the clipboard

cryptocurrency doesn't have a P/E. cryptocurrency is about speculating that crypto will be easier to trade than fiat in possible future situations.

this was me for like 5 years. i was following bitcoin from the beginning and finally bought in last week, at the cool price of $2200.
to be fair, if I had bought in at $10 i probably would have kept it in mtgox. that's what made me paranoid and is why i only trust Coinbase even now
edit: oh wow, I actually had money in MintPal. I completely forgot about it

That's what this former millionaire did with all sorts of protections. It didn't work out well for him

I'm saying my security strategy is different from yours. I have 2 factor on coinbase, linked to a 2 factor secured email. The tradeoff I have made is that it is easier to sell my coin and harder to accidentally destroy it, at the cost of paying 0.5% more for transactions and risking theft if that security system is penetrated. I choose to take that tradeoff.

i was reading and for about a year and i strongly disagree with this

it has absolutely nothing to do with legal guarantees, I just consider it a trustworthy company which will be able to sell my coin quickly if i need it, without too high a chance of losing it in the meantime -- which in my *personal* estimate is probably better than keeping a wallet in my room or on my person.
you basically just have to make these decisions for yourself
