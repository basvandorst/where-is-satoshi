You don’t think people are working on this?

Beats me... I heard people tell me this when bitcoin came up just today. I think why it’s valuable is just a very hard concept for the average person to wrap their mind around.
It’s ok though, I never try to convince anyone. The longer the average person thinks it’s throwing away dollars then the longer time I have to invest at lower prices.

Bitcoin is taking the slow and steady wins the race approach. This is just the natural outcome of the consensus dynamic between passionate volunteer developers.
The best developers that best appreciate the game changing potential of crypto will naturally flock to the most advanced and oldest crypto project. 
Bitcoin really is the cutting edge of crypto technology, believe it or not. 
It’s not cutting edge because it has a lot of bells and whistles and works perfectly in every way, but it’s the most advanced in the sense that it has scaled without making mistakes. It will be even more advanced when higher-layer protocols are organically layered on top over years.
The bitcoin decentralized consensus process takes conservatives steps and makes sure to do things right, even if it’s doing them slowly.

Oh I do this too every time bitcoin comes up. I think to those people, it already seems like bitcoin is everywhere all of a sudden, and that's part of why they're suspicious of it. Of course were still a looong ways from the fully matured technology.

I’d rather store it somewhere safe than on my person at all times...
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:51:11
Well they could spend those bitcoins then
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:29:08
Yeah but they can still be called out for being jerks about it
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:35:04
I don’t think there’s any “them” - it’s a fully peer to peer exchange.

It’s called a logarithmic chart and it’s often used for exponential data like this specifically because its more meaningful and easier to read for exponential trends.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:36:33
Yeah this is my outlook pretty much. Could take even longer than 2 years though
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:57:09
You’d be a fool to do it in a situation when it exposes you to unacceptable risk. That risk will be tolerable to some people.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:58:55
It just seems like the general consensus among real-life people I'm exposed to is that bitcoin is a bubble/fraud/a way for the system to control us (???). They don't understand a thing about how it actually works either.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:51:59
So price declining = pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:43:16
I think we’re still early adopters mainly because almost every time bitcoin comes up in conversation in real life for me, someone who doesn’t understand it is trashing it and making fun of it while everyone else seems to agree with them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:37
Yeah totally open source software is a total joke /s
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:05
Yeah there really is a heavy astroturfing vibe among the bcash crowd... sadly a lot of innocent but clueless people are getting pulled into it.

Good reminder for anyone who’s concerned about a “dip”.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:10
I’m here for the bitcoin dopamine 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:17:50
Except when they’re pushing fentanyl analogs

This is the crypto end game
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:43:10
50 Euros of negative bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:32:38
It really just depends on risk tolerance, some people have manageable relatively low-interest student loans. 
Should they not spend money on anything other than student loan payments until the balance is zero? It’s not so black and white. Money is fungible, you know, and sometimes someone can have debt but also a very low risk of getting behind on payments.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:50:53
It's hard not to when r/bitcoin gets brigaded by astroturfers
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:45:18
And still is, apparently, via bcash.
