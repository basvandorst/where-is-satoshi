a currency and monetary policy that isn't tied to a government. To me that's the biggest reason they don't want bitcoin to be a thing

You people live in fantasy land, monetary policy precludes the rule of law, which is why cryptocurrency is only useful for buying drugs on the internet. 
Venezuela is a communist shithole, which is why their money is worthless.

lmao and because it's all speculation it's not worth shit. Bitcoin's only value is transferring wealth out of collapsing economies like Venezuela and buying drugs on the internet

lmao, now this is the self-delusion I come to this sub for!

what are you using it for besides speculation and buying drugs on the internet?
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:25:49
right, you're exchanging it for USD or another currency backed by a sovereign government to buy those goods. The value of the bitcoin is purely speculation, you're selling it to other speculators to get dollars. Do you not see how that's a problem and precludes the long-term growth &amp; expansion of crypto currency?

a lot of words there in your comment but you're saying absolutely nothing. The bitcoin you've bought and the bitcoin you've sold has only been to other speculators; intrinsically, it's not worth shit fam.

because it's a way to transfer US dollars?
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:35:43
because bitcoin as an investment proves how worthless it is. You don't buy USD and keep it under your mattress because you think it's going to increase in value, you use it to buy other things. People are only buying bitcoin as an investment, to buy drugs, or as a medium to transfer wealth out of failing economies like Venezuela. Expecting it to be an investment like a stock or a bond is asinine, how do people not realize this? You're selling to and buying from other speculators, the intrinsic value is therefore highly inflated.
