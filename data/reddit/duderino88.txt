@_date: 2018-01-30 20:49:24
look, Bitcoin is like a black hole. The more you try escaping it by accelerating away, the higher velocity towards the centre you will in effect have (once within it’s gravity field). So the more elastic created, the more snap back. You think short term. Think long term. What we are all really waiting for is the GIGANTIC financial crash to end all financial crashes. Everything else right now is just background noise. Just forget about Bitcoin and open your ticker again when stocks and real estate starts collapsing. You’ll be witnessing BTC going up vertically, straight line. IF you can buy them anywhere :-D
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:39:09
you girls are acting like this is a bad thing. Bitfinexed have been screaming about this like forever and all maybe thought this would come home to roost during next ATM. This is good weeding out if it happens, separating the bad seeds from the good. However Bitfinex have already anticipated with legal moves so prob they will be around for a while. The whole industry of banking (it’s employees cooking the books) are sitting waiting to buy cheap Bitcoin. Nordea had to prohibit it. Not to mention all the investment banks who are already vested. Throughout this we hardly have come close to 9K before quickly rising. June last year 10K at Jan 2018 seemed like a crazy idea.

Version 1 is clearly the only borderline legit looking. For the world new currency? This is geek graphic of the highest order. I know you can’t get yourself to talk to a “web-designer” but it’s bad for all of us that any of the options you present look like the Internet just before 2000. This is not criticism, it’s just a suggestion to get the best people we can find to have a look at it. I will personally pay the bill if that’s the problem. Seriously we had Bitcoin being under marketed for 7 years now (for a good reason, maybe). But currently we are all sitting wondering if the dream will all end as shit coins slowly destroys the glitter of crypto. We haven’t even had the major exchanges fold yet and regulation crackdown. Don’t know, love all your work at .org thumbs up but tech is not all that will eventually work in this world where looks matter more than content.

historically it’s over 2-6 months depending on the news situation, however todays scenario is different. We are much much closer to a complete meltdown in stocks and realestate, unless central banks throw more money to the fat cats to burn and it ain’t happening. Interest rates now are going up, signalling that something again is gonna go down. When this next financial crises come, no one on this planet, no amount of money or shorting can stop Bitcoin from going up vertically. Try buying bitcoin now with fiat and see how difficult actually it has become. Then imagine how difficult it will be with fiat going down the toilet, with every other market in complete shatters. Gold (toilet paper-gold), art, commodities (paper) everything included.

your example is on assumption you are within a planetary gravity field. Newtonian physics can not predict anything within a gravitational singularity. I said, IF you are WITHIN the gravitational field of the black hole, meaning it’s eventhorison (as we and the solar system, and everything else are already held up by a central galactic black hole). I respect Nassim’s contibutions to physics more than Einstein’s (that’s currently increasingly being acknowledged as severely flawed).

the exchanges (Especially) have no/limited bank account access so they need a liquid token that pairs any fiat to move between exchanges
otherwise you’d have to cash out in fiat, move country, continent, exchange, deposit, throw them on new exchange, lengthy procedure. To some extent they’re right it’s just what the banks are doing with fiat, however they’re artificially filling their own pockets while shafting people buying in expensive, inflated

You write and think like a retarded moron. Nevertheless let me help educate your idiot ass.
1) Grand solar minimum in history had every major empire fall. First goes food security, riots, mass immigration. Severe cold making ordinary life impossible. If you think this is some far fetched theory look it up. We began in 2016 with minimal sunspot activity.
2) USD? Are you fucking kidding me? Petro yuan is coming. IT might take a few years but the americans by then will have hyper inflated the dollar to death. American economy is already gone, just living the last hiccups. It’s like spring 1929. Whats different is this time no Americans are used to working, with the rest of the world feeding it and wiping its shit from its ass. America is the centre, so it will send waves throughout everything. But China is there in the door to take over. It’s obviously not the end.
A fucking chat app worth billions USD? We are in the biggest virtual economy bubble in history, blown up by trillions of free money to banks and corporations, trickling down to the little folk. When realestate goes, how much you think they got to invest further? When all the derivatives blow up, you think they’ll just come out and give them more free money and it’s all saved?  
With 99.5% of the gold sold not being redeemable? Good luck with cashing in you paper gold when the investment banks fold in the next chapter. Save Goldman. The sheeple believe all this shit, just as in 1929 when they believed the sky was the limit and kept buying. 
The next mega crisis is food, and for many it’s a surprise. Try going to the worlds poorest countries. USA live on the top of the pyramid being fed by Mexicans so little idea what happening for the 90% rest of the world.
3) Buying crypto will become extremely difficult, as first exchanges are likely to get a) regulated further and b) crash or loose money in the whole Bitfinex/tether calamity. Seriously have you even tried lately? Do you have any idea how difficult today it is to sign up and deposit to an account, the wait. The limits. Not to mention for 3rd world people straight out BAN, and severe difficulties with banking acceptance. I tried yesterday with two working credit cards on an exchanges, bank declined. 
You live in a virtual world, you fucking retarded piece of douchebag idiot. Fuck you.

also what uncannily similar are the bots are trading up the price, shit-tokens coming out of finex's offshore ass. But not limited to that. Ponzi sidechaining on top of btc is ditto exactly what fucked a high rise into a extended low. Thinking of CME, question is if somebody who knew was actually shorting btc at that time when Gox flipped. You'd think at least people within, and anyone who knew, was..? Enter Roger Ver living across the street. With Powell who runs Kraken working on the computers the last week of the Mt Gox life. Just another day in Bitcoin.

at least I know not to word it "fractional lending" as it gives some connotation to the bcash camp. It's not questioning the multisig part/smart contract part. Maybe it wasn't clear. It's the layer 3 that Stark for ex alludes to in end of her recent presentations. Even Andreas up to this summer in his presentations have been reluctant to go more into detail (as he's probably feeling out of knowing..). 
For ex, a malicious 3rd party actor submits additional software that enables fractional lending on top of multi channel 2 layer. This doesn't necessarily have anything to do with lightning/SW implementation. On the contrary it would depend first on lightning implementation being sound and dependable. Think how the first 14-15th century IOU gold certificates transformed into promisary notes and later on by necessity, fractional reserve lending: as people were hoarding the good money, gold and silver. These are legit economical issues that we are only starting to understand as the software gets implemented.

no it's not traffic obviously as there have been way more short term volume. My first feeling was bots going nuts against each other and giving just insane swings going outside their strategy (first 10 min). Even on BitflyerFX and bitmex volume is flat thereafter. Maybe they need to calibrate bots across all exchanges for new trading patterns. I think we need to go maybe 24-48 hrs into it before they feel AI has the pattern and reprogram strategy but have I got a clue, not really!

all the bitcoin Goldman have bought on the way up will be dumped, believe me, and bought back up cheap. It's just a casino wheel where the casino always wins. But Bitcoin doesn't emulate normal markets in that you have the gravity of exits from all fiat economies weighing down on the outflow. That's why it's prone to fail eventually. They might win a round but there will be 14 thereafter and the last few rounds decide who wins. All the money they are now flushing into Bitcoin to extract the Bitcoin cap and stop it, will eventually swing back only to inflate Bitcoin more

yes, both answers are not very enlightning. potentially wrong. 1) it doesn't address the IOY foundation lightning is building upon (even if it's 1:1 satoshi). Potentially you can create infinite IOU's on top on a finite supply. In the same sense that margin or futures trading already is a kind of fractional banking "on chain". Meaning an exchange can flip it's IOU's and start banking on outstanding credit (What we see w bitfinex at present and tethers). 2) once segwit already is firmly implanted, I wonder if it's still possible to make transactions on chain outside segwit. If everybody finally implements segwit. 3) I notice how posts like this are ridiculed and taken off board without getting a single serious answer, only fueling my skepticism (supposed to be a bitcoin community primary).

no need for fear, just trade on whats in the making. Where there's big fluctuations there's additional bitcoin to be made. Those who play this right will literally be siphoning fiat off from the casino owners into their own bitcoin wallets. Like I said before Bitcoin is a black hole and will vaccum up everything in the long run. Whenever there's a major correction, just zoom out. In the end price of Bitcoin will be that higher all the casinos threw into the pot. This is no ordinary stock market where shit is solely in the hands of those that run the trading computers..

unless you have "premium" account with one of the exchanges you be fucked if trying to get in/out at peak hours. Every exchange will melt down for normal trading through a shit storm. Price now is completely inflated artificially to set it up: if you aren't taking fiat out it's a virtual scene. But when to do that? Def not on the 18th as the action is already pre-anticipated. Before or after is a better guess. A prediction: sometime around Christmas when nobody's near a computer. That would be the best, and easiest, time to ruin the holidays for everyone with a manipulated crash. Bankers selling everything and buying it up, incredibly cheap. The problem is most people here have a to-the-moon-lambo mentality and will not realise it before it's too late. Def a new attempt to shread BTC in the making. You can hodl, thats all fine. But many people who have bought from 7000 up to 20K will have weak hands, likely a slaughter on the way. But sunshine follows every storm..

essentially it's bookmaking, just betting on which way it will go. But it's already been happening with all the Asian exchanges so Goldman's entry with their own terminal, their own naked shorts will have some impact: Goldman will loose a ton of money in the long run.

well, statistical official "inflation" is low, but it's artificial. First there's "shrinkflation" but it's going unnoticed. Take paper gold for ex having held "similar" price even if thousand fold money have entered since the 70ies. It has risen yes, like 2% inflation, but not anything like the goldbugs had imagined. That's the "magic" of what future markets have done to anything prone to inflationary measures. All the funds going into those fake paper commodity markets, just flow into hedgefunds and derivatives. It's a pyramid sceme with fake numbers making inflation look zeroish while skimming off the entire pumping into the coffers of the bookmakers. Fractional lending used to have inflation as the main problem undermining issue of new fiat, but the derivative economy circumvents this issue. Hence we have a derivatives industry as de facto worlds largest economy. 
Now with Bitcoin being the first EXIT in many years, notice how all real commodities skyrocket (in BTC). Meaning, measured to Bitcoin prices. 
The most growing commonly used barter money in Africa now is not dollars, but bitpesa or mobile pay credits. This is because it's got real use case and is not inflated at same pace like dollars. Because people have to BUY mobile phone credit before it's created as paper.
The problem facing the derivatives industry, being the worlds largest real inflationary beneficiary, is the pyramid will fall like a card house if there's anything removing systematic incentives. 
But I think you're right to some point, in that fiat will still serve some things. For ex in 3 rd world countries. Still take Venezuela or Zimbabwe, we might see them oddly being the first to 100% implement crypto currencies as fiat is almost off the table and there's severe dollar/yuan/yen fiat shortage.
That's why probably altcoins will serve a role apart from being speculative. Because it simply doesn't matter if it's sea cowries or giant stone money as long as people agree on whats limited and can be bartered.

correction, there's a place for inflationary coins in coffee type transactions. Whenever it's money supply becomes to great, a particular coin will tumble in value valued in bitcoin (in theory). That would solve the limited supply problem of Bitcoin and settlement on chain in that you just buy coffee with some inflated shit-coin (just like we now do with fiat). The problem is then that goverments can decide what coins will be allowed (theirs). Black markets for Bitcoins will ensue, but all public trade would be in government coin. Unless our leaders are oriented towards free monetary system..
To say that Bitcoin is similar to unlimited inflationary coins long term even if new coins are produced exactly FOREVER is to live in a virtual world. If you produce constant amount (forever) this will be very different, you have no meditated limit. Bitcoin's inflation is time limited and quickly dropping, and further more if you measure that creation against lost coins (4 mio BTC) it will not even make up. So it will effectively be deflationary. Correct me if wrong please.

Bitcoin and alts is prone to attract fraudsters/pyramidscemes as we see now. Tether creation out of thin air and Bitfinex is going towards a MtGox repeat. Bots trading the price up to free up money for leveradged. For those who are all in, this is prone to failure. Have at least a good buffer that can carry you through an extensive bear market. Wait for the correction when CME goes live and buy it back cheap.

1) settlements on the blockchain NEED to have high costs to prevent spamming of the network (seen now with cats/Ethereum)
2) for coffee payments use some alt/shitcoin like feathercoin, and when it's gigantic blocks ultimately fills up, a new one will be created. This is the inflation on the network just like altcoins are a type of on top sidechaining on BTC right now.
3) having most smaller transactions kept off chain, and off bitcoin will allow Bitcoin to be more secure. Just like fiat: you can transact with paypal or VISA, but if you pay for coffee most places in the world you pay with coins/notes. 
4) LightningNetworks will work in principle, but discussion have to center around what form of additional layer 3. Without discussing what follows, we can't purposefully discuss layer 2.

this is purely theoretical and has nothing to do with how the world really operates, derivatives are by large a money printing machine in how you can naked short something if you own an exchange. That's why derivatives are by far the worlds largest economy. Basically it's a pyramid sceme. It will not work for Bitcoin as you can see already on the movements from BitflyerFX, insane fluctuations.

have you ever heard of naked short selling ? that's how gold paper price is being supresed, among other things. It will not work here though for other reasons, long run. But be prepared for them giving it everything they got to bring down BTC for an extended time, bleeding all the free money in the world they have access to. Just increasing hyperinflation. Welcome to black hole Bitcoin..

Im not questioning lightnings motivation or their ability. Im asking towards how the deal with security issue regarding it's implementation. The whole world now rests on that issue. I'd say it's lightning (or blockstreams) responsibility to indicate how they are dealing with the implicit threats the system will be prone to encounter. I have difficulty in accessing any serious input on this. So far, this kind of comments only tell me people are blindly trusting. But where there are people (working on lightning) there will be security risks as they will be targets (think only Garzik..). Wouldn't you agree that for something which will completely decide the future of bitcoin, we have extremely little discussion on this apart from the obvious marketing how it works?

just wait a bit, because the first round of wall street will be trying to scare any joe simple who bought into the craze to never go in again. they will keep it artificially low for a week or two with insane volatility and once they've bleed too much money they will let it ride. then massive up, again followed by massive fall. throw into the mix that most exchanges are tether risk prone, so when bitfinex is heading for trouble they will be dragged in. just know all those factors. once this storm have settled prepare for some serious up tour. wait for the exchange trouble to settle and go full in

No futures trading are practically already done with bitflyerFx and bitmex that have the far greatest volume. Any exchange who holds IOU's to customers as they deposit funds, can de facto "print" more leverage. They become a bank and can in that sense print currency in outstanding dollars vs deposited exchanging currency. This is what fractional banking is, hence the mismatch name. This is also why we have trouble now with bitfinex/tethers, involving all the other exchanges doing tether dollar swaps. 
Im not trying to spread FUD, just trying to understand the implications and see if anyone did some real thinking on the futher evolution after LN implementation..
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:26:26
main principle of BTCs limited cap is that malicious actors can't create their own new Bitcoin. Apart from the mining inflation at some 2%, as we have seen there are other issues, altcoins pop up creating unecessary (de facto) inflation on the main chain while not delivering any value nor innovation. This is bit like thinking the internet will issue a new golden age of enlightenment and instead we got social media &amp; the twitter presidency. More dangerous are whats to come 3rd layer applications or the current financial giants wanting to create their own shit-token system on top of BTC/lightning. "Robinhood" app exemplifies this in the most simple way, but ponzi-schemes will become more and more sophisticated (creating the ad hoc token printing..).

Throughout history "sound money" have never changed much how debt is managed. This is what Safidean doesn't understand. Read David Graeber's "5000 years of debt", it tells economic history from the view of an antropologist. Not saying The Bitcoin Standard isn't a good book. But the rabbithole goes much deeper than just "sound money". Ask yourself how the current system (from Roman- ot the Spanish-, to the British- and American -empires) were all based on sound, hard money (silver and gold). What were the effects?

the penultimate swing low into a bull market. Look at the Bitfinex volume just went up 4\-5 times passing 8K. Who'd with their brain intact would sell lower than 8K? My guess its combined forces of banks and FX markets dumping everything on the market before we take a 180. FX trading desks shaking out the lice having gone long. Institutional trading desks, and hedge funds will buy in back low \(thanking anyone who panic sold\) anywhere from 6K\-7.5K and sell once we are back at the new ATHs. N00bs wil buy back in again  FOMO style. It's just the way our culture works and Bitcoin can't change it. Hedgefunds and FX markets make their killing on volatility.

anyone thinking that the MtGox lawyer can crash the price with his tiny stack of coins have not looked at volume stats and done the math. There are literally 2\-3 times volumes being dumped compared to what he had transfered on to exchanges.
Look at the "Bart" patterns reappearing 7800\-9500 USD. Driven by huge volume spikes jumping BTC across strategic liquidation zones. Or is that just bots randomly dropping and buying back coins??
Just Bitmex have 4\-5 bio USD /day, and readjusted for leverage \(average 8x\) maybe 500\-900 mio USD. Then comes all the other FX markets, Bitflyer, Quoine, BitfinexFX etc. This alternative speculation market have [major profit motive incentive to drive volatility]( As volatility impacts their profit making probably much more than ordinary minute trading fee income. Just recently Bitmex blog there was a [major anouncement on "market making"]( having enlisted "Nick Andrianov. .. former Deutsche Bank equity flow and exotics options trader".
Goldman eyeing out the lucrative FX market, should also point to where the hatchet is burried: [buying Poloniex]( introducing their [own version of "tethered" USD]( Trying to do what they have done to other commodity markets: rigging them.
Essentially any FX market is another form of "altcoin" pump, in that it cuts open another rift in the belly of Bitcoin to siphon of value going into the system \(in this case BTC is the only with severe cap limitations and without a centralised dev community being completely decentralised\).
Whether it's temporary or will be elongated depends on how marginal trading volume goes.

The whole trading space is dominated now by algorithms/bots that are learning from eachother and how to best cheat out the humans. 10% of a professional trading floor can beat the boots in stocks.

FX markets have been at work since MTGox even if the volume on BitfinexFX, Bitflyer and Bitmex only recent 1\-2 yrs have climbed. CME\+CBOE combined are not much in comparison maybe only 30&amp; of the other FX markets \(don't forget BitflyerFX and Quoine that might be bigger\). It's difficult to know as they present turnover with leverage included and pumped up with own trading.
During the 2014 \(even 2015\) slump no one was asking if a 6 month drop was due futures. It was simply taken for granted that there was a down turn. Trading and valuation moods goes in ebbs and flows.
Whats changed recently is that major investment banks have realised that if you can't beat them join them: They need to get on board this train cause it's leaving. Anyone in banking right now knows they're out of a job in few years if they aren't aboard \(JP Morgan [tried many patent applications for blockchain and failed all]( 
Therefore the story maybe more is that these "institutional" investors are going low key into the market, and while they can try to shake out loose coins \(faith in Bitcoin basically\). If they bought in with their \(unlimited fiat\) at the top, the price would sky high in a moment, so the strategy must necessarily be different. Trying to buy in slow, dumping to take any faith in the market out and award shorters.
What's different with Bitcoin to commodity markets is that there's no limit to how many gold certificates you can print. Meaning those markets are rigged on an afternoon in the park, and off to fine dining.
At the present rate of burn, I speculate that banks are burning a lot of fiat to scoop up BTC. They don't care if they eventually buy their own stash back with a tripple loss. Cause they can afford it with creating more zero's in their software. The question is when the elastic tightens again, and they run out of shots. It will eventually happen as sure as gravity.

Being blunt, its bit conventional and similar to others. But great for main market of course. 
Here's what I REALLY LACK to better trade crypto. Maybe it's been made already? I havn't seen it. Surely hedgefunds trading in crypto with APIs will by necessity follow these aspects:
- velocity up and down of alts compared to BTC (and maybe ETH, USTD). (looks like a RSI index of all crypto w the high velocity on top and low on bottom)
- visual chart showing volume representation of top alts compared over time (looking like 100 equalizer bands stacked on top)
- own portfolio over time total after each trade, and with parenthesis of every loss/gain at trades (looks like long horisontal candle chart with green/red for gains/loss and w figure)
- pump warnings (set alts or BTC in focus to a threshold of vol vs rate (in USDT) movement). This enables to track any unusual movement of vol or rate compared to the average
I have more but these some of the most important coming to mind when trying to get overview over crypto.

it's insane how people still define their world in terms that goes back to where you literally sat as relative to the king:
\- being his "right" hand \(the chosen ones, the \-inbred\- aristocrazy..\)
\- left of \(the ones carrying out the dirty work, the peasants, the underclass\)
We need to delete those old terms \(left/right\) as we delete the old UNJUST monetary system. 
We \(obviously\) need new definitions as the former are no longer serving any meaning \(class distinctions, political economy\).
Look at whats going on in the US, new "conservatives" have taken over the "old" asumed sympathies towards classic post\-communist countries \(.. Russia\) that used to belong to the furthest left. And so called "liberals" \(democrats\) today are in bed with the corporations, favour outright new wars on regimes they don't favour \(typically old skool conservatism..\).
Real decentralisation of power, real "democracy", is that anyone influences the mandate of the King and recedes to be a "subject". To fully understand the implications have a lot to do with what the \(real\) of what made Bitcoin. We all need to come together, focus on similarities instead of idiotic supposed "political" differences.

this is a good but also silly question. For some it already have. For others, not. In some stores you can pay with bitcoin, and fiat. Some only fiat. So when do you decide "NOW" has crypto replaced toilet paper money? When fiat has left completely? You can't. Just like in the time when cars slowly took over from horses, or telephones from telegrams. Or emails from faxes. It happened gradually. We still have horse carts. In some countries they only have horse carts and maybe a few cars. For some people much sooner, for others much later. It's a error to think it's a one date. 
But ok, mate, if we have to look for a buffer zone, how about when the next financial crisis really starts honkering?

Not to mention what will happen after BTC1. To me the most strategic factor is China and China-minining have an interest in maintaining their own coin. This will be a warrant for that BTC is not steered into the folds of corporate arms just like now is happening to BTC1.

word, but no need to overcomplicate things. The "steady" backbone of the world economy since 1945 have been the Pound and the dollar, paper gold (manipulated non-existent..). Now we have a new one to show how those others weren't really decent measures, just handing free lunch on a silver plate in those places where the former could be printed. What will be interesting is to see how extreme hoarding (like never before) will influence young peoples initiatives as hodling becomes more profitable than any real physical entrepreneurship. Right half the worlds agriculture is just about to fold, and the other half is moving indoors to complete artificiality. Food will sky rocket, if there will be something on the shelves when the cold snaps really set in in this new sunspot minimum. You can remain in lala land of virtuality but when it comes down to sustaining this world, it's food and water.

whats funny about this is when you increase velocity to escape the event-horison of the Black hole/singularity, the more your velocity towards the "center" will increase. Because all roads in there leads to the singularity (don't worry if you don't udnerstand this the first time).
The more the douchebags try destroying bitcoin, by manipulating paper markets with fake orders, the more real recurl elastic in the velocity upwards bitcoin will get. You just witnessed an example with BCH and the scaling debate.

look at the market and do the math on volume vs trades. If you dump Bitcoin at the bottom, what's usually the result? You don't sell 10-25K Bitcoin at the (obvious) bottom - unless ofcourse you think you can drive it further down. Which looking at the ticker doesn't seem too feasible. 
Considering historical development, what would you do if you sat on say 20-30K Bitcoin now. Or let's say 30 for that matter? Would you hodl or sell? I'd expect those that have no clue about historical BItcoin movement or are new to answer "sell" to that. The other factor is: if you had one of the big 5 trading desks (for ex Goldman) - and Bitcoin is seriously starting to contend with all their pyramidal ponzi's. Would you just stand there and sing Christmas Carols, while Bitcoin takes over? Or would you throw everything you had in your arsenal at it?
I'd buy high and dump it continously down the ticker, and try keeping it at the bottom at an acceptable rate loss. But I have no idea what's actually happening in those board rooms, just guessing. Obviously you didn't participate in 2014-15s long price supression. The fluxtuations are typical Bitcoin, and not for the weak hearts.

There are two parallel trading tickers. Retail investors with hardly noticeable trading trending always sideways or slightly up. And there's the massive whale dumping (/buys) in chuncks of 5-25K BTC/hr (on Bitfinex for ex). Most retail panicking suckers are long gone having sold. And there's not a lot more going on down towards 1K (but retail and institutional starting to pick up cheap coins if available). The question is how much of this dumping is actually within reach to buy? Meaning in those dips, if you go for say 10K BTC, would you get the orders? (or are these whales just selling to themselves...)

@_date: 2018-06-16 11:27:59
there's definitely something unexlained in the general discussion, looking at volumes before China exchanges were closed down:  and (currencies:) 
(assuming it's correct data, I have some doubts to it's accuracy)
maybe we used to have loads of Chinese wash trading (until Feb 2017) but that it was actually price surpressing.
Then when China was stopped, price had a hand break release, and with help of the bots of Bitfinex etc the currency pairs changed momentum. There's hardly any CNY trading after Jan 2017: 
I'd like to presume that volume currently is down meaning there are few sellers, and that anything currently being bought in USD, is immediately dumped again (at a loss). It makes little sense otherwise to buy, and sell at similar price (or lower) unless you have short positions or actively trying to take down the price:
Note that South Korean Won hardly is visible on the chart anymore. What's the reason?

this is a controversial one, but probably will happen no matter the resistance: **lending.**
Lending of surplus value is very important for a thriving ecology, economy and overall wealth. Right now obtaining bank loans for the poor, even middle class westerners are extremely difficult if not almost impossible (need 70-90&amp; collateral).
Just like micro loans are effective in developing countries, network clusters can offer their shared base of any crypto coins with a fixed return micro payments (hourly/daily/weekly etc). This will for ex enable a farmer or street vendor to be out of the inflationary government currency (sanctioned by the international system = $) as well as giving the principal (the micro loan company) a method of monitoring payment cycles (to coach and manage loans better). Not to mention securing a much easier cash flow and return payment cycle.
I say *controversial,* because what may happen is new inflationary tokens like shit coins, eventually will be enough "lower order" that they can serve as collateral for loans (for ex litecoin, dash, ethereum, monero, NEM, IOTA etc). Bitcoin might become to "hard", expensive and even rare as we already see funneling the creation of shitty forks and shittier copy projects, essentially printing money (tokens) out of thin air just like their predecessors, the banks.
The real collateral is shit coins exchange rate linking to Bitcoin. Hence the inflation is created, not on Bitcoin, but leeching on Bitcoin through secondary virtual "assets". This ofcourse in turns similates how gold and silver primordially operated, and was thinned in coinage, but is different in how it's technically implemented.
Ofcourse it would be better with Bitcoin as collateral, it's just dubious how many would give up their burried treasure, risking it with the company/tech, to earn an interest. To some extend this is what already is happening with futures/FX markets, we just haven't seen it develop into next phase which is organic lending.

If you know BTC is worth 1 mio in 5 years, would you think 1,000 USD/BTC today is expensive?

@_date: 2018-06-16 09:19:56
yes but it's different with Bitcoin as it's limited cap, anyone trying to list a betting market correlated asset like fiat will eventually have the limited token swing back hard at their bets. On the table it seems you can pick up anything that limited (e.g. Bitcoin) with an unlimited volume (fiat), like finite vs infinite. But it doesn't work that way as there's a dynamic of hoarders (exiting the fiat system, mostly China/Asia) as well as singular entities scooping up the available coins at the lowest prices where they deem others would jump in (in this case 4-6K$). CBOE is relatively tiny compared to the general FX volume, the market moves more according to market marker desks of FX and banks desks going against Bitcoin adoption [
a further extensive study and explanation of this is needed to properly understand the price action. It's different to any other commodity in that you can't use real gold or silver to buy stuff, whereas for Bitcoin is at least seems it will be the case. Meaning even if they create these sidechains of correlated, inflationary assets you can actually use your "goldbar" (BTC) to live on. Hence destroying the ability to keep the upwards (ant-inflationary) price movement of BTC in check over long run. This is also why the whole financial community will do anything to stop adoption. With introductions of "Fed coins" probably Bitcoin at some point will be banned to be used in stores, especially food oriented (the bottleneck) but blackmarkets will naturally occurs (silkroad.. or like in Venezuela or Zimbabwe you can buy anything anyway).

When China devaluate like in 2015-16 and now again verge of trade wars, a million Chinese millionaires are looking for exits out of the Yuan. This is probably why Chinese exchanges were leading up to 2017 where they were closed by authorities and it all moved to Japan/Korea. I'm so tired of hearing this US centered everything, like naval of the world thinking, when clearly $ are only marginally deciding for the outcome of BTC vs fiat exchange rate. If anything, when the $ is dominating like it's been last year, we see the inevitable bear market. The Chinese coming back into Bitcoin if the Yuan start devaluating (to foster exports), will be major major new upcycle.

Well, yes. First, there aren't any real data, or very little, for unregistered citizens living in the slums in "3rd world". India and China both most populous and wealthiest countries in the world pre- 1800 measured in general living standards, hunger, health etc. Many continents as for ex Australia before the British colonists lived in chosen (happy) "poverty", as they were limiting themselves to just a spear and collection basket as the only technology. Eskimos, nomatic, tribal people all had simple lifestyles as their preffered happy modus operandus.
That report are all estimated living standards for rest of the world. We don't know how they used to live being serfs, or in the slums. Bottomline is slum residents/extreme poor today outnumber world population 100 years ago (1-2 bio) by a factor of x2. The statistic is more US centric than anything else, because US had insane poverty up to it became the empire (made up of poor immigrants). Ofcourse it's standard American to think we are the model to which the rest of the world can be judged.

\- instant (almost) money transactions across any borders
\- censorship resistant
\- open source project
\- your bank deposits will be gone the day the next crisis hits, no government will bail you out cause they will be broke too
and there are more ofcourse.

I decipher the proposal of Mr Ammous it is that BTC can BECOME the new "gold" standard. 
This implies, implicitly, that you run fractional reserve on Bitcoin. Not that it's already not happening. Altcoins. FXs houses like Bitmex, leanding on the Ethereum platform. All these are borderline fractional systems, meaning you have additional inflation with new "tokens" or systems, that replicate the use factor of the main chain (gold, Bitcoin). Without necessarily adding particular obvious value.
Ofcourse he clerverly never explicitly states "lets run fractional reserve on Bitcoin". But his chain of arguments, his title (Bitcoin standard) etc are indicating it.
I'd love to be proven wrong, and it would be more interesting to have Mr Ammous commenting himself. Following his tweets along the last year and his writings however, it shouldn't come as a surprise as he still is (employed and thinking) within "economic academia". That does seem more to think in terms of the past, than creating solutions and ideas for the future.

not sure what FAO is. But your imaginary grassland? can tell you from my experience that most places in Europe don't have lot grassland left for expansion, besides it's high m2 cost. 
Most beef that are sold and bought in todays lowcost supermarkets (marketshare some 90%) are dumped dairy cows. Argentinean beef are for the AristocraZy. 
Today's discount beef and dairy never sees grass and air BTW, and only eat the cheapest animal feed available. That's essentially what you'll be consuming.
80-90% of world population will not be able to afford meat alone, yet at all a weekly meat portion. So we're talking about a select group.
Even when world population was sub 1 bio, the poor were only allowed to eat fish. And since then the amount of available space have remained fairly constant, though massive deforrestation and clearing of natural habitats to get more space for beef. 
PS I tried getting cows on my land, but you have to have at least 1.5 Ha/cow and that's still not enough to feed it now if you aren't in extremely rainy conditions. Cow feed is expensive for an animal that eat between 90-120 Lb /day. Last 15 years most cattle rachers in Europe are making red numbers and only held up by taking out loans on more property.

The *Gold standard* is what produced the current calamity (unlimited fractional printing by a [oligarchy](
**The Major problem in seeing Bitcoin as "Gold standard" (as in "The Bitcoin Standard")**
What happens if Bitcoin generally is seen and utillised as a new banking "standard"? 
First we'll see newly issued centralised "fiat" tokens *backed by Bitcoin* (just like shitcoins now de facto). In that Bitcoin will face a much greater existential crisis than 51&amp; attacks, forks, barnacle code and outright prohibitions. 
Second: the 30ies had gold confiscations by state.
Try buying food in almost completely centralised (supply and distribution) market with an outlawed money unit on a network as smartphones that are 100&amp; surveilled. Or from a farmer without any access to technology.
China already are running trials with people earning social credit for aligning with the state. Having mandatory surveillance apps installed.
This current physical threat  will be impacted during a grand solar minimum (severe weather) with severely decreasing agricultural yields. If you don't think there's rampant inflation in foods, check the [burrito index](
Food (and resources) are the control of the masses, not money. You can't eat money. A goldbar hardly buys a loaf of bread in a total hunger situation.
**The solution**
Autonomous, decentralised distribution chains of resources like organic local food production running 100&amp; crypto payments. As long as food is grown with fiat, we will be at their mercy. 
***Short history****,* ***Gold***
*Fiat ($) printing went unlimité in 1975 with Nixon's discard of the gold dollar standard. But in reality it happened much before, around say, the Jekyll island conference (and US confiscating all citizen gold in 1930s).*
*Much before however, Medieval "goldsmiths" or rather private financiers were already controlling gold deposits,  redeeming gold certificates (banking houses like Monte di Pachi, or Rothchild).* 
*In the West where paper money became a means to exploit the masses, gold (or silver) was the* ***tool per excellence****.*
*The West (even under the Romans) typically had negative trade balances to the East, with silver pouring out of the empire coffers from Rome to London. Giving reasons for new wars of conquering etc. Hence their gold standard is partly what unevitably produced more war (and hunger, suffering).*
*Invented in China, redeemable silver/gold hemp paper was initiated much before around 900 AD. The difference was there wasn't rampant inflationary intentions as those "redeemable papers" were only printed in limited amounts (typically only to the level of deposits).Also the centralisation around an emperor, allegiance to the state, Kungfucianism etc*

this is wrong, Bitcoin IS factually still entry level (we aren't even at 3% world population adoption). I'd throw everything I had, if I had something cause it's still in it's earliest phase. Because :
- real estate is going bonkers, no milennials can afford it or even get sufficient loan.
- fiat will get confiscated, and that not confiscated is already dissapearing to hyperinflation (banks getting literally negative interest rates right now)
- gold/silver etc is a complete scam if it's paper gold and not physical gold in your own vault etc etc
For the paste 2 generations it hasn't paid off to save, and Bitcoin changes this so saving no is premiumed like never before in history.
BTW Counting in full Bitcoin is the wrong measure, the future will be in satoshis.

Your internet research skills are good, but the analysis is lagging a bit. For ex the old Bcash story of Blockstream being tainted with the DCG investment doesn't necessarily have to be connected into the whole USD-T drain of malicious intent of bending the onramp to Bitcoin. Granted, investment carries ties, but placing Maxwell in the bottom of your long article which really is about Bitfinex/Tether/DCG doesn't produce coherence.
Apart from the attempts of "paypal" bends (circle, Coinbase, USD-T, GS coin USD-T etc) the are much greater forces in play. You have to zoom even more out to start grasping the picture, making these attempts to bend a new pyramid/ponzi onto Bitcoin a shrug. I will just name a few:
\- inflationary practises on Bitcoin: pumping altcoins (typically beefed up by stolen Bitcoins) from 100&amp; cap to now just 30-40&amp; of total supply (meaning 60-70&amp; inflation over the years)
\- effects of inflationary lending of futures (Bitmex notably), morphing into lending onto Bitcoin (this has similarities how the Gold standard morphed into fiat, enabling lending on a leveradged IOU paper contract)
This comes from within the eco system and its effects for eco system heakth, potentially worse.
Equally you could attack Binance for pumping their own crypto project beyond USD-T pairing. It has no backing what so ever, but people accept it just as well. It sits now just 600m under tethers total cap. It literally has just centralised name air of Binance income to back it = worse

what most mindless shoppers don't know is that the 3.5&amp; credit card or debit card fees (Master, VISA, American etc) is automatically put on top of all vendors margins. Obviously. How the fuck else can you stay alive selling stuff if almost 4&amp; is taken out of your profit margins?
Many online stores today are down to 20&amp; margins although there are still stuff with 35-40&amp; margins (sales price minus VAT).
2.5-3.5&amp; fees on a 30&amp; margin is almost  10&amp; That's ridiculous. Attack this first please before bitching about BTC fees.
Let's math: doing a card purchase of 100$ you pay extra 3.5&amp; to the card terminal = 3.5  $ that's currenly about 100-10,000x the transfer fee of an instant 3 sat/b Bitcoin transaction.

Few thoughts. Compared to spot market, when bulk of volume operates on a un-paired (correlated only) betting market (the major are Bitmex, BitfinexFX, Bitflyer, Quoine etc and CBOE/CME comes after in size) logically you will find that there will be a shift in price dynamics. (This has been ongoing since MtGox say 2014 where real volume shorting started for BItcoin and kept the rate down over a almost 2 year period.)
Instead of for ex future exhanges *following an index* made up of say *Bitstamp/Kraken/GDAX*, the attention from all traders shifts to monitoring marginally the futures markets (not exclusively spot markets). Or at least this is how gold, silver and any other (paper) commodity market have turned out.
It can be seen as a movement into "virtual" markets on top of the real underlying fundamental market. Just as we have social interaction moving into facebook or twitter. This in turn creates a market situation that is easily gamed by big actors. Swinging and manipulating price in both directions and benefitting from taking bets on the correlated future. Hence in modern manipulated finance (fiat printing ad hoc, asset "certificate" printing ad hoc..) commodities eventually *become futures*.
This is to be expected for Bitcoin as well short run. The difference is limited cap. Limitting the possibility of price tampering and complete shift to a manipulated futures market solely.
Think any financial institution (and maybe even FX market maker desks) right now taking (short) bets against bitcoin, agressively pursuing a strategy of short selling real BTC on the spot markets.
"Larger" anti-BItcoin actors **should be expected to mathematically sell at least the quantity with loss as they can gain shorting.**
Meaning at this point it would pay off for the biggest houses to buy high and sell lower, given they can make much more on a betting market with large order movements.
This is because Bitcoin is the only real threat to manipulated commodity paper markets that serves as golden goose for the financial industry (the upwards - inflationary - movement is severely tampered by priting more certificates as there's no real pairing with underlying assets. Try cash in with your gold certificate, only the vendors that particularly offers redeeming do that).
Keep the spot commodity prices depressed or at least largely in check and people will go to futures. Giving you the opportunity to easier control the spot market with large chunks. [This activity]( even at BIS has been [documented]( by conventional media like [Reuters]( and [Bloomberg]( It's latest developments: [
The problem that any actor eventually faces if pursuing this strategy for Bitcoin is that the small amount of tradeable spot, flowing on the exchanges, will sooner or later be taken up by long term holders at lower and lower prices, limiting the already dwindling volume on the open market. On one hand you are handing over the Bitcoin you are dumping to shorters, but the real danger are whales at the bottom buying up large parts of the market. Hence it is a loosing strategy that will only work in the very short run, considering the relative minuscule size of the current crypto market compared to other markets.
On the contrary keeping Bitcoin artificially surpressed, will allow much more people to enter at lower prices, creating eventually more long term holders of last resort not selling until the fiat/Bitcoin rate have risen, say, at least 10x.
In short, bullish for Bitcoin.

in any case the few months is too short as investment horison. Most below 40ies are so desperate for funds, that it has to be instant returns.

It happened to me as well. First year upon buying BItcoin price went down 65%, I sold but bought back in.
Almost everyone who's actually holding on to their Bitcoins for years have been through one or several 59-70% corrections. It's part of what it is to hodl Bitcoin. If you wan't the highs you'll have to accept and go through the lows. Every year we have gone through the same cycle. Just look long run. 
You've escaped the risk of holding fiat as well. Fiat can be printed infinitely. Meaning it's not really "money" - its just we've become so used to it we call it "money". Banks can void your account, citizens in Cyprus 2008 had 50% shaved of their deposits.
Bitcoin is much better money as it's severely limited in coinage. You can compare with other mediums of exchange, not only fiat. Physical gold or silver, art, real estate. Still Bitcoin is more liquid, more secure.

it's that BTC will obviously become a world base currency, just as gold or salt was locally scarce. Gold was more abundant in West Africa than gold, and was more expensive.

their plan to shift to 100&amp; digital money in this upcoming (enginered) crash of all crashes. Along with the inevitable totalitarian control of everything. Then Bitcoin looks joker card, but it's not. It's tables turned and they havn't yet realised it (or rather most worker bees have but the top dogs are still in denial). 
If everyones pensions and accounts are voided overnight, Bitcoin will from day to day become a monetary worldwide unoffical standard. Yet those who aren't in crypto will be 100&amp; totally dependent on bankers visions for the future. The rest can improvise as they please. Think about that.
Probably a next ATH will not be incremental steps up. It will be real estate and stock havoc. Bond meltdown. Toilet paper gold gone. Crypto exchanges down, no (paper) fiat anywhere and a gigantic "black market" for crypto currencies. Supermarket and distribution likely controlled at state (=corporate) level as food/water is the bottleneck for basic monetary exchange. Or rather it already is (corporate distribution politics) - it's just the mainstream havn't woken up to that fact. Let that sink in.
Curriosity: current monetary system (british gold standard, dissolved by US "gold" standard) also started as running opium/drugs through the silk road (to.. China who had most of the silver).
Another curriosity: west africa (notably [Timbuktu]( in Mali) that had some 50-70&amp; of the gold back then (before it was looted) traded salt, not drugs. Salt was vital to survival in all Africa as it was and still is the only way to preserve meat in tropical areas before electricity. Again please consider and digest this information slowly.

Look at some self glorified trading experts. Tone Vays lost (sold) all his Bitcoins during the 2014-15 slack. Peter Brandt from his tweets seems to be out of crypto (with a good loss). Most shorters, are making lot on the easy way down, but usually loose it all when the bottom turns (betting continously on drops on the way up). 
There are plenty more, 85-97&amp; probably all traders are actually loosing money to the clusterfuck of bots trading (incl the hyper trading ass fuck..).
Instead of seeingit as a loss, take it as learning money, offering you to better your strategy. We are only in the beginning of this market.
There's historically one trend that is ongoing and sure to return: new bubbles, and new rapid declines. You make the most Bitcoin by selling spot, at the top. Buying on the bottom. Here some thoughts after following the market the last years:
\- Don't waste your time with anything in between top and bottom. You will loose to bots and more experienced traders. 
\- Don't waste time on FX markets. You get insanely bad odds, not worth the risk unless it's a say 90-99&amp; sure event. Even there (top and bottom) getting orders in are insanely difficult.
\- Do long term trades. Forego the daily/weekly need to do trades. Trade top and bottom after making sure it's actually turning the tide. Have at least a 12 month investment horison so you aren'f forced into risky short term risks. BItcoin is sure to go up over time as water is to fall towards ground.
\- Sell 5-45&amp; at the top and use it to buy back at rates of respectively 35&amp; 45&amp; 55&amp; and possibly up to 65&amp; drops.
\- stay out of alts unless it's a sure rise in value. They are mostly centralised and have little or no real value.
If this strategy is generalised, we will start to see a swing from community support in buy up at the bottom, instead of it being whale financial industry as it now probably is. Both bottom and top have some serious wealth distribution, and hence it's where you want to act if you know what your doing.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:32:30
No, ofcourse no. In the sense that it can "fake" drop to 1 USD on Poloniex if Goldman wants (and they allow people to go over there and buy available coins). Just like Bcash can be wash traded in China to ridiculous levels. But who is really selling below 6K is a riddle (apart from the low volume retail panic sellers). 
There's little liquidity in the market as right now, if you want to buy the whole market. If somebody's trying to put a lid on the market it's another open hole in the dam of fiat, funneling out cash to anyone scalping or shorting. It's happening ofcourse, but how can it continue amidst financial crisis and trade war already cracking.

Any of the established finacial pyramid schemes trying to destroy or delay adoption to keep their money machines going. The longer they kick the bucket down the road, the harder it will swing back in momentum.

Here's a thought: that chart is little reflective of the reality. Most altcoins aren't really liquid if they aren't continously pumped. Meaning Bitcoins dominance is far higher than the total coin cap charts show. Obviously everything is Bitcoin correlated, meaning the true cap of BTC is much higher and viceversa.

look, we need to shift both understanding of how bitcoin can serve to be both secure, decentral while at the same serve as payment. Well many altcoins are based one bitcoin sharing most of the code base. There can be some useful for small transactions, and this can be any. For ex the top 10, and yes.. even BCH. Think about it. In this way we can all be happy and when BCH camp realise that trees don't grow into the heavens, there's maybe a place for it for coffee transactions. If not, well there are 10 other alts with fast transaction times. Problem will be all those will have high inflation rates, so it's just for instant swaps. Dig?

Whereas 6 is the destructive number (breaking up the multiple rows of 3's, 3 is the constructive (hence 33 for ex is important to masons, christianity etc). 
That BITCOIN /DOLLAR on samhain/halloween correlates with 6's is a tell tale of what's happening on a greater scale. Maybe as the dollar is about to fold completely and bitcoin to skyrocket. Also appreciate how in tune with the universe bitcoin is. Everytime I look at it moove it just reminds me of us (the sun) going through the galactic center these years.

this is complete utter horseshit. Inflation rate of dollar (real) is not 2%. It's 300% measured against bitcoin for ex. 2% is just some imaginary number taught by federal banks to bank, the press, university professors who can't think and their brainwashed students. Ethereum doesn't have a limit on it's caps and there's no real information on if and how it will change over time. Making it infinitely inflationary just like fiat (just wait a year for the hyperinflation in the dollar). Any coin that doesn't have a limited cap build into it's source code is high likelihood a scam coin as it can be altered over time and especially if the programming is centralised just like with ethereum. Most people who think positively of Ethereum are blind to those facts and overly taken in by all it's supposed positives. Great idea, bad execution.

Guy_Incognito97 the right answer is, it's an attempt from the financial world to be in, without being in. It's an attempt to extract as much as possible of the liquidity going into Bitcoin. Meaning they will try to aide it's rise artificially buying up to the point where they short it. At that point they will try to ram it down as far as possible to scare people off and return to the usual bets they're dealing in. Expect more fluctuations, not less.

*wiki: " In October 2016 China's foreign exchange reserves totaled US$3.12 trillion, the lowest total since 2011, but remained higher than the foreign exchange reserves of any other nation"*
Respectfully, pumping a shitcoin is like a drop piss in the bucket at present for China, 1 USD bio a day taking over total supply while working on trashing BTC to pieces. 
Obviously this is all trade on one Korean exchange by few Chinese and Ver. some people and fans hopping aboard for the ride. 
I project that time will show that Jihan understands mining, but not OS programming. Ver understands marketing/sceme, but not OS programming. Chinas security services, do they understand OS programming being a totalitarian state? 
all those dots must be connected before we can talk about why Bcash is being pumped. 
programming (free flow of information=energy) in this new reality is winning over old paradigms, napster, piratebay, gutenberg project, youtube, twitter etc. so what they are doing at present is old paradigm physical positioning against something that's virtual (while also being physical). it's like the fight against silkroad. you shut down one and 30 reopen. I can't explain it shorter at this point but there's obviously much more..
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:52:17
Don't underestimate the intelligence of Jihan. Vs the idiocy of the stooge Roger Ver. Jihan by now is right hand of China (the polit bureau.., not the people), with subsidised mining to take over the crypto space. Ver is just used on the bandwagon because he's useful to them, with his hoards of paid shillsters. And because as their dog he's awarded with many more coins. I have great respect for Jihan for playing this game, cleverly as he is. Recall he's doing it for his nations prosperity (China holds most of Americas worthless IOU's). But zero for Ver, as he's purely in it for greed, has got zero to do with "benefit of bitcoin". He doesn't give 2 shits except for as to what makes him rich just like selling fireworks to minors.

I had that post removed so here it is: Korean Bithump crashed peak pump when BCH was hitting 2500 USD and all the selling order came in to roost 
I looked into it, searched throughout all search engines incl korean naver.com and nothing comes up on ownership structure of bithump (Chinese money??).
Knowing the history of Bitmain, mining centralisation and China playing Go with bitcoin, this is interesting to say it mild.
Looking at Ethereum past trading it points to trading on Bithump seem likely to show what some whales decide is fit. Swing the market one or the other way. Hence the 0% fees and massive trading volume (owners/creators of a coin trading to themselves). Worst case: numbers on Bithump mean nothing as it's never really traded.

because they (Jihan+Ver) meant to pump BCH when 2X were taking over the BTC chain (or so was the plan). So as to completely destroy Core's (lightning) vision for bitcoin (miner's want power..). And get BCH in as "real" bitcoin (2X was just sabotage it wasn't even serious). Then as 2X isn't happening, now obviously they are giving it a shot anyway buying like crazy. Trying to get it up as much as possible, selling off bitcoin. That's a real short term project with another batch of Bcash on sale when coinbase opens in january for bcash to their customers. No one with their sanity intact is going to buy BCH long run except BTC insurance. They will bleed an insane amount of money, and can't keep it going long run. Speculator will jump in for short term gains, as will the chinese state (their mining, their coin..). But like Fedcoin, who's gonna believe and buy this shit? I held on to Bcash as long as possible but not long enough. But going back just for the pump.. couldn't even be bothered.

Seem a little weird selling at this time, now almost any trader have gone long and we were at a crossroad heading into complete bull territory. Now we are entering more chop as +20-40K BTC is a lot for market to absorb short term

Many layers, it's like an open puzzle (but intentionally full of deception). Could be Ira trying to put the heat on Craig Douchecroc, if Ira really holds the coins (unlikely, but maybe hodling parts..). There's little if no chance scammer Craig have got those coins, per the security level of Dave (if Ira didn't have access to them, how would his attorney). I'd suspect the emails quoted are phoney, but intentionally quoted to pass the heat. Maybe Craig has (virtually ALL..) his coins, as part of the heist from MtGox (together w Ver and McCaleb). Not from mining as the filing alludes to (because if Craig admids he didn't mine the whole satoshi story goes away). 100% that Craig isn't Satoshi, because why would he suddenly in 2016 give up himself to be a living target (elite knows this..). Listen to any of his lectures and know this idiot almost can't figure out to turn on a computer. Only thing Craig Douchecroc is good at, or semi-good at, is scamming. But now his game is catching up (he shouldn't have forged.. those docs..). The trap and net is tightening, if Douchecroc admids he wasn't mining, the whole Bcash cabale falls and the chinese mob will skin him alive.
McCaleb, Ver+Craig eventually turned their share of the MtGox heist (part hack, subsequent heist..) into their own (miner owned) coin (w Jihan &amp; co backing). 
Scammers always want to control own (centralised) pyramid organisation. 
Noteworthy that Dave was affiliated with Homeland Security and it is toned down somewhat. Most likely Satoshi is still Hal, getting wacked and "homeland security" are trying to pick up the leftovers, Ira trying to play a game of chairs. Then this read as a pretty desperate defensive manouvre. But could be wrong about.. everything..

Like the event horizon in the classical sense doesn’t exist as a confined “border” you need to pass. I used to believe this idea, just as the idea that the Universe has “borders”. Like they still explain with the balloon/markers theory with a blowing person. One of Harramein’s contribution is to question who’s doing the blowing and questioning the whole idea of a black hole being “limited” or bordered. Next time you look into the eyes of somebody, keep thinking about that the black is a black whole. It’s like free LSD.

2 observations.
- the tiny trade limits (0.0625 &amp; 0.25 BTC level 1, 2) will severely hamper adoption as this will only be used by small scale traders 
- bisq team, you need to add a chart page to the tabs just like any other exchange. It's maybe just to follow the movement. But think how an exchange window typically is open on the chart, with the depth as secondary. Right now you need to look at tradingview and then go to a P2P exchange like hodl hodl, LB or Bisq. At one point (exchanges all folding due regulation or tether) you will have to add the chart. It might as well be now so Bisq will be the primary window.

the problem w bitcoin until perhaps lightning networks kicks in next 2 years, is that fees will remain relatively high for smaller transactions. So adoption in Africa will maybe be more oriented towards altcoins and export type of biz than peer to peer payments like bitpesa. But just using localbitcoin or localmonero trading for cash is fine. Or start organising crypto bank/society: people that are unbanked and want to exchange their worthless fiat can come and take a weekly course for a small fee in how to buy. Then you could act as local physical exchange as well. People will buy btc when they need to save, and take it out in cash when spending. Everybody gains. Except the banks and their dickheads.

@_date: 2017-10-25 18:23:46
 the way forward is peer to peer exchange like localbitcoin or local monero. Any shicoin should get one to serve as an entry point into bitcoin. Also it will provide a new reason-de-etre for any shitcoin : who has the best peer to peer exchange. 
Any exchange is a gatekeeper and potential hostile control over entry/exit. For long term hodling use local exchanges and coin mixers to spread coins out even if you pay 3% extra.

The bankers and their stooges currently waiving out fiscal policy can do whatever wild gesticulations they please, it will not change anything. We already have an inverse real inflation now of some 500-1000%/year average USD/BTC. It means fiat is already hyperinflating.

But Bitcoin is a transaction/value medium. It's about actually securing something cryptographically, decentralising it, so economies will be based on savings rather than credit.

It all starts with Banks (BIS) being the hubs of money creation and debt enslavement. If states are in creation of their own supply and things don’t flow out it will take long time before you see hyper inflation (like pre-war Libya, Iran, NK, Cuba etc if no trade blocked but the US they wouldn’t be that bad off). Also recall the current Rome is the US, living off everybody else, just creating war machinery, more conflict, violence. Profitteering from it..

Spitting it out in a new dimension, the white hole, as butterflies and flower meadows. Problem is interest (credit). That's why jews and muslims by tradition weren't allowed to charge interest to their own. Destroys the economy when resources are used up (and people look to new pastures, hence war ensures..). A credit based economy like we have now is sawing over natures branch youre sitting on while facilitating mega yachts for a few people. Overspending just comes with available credit. Right now federal banks are giving the banks money at 0%. Bitcoin even with limited cap is divisible down to a tiny satoshi. So more apples per satoshi. But the point is that all sound natural resource economies are based on savings, i.e. actual wealth. I see more the temporary hoarding might cause problems in limiting circulation as people stand to gain more by hoarding.

often flabbergasted by the intellectual level here in many posts. Poor Garzik highly likely have his nuts squeezed ad infinitude by the grey elite. His turnaround is far too spectacular and weird to be coming out of moral degradation and greed. If you read his old tweets and code reviews, appreciate why they possibly singled him out as their glove to attempt (another) take over. Count in Hearn, Andersen and so on to those before. Effectively it's only him adding real code to a non existing code-base on 2X. But maybe good Jeff is doing this on purpose - making it lame enough for 2X never to catch on. Sure looks like it. 
That financial elite, a handful, in "power" will obviously try again when this fails. Hijacking an important enough individual. Who's next. If that doesn't work they will go on to every single individual of the core team. That's why bitcoin needs the "Chinese" insurance policy, because bizcoin with infinite supply would not be preferred against any decentralised coin with limited cap.
Every single individual over 50, including who's not "invested" into bitcoin is potentially the enemy of bitcoin as they don't want to see their amassed, bailed out (stolen) financial fortunes being carved out by an inflation proof bitcoin at the rate of 500% a year.

One word: Kosovo. I recall Spain school boy helping NATO's bombing campaign when Kosovo was allowed to  seperate from Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia). Then it was ok to allow "illegal" separation even though no referendum even was taking place. It's all a game of moving the chairs. Under the nazis  (and Franco)it was illegal to speak out against them, if you did it was torture and concentration camp. Most separation from any empire (EU) comes by people showing their opinion. Dictatorships will always refer to the laws they written and call it illegal and put in the dogs to maintain order. Look, I wish for Spain to be united. But if a couple is already arguing over the bills, it's already over. They can put guardia civil to reenforce order, but man is that the country we want to live in? Fascist dictatorship? Let them leave, and let them come back if they don't like it. IT's all about money anyway. There's no Spain but on paper and flag. All policy is being dictated by EU. And just to shit on us more they put a drunk ex banker, Junker in charge. A farce everything, people digging up old corpses again and looking at the wrong problems.

to get the price higher than bitcoin they will have to use some +100 bio USD in fiat over short time provided BTC/fiat stays where it is. This new currency injection will just rise the BTC price even further (as with the stock markets). So whether hashrate goes is open question.

It's not about Spain as Rome seem to think. This will be first of many regions now to break up from the EU. Brexit was first. But Lombardia and Flanders is next. Countries will follow. The only reason why Greece hasn't left is because the banks wouldn't allow it. They are currently ripping off any public service remaining there until ther's nothing left. If Catalans go, Spains economy will disintegrate. That's why Madrid will use gunpoint not to have it happen. For them it's destroying the golden bird in their cage. Only they are like the bondage serfs in the 16th century. No idea of how to create abundance and wealth. The more pictures of police violence, the worse for Spain as country and unity.

Hypothetical ETFs that doesn't matter, aren't the reason BTC is racing back up. Neither is USA the center of everything no more. The main marginal buyer the last 10 days (excluding Bitmex) has consistenly been HitBTC (Hong Kong, read Chinese billionaires). As the Yuan deflates, the million millionaires of China will panic towards the exits, again. The last 6 days Coinbase/Gdax have just been unloading, just now starting to buy. This means, just as with gold, USA is hemoraging it's last few valuables, quickly loosing it's financial base (shifting to earning money on tarifs on everything..). While China, Russia, India, Koreans and Japanese are loading up with the rest of the world (and so with treasuries).
The people who think ETFs have anything to do with BTC, are dellusional at best. The shear pressure now for possible exits (BTC remaining relatively cheap) as we are before the biggest clusterfuck crash in living history in stocks, realestate, bonds (all countries except SDRs). The nuggets in the elites know this, so do people working on the inside in their rigging houses.

But.. don't underestimate the chinese=&gt;Jihan (not Ver) playing Go with this coin, buying up everything on the market really cheap, and then reinflate it once they got close to most of the marketcap. It's what any sensible player would do against bitcoin taking over as no 1 currency in stead of the new gold back petro Yuan. China has the worlds largest currency reserves. When it doesn't work with Bcash as noone wants it on world market they will just proceed to their own central coin, be it variations of ACchain or whatever. But Bcash, like Ethereum classic might be fading out towards zero, but they have interest in keeping it close as they now have their own minted coin, centralised, like bitcoin.

It's backed by nothing.Banks just creates zero's out of thin air on their balance sheet (their own database). The regulation is lax to say it mildly, often controlled by their own people. The 6-8% real cash deposit demand is never checked in reality. Accounting is legendarily fake (remember Enron..). Further more the fiat cap is unlimited supply. Interest is contrary to natural wealth as resources get overused by people trying to pay off their debts that banks created out of thin air to make more..

yep, and a good example (for the "masses") is [Robinhood]( just pure dogshit IOU Bitcoin pair. 
Bitcoin will be different than (the historical manipulation of) paper gold however. This is also what secures it's rule over other shitcoins: the extremely limited cap, and low inflation (mining pay out). 
All the fake fiat-fork fund of the world can go ahead and print their own BTC-fiat (expose) IOUs, but along with hyper (and food-) inflation setting in (trade wars..), BItcoin adoption, there'll be slow but gradual "bankrun" on anything than what hodling it's value. Don't be pessimistic about all this. ETFs will attract loads of idiot rich grandpa/Babyboomers, who'll see their money evaporate into thin air once this money contraction (Feds lowering rates already) starts kicking into mainsteam. That in turn (money taken out of circulation) will instantly flop into the value represented by Bitcoin. The derivatives bubble blow up.

the real volume is much less on Bitmex. The record set few days ago was just over 8 bio USD (1m XBT). In that figure is included the leverage used by traders (1x-100x). The average leverag is just under 10x, so the "real" volume perhaps is more like 1 bio USD/day (similar to what Binance /BItfinex has). A good deal of that is just people trying to improve their position, as if you are a market maker you get 0.25% on a trade (whereas the takers pay 0.75%). Meaning this is worse than no--fee exchanges where anybody can washtrade a price in a thin volume market. If the volume was cleaned from all this, maybe we'd have a 350K-500K m USD/day.
Bitcoin, if it's actually limited in cap as it should be, will never have the same problem as gold derivatives (easy to manipulate). As financial broker houses just issue new paper-gold certificates, in the end we see real gold only be 0.5% max of the total paper market. As Bitmex is only trade with BTC as input, there's direct correlation of market size vs input.
Lot of trade moves temporary to Bitmex in periods of high volatily, as the price action tends to be highly manipulated in the spot market (whale pump /dumps and serious offloading at peak times). To some degree Bitmex can in peak hours (?!) be leading the ticker race up and down. Im wondering if it's geographical limitations (not for US customers) prevents incentive to manipulate across exchanges (for ex taking spot markets up/down shortly) while going short/long on derivatives.
Derivatives make Bitcoin more volatile (not less) as you see when the tide rolls out, the spot market shoots up as soon as shorts close, or when we are shooting up in new ATH (only to drop like a stone). This is because there's real buying up of a physical asset (vs for ex gold where there's zero buying almost and no influence on the overall market).
Derivatives are sort of a necessary evil, the best to hope for is all the short term gains by shorters will get sucked up by longs over time. This mean, even more $ in the crypto sphere..

who's "others" (exchanges)? I did the aggregate (multiplication) sum of smaller exchanges (on volume trading..) and there it doesn't add up.
"Others", meaning any other exchanges than the say top 10 listed, MAY have extremely large order books (say for ex 100-1000x their traded volume). But it seems highly unlikely!?
Obviously the data input could be wrong. I asked the admin, but to no reply.
What I'm wondering is if somebody's clandestinely buying up most available coins on the market (off the "public/official" exchanges), and what we are seeing on the cover (flat price development while we are still in massive QE) is a mirage price, washed-traded. As in the same seller buys coins back at a lower price. BTC is still a tiny tiny market compared to global derivatives.
Something is extremely fishy if this data is correct.

"ETFs" for Bitcoin will very likely just follow the Robinhood app formula, in that they (financial corporations) will say they are "investing" and storing Bitcoin (while having clear incentives to reign in Bitcoin being the market exit overall, just like they're doing with gold). This is social math for 5 year olds, but some have yet to arrive at this stage..
Other examples are Conbase's new "pro" portal that on the corporate level obviously is trying to "bend" Bitcoin into a paypal like on ramp. Meaning you have your "IOUs" in their custody. They leverage those as they please.
Not having anything in anyone's custody, is the whole idea of Bitcoin. It's weird we have to repeat this mantra over again, but it seems many jump on to this bandwaggon thinking, that when financial institutions get onboard Bitcoin will moon.
Probably it's always been from the exact other direction : when the masses, millionaries and retail investors get onboard, Bitcoin moons.
As for Goldman Sacs excetutives, they have already loaded up on Bitcoin a year ago, just as a hedge in case all their rigged casino's offered to the debt serfs aren't bringing in the billions they should.

Probably ETF approval is already calculated into BTC pricing, so we are likely to see a short correction if it should get disaaproved. Doesn't matter in the longer run as BTC is more dependent on retail investors (derivative bubble will likely dissapear into thin air in the next financial crash and along with it most of the financial industry)..

yes to the premise as well ofcourse, but no to the inflation bit. Bitcoin is what the British pound used to be now: the worlds strongest currency (or "store of value"). Bitcoins stable "rise" in exchange rate reflects the actual (hyper) inflation of the other currencies. So when btc is up around 3.5x per year it means we have this amount of hyperinflation in both USD, GBP and EUR etc. The rest of currencies way more. Many can't get their head around this. The official stats are just rigged numbers, phoney-fake. 
But you don't take into account that in the next financial crises, that will be 100% much much worse than the previous, everybody will reach for the lifeboats. And in all the rigged markets only bitcoin is secured with somekind of anti-rigging mechanism. Do note that Ethereum isn't as it is non-limited cap.

look at the past of any new technology when the existing players tried shutting it down or buying it up.. napster .. mega... myspace..silkroad.. piratebay all shut down, faded out or changed ownership. But the form surviving. Bitcoin IS already a multi currency system in that we already have 2 ethereums (bitcoin forks essentially), 4-5 bitcoin wannabes (litecoin, ripple, zcash, bcash, 2X, bitgold etc). The real question is what will happen during the next crash. Maybe like in Venezuela even if real BTC is prohibited and the crypto "ruble" only allowed people don't care. There will be a black market where "real" currency is traded like in any 3rd world country now and then the "fiat" crypto that nobody wants as it's not got a cap limit and is centralised. Africa might be adopting to this much quicker and it will be a tremendous change as suddenly you can now really save you labors worth and not have the dollar/€ economy and its people living on debts sucking up the real value.

Some of them, or most of them (the dogs) even in the board room, don't have the understanding, knowledge of what it really is (As they have their heads up own asses). But the big dogs do. What they try is to bend the narrative, to let other bankers believe it's not a threat. If they believed it was a threat, everything in their -personal- holdings would instantly be siphoned over into crypto... adn eventually that of the clients. They know from first hand experience what a complete shitshow modern banking and finance is, and how close the house of cards is to complete anihilation (think only back to 2007 Paulson with hat in his hand .. and stick, begging bailout).

the development (inflationary output on top of Bitcoin) in shit coins, can be seen as part of fractional reserve "lending"/money creation. It's borderline similar to what happened to fractional reserve fiat on gold, or rather at first recorded event, for silver, in ancient china. Egypt likely had a precursor but nothing remains to tell that story..
We are supposed to believe the [first banks were Chinese]( issuing 1:1 guarantee signed hemp papers that supposedly could be used as collateral/withdrawal proofs at multiple locations. The question is if their later outflow of silver (the opium wars) started troubles (and hence made them print money). India and China used to be the two richest countries in the world (with most of the gold and silver) before the british empire. Both
The incentive to issue more "paper" only comes in a economy that operates with interest. I reapeat "operate interest", as this was probably UNIVERSALLY avoided, even forbidden in most ancient economies. Just as today if you go to many places in the Muslim world (part of) their banking system don't allow interest (they have a shadow banking system now that does...).
This is because if you start to issue credit, loans with interest, someone in the economy has to go broke.  It creates that game of musical chairs where there's constantly someone who's conserving loosing out to the one consuming. To illustrate that, one can look at deforestation speeds or how the oceans are fished today virtually 99% empty of fish. To pay loans on your fleet, today you literally have to go 2-3 weeks at sea to catch anything worth it economically. Just 250 years ago there were so [much fish]( it was the common food for the poor masses. Many straits and [rivers]( had so much fish people would showel them into barrels.
Interest bearing money creation is typically sought by those in power, only to rid the poor further of their value. It's only the later few hundred years of history where we almost now universally think that it's a necessity.
Please understand that to remain prosperous across populations, with natural resources intact, coherrent as a civilisation culturally, morally, ethically non-interest bearing economies is the logic choice.
The "rich" will maybe not be extremely more rich (look at Warren Buffet), but is that what we want with the world?

of course I'm guessing at best. But it seem to be a general asumption, that big institutions will just buy up BTC on the open market.
Obviously it depends on the institution. If it's Goldman they'd have giant incentive to make own stable coin (they're already doing it), and introduce it onto their onramp platforms (Circle, Poloniex). Then hold BTC down as much as possible while scoring on any other market ad hoc. If it's for ex Blackrock they likely make a "fund" meaning you don't know if they're actually purchasing 100% crypto (as they're custodians), meaning likely they're just pairing their "blackrock IOU" to BTC. 
The biggest problem for any ETF operating without actually buying up 1:1 on the open spot market will be "bank runs", so maybe we can expect to see some dodgy small writing with that.
Look at CBOE and CME futures, they're both cash settled futures, paired to BTC. Meaning no Bitcoin is ever bought or sold. Just CBOE/CME tokens. This is what happened to gold in the 70ies and continued up to now where +99.5% of gold sold on the world market are worthless paper-gold IOUs that for the main part can't be cashed in even for physical gold (as with any FX product..).
Ask yourself, if you're sitting on a goldmine (current finacial derivative markets), why would you want to leverage anything competing to that system, unless you absolutely have no other way.

obviously it be incredibly bullish with a real estate landslide BTC acceptance. Real estate luxury prices are starting to drop worldwide, to get stuff sold they cave in to lower prices. Selling pressure triggers a whole new front of BTC acceptance, possibly the primary: other vendors (mainly in luxuries) see the new business the real estate agents are getting. 
..difficult not to be incredibly positive. The more luxury real estate is going in the shatters as liquidity dries up for the financial sector, the more pressure on crypto adoption.

oh yes great question. Maybe atleast it will inevitably create fiat hyperinflation. Governments and banks poor their money into something tangible (bitcoin) per necessity. Only make price hike up further. Even if outlawed (like street dollars previously in blockaded states like Cuba) bitcoin will be buried deep as people know it's more worth than gold. Recall that gold can be confiscated (like in the US 1929). That's why all bankers want bitcoin dead. Fiat would blow up anyway due the credit based inflationary economy bubble. They would have their microchip electronic money only system ready. But eventually it will not be the hyperinflation that finishes off the old economy, it will be derivatives and housing (loan defaults) just like in the last crisis. But it will be unevenly distributed across countries. Most western world will look like 2012 the movie whereas China will have their arks (having bought gold.. and prepared their own state backed crypto and gold backed currencies..). These just few of the parameters..

those are excellent questions, and obviously difficult for anyone to answer well. We should observe maybe the difference of a system based on,
1) Banks lending out credit based on adding zero's after a "1" in their computer when you take a loan, effectively creating one gigantic economy based on marginal default loans, and constant credit bubble creation (to be able to pay back the impossible loans, raping the planet)
2) someone deciding to risk their Bitcoin in a loan (with or without collateral), much like the family loan
The latter in infinitely more difficult to manipulate compared to credit creation with fiat. You can only lend out your private keys (them being spend) once. Where as credit creation on a "money residual" (fractional reserve) in reality have no barriers, no stops but the supposed residual "[capital requirement"]( (that now goes away with "cashfree society" and the latest development in [removing capital requirement](
Still, the tokenisation economy, with every company creating their own token, abundance of shitcoins, it's the dillution of Bitcoin we are facing. So with 40-45% BTC market dominance, instead of the theoretic inflationary (mining) rate at 2%, we see instead a inflationary rate much closer to say 5-20%/yr (depending on shitcoin dominance). Possibly shitcoins will have a similar development as dotcom crash, with 95-99% dissapearing within 3-5 years. Then it will be the ["tokenisation if everything"]( that will lead the inflationary input to the equation. Especially if central autheorities are able to "fix" rates (to Bitcoin or other crypto), in that a for ex SDR/Goldman/Fed stable-coin are law enforced. Meaning it will only be allowed for transactions (and BTC will be the blackmarket coin). Want to eat, buying stuff in supermarkets? Use fed-coin. Blackmarkets seem always to occur under totalitarian regimes..

Still it's a viable hedge ofcourse and especially while the spot rates are being manipulated: as you can take a severe bonus on the upside when it's being shorted further down than natural, and same thing for bubbling when euphoria sets in.

point is, Bitcoin went through similar development with FX as in commodities. Meaning many more traders now look partly to shorts/longs in their opinion on trends. In determining trading direction. 
Meaning, the price on spot exchanges now are weighted more relatively by what's happening on the FX market. Not the other way around. That's what I meant.
It doesn't matter in that sense if FX exchanges use corrections to index pricing from spot markets. That's why observing trends and development in volume levels (especially FX vs spot) is more interesting - even though it can be difficult to figure out whats real and not.. makes sense?

correct me if wrong: there are now more turnover on FX exchanges like Bitmex, BitflyerFX, as well as institutional combined than the regular spot?
Hence it can be assumed, will be marginally the FX market driving price. For ex as we bottom out any trader will have inclination to go betting depositing BTC, to gain “more” (than just pure BTC spot purchase). But since volume is moving over to FX, the regular spot is not increasing as much.
The same effect can be seen with alt coins, being historically dependent on BTC direction. Any marginal rent seeking fiat pushed into crypto goes (not into BTC but..) into a secondary market (dependent on the primary..). 
Hence theres a weird catch 22 event, where interdependence rules out the preliminary motivation. Meaning the very purpose of going long (to gain more BTC, compared to buying regular spot BTC), is defeated in that placing betting produces a manipulable secondary market. (this can be illustrated with that fiat is unlimited pushed on to something limited and decreasing supply)
I havn’t read this anywhere, it is simply logical reasoning considering infinity/limited applied to these social dynamics.

there's currently more daily volume on futures exchanges Bitmex, Bitflyer, BitfinexFX and the retail gamblers are slowly but surely loosing chip by chip. 
Bit of a concern when the old fiat houses are coming into crypto and scooping up whats left. While their monopoly money is still worth something. 
Ordinary folk will gain interest again when BTC is new ATH. Only to be fucked hard as the house starts turning the bucket to short, while unloading their stash again. Or y'all think they will hang on to BTC?

Aprt from BTC moving with seasons and planets I noticed the date is 12042018. Few will get that, but there's a particular mood change everywhere and spring in the air. It's turning tides, and yes haha so sad the feeling not having more fiat to gobble up BTC while it's ridiculously cheap..

having paper wallets are not a flaw mate. Non open source software, forcing trust on to a (corporate) business, issueing your hardware is. Clear now?

This is old news. But whats happening on the moderation? I thought r/bitcoin was only 100% bitcoin related? I recall posting when the libor scandal hit the streets, having it removed for non relation. That, apart from continuous bailouts, is single handedly is the biggest scandal to break in the last 25 years in banking, and much more reason for everybody to swing to BTC. Just a sour taste as this forum again shows it's mysterious standards of selectiveness. Im bitcoin maximalist.

translation of the article into common non-doublespeak: "the twins, to do what daddy says, will do anything in their power to abide to wallstreet (like on 2X), ensuring smoother manipulation and "compliance" with corrupt authorities.

retail trading at this point with average betters loosing their pocket money is minuscule part of the market. Many seamen betting on FX will be rinsed out of all their winnings sooner or later.. by AI and hypertrading. 
Try having some practise against AI in Go (the asian board game) and you'll start considering the overall, general aspects of many AI's involved in this whole endgame, slowly eliminating the fringes, concentrating the main action on a few larger players running quantum trading algos. Not saying that there aren't a few clever % of people able to cheat the AI's. 
But, reading tweets of seasoned traders falling back on hodling as the most succesful of their portfolio strategies, should indicate part picture of what's unfolding..

that thought occured to me too, but in the light of the risk profile doing it at this point with 2 large funds going into the market it wouldn't be legit. More likely it is institutional money from the self same realising this is not dropping further, or a combination of the two. Driven by AI bots, and reenforced by manual buying, shorters getting liquidated, people going long etc. Typical of a cyclical bottoming out..
