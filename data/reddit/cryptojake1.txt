I know this might be a dumb question but can someone explain to me how the whole network can continue once the last coin is mined and miners have no financial incentive? How will transactions be processed?

While I won’t be dodging taxes, I do find it fairly ridiculous that the government feels it’s okay to tax my income, then tax my returns on crypto, and THEN tax me when I use that money to purchase anything. Greedy bastards

What I did was buy BTC until I hit the number I wanted to reach and then got into mining as a hobby of sorts. It's ultimately up to you, but I'd try to find something in the middle and not put all of your eggs in the mining basket.

Would I be better off just taking the money I was planning on using on the mining device and just buy more bitcoin with it?

What a tool. Does he actually believe the nonsense that comes out of his mouth?

A USB mining rig I put together. Nothing that's gonna light the world on fire but enough combined hashrate that I feel I have enough of a shot to keep running it. And I bought BTC first and then spent a good amount of money on my miners so it's not like I'm banking on it. I just let the program run all day and night and if I hit the lottery then great lol

I would say never buy a cold wallet from anywhere but the official site

100% in the same boat. Wasting money everywhere. I wanted something and I got it. Whether I had the money or had to use credit. Now, I put so much more thought into every purchase because I want more bitcoin lmao

Not yet. But I'm also not in it for any kind of business interest. I am not in a pool or anything. Solo mining and hoping to hit the lottery.

Imagine buying bitcoin as a way to try to get a sports car..

I'm not sure, but honestly it's not worth risking getting one from a third party just to save a few bucks. Make sure you get a brand new, unopened device from the company.

I started buying bitcoin a few weeks ago and within the first day of my purchase I was getting calls from my bank asking if I made these transactions and if I was held against my will and forced to make them. Never had a call like that in 4 years of using that bank and as soon as I switch my money to crypto I get that call.
