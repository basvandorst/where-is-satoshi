I'm not sure you can ascribe such an abstract position to a dead guy. Maybe have a little respect? Did that occur to you?

This post got me to check out after being an observer of this sub for a while. I don't understand the in-depth ideological differences between the groups, I just have a basic grasp on bitcoin and think it's pretty cool.
Even though this sub seems more popular, I saw some convincing rhetoric about increasing block size and I was wondering if anyone here had a resource that addresses the pros and cons in an unbiased manner.
Additionally, the accusations in this article just seem like suspicions with little actual evidence. I would assume there is more hard evidence floating around somewhere? Could anyone help me find it?
I find it amusing that r/btc has their own medium article filled with the same accusations I see here:
It just seems more concrete. Please help me figure all this out so I can make informed decisions.

So why is a business openning unprofitable accounts in the first place?

As was stated above by another commenter,


People give the banks tons of excuses for their behaviour that have nothing to do with money. I shoot down those "reasons". Oh look, it actually *is* about money and not whatever bizarro excuse the reddit commenters made up today!
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:55:36
Yes. This feels like an infographic which is 20% done.

It is a trade off, certainly. Banks came about to hold and transfer wealth because the individual was not able to do so safely. People traded immediate ownership and access to their money to the bank in exchange for the protection of their assets. Having accumulated wealth, banks acquire a secondary function to redistribute that wealth into loans and investments.
Now we have a much more secure *and* immediately accessible way of storing currency. It doesn't produce interest, but it is solely the property of whoever has the info to access it. If no one has the info, it's no one's money. That's the trade-off for leaving the old technology of banks behind.

I'm not *saying* they should make decisions off of kindness alone, all I'm *saying* is that it's wrong to attribute incompetence to banks as a reason they aren't helping you. They are very competent. They *could* help you if they wanted. But they don't because it isn't profitable.
Though it would be nice if we lived in a world without profit incentive, I don't think banks could even exist in that world.

So, do I *also* share all my debt with anyone who shares my name? How does the government know who to release the money to if there's no way to differentiate between people who share a name?? 
Or are you just being obtuse in order to defend the banks, for some ungodly reason?
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:47:13
You really believe they have NO other way of finding you other than the address you give?
I guess I can take out loans, then move somewhere else, and the bank will never be able to find me! I'll never have to pay my loans back!
Unless...it is actually really really easy for a bank to find someone. In the year of our lord 2019.

In America we have these things called Social Security Numbers that the government made specifically so they can track and differentiate between people who have similar names or records.
If you are opening a bank account in the US, you are recquired to provide them with your SSN so that they have the capability to tell the difference between the owners of two accounts. This is simple stuff. Your SSN is tied to a good portion of your economic activity, making it easy for the government and for banks to be sure they've got the right person.
You are acting like we live in medieval times where banks have to send out a town crier to shout, "John J. Smith owes 50 dubloons!"

You are removing the context of my quote. "If something makes people mad it should not be done- IN A DEMOCRACY"
Clearly you don't think a democracy is the right way to run things- and I'm inclined to agree.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:52:19
Ok, so which is it? The banks don't contact you because they can't, or the banks don't contact you because it's unprofitable?
This is the point I was getting at.

I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding the point they are making.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:27:38
They're all forks, genius. That's what forking means.
If I am talking about Bitcoin as a class of actively developed currencies, it makes no sense for me to also use "Bitcoin" to refer to the single most used fork out of those currencies. That would be confusing for my audience. So I clarify it by the terminology I've seen used before, which you obviously understood or else you wouldn't have been so *offended* over being reminded that your preferred cryptocurrency isn't globally dominant yet.
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:17:46
I'm not trying anything. I called one fork of bitcoin a fork and you had a fucking meltdown that you ineptly injected with  bad jokes and cumbersome idiosyncracies to make it seem like you are less embarrassingly upset by my neutral, nonjudgemental reddit comment than you actually are.
A guy asked a question. I answered. You revealed just how necessary it is to your self-image that you must attack me personally, and that you must seem super funny and intelligent to all 4 of the internet strangers reading your comment while doing it. But you missed the mark due to your low emotional intelligence and poorly developed self-awareness. Desperate. But these are things you CAN work on. :)
This is what calling people "kid" and using stylized laughter as dialogue gets you. Maybe just try condensing your thoughts down to what you actually want to say instead of writing a highly derivative micro-screenplay whenever cryptocurrency discourse becomes too much to handle.
I'm just doing this in the hopes you'll be less eager to bother the next random commenter who offends you. It's less an attack on you, so much as it is an excercise in seeing whether self-realization is attainable through digital roasts. If you can't handle this, you shouldn't be inviting it with your comments.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:39:17
Do you put on that blindingly desperate personality just for reddit, or is it something you do in front of actual people, too?
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:31:52
You won't find it on this bitcoin subreddit. To put it neutrally, r/bitcoin is run in cooperation with the current developers of the popular fork of bitcoin that deviates from the whitepaper and seeks "off-chain" solutions to scaling, AKA Bitcoin Core (BTC). Bitcoin Core is the currency that this takeover and sabotage *allegedly* happened to.
Whether that's all true or not, this subreddit is NOT receptive to the notion at all. You might find more luck asking on other popular crypto subs.
Edit: See what I mean? Not receptive at all! Also, I'm not an owner or supporter of any Bitcoin Cash! Try reading my comment again and look for any judgement words being included. Note: there are none. I don't hold a position in this comment. Debates of terminology is another matter; a matter of education and not reprimand. Thanks for being understanding, r/btc
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:53:27
Do not reply to me if you have nothing substantive to say. It's a waste of my time.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:30:32
Yeah, anyone can develop, and anyone can fork, and the developers for this fork have significant sway in the subreddit dedicated to their fork. I'm not saying it's some crazy conspiracy. I'm saying that's why people won't be receptive to this guy's vaguely recalled story about a takeover and sabotage. Which is true, isn't it? The people here weren't happy to see me explain the allegations.
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:47:02
He also provided basic solutions to be implemented before we reached that point. Saying it may be required is not the same as saying "abandon the tools I've already built into the currency in favor of a privately controlled and developed vaporware."
But I don't want to get into a big argument. That's not why I made the comment.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:16:38
Sounds like an excuse someone who is actually doing bad things would use. Using the CIA as an example of "the greater good" is a poor choice.
If doing something would make people mad, it should not be done in a democracy. That is the whole point of democracy.
