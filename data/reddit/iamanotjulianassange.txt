Aaaaand downvote for being off topic, still.  It sounds like you'd like to have a different conversation.  One I might enjoy.  But this is my post and it has a specific purpose.

Oh yeah.  Good point.  Well that tears it.  Bitcoin is a failed experiment.  I'm cashing out.

Okay.  Why?
EDIT: Wait, don't you have that backwards?  Could you write that as USD:BTC to be consistent?

I don't see how.  It would only affect the time a transaction takes to clear within a region of the universe.  Paul Krugman of all people has an analysis of this:
Anyway, that's a physical limit.  Not a technical one.  But upvote anyway because cool.

Is he living?  Maybe he died after he dropped the mic.
Then again maybe he's not human?
EDIT:  And it just occurred to me that maybe he's not a he.  Maybe he's a she.  Or an "it" like the CIA.  Or the CCC.  Or the PTA.  Or some kicked-around dork and his three dweeby friends who all dream of being overnight tycoons and buying a bond-villain island if they don't die from Mountain Dew and Ho-Ho poisoning before they crash the world financial system by selling out and buying... gold?  Greece?  All the water?
By the way: I'm not proud that I consider Bitcoin might be written by aliens before I considered it might be written by a woman.  Personal low point.

Okay but why?
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:34:51
That wasn't the question.  It's a philosophical belief that you chose to interject.  So: downvote.

All very interesting but I don't see how Satoshi's personal stake relates to the value of Bitcoin.  Do you?  If you do then please explain.
The rest of it sidesteps the question.  We all know that the value of Bitcoin is determined by a wide range of factors.  My question was not what those factors are but how high you think Bitcoin can go and why?
So saying it depends on "general financial stability of the economic systems in the world" sidesteps the question.
