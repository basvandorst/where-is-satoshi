Are you seriously banking on bankers telling you the truth about anything?

Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that it's deflationary, secure and decentralized and borderless. You can send your monetary value world wide without any 3rd party interception of the transaction. Increased value will come with additional adoption as fiat currencies convert into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the next step in the evolution of currencies we use today.

Bitcoin is currently divisible up to 8 decimal points, if fully adopted everyone in the world will be trading in portions of a bitcoin and owning a full bitcoin will be rare, the smallest unit of a bitcoin is a Satoshi. Currently speculation is on that fact, if you own a full bitcoin now and hold it till mass adoption occurs you will own a large amount of value. Bitcoin can also be divisible by other currencies which base their value on bitcoin such as litecoin, a gold/silver like partnership. A switch to bitcoin is a reverting back to gold backed fiat but with a lot more advantages due to the technology.

They made money by shaking it out of your pockets with the lies they peddle about markets while they put themselves in a position to profit. If they tell you to sell while they buy and then buy while they sell, who wins? Make money off your own research and decision making.

Because Bitcoin Cash is an attempt at centralization of bitcoin with nothing more than the allure of a patch fix (increased block size) and lots of propaganda, Bitcoin has problems but they need a real solution and not the one proposed by Bitcoin Cash, which would see just constantly increasing the block size to artificially fix the issue of scaling and fees but ultimately failing due to the increased data amount required to run nodes causing the network to become more centralized and manipulated.

Your attempts at misinforming users needs more work, it's quite pathetic how weak your attempts have been so far.
