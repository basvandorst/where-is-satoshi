That is for running a full node, which is definitely recommended if you are putting a significant amount of wealth into bitcoin.

The main pieces Satoshi used to put Bitcoin together existed as of 2001 – the configuration was novel and the invention of the difficulty adjustment was the logical next step, if also a genius breakthrough.

@_date: 2015-12-27 06:03:39
This is incorrect and a whitewash of the real situation. It's horders (HODLERS) that provide a lot of the buoyancy in the price, and obsession with Bitcoin's value amongst traders creates its market exchange rate, which in turn strengthens/secures the network via its value. You'll never convince all the millions of people with skin in the game that the price is "irrelevant".
However, I agree that the technology is what underpins the importance of the price.

Wrong. You can EARN bitcoin through economic activity now (providing goods and services) that wouldn't have been possible before; no conversion of old assets is required.
As even more financial instruments are built on the blockchain, the total amount of new economic activity that was not only impossible but inconceivable before 2009 grows. Technology is NOT a zero-sum game. As an analogy, see this article critiquing an analysis of the growth potential of ridesharing app Uber:

Wonder if Bitcoin has a tipping address...
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:03:45
First off, those are the 500 largest *addresses*. Many of them belong to companies. A completely inaccurate view of how much wealth *individuals* control in Bitcoin. 
Secondly, currently the [85 richest people in the world control as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion]( which is pretty uneven as it is. Regardless, I take issue with your assumption that wealth inequality is inherently bad. People are *not* equal in their skill and luck to earn. That's life. At least with Bitcoin, the early adopters have had the foresight to invest in a new technology and be rewarded. In addition, in our current system, the very wealthy control the means of money production and use it to draw off wealth from all the other users of that money. Even if there are megarich Bitcoin holders, they will never have that ability.
Regarding your other inane comment, mobs with pitchforks also kill and steal from innocent people. Not necessarily a good thing. No one is forced to use Bitcoin, it's completely voluntary, unlike government monies, which are forced upon citizens by legal tender laws. So, if enough of a "mob" decided they didn't like the way the big Bitcoin holders were acting, they could very, *very* easily transfer all their currency uses to an altcoin of their choice.

@_date: 2014-09-04 16:57:30
I remember this very well. It's cute, but unfortunately not based in reality. A constrained money supply is not a barrier to investment or progress. In fact, investment and progress are more likely to increase in efficiency and effectiveness; depreciating currency creates an unbalanced desire to flee it and invest in anything and everything, throwing caution to the wind to escape guaranteed loss.
And in a cryptoeconomic world, new tokens can be created at will to fund new projects, while an underlying asset like Bitcoin remains sound and retains its value. Over time, overall wealth increases, especially in a mechanized world (where machines' work create abundance). Once we remove the shackles of inflation and predatory banking, that will become much more apparent.

This is possible, especially if Bitcoin's and gold's supply inflation rate are similar.
However, it's far more likely they would float a lot against each other. If Bitcoin is on the rise as a store of value at that time, it may well eat into gold's market share for that purpose. After all, gold's industrial value is only a small fraction of its current price.

1. No. Margin calls are automated sells. If you are gaining value, there is no automation needed.
2. They leveraged in the hopes of price *rises*, but had to agree that their position would be sold after a relatively minimal price *drop* because exchanges only allow traders to borrow as much as traders have on the books and no more. (Iow no debt allowed, all leverage must be covered on the books.)

Not necessarily. The demand just needs to exceed the 3000 bitcoins being created each day, i.e. a million bucks at current prices.
Being rather illiquid, a few million every day will have a massive effect on the price. Go mouse over the buy chart on a bitcoin price site and you'll see just how little worthless paper it takes. Several million a day is a drop in the bucket, considering the tens or hundreds of *trillions* of fiat out there.

Agree with your summation that the author is attempting to define and analyze the impact of blockchain tech from a narrow pre-defined politicophilosophical viewpoint. 
Imo, despite his careful study of cryptocurrencies, their fundamental technology, notable developments and key philosophical figures, the author misses just how deeply revolutionary the Blockchain is. Rather than exploring the possibilities, he is calling for restraint. 
I can hear his voice echoing into the void while the reality of human society plays its own tune more and more loudly. The Blockchain will destroy the trust-dependent institutions he finds so attractive and full of the goodness of human warmth and goodwill whether he approves or not.

No one seems to have mentioned the coming crash in centralized manufacture, so I will:
A crash in the centralized manufacturing industry is coming, fueled by the ubiquity of 3D printing. Cryptocurrency will imo already be the world's dominant money by the time the tech advances enough to make this economically and practically feasible (~late 2020s). Individuals will make much more finely-grained decisions about exactly what to spend on raw material (and DRM fees, if applicable -- though post-manufacturing might also mean post-intellectual-property). With advances in energy tech also causing a plunge in the costs of creating physical goods, we might see a totally different landscape for calculating and conceptualizing the economy of manufacture that would make the above analysis obsolete.
Efficiency is the natural result in any case. Decentralized manufacture means that the adjudication (product quality vs. price) is achieved either way.

It often is, because sellers often immediately cash out the bitcoin they were paid (a la Bitpay).
But I think bitcoinisawesome is wrong over the long term in the sense that the more time passes, the less the early adopters will *need* to cash out in order to buy goods and services. When BTC simply circulates, it has no direct effect on the exchange rate.

They aren't "supposed" to do anything. We all decide together. And "we" includes the CEO of Paypal.
The truth is, Paypal provides other valuable services in addition to its soon-obsolete money-transferring business. Most notably, escrow. I am 100% certain they are going to be merging their escrow function with cryptocurrencies, helping provide a valuable service to the Bitcoin ecosystem. But this time, they'll have to compete with thousands of other escrow companies in a free market.

No it is not a valid transaction.
If you want to buy a $10000 car and have a one of a kind signed Jim Morrison poetry book worth $6000, you need to come up with the extra $4000 in kind.
So if you wanted to buy LinkedIn, you'd have to pay partially in Bitcoin (however many you could buy up) and partially with something else.
However, 1) buying up lots of BTC will increase its value to an extent and 2) in the future, the market cap of the Bitcoin market could be in the trillions, in which case it will be more useful.
A $7 Billion market is not very large compared to the world economy, which is why Wall Street is barely nibbling. As the market cap grows, naturally Bitcoin becomes more useful at the large scale end.

Those who underestimate the "good enough" principle of technology and overestimate the value of "build a new one from scratch" are typically ignorant and inexperienced in the ways of engineering workflow.
Yes, Crypto 2.0 (e.g. Ethereum) built from scratch may be better academically or philosophically. But this is the real world, where software gains strength and stability from testing and bugfixing by the most people for the most hours, not from ideas or neat, clear charts.

Regardless, Peter makes a very big blunder in this video, that gold will have value in the future just because it has had value for thousands of years. The same was thought of horses.

Bitcoin was built to be regulation-resistant. What that means is that enforcing regulation is a fruitless effort, essentially impossible to do in any meaningful way.

Actually you'd need a lot less bitcoin than you need USD because the (potential) velocity is so high. So that's a downward pressure.

I'm aware of sidechains. They are orthagonal to the hard fork issue... i.e. both Core and Klassik could each have sidechains.
And who is "forcing" anyone to participate in speculation? Futures and prediction markets enable people to evaluate risk scenarios more accurately, leveraging the wisdom (or foolishness atcmb) of crowds. Note though that the speculation in a prediction market about a hard fork would not prevent anyone from investing in either side of the fork.
It sounds like you support Core and are afraid the prediction market might show more than 50% support for Classic, causing market share to leave Core. Nevertheless you and many others would still invest in Core. Perhaps corecoins might lose exchange value, but it's not the end of the world. No need to fear anything (especially if, as critics of Klassik point out, its higher block size reduces its security).

The pressure on miners is intense and will be even moreso by July. Their profit margins are very narrow and nearly all need to sell most or all of their fresh bitcoin as soon as they can. That currently sends up to 3600 btc ($1.6m) into the markets daily, absorbing demand.
Regardless of speculation between now and then, that amount will drop by 50% on that legendary day in July and the demand will NOT be met by the newly mined coin coming onto markets over the following hours. That demand has to go somewhere, so it _must_ go to open markets where the liquidity will be sucked up until the price reflects the change in supply. No amount of speculation can change that simple fact. If the start of this year is any indication, the demand for Bitcoin is likely to continue rising or at least staying stable.
It would be different if most or nearly all miners were living off debt (like oil e.g.) and didn't actually need to liquidate their revenues quickly. It took a year or more for many oil companies to go bankrupt, operating all the while at a massive loss.
Miners otoh don't have the ability to do that. If the price drops too much, they have to reduce capacity FAST or they're toast. Bitcoin moves at the speed of the block, not the speed of the courier. It is possible that all speculators will simply sell into the demand and keep prices even, but that type of pressure tends to have a psychological effect as well.

He used to make terrific educational videos, then got obsessed with how anonymous votes in the US Congress have allowed more corruption (probably true) and has attempted to apply that principle to Bitcoin mining (dubious at best), which made him lose faith in Bitcoin apparently.
Anonymous mining is pretty central to how Bitcoin works (prevents authorities from oppressing the system), so hardly anyone in the ecosystem listens to him anymore.

One important point is that due to technology moving so fast, scarcity in general may be a historic concept some time this century. Regardless, better/more effective/popular monetary systems could easily be created during that time frame that would supercede Bitcoin.
And given the deflationary effects expected with hypothetical mass adoption of Bitcoin, the block reward will have a high value for a number of decades still.
So imo the scenario of us ever needing Bitcoin to survive to the point where transaction fees truly take over in the mining profit scheme is slim to none. Certainly it needn't be planned for when there are much, much more urgent tasks that need doing like throughput scaling &amp; fungibility/privacy. A glance at recent BIPs being developed shows that they're certainly being addressed a step at a time.

I see you haven't watched that first video yet.
Yes, the return must be expected to be greater than the cost. But you must separate value/wealth from numerical measurement of money, just as is done now with inflation (where you must _beat_ inflation). Instead, you must only earn a numerical value amount that beats the value lowered by expected deflation.
To think that such a simple calculation (adjust numerical value by expected deflation amount) is beyond accountants or that there is a psychological effect that cannot be overcome by economic reality is specious in the extreme.

Implementations of Lightning are currently being worked on and there are proofs of concept already running on testnet.
Other payment channel innovations are also functional (in alpha), such as the one created by Yours social app, while others are planned such as Duplex Micropayments. Then there's Open Transactions which has a slew of privacy &amp; scaling features and is already in production on Stash Crypto hard- &amp; software.
However, the big prerequisite to getting Lightning up on production is segwit, which is currently pushing 30% miner signaling. Wallets and miners are in the process of integrating the relatively labor-intensive changes that segwit brings, so they're taking their time signaling support. I would imagine reaching the 95% threshold will take until March at least. After segwit activates, we'll start seeing Lightning features getting integrated into wallets &amp; services.
In my estimation, we'll start seeing the first practical payment channel use cases popping up this Summer.

This is nothing at all like late 2013 – much more like early 2013 in the aftermath of the first halvening. Remember the price doubled and doubled again at that time. Based on those numbers, we aren't even close to a bubble now; we would need to be in the mid-4 digits.
Oct-Nov 2013 was obviously unsustainable. We are seeing 5% days here, which is very steep, but back then there were 20% days, which is crazy and an obvious result of rampant, raw speculation.
As expected, India was the sleeping Bengal tiger that awoke to the Coin when their authoritarian government pulled the rug out of the economy. What did they think would happen, everyone would just smile and meditate while their children went hungry?

Couldn't resist:
* "Lightning’s proposal would enable small frequently-occurring transactions . . . to be taken off Bitcoin’s main (public) blockchain, by (effectively) combining it with any number of permissioned (private) blockchains."
– Neither effectively nor literally. These transactions are much more like cash and do not necessarily form a paper trail or chain of any type. As such, the next paragraph about the general ledger / subledger comparison is invalid. This assumption causes a later confusion in the article.
* "Bitcoin may be more advanced technology, but the set-up is hardly innovative."
– The setup might not be that different from a debit card, but the fact that you're not trusting your payment channel to a central party is a major innovation.
* "Clearly, this goes some way towards solving Bitcoin’s capacity problem, but at the price of reduced transparency."
– Reduced transparency is not a price, but a desired side-effect to improve fungibility. Transparency = record-keeping = cost (txn fee).
* "Trusted third parties. In a supposedly trust-free system. Seriously."
– I don't believe anyone is claiming Lightning to be trust-free, only Bitcoin. In fact, the central (hehe) premise is to induce a small amount of trust in order to enable instant and tiny transactions that the trusted Bitcoin system cannot. 
* "Why should I trust bitcoin miners more than a traditional central bank?"
– Because miners are accountable to users of the system, unlike central bankers who are accountable to no one, frequently not even the banks that own them.
* "Because these “banks” are full-reserve, the central hub is a liquidity reserve, not because it creates reserves (it doesn’t need to) but because it pulls in reserves from all the satellite banks through the periodic balance updates. It is, in effect, a central bank."
– You just mentioned that is doesn't need to create reserves. It may perform a similar function to provide liquidity that a central bank does, but it is NOT, "in effect" one.
* "But it is not really decentralized. True, a Bitcoin central hub would be distributed: but does putting a copy of the central ledger on every computer in the network make it any less a central ledger?"
– This is not a *Bitcoin* central hub, it's a *Lightning* hub. Very different, as there is no large ledger here, just the live cash-like transaction files flying back and forth. A hub may choose to keep records of said transactions, but that ledger is not functional in the way a blockchain is.
– And even considering the Bitcoin blockchain ledger as "centralized" because it's one ledger is specious in the extreme. Bitcoin's achievement is the establishment of consensus over electronic networks without requiring trust in a central party. Consensus is the point itself, NOT a weakness. This is a typical fallacy seen in a number of anti-Bitcoin and pro-statist/pro-banker pieces over the years.
* "It seems tragic that the solution to Bitcoin’s scaling problems is to turn it into a banking system. But maybe that’s where we inevitably end up. After all, it is not as if the world hasn’t grappled with these problems before. In the end, technology can only do so much. We end up back where we were, not because we want to be there, but because where we were – with all its flaws – is in reality the best we can do."
– To claim that a small amount of trust in a banking clearing-house-like system *built atop a totally decentralized sound asset clearinghouse system* is "back where we were" is completely misrepresenting the Lightning Network. Using the word "tragic" here sidesteps this fact, a rhetorical device to mask the obvious bias of the writer.

However it's likely Bitcoin will enable entire new sections of the economy to open up, new economies entirely, new technology, all requiring Bitcoin to function, increasing demand an unknown amount that could certainly be 1000x or 10000x the current economic capabilties.

If you're going to do an M1 comparison, then you must consider that bitcoin's potential velocity is several hundred times higher than electronic fiat's – therefore less bitcoin is needed to perform the same function as medium of exchange = lower demand = lower price all things being equal.
If the M1 is say $100 trillion in size, you might only need a Bitcoin market cap of $1 trillion to replace that fiat, which makes a price of about $60,000 to the 'coin.

Proving ownership of the BTC is wonderful, until those reserves are stolen or lost, at which point these derivatives lose a concordant amount of their value, up to 100%. 
Proof of reserves does not equal security of reserves and as numerous hacks show, there is no such thing as perfect cybersecurity; hence, these are indeed "paper bitcoin".

Appreciate the effort and thought, James. But you forget about the other branch of Bitcoiners, the anarchists. They simply don't believe the State can be reformed. The general opinion seems to be that, with ubiquitous cryptographic privacy and currency preventing coercive taxation and the support of state fiat, and DApps providing direct, provably fair voting and distribution of the means of production, the future of governance will proceed without govern*ment*.
In short, they believe trying to fix a system with coercion at its core is useless, so they're making all new voluntary systems to disintermediate the current hegemonic, abusive, corrupt social structures.

Network security and 51% attacks aside (interesting as they are), the other elephant in the room is that "smart property" is only a solution to the problem of bookkeeping. Unlike a straight Bitcoin transaction whose value is dependent only on people's willingness to accept it, smart property is just a more effective record that is totally dependent on legal and policing infrastructure. The presence of dependable bookkeeping is very far from any sort of guarantee a developing economy could conjure up such trusted property systems.
An unassailable worldwide currency independent of any local infrastructure besides internet access therefore has far *more* potential to transform such an economy *today*. This video puts the cart before the horse.

"Order is more conductive to a species than chaos"
Not sure I agree, when it comes to systems. It all depends on your definitions. Imo, Bitcoin is far more chaotic than "ordered" government fiat.
Chaos -- in the form of decentralized networks -- is far more powerful than hierarchical, centralized, _ordered_ systems.
"A representative democracy is the best solution for government because though human beings have different capacities and dispositions for rule, all should have a say in their destiny."
Strange you should choose democracy, because anyone in a minority opinion precisely _doesn't_ have a say in their destiny in this system. Information symmetry is coming, and representatives are increasingly less fit to rule since they have no information advantage.
The "best solution" is yet to be found and probably never will be.
But we can do better, _now_.

I got a flash of insight upon reading this article. In crypto, all the various assets are highly liquid, allowing any type of cryptoasset to be used as currency, including stocks in companies and DAOs, etc etc. That's what we have to look forward to -- total flexibility of payment options and acceptance. Anyone will be able to pay anyone else as long as there's a conversion path, and cryptomarkets are essentially trivial to set up, so payment pathways will likely be close to 100% amongst cryptoassets.

Amazon is actually taking a loss in one sense, since they probably budget for their pseudocurrency, the Amazon Credit, to be illiquid enough that they won't have to deliver on x% of the Credits issued (which translates to pure profit). Purse.io is causing that x% to be lower, as it makes their Credits more liquid. I.e., Amazon has to deliver actual goods for the Credits they issue at will, but only if they're used. Purse.io allows them to be used / cashed out in higher volume.

"Because the Bitcoins being spent this way are always from the multisig adress they both agreed upon, Bob doesn't need to worry about the funds being doublespent by Alice as they are already locked to the 2/2 multisig address and cannot be refunded until a certain while later which was initially agreed upon by both Bob and Alice before the funds were ever sent to the multisig address."
How do the bitcoins get "locked" into the initial multisig transaction if they haven't hit the blockchain? Couldn't Alice just fire up her wallet in another client and create a different offchain transaction with another party with the same bitcoins?

I think you both have interesting takes on the crypto situation, but are both too black and white in your thinking:
- is too certain that regulating Bitcoin exchanges is impossible. It certainly is possible, though I agree even if Bitcoin is made 100% illegal in all Western countries, nothing can actually stop it forever, just delay the inevitable.
- claims that individuals "cannot" possess the viewpoint that Bitcoin *both* empowers individuals _and_ is a good asset/investment class. Clearly they do, and clearly that hasn't stopped Bitcoin in any meaningful way.

- I did not call him short-sighted, but I do think he is, based on our conversation.
The macroeconomics field is a complete sham imo. (cf:  -- also see the works of Nassim Taleb, whose main charge against the field is its utter lack of understanding in probability.) Economics in general cannot be considered a science as its "theories" cannot be tested. Much of economics focuses on prediction, but has an atrocious track record for predicting market behavior.
As a techie, you understand the world in a far more accurrately predictive sense than any economist or financier. I congratulate you on your wise and future-proof choice of career.
It is my contention that the academic field of economics is simply a marketing ruse on the part of the finance industry to provide pseudo-scientific legitimacy to their widespread fraud.

Correct, sidechains like Rootstock and software layers atop Bitcoin like Counterparty can be used to duplicate all the basic smart contract properties of Ethereum.
Ethereum differentiates itself via its governance model, block time, plan to introduce proof of stake eventually, and the fact the smart contract language is built directly into the blockchain.
No one has yet been able to explain to me the advantage of that last.

Yes, completely and utterly different. In fact, so different that your question is essentially moot.

makes the same point I was thinking about.
The parallel to the Internet as such is not very useful, as the Internet is a base (physical) utility for which alternatives like mesh networks are not yet tenable. Bitcoin is a *network software* protocol.
The main difference between the two approaches (big/small block size) in regards to censorship resistance boils down to this: History has shown us governments consistently attack competing money systems that threaten their power monopoly (virtually a certainty), while governments may or may not decide to let fear of discontent at banning a given software protocol affect their decisionmaking (very uncertain).
Given the clear difference in the probability of these two types of censorship, it's clear why this issue hasn't presented much of a valid point of argument for miners, full node operators, core devs, investors and other stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, and is one big reason why, despite the rhetoric flying all over the place, "small blocks until upper layer scaling works" has been winning.
In fact, spicy rhetoric riddled with fallacies is the *real* (social) attack vector on Bitcoin, since technical attacks are infeasible.
Otherwise, I appreciate the "meta" comment Jim. I predict the rhetoric will just get more heated, however.

**Step 1**: Have your bitcoin lay down. Wait for him to stand up. When he stands up, click and treat. Repeat this action several times until he learns that he has to stand up in order to get his treat. Standing is so natural that it is likely that the bitcoin won't immediately understand why he is being rewarded, so it may take more repetition than usual. (Initially, it's okay to click even if he isn't standing perfectly; you can work up to this gradually).
**Step 2**: Begin to introduce a visual cue (like your hand gesturing upward) and a verbal command ("Stand") so that he can associate those with standing. Click and treat.
**Step 3**: Have him lay down, then say, "Stand." Jackpot when he stands in the perfect position on command.

Inflationary money as a legitimate, practicable, and sustainable long-term currency is a bogeyman invented by 20th-century pseudoscientists that call themselves economists.
Given the *choice* (that being the operative concept here, in other words not being *forced* by a cartel with violence at its disposal to use their paper "money"), users of currency will not choose one that has all the advantages of Bitcoin except that it loses value as time goes on.
Your concerns of volatility being a barrier to use are manifestly disproved by the current boom in actual use.
Look to adoption rates of technologies as a bellwether for Bitcoin, not financial instruments. These are not "booms and busts" but "growing pains."
Kick back and let the size of the market slow the volatility for you. The bigger it is, the harder it will be to move.
And anways, it will be much less volatile when it's the dominant currency in use.
