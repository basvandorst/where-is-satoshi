Damn you're cool. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:56:16
Why is it scary
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:43:25
What had you bought at? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:26:34
Yes 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:59:11
You serious right now? 
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:27:11
No it won't. Because you'll not only be betting on sports but you'll also have to be betting on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:27:37
It rose substantially. If you think this surge is high,  just wait. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:37:26
So in the "freest" of markets the person who pays the most gets to buy and sell the currency.
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:38:23
lol wow so generous. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:23:49
Hahahahahah. Wow you're deep. That high-school philosophy class must be intense. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:05:32
What worthless degree did you get?
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:15:11
You're only down like 20 percent of your investment right now, so nbd.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:32:27
How fucking stupid are you? This is so little money for the US government. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:25:19
Shit, in five days you might have missed the peak. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:40:58
This isn't an add. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:10:53
Bitcoin is up from when they bought last year. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:28:39
Because bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:44:19
Exactly. If you researched bitcoin you're an ignorant fool. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:11:30
Lol 
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:20:36
I guess if anyone was to believe this absolute bullshit it would be people who own bitcoin so good target audience.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:40:35
Lol 90% of the people in this sub only care about price. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 08:57:23
Oh I know. I don't push, I just feel like I'd be doing my family a disservice by not getting them involved in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:41:51
You're going to really want to understand how bitcoin 
works if you're going to be opening a store that accepts bitcoin payments. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:47:11
It's always good to get more coin. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:08:20
In my opinion bitcoin has plummeted more than 60% :( but that's if you compare it to two years ago. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:15:08
Yes, death is.  
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:55:37
I wanna chat with you about your high school philosophy class. Big poster in trees, atheism, bitcoin,  and conspiracy.  Haha classic. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:09:57
Gotcha 
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:17:32
Real bitcoiners did wake from their parents basement till 11. Hurry, you only have one more hour to Buy Buy Buy! 
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:16:20
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:54:05
Extremely, really? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:16:00
Good call on the china thing.
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:45:08


@_date: 2015-11-04 23:55:50
I though we were here for the technology.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:25:05
Why would a business break the law just to accept bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:53:53
So I can't pick times to fit my narrative like you pick times to fit yours?
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:39:51
Damn that two cents will go a long way.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:52:37
I'm just waiting for the crash.  
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:06:52
Someone is trying to sell. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 06:22:23
They're in fucking middle school. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 03:15:41


Well there's your problem.
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:34:58
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:06:49
How many bitcoin links equal one Facebook like? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:54:45
How much you buy in for? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:35:14
Who says he still doesn't think that? He essentially just wants free money. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:08:46
Genius idea here. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:57:27
So you're telling kids to gamble now?
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:36:06
How much did you buy at 1200?
@_date: 2015-11-07 00:46:12
And apparently no answers.  
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:35:40
How much did you buy at 1200?
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:48:25
What about 18 hours?
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:10:04
Nothing to worry about, you've only lost about 80% of your investment.  
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:55:47
Why would you sell, we are headed to the moon. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:04:45
That doesn't mean you should cheat and have someone write it for you.
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:49:27
Someone's trying to sell.
