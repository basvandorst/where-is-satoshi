Thanks for the explanation. These types of arguments are specious, the form of payment shouldn't be blamed in an extortion effort.

I think going to mBTC is just delaying the problem. Let's go straight to bits. 1 Bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits. 1 bit = 100 Satoshi. These are numbers that are simple and easy to remember.

A 1MB limit on the blocksize provides more potential for decentralisation as they travel through the network faster. This means that miners who are near each other or can afford greater access to the network are not disproportionately rewarded. It's also more resistant to erosions of Net Neutrality, making it more difficult for regressive nation states to interfere with.
Higher transaction fees and longer waits are mostly due to the blocking of the SegWit proposal which would reduce both these factors while keeping the important property of decentralisation intact.

I see others with this sentiment are being down voted. Instead of that please offer a reason that we should assume, no matter how much one might disagree with BU or certain actors, that the majority of participants in that movement aren't rational actors.

Paranoid rumors. If any major state actor wanted to shut down Bitcoin they could make it happen. Serve notices to the US miners and ask for cooperation from China to shut down those miners in exchange for something else. With a non-retargeting POW difficulty we'd never generate blocks given the current difficulty. You don't even have to take down the 5k-15k nodes.
I agree that from the ashes something stronger would arise, but there'd be ashes if they wished it.

More powerful at the specific task of mining, but not larger. 
Let's make it larger though! Are you running your node?

Would anything persuade you that the community does not want this? Do you see evidence of this in the futures market for example?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:17:02
I would define community as users. You're correct that an unfortunate amount of users don't understand the topic. I would assume incumbency in that case since otherwise potentially breaking changes are made underneath uninformed users. All pool operators should let their miners vote on proposals. Businesses provide services to users so should each be counted but not disproportionately.
Turning the question around do you think it's fair or wise to proceed if the proposal group cannot answer this question either?
(Also is even a Bitcoin sub anymore? Honest question.)

Comparing market cap to supply of something is a facetious and fallacious comparison.

I find it odd that we're in a position where we care what some company thinks. I will be recommending LocalBitcoins and Bisq for all people that approach me in the future. This centralization is ridiculous and unacceptable.

Mr. Voorhees, thank you heartedly for the sincere reply.
I agree with many of your points and am able to sympathize with your perspective. To move the conversation forward I would offer this thought with the aim of illuminating the discord:
The difference in perspective seems to come from disagreement about where costs should be incurred between businesses and end-users. As you know the value to Bitcoin is inherently, almost strictly, within its decentralisation characteristic. That is to say its main value is not within its low-feeness or its ability to compete with existing payment infrastructure.
A community that believes this at the deepest levels of their hearts  cannot fathom tolerating the cost of more centralisation in order to externalise the costs of others' businesses.
The path forward, to me, seems to be a heartfelt and honest pull-back from the fork at this time and to visibly increase support of open source initiatives financially. This would show good faith and help restore goodwill. Such a move may also prove wise in the long term as it relieves these businesses of any evidence of the ability to affect the outcome of Bitcoin which could otherwise become a legal liability.
I am a user and I would like lower fees, certainly, but not through the cost of the talent dedicated to this project and to decentralisation. With increased funding and lack of diversion from forks we could obtain lower fees through advancements such as Schnorr signatures and second layer technologies.
If none of these statements have proven effective on your outlook I nonetheless thank you for considering them. I appreciate also your honesty about how this situation has gone out of hand. I implore you, between fellow Bitcoin lovers connected at a fundamental world outlook, to find a way to mend the rift. After all as fellow Bitcoiners we know that consensus is more than a trivial majority vote, it requires overwhelming support.

A cartel of miners want to take control of the protocol before it's even more popular. They don't understand that Bitcoin's most important value is that it is not controlled by a central authority.

Theory of Bitcoin transaction spam:
People who want bigger blocks will create large transactions, usually paying themselves, which have small fees so that:
A. The mempool (unconfirmed transactions) grows a lot.
B. Fees will be artificially pushed up due to demand for block space.
tl;dr: It's like someone is maliciously making payments in wheel barrels full of pennies. This puts an artificially created burden on the network in order to push a political agenda.

I think this is what's called "constructing a strawman argument." I disagree that your analogy is an accurate representation of my statements.
I suppose, though, that this is is the fundamental crux of the disagreement between the two "sides". I don't follow your analogy, so I will summarize like this:
Bitcoin is less decentralized the less realistic it is for any given user to run a full node. It's not enough to only be open source, you need to be able to run that code to validate the blockchain independently because you cannot otherwise guarantee that nodes you're trusting are actually running the open source code that you believe they are.
Anyway, thanks for the chat. I hope that we can come to a mutually satisfactory compromise in the near future. I do believe our interests are much more aligned than they are different. Peace!

I agree it's unideal but requiring that everyone understand a radically novel P2P networking protocol seems unrealistic. I wish it wasn't. What's worse is that requiring understanding of all means we get bad solutions. I understand both Segwit and EC and I believe EC would irreversibly harm users due to centralization pressures. It's easy to just say "increase the block size, that's easy and I 'understand' that" but the reality is that blockchain P2P protocols take a lot of study and making changes can lead to very unexpected properties, and, ultimately, to something I would no longer call "Bitcoin".

100% of people prefer secure connections on the internet. How many of them do you think understand HTTPS? Understanding something's value does not require understanding how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:26:17
My point is that it's not necessary to understand how something works to understand its value. We can take a more complex subject as an analogy if that helps: how many people understand the value of electricity as a proportion of those that understand the physics of electricity?
In other words it is condescending to belittle people's support of something's value simply because they *might* not understand how it works.
