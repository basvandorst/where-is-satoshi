My advice, by the woman you want to marry a diamond for 12500, and by one bitcoin for yourself.... the rest as they say is history

When a man is cornered he starts thinking and speaking all sorts of craziness, it’s a fight or flight.... is there any fight left in him :)

Very true about down voting to give negative karma, just the r/btc censorship which they claim is non existent. Comment negatively about ver, down voted for sure, but it’s still fun to ruffle the feathers over there :) and not hard to get a reaction!

don’t bitpay do that when you have usd as a % of your settlement ?

get a hardware wallet, Trezor or nano, 100 bucksish. Buy your BTC send to your wallet. I guarantee within a month you will buy more and send it to you wallet. Maybe an ALT coin takes your fancy, if your new hardware wallet supports it then that’s a good short list

5 bucks with PayPal not many people will entertain as PayPal fees are too high and the buyer protection is too one sided for sellers

Rubbish, look to the past to see mistakes if you need to, never repeat the same, the future try and be ready

CoinPayments api is pretty good
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:13:04
the inevitable, shit coins die, if bag holders are lucky they are out to BTC before the bell rings. There is room for other coins/tokens/currencies but the lion share will be BTC, I think 75% upwards is where it might settle
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:55:40
The merchant using CoinPayments can set the amount of confirmations they require to verify the payment, the more verification's the better of course, but depending on the amount 1-2 confirmations can be sufficient and this will result in a faster verified payment
