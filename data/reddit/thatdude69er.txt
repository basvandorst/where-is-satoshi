Hodl marks the belief?? Hodl goes against Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not have any value if its not spent. These so called “hodlers” just want to wait until it grows enough to sell, so they can exchange it for fiat. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:13:19
 Bitcoin Cash in one picture
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:05:09

@_date: 2018-06-06 18:07:17
Are you guys with Bitcoin or do you just want the price to rise so you can cash out for fiat?
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:27:34
Thats exactly what Tim Draper wants you to do.
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:49:24

The world will know that few decentralized bois stood against a dip, that few stood against many, and before this battle was over, even a fud-king can bleed.

Have you even watched the video? That drunk dude was threatening everyone in the subway and was getting very physical and aggressive. He had to be put down, and he was very well breathing when he was on the floor.
