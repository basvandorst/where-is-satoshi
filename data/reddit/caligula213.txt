So I placed an order on coinabul and eventually got my silver but it took almost 4 months.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:58:06
I'm guessing your order won't get bought. I mean I could place an order to sell 1 BTC for 1,000 BTC, doesn't mean someone is going to buy it.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:14:12
Sounds good. PM me the details!

I've been waiting 2 months. Everytime I contact them either through the website of through IRC I get the following.
No we can't give a refund. We will be shipping very soon.
Fucking Bullshit.
I'n the meantime orders from Amalgimetals and Agoracommodities have come through within a week of placing the order.

Did you not think it was going to drop to the same level as other exchanges? Why would people pay more at mtgox when they could buy a coin at another exchange for $70

I used  about a month ago.
It was painless and pretty quick. I am in the U.S. but I did an online bank transfer from an Oz Westpac account. 
I could withdraw my coins after I was verified, which took about 5 minutes using my Oz drivers license and medicare card info.
I would recommend them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:28:23
Just to back you up. I've used bitinstant twice in the last two days. The first time my money was in mt gox within 15 minutes. Today, after the 15 minute drive home from CVS mtgox was down. within 5 minutes of it coming up the money was in my mtgox account.
Personally I thin if you do it properly bitinstant is a great way to fund an account quickly.

@_date: 2013-04-12 22:10:20
You mean make money off the bull traps..... except if I listened to everyone who was posting that in the last day then I would have sold at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.....
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:35:35
I will buy all 100
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:41:40
I made an order with bitinstant 3 hours ago. by the time I got home (15 minutes after leaving cvs) the money was in my mtgox account.
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:21:22
HSBC internet bank transfer to the mtgox account in jp. But I could have done the same thing from my westpac online banking.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:17:54
Is that $1,644.53 worth of bitcoins or 1,644.53 bitcoins? There is a big difference.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:53:46
So.... could you buy at $50 from Bitstamp.. Send to BTCe and then sell for $118?
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:54:15
I'll buy them from you @ $65 a coin.

Go to amagimetals or agoracommodities.
Amagi will give you the price in Bitcoin and agora will give you the total in bitcoin when you check out. 
Place the order, send the bitcoins to the wallet address they give you, and sit back and wait for the silver to arrive in the mail.

Ah ok. Sorry I can't help
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:11:35
Do you need the cash immediately? If not I recommend buying Silver with bitcoins.

Edit: Oh Yeah, Looks dodgy as all hell. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:34:53
I think I bought your coins. Haha, Just kidding. I sold at $980 and bought back in at $580.
Today was great!

hmmmm... Well that would be good for you. I have contacted them several times via email and also have talked to Jay on IRC multiple times. He always says that it will hopefully ship by the end of the week. It never does. 
I certainly hope you get a shipping number. Please let me know if you do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:45:30
So I have a feeling that most people desperate to sell have moved their coins out of mtgox and sold them on other exchanges. I'm not sure it is going to drop much below $80

@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:36
cash only. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:33:29
I wanted to buy when they were $1 but I was too worried. Then when they hit $4 I thought they had peaked and didn't buy. Later on they hit $13 and I thought, well I should have bought them but it's too late now. Once they hit $30 I was cursing myself for being a fool. I should have just bought them. Finally I bought $1000 dollars worth when they were $88. Let's see what happens, At least I won't be angry with myself for not buying.
