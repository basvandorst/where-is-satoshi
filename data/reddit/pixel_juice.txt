I agree with you. In fact I've viewed crypto currency investing as basically forex investing from the start. More so as adoption increases. Though the finite limit of bitcoin in specific may increase its value over time, so it may be more akin to precious metals.

Pawnshops and check cashing places might want to  start dabbling in bitcoin purchase/sales. Basically any place where cash or assets changes hands is a great place to sell bitcoin. But hey, I'm no rocket-surgeon.
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:49:01
I hope this is just the legal system testing the boundaries of crypto-currency and not some part of an agenda to prosecute bitcoin users. From the comments I'm reading here and the article, it sounds like it's plain old "failed to follow the established laws" and not really crypto based at all, but man I don't want to see crypto quashed before it even has a chance at mainstream acceptance.
The sad part is that if the US does pursue prosecution of bitcoin exchanges and their users, it's really just going to set the US back. The rest of the world will continue adoption and we lose a lot of steam. I feel crypto-currency is as inevitable as digital music and movie distribution. We can be at the forefront or we can dilly dally around for a few years until we are forced to evolve.

@_date: 2014-01-20 00:40:04
Paypal really hates crypto, too. I get why, but man they should learn from all the tech changes in the various other industries and get down with it instead to try and fight the inevitable. Or I should say I began to see it as inevitable once I started using it. Crypto is like the MP3 of finance, get on the train or get squashed.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:35:17
Yeah, I'd like to see the total expenses on the side of crypto too. Including the cost to the economy (in lost jobs and tax). It's a difficult and uncomfortable question, both to ask and to answer.

Thanks for this. When I started seeing examiner.com links on my FB feed I assumed it was just the web arm of the SF examiner. After digging through the site a bit it looked more like a more aggressively disingenuous  Buzzfeed so I hid them. Glad to see I was on to something.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:22:03
I totally agree. Since we can't depend on these startups to deliver what they promise, our only recourse as customers is to be conservative in our risks and vocal with our bad experiences. I hope if we all take that approach, maybe vendors may be more concerned about their businesses and follow-through.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:49:24
Yeah, see what I mean? And those expenditures or energy and resources were just off the top of my head.  I'm sure there are hundreds or thousands of moving parts in the life cycle and use of hard currency that are all using resources. I never really thought about it until people started saying "computer money?!? What a waste of electricity!" I'd love to see an in depth investigation in to it.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:26:45
I thought that clause applied to printing US dollars? As in only the gov can print them, as opposed to states or corporations.
Other wise coupons, disney dollars, gift certificates, any number of other forms of currency would be illegal.

BTW, why didn't they just send a tech to the site to complete the set up? Surely that would have a) restored confidence in the product, b) cut down the back and forth time significantly, and c) cost less money in the long run. If it is that big of a burden to fly a tech in to service a $20,000 machine, then maybe they need to rethink their business.

I think this pattern is rampant these days. I can't say how I'd handle it if something I started resulted in WILD SUCCESS, but I'd like to think I'd have the sense to seek council from more established entrepreneur's if I got overwhelmed. I do know transparency and communication go a long way. If one can't at least do those, then they are most likely doomed.

When I hear people complain about the waste of energy in producing bitcoin, I often wonder about the waste of energy surrounding paper currency. The resources used to produce the paper, the energy used to print it, the gas used to transport it, the effort to destroy (recycle?) it when it reaches its end of life, the time and man power used to guard it... etc. Has anyone done a breakdown on this? Any numbers on which is actually more resource intensive? My knee jerk opinion (based on nothing but these thoughts) would say bitcoin is "greener" than cash.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:52:22
Yeah, that would be my assumption too. "Breaking Bad" is a recent example, but there is that great scene in "Blow" where the coke dealers have so much cash in their house that it makes it difficult to walk around in. Also the Joker's cash pile in "Dark Knight Rises".
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:16:23
I realize there have been badly run businesses since the dawn of trade, but I can't help but feel our current crop of young entrepreneurs are more slipshod than ever. They are good at building expectations and marketing, terrible at delivery and customer service. They shirk their responsibilities, forcing customers to resort to legal action. The cut too many corners. They don't plan well. At least that is the way it appears to me.

I said this same thing in reference to PayPal/ebay fighting crypto sales. They are fighting an un-winable war. They should learn from the errors of the recording industry and get out in front of crypto instead of fighting the rising tide.

This should be part of the question too, IMO. Because there will be consequences to adopting all crypto, just as other technologies will kill industries (like driverless cars will strike a blow to taxis and trucking). But I think there is a quantifiable answer if the question honestly includes all the gains and all the costs of both fiat and crypto. I'd love to see this researched.

You are correct, in my experience TOR slows down my traffic significantly. Also, from what I've read, it increases the chances of my traffic exiting a node that is monitored by a government entity.

I think evil is relative. If your job is to keep a monitory system propped up, despite market pressures, then I can see how a decentralized crypto currency could be evil. If your goal is to make a currency that works globally and without anyone dictating it's value or use via political agenda, then you probably see it as a miracle.
