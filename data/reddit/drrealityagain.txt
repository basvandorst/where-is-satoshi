Very bad attitude.   Mend your ways.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:17:14


Why do people write nonsense like that?  Most people don't hate bitcoin; they simply can't be bothered with something so flakey.   And it is naive, if not plain silly, to believe  that bitcoiners are the only people of understanding it.     
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:57:39
Are eggs used for the same sort of scams and criminal activities as bitcoin? Or was the Bitcoin ATM you went to an egg dispenser?
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:31:36
Wrong.   Use your head.  As soon as no one has any use for BTC, even for its current uses of greedy speculation and criminal activities, its value will drop to $0, and nobody will be interested in mining it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:20:27
It's paranoid to insist that he "dumped lots in the last few" days and he was "one was selling loads of btc yesterday when it crashed".   Could have been anyone doing the selling and he dumping.   
But even if it was the trustee, so what?
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:47:43
Between every rise and fall, there is money to be made.   Just get smart.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:12:36
Not all of us agree that the decisions he made are dumb.   We think he is doing an excellent job in getting back money to those who lost it ad thought they might never see it again.   
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:13:47


They are?   For what?
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:38:36
Maybe they fear the wrath of the bitcoiners?   Lol!

I don't think that's what's being regulated in requiring IDs at a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:47:51
If you had bitcoins in Mt. Gox, then take the matter up directly with the trustee, as is your legal right.   Otherwise, mind your own bitcoins and leave the trustee to get on with his work, which he is doing according to the law and doing very well indeed.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:37:24


So, what are people like you even doing here then?   Why not just go away and come back in whatever number of years?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:22:12
Of course, they would deny it.   Now wait for the changing "explanations" of what happened.     Already CZ is calling it a "phishing scam".
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:50:00
(1) Their main obligation is to get as much money as they can.   
(2) Market impact should be a secondary concern, only the extent that it interferes with (1).
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:17:38
Could be.   But I doubt that the Mt. Gox trustee is sitting at his computer doing 20 BTC at a time.    He will most likely do largish numbers.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:33:10

To save you a lot of trouble: the encrypted string will not do you any good.    Just about any halfway-decent modern encryption method will be sufficiently strong to resist reversion.    So, short story is your 4 BTC are probably gone.    
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:31:29
One more time: nobody said it was a central bank.  The point is that just as central banks do influence the value of our fiat money, so, even if in a different way, these centralized exchanges influence the value of our supposedly decentralized money.   Now, read that carefully, and make sure you understand it before you type again.

Under Japanese law, once those who have been owed (creditors) are paid, the rest goes to the owners/shareholders of the company. The company that owns Mt. Gox is approximately 90% owned by Kerpeles, with one other shareholder I believe.

I am.   And dumping at 10.5K tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:05:55
Of course, it is.    Smart thing now is to buy and sell every few days.    But in the 9K-10K range, sell in the 11K-12K range.    Casinos rely on blockheads to believe that all they have to do is hang in, through the ups and down, and they will strike it rich.
Bitcoin etc are a zero-sum gain, and there are not enough new suckers coming in to be fleeced.   The mansions and lambos of 2017 are all gone.
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:34:07
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:19:29
Perhaps.  But the main problem here is, as indicated in the thread header, that of the OP needing an ID to use a Bitcoin ATM.   The number and nature of my problems are of little help there, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:15:23
I'm about to do my daily buys.   Look for a pump to 9K+ in an hour or so.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:59:23


Use it for what?   It  is useless as a currency or something to use for goods and services, and its value for speculative greed is also rapidly diminishing.   
Everyone is into bitcoin to make money and that requires that FOMO bring in new suckers to be fleeced.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:14:48
Looks spot on!
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:47:36
Sorry, all these scam-coins are ultimately going nowhere.   Once there are no more new suckers for the greedy to profit from and governments clamp down on the scams and other criminality, it's game over.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:06:49
Yes, the technology (blockchain) will remain and be used elsewhere.   But how will that help people who have invested in bitcoins when the value of a BTC goes down to $2?
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:23:24
Keep dreaming?   Did I say anything would happen in a day?   I just called out your "knowledgeable" crap about too strong a support at 5.5K.

@_date: 2018-03-11 14:07:13
Yeah, that will really hurt them.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:30:44


Yes, but to what end exactly?
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:18:31
yep.   now he has joined the community and can hodl 0.000000001 BTC. lambo!
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:07:50
Why 8.? Why not 8.5 or 8.8 or 8.9 or 8.4?
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:48:27
The movie has not ended yet.   There is still a surprising number of blockheads left to be fleeced.   You can daily see some in the promotion  "average cost game"***, which goes something like this: *if you bought 1 BTC at 16K, you can't afford to sell now; but if you buy another 1 BTC at 10K, then your average cost is 13K; and you can keep buying lower to reduce your average cost*.   The person is then supposedly better of with a decreasing lower average cost, even though that does nothing to reduce the money they have put in and must then recoup somehow!.   So, instead of bailing out, the suckers keep getting in deeper!
***Just last week there was even a thread arguing that lower prices are a great opportunity for those who bought at 17K!   
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:15:19
A money-making idiot?   I'm OK with that.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:16:24
Do you even know who the arbitrators are?   For all we know, they could all be one person.  And that one person could even be a party to numerous transactions.   So all he would have to do is wait until there was a good enough pile of deposits and then take off.   Use your head instead of just believing that decentralized is good.   At least with a centralized exchange there is something to go after.
By the way do you not find it ironic that people are worked up over the decentralized nature of bitcoin but then there are centralized exchanges?   Lol.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:21:01

@_date: 2018-03-09 20:16:48
You can make it end right now if you wish.   Just sell your BTC and never look back.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:36:32
nice day?   really? how so?
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:44:05
Me too.   I have no issues with my bank.   When I use my credit cards, I have buyer protection (refunds in the case of fraud, non-delievery, etc.) that I don't have with bitcoin.   The banks also loans me money for a house and a car.    As for my daily needs, I suppose that if I looked really, really hard I could find some place that takes bitcoin for them.  But generally where I live (and it's a big city), food, clothes, gas, utilities ... all have to be paid for in real money (cash, credit cards, debit cards, etc.).    
Everyone I know seems to be in a similar situation, and I am hard-pressed to imagine why any of us would change to bitcoin for anything.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:24:26
It is certainly possible to buy things with it, if one tries really hard.   However, working as a currency means something more that a few people, after much effort and searching, using it for something.    The  truth is that even most believers in any value of BTC are simply hodling it while waiting for new suckers to come in so that they can make some profit selling.
As a store of value, it is especially useless.   How can something be a store of value when the value swings wildly and can droby by as much as 25% in a single day?
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:06:22
Some of us sold, took our profits, and are waiting to buy again at the next low.   Then we repeat.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:32:56
So what?  The crypto world is foolish of foolish, greedy people.   People who will not pay attention to common sense even if you hit them over the head with it.  Why not empty their pockets?

In that case he should quietly suck it up.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:17:45
yes. we can and should go further and impose more, but reasonable, severe restrictions and regulations.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:01:03
And I'm getting a feel that you don't understand how the way exchanges work  can influence the price of BTC.   Wait until a couple of the big ones collapse and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:59:16
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:35:16
The idea that Asia is full of mugs waiting to be taken is wrong.   So don't jerk off just yet.
The best that will happen is that buying all over the world will bring things to 10.5K tomorrow; that's the pump.    Then day traders like us who are now starting to buy will again sell, and it will be back to sub-10K; that's the dump.  
Then we repeat again, always in the range 9K-12K (mostly 9.5K-10.5K).    
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:58:12
And where do you go after the people who started and are running the "decentralized exchanges" take off with your money (e.g. security deposits) ?   Please don't tell me about arbitrators and 2-of-3 multisig what-not before you properly use your head.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:40:40

How much has he dumped *this time*?
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:50:31
If you did, then you have your answer.  Good.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:01:50
sorry people, we'll soon be doing our regular dump.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:51:16
OK.  Brand recognition has something going for it, but in this case it will be limited to cryptocurrencies.   It will have no relevance to other "outside" uses of blockchain, and that is already evident out there.  
Further, first-mover advantage only goes so far.   At some point, if others are able to do it better, cheaper, faster, etc., then it doesn't matter.   In fact, China has made a whole economy from just two of the three!
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:38:49
This is excellent advice.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:42:37
Regardless, the authorities in Georgia seem to be do an excellent job,and one hope that more will follow and all will take it to the next level.   What this wasteland of cryptocurrencies needs urgently are severe restrictions and regulations.

Totally acceptable in the unregulated wasteland of cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2018-03-11 22:14:54

@_date: 2018-03-11 14:14:49
You seriously believe that?
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:32:27
That's why people who want protections rely on cards.   If you want to say that bitcoin is like cash, then you have even more arguments in your arguments about what bitcoin will ultimately be good for.    
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:56:31
If all those people are so wrong, then why not just ignore them and go on with your business.   Are you angry because at the end of the day you know there is some truth in the so-called FUD and you are scared shitless of losing your money?


I'm here for the price increase, and I will not leave.   So there!


That is a silly argument.   The fact that you can find some article that was wrong on some technology does not  mean that every article predicting that something else will fail is wrong.

@_date: 2018-03-09 13:37:28
Sorry about your loss.  However anything to do with cryptocurrencies is well known to be very risky, and one is well advised to stay out unless prepared to lose everything.   I would encourage you to get out and put your money in a bank, regulated by government and with proper protections in place, as per the law.
FBI, SEC, French Authorities, etc. will do absolutely nothing.   While the loss is probably big for you, it is not worth their time and would be only if thousands of people were involved with similar amounts, i.e. total of millions, in a single scam. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:37:11
It will go down tomorrow, so you might as well wait.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:36:19
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:51:56
Wrong.   First, you assume that people will always want it.   When the whole pyramid collapses, nobody will want it, so the value of a BTC will simply go down to close to $0.   Nobody will want to put effort, time, and money into mining something that nobody wants and is willing to pay for.
Second, the difficulty does not always go up.  The general trend is that overall it has been going up, but the system is built to make it adjustable.   In fact, if you look closely at the graph, even in just the last could of years, you can see it go up and down although mostly up.    
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:58:39
It's his job to support his wild stories.   Yours too, Mr. Google.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:05:43
I wasn't asking about anything.   I was asking about BTC tech, which you seem to believe is worth something.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:12:38
Yes, they can.   But they will never do so if you have not been engaged in mischief, in which case they are quite right to do so.  Contrary to what most bitcoin zealots might wish to believe, people will sometimes have occasional issues with banks, most people have no real problems with their banks, certainly not to the extent that they will switch to bitcoin or some other fuzzy internet concept.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:47:07
Crap.   Whatever ideas Satoshi had, and they were mostly naive (except for the technical part), bitcoin has evolved into a token for greedy speculation, gambling, scams, and assorted criminality.     The only honest people around are the misguided hodlers and the smart day traders (like me).   Otherwise, it's a dangerous wasteland that most would be well advised to stay away from.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:17:50
Yes, just like the lottery.
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:19:14
See my analysis from last week.  The high for this year is $12K, and it will happen in March.   This March.

Succeeds at what?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:41:14
His business was to sell enough to get enough money to reimburse clients.   He has succeeded in that.   Selling at higher prices would not make any difference since the clients' losses are a set figure, and that figure has been reached.     Also, the general state of the market was not and should never be his concern as long as he achieves the target, which he has.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:40:18
Do you really believe all that nonsense you just spouted?
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:34:42
You can argue that, but at this stage it is not necessary, because that is not what I am talking about.   By protection, don't mean just the technical stuff.  I mean the ability to get refunds in the case of fraud, non-delivery, etc.  I have that with my credit cards and have used them.   So have many others.   And with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:18:58
I already have a very good life, but thanks anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:34:44
Times are tough.   It is necessary to find something solid to latch onto, regardless of what it as to do with reality.   If the one here works for you, go with it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:51:46


In that regard, most people have few problems with the current systems.     


Actually most people are content with just credit cards and debit cards and so on, and "understanding the concept" won't change that.   While bitcoiners continue to talk in abstractions, most people  live in a real world where credit cards offer insurance on purchases, people don't lose their money of if they forget the password to their bank account, and so on.    
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:57:27
cost averaging works only to the extent that it goes up high enough for cost recovery.   that is still possible now, but there is no guarantee that it is indefinite.    
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:54:46
Perhaps.   In the meantime, it's going to the dogs and the natives are going crazy.    Take a look at the "daily discussion" and all the threads to do with btc price.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:39:26
That is enough to learn an important lesson: don't be foolish with money.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:13:02
Bitcoin is about freedom.   So people should be free to buy and sell as many BTC as they like, whenever they like.   Bitcoin is also about control.  So if you feel that another person's actions are affecting you, then just get out.   
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:56:01
If that is logical for you, then why not. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:51:32
Please pay careful attention.  The point is not that they issue bitcoins, and even *you* can see that they don't.   It is that what happens at *exchanges* influences the value of bitcoins.   I imagine that for an owner, what matters is that the value is going down; whether it is by issuing or by indirect action makes no difference.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:12:41
Great.   Hodl and start checking out lambos.

Exactly.   Thank you for that succint summary.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:25:29
No problem.   Bitcoin is about telling banks to fuck off.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:52:12
I don't get excited.    My business requires constant calm.   We pump.    Dump at a profit.   And the pick up again.   No change of view; that's where the money is to be made.   
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:46:06
You people need to wake up to the truth in what you call "FUD".   Simply getting so angry serves no purpose at all.    If such people are so hopelessly wrong, then why not just ignore them.  Because the real truth is hard to ignore?

Pay attention to that bit, and then learn a few things about modern encryption; don't rely on "Basic Computer Security for Dummies".    E.g. with a good method, even a single-character difference in passwords will give a huge difference in the result of encryption.

People are all about "government out!" until they feel the pain.  The SEC has been getting plenty of complaints from those who have been scammed.   Amusingly, right now there is a leading thread here about a guy who unfortunately has just been scammed out of $70K: complaints have gone out to the FBI, SEC, French Police, French internet regulators, etc!

The result of the encryption (i.e. the encrypted string you have) is nothing like that.    The difference is the whole point of the encryption.    Also, if the wallet is corrupted, then what are you trying to get into?

TA in a nutshell:
- If it is going up,  then it could well keep going up until it stops.   (That's called upside trend to a resistance level... or something.)
- If it is going down, then it could well keep going down until stops.  (That's called a downside trend, unless it's to a previous leve in which case it's retracement, to a support level ... or something.)
- If it was going down (up) and is now going up (down), then it's changed direction.   That's called a reversal!
- And if you look at the charts from a distance, you can see all sorts of things: a head and shoulders, sometimes inverted, a wave, an Italian guy called Giuseppe, etc.   Like those people who sometimes look at a sliced potato and see the face of Elvis or some saint.

If people claim that bitcoin will replace regular plastic, then that is what it is to be compared with.    If people insist that bitcoin will be used to pay for regular good and services in the same ways as cash, credit cards, and debit cards, then those are what it should be compared with.

Fair enough.   What I'm saying is that these things are important to regular people, in their every-day transactions, and it makes no sense for bitcoiners to keep proclaiming that bitcoin is going to do all this, replace all that, and so on, until someone starts to actually think of appropriate mechanisms.    The other thing is that some of these problems are probably intractable unless bicoiners wish to give up some of the things they claim makes bitcoin so dear to them.

Try to use your head.   Knowing some of the characters used is helpful if you are trying to guess the password.  The guy wants to start with the encrypted result and get to the password, that's quite different.   I don't have the time to explain, so it is left as your homework.

And how is bitcoin going to help them?   Take a look at the world map of bitcoin activity.   See where it is?  Mostly in places where people already have credit cards and banking services.   You know why?  Because those are the places where people have the means and disposable income for waste on dubious greedy speculations.   The idea that bitcoin will do any good for the the world's unbanked is a genuinely and uniquely  American stupidity, because Americans actually know very little of the rest of the world.

What does that have to do with "groups might be secretly developing their knowledge in Bitcoin"?   Developing a knowledge in something has nothing to do with adoption.   Right now law enforcement agencies all over the world are developing their knowledge because of the criminality associated with bitcoin, not because they have an interest in adopting it.   As to why that should be done secretly, only you know; but hardly anyone is even trying to keep it a secret.

Again, take a look at where bitcoin and other scam-coin activity is located.    Even with your Kenyan example, and Kenya is one of the more "advanced" in the lower economies, what I am trying to tell you is that most of Kenyans and their MPESA are in no position to gamble their little money on bitcoin etc.  Is someone going to hand them bitcoins for free?

@_date: 2018-03-11 19:32:43
Bitcoin will surely but definitely die its own death.   What governments are trying to do is what is their job: ensure that people are not scammed, deal with criminal activities, etc.   Banks for their part quite right want to make sure that they are not laden with debt from clueless "investors" in bitcoin.    And the economists are quite right to warn the naive who, on the basis of some slight reading of the fantastic promises of bitcoin, now fancy themselves as expert economics.
Bitcoiners should stop being paranoid, as reflected in the title of this thread, and also stop being naive and foolish, as in statements about how bitcoin will do this and that to governments and central banks, save the world, etc.

People thinks all sorts of weird things.   Try to point them to reality, and you will be told that "you just don't understand it", "you feel threatened", "you have been paid to spread FUD", etc.   Just this week one redditor stated that although he has never studied anything of economics, he was sure he understood it better than a former chief economist of the IMF.   His "heroic"  statement got positive, "cheering" responses.

Unfortunately just because credit cards succeeded does not mean that bitcoin will succeed.  Nor does the fact that it is a new concept.     There is very little to suggest that bitcoin will ever be useful for anything beyond greedy speculation, scam, and assorted criminality.   I know it pains people like you to hear that, because you wish to have more people engage in another FOMO rush so that you can profit, but I'm afraid reality is reality.   
As to how long I have been on reddit, time on reddit has nothing to do with intelligence, knowledge, and ability to reason.   And a simple  proof of that is that we have plenty of morons (such as yourself) who have been here much longer but keep spouting nonsense 24/7.

For a whole variety of reasons that I don't have the time to go into, that will never happen.    Anyone who puts money into BTC is a fool and fully deserves to lose that money.


If the the technology, you mean blockchain, then, yes.   That is possibly quite useful.  But the adoption of blockchain does not require bitcoin of any of the funny monies floating around.    Anybody who is investing in BTC on the basis of the promise of the underlying technology is likewise a fool who should be parted with his money.   However, in this case perhaps less of a fool, because it takes some reflection to realize that a blockchain is just a data structure that could be put to all sorts of uses.

Feel free to believe whatever you wish.  The fact is that the trustee's duty was to obtain enough money to reimburse the clients, and he has successfully done that.   No amount of whining about what he might have done and how will make the slightest difference, and nor should it.

@_date: 2018-03-11 13:34:13
Many people who have invested in bitcoin are worried that they will lose their money or at least not get the riches they dream of.    So, whenever they read anything that they interpret as negative about bitcoin, they really get worked up, because they know there is some truth there, and their fears are really stoked.
In the long run, it is actually better to deal with the reality that this thing will eventually collapse and to try and make money while it is still possible (e.g. by trading on a regular basis).

I buy dips and sell later on a limited basis.    E.g., I've already made my purchases for today and will sale during the weekend (hopefully) at a profit.   In the last few weeks, I have done well buying below 9.5 and selling above 10.5, and repeating it.
As for "chances of future adoption and long term success", I have no interest in those misguided fantasies.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:17:46
It depends on what you mean by better.    His job is to get enough money to pay back those who are owed the money.   He has done that.   Can't get do any better than doing exactly what one is supposed to do.

A key point about bitcoin is the decentralization, which supposedly lets people control their own money and its value.   So it makes no sense  to be pissed off at somebody who's just minding his own business and doing his job.   More importantly, it does not make the slightest difference.   
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:14:03


The trustee's concerns are limited, and must be limited, to those who lost money in Mt. Gox and are properly included in the related legal proceedings.     All other random punters are not his problem, nor should they be.

And as far as I can tell, he is holding way more than he has sold.

Now you have completely lost it.   Secret knowledge in bitcoin?   Ease off the weed, buddy!
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:29:01
No, his legal obligation is to get enough money to pay those who are owed, and he has done that.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:30:51


He doesn't need to unload all of them.   He just needs to unload enough to get the money owed to former clients of Mt. Gox.   He has managed to do that; that is the most important thing.    As to his timing, I am not in a position to comment, as I do not know the legal timetable.    You say that: 


No matter.  The simple reality is that it is up to the trustee and the supervising court in the legal system of the country in question (Japan).   Working yourself up over it is therefore an exercise in extreme futility.
If you feel aggrieved by his actions and you are one of those properly included in the legal process (as a former client of Mt.Gox), then I would encourage you to communicate directly with him and the supervising court.   Otherwise, I see nothing that should concern you.    
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:07:15
So it would seem.   But the first response the bitcoin zealots will give you when you ask them to consider reality is "you just don't understand it [the technology or whatever]!".
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:22:24
Possible.  I'll leave it to them to decide what they consider best, auction or whatever.   I'm sure that they have their own objectives, which do not generally include the overall state of the "market".   So far they seem to have done reasonably well.

Mt Gox did not cause the 2018 crash.   What happened is that there was a drying up of the pool of suckers who rushed in at the end of 2017.   That is too bad for those who had planned to be millionaires by then, but there it is.

@_date: 2018-03-08 15:03:36
No, no, no.   Wrong.   He is the one holding the 200K BTC or whaver.   The lump sum was fairly determined based on the figures at the time of loss, and the amount required to reimburse the clients has been obtained.    As to the other "so many people", that is not his problem, nor should it be.  Those people exercise BTC's "decentralized, be your own bank, control your own money, .... " instead of expecting others to take care of them.

@_date: 2018-03-08 12:09:44
People, the job of the trustee is to sell enough BTC, at whatever price, to pay those who are owed.   He seems to have succeeded in in doing that.   So to call him a moron or clueless totally misses the point.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:29:45
If you are one of those who are affected, because you had your BTC in Mt. Gox, then take it up with the trustee, as is your legal right.   Otherwise, mind your own BTC.

Who makes the decisions on refunds, on what basis, and from where?    The fraud-protection remedies that banks offer are essentially covered by their insurance  or included in their contingency funds.  With a decentralized system like Bitcoin, where would you even take the case for a refund?   What evidence would you offer and to whom?  And where would the money for a refund come from?
By the way, banks have  legal obligation to shut accounts or freeze funds where there is reason to believe that criminal activities are involved.    Innocent people have nothing to fear in that regard.  Others are free to go to court.

This is supposedly in Atlanta.  In that case, if you use your credit card or debit card to get USD from an ATM, then it is possible to trace it back to you.   For that reason you don't need an ID.  You already provided the ID when you opened your bank account and go the cards.  They know who you are.
The term "black market" suggests questionable activities, so it is hardly surprising that there should be no IDs involved.   However, I don't see you point about Lego.  Are major criminals (drug dealers, money launderers, etc.) using Lego much?

And here comes the guy who's lived on water, rice, and bitcoin for 100 years!

Seriously?   You think this one will work?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:51:05
You are free to assign all sorts of responsibilities to and to insist on what he may or may not handle.   What matters are his actual responsibilities and that he follows court orders.   If you had coins in Mt. Gox and are included in the current legal proceedings, then take up your issues with the trustee and the court responsible.   If you are just a random punter who feels affected, then the advice is that you mind your own btc.

What is the tech worth?   
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:13:51
Wrong, nothing here is my problem.   The person with the problem is the OP.
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:53:27
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:10:33
Who's that?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:18:24
The question was obviously made in the context of BTC.     BTC is certainly useful as a token for speculation and as an aid for criminality.   Did you have anything else in mind?
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:39:33
In how many places can they pay with bitcoin?  I can't find even one on coinmap.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:48:04


You and other bitcoin zealots are certainly proof of that!
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:12:17
The trustee's job is to get as much as he can out of those coins.   That means the best time to sell is on the highs.   
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:02:48
That is quite different from what I was responding to.   But Yes, there is some uncertainty.  And so?   
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:54:00
Sounds like a waste of time.  What does he do when he finds his money has gone to some identity in Ukraine?  Only thing he will get is seeing his money get spread around.   
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:36:11
Most people there don't care to waste money on gambling.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:50:12
sorry, i have to make some money.   just hodl and you will be ok because this thing is going to the moon.  $1million in 2030!
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:49:01
His job was to get enough money to pay those who are owed.   He has done that.    What else he might have done, and in what manner, is completely irrelevant to his legal obligations.

The regulations in Georgia are very reasonable.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:33:59


Excellent advice for the OP.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:31:16
Some people will come in and say "let's get some while it's low".    That will make it rise for a bit until tomorrow.   Then some people like  will come in and say "let's sell on this small high, make some money, and restock on the next low".   That will make it go down.  REPEAT.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:36:58
now it's only $200 and it feels like it's 8,000
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:18:09
I can't think any reason, other that simple-minded foolishness.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:14:45
The only shit you should be concerned with is the misleading bullshit in TA.   Report that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:44:20
Your statement is the sign of bull.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:20:57
So far it is not being used for anything other than greedy speculation and criminal activities.   What makes you think that will change?


What expectations were those?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:39:12
Yep, that's it.  People never fail to find one reason or another!  LOL!
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:05:13
Yes.  But people did not to around getting all worked up about how gay marriage was legal here and there before it became legal anywhere.   The problem we have here is excessive excitement on the basis of no more than misguided headlines.
