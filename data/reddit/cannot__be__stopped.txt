Why the fucking fuck is Bitcoin still dropping? I mortgaged my house to buy at $19k. You guys guaranteed me this thing would keep going up.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:42:55
If that dumb old fuck put his money into Bitcoin when it first started he'd be a quadrillionaire today.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:03:27
If you think Bitcoin can't literally grow exponentially forever then just sell your coins and piss off. We don't need doubters like you in the movement. I'll be laughing when Bitcoin is worth $1 million and then $100 million and eventually $1 billion per Bitcoin. By that time Bitcoin will just be getting started.

OP is knowingly spreading FUD. Trying to make the bank seem like the good guys so people abandon Bitcoin. Fuck OP the loser.

WTF just read that South Korean police are going door-to-door and confiscating Bitcoin from civilians. How can they keep getting away with this?!

You have to risk money to make money. Fortune definitely favours the brave. And yes I am someone who took out another mortgage on my house as well as maxing out several credit cards. Also taking out credit cards in my wife and children's names.  
  
If it doesn't work out just declare bankruptcy and move on. But if it works you are looking at a whole new world of possibilities. In crypto it is impossible to lose money unless you're actively trying to lose.

All praise Emperor Trump.  
  
Funny, when Obama was President Bitcoin languished in the shitter. But with Trump we have entered a new golden age of crypto.

If you own even a single dollar of fiat you are literally an idiot. Every single cent I make goes straight into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:37:43
What the fucking fuck is happening to Bitcoin?!  
  
Mortgaged my house to buy Bitcoin at $19k. YOU GUYS TOLD ME IT WAS GUARANTEED TO GO TO $100k BY NEW YEARS DAY!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:59:18
Yeah we'd hate for someone to talk up Bitcoin on this subreddit.

Webmaster of coinmarketcap.com here. Thanks for this I'll get it updated soon.

I saw Jeff Garzik at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  
  
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  
  
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  
  
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Now he looks like the retard. Slaving away at his 8-5 job while his boss fucks his private yacht and buys hot bitches.  
  
Cryptocurrency is the future. True freedom.

22% in three days? Most people wouldn't even blink. That kind of swing can happen in 3 minutes.

She looks like the kind of girl you can get when you bought Bitcoin at 3-digits.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:22:24
It's surging big time. Expect it to double every week for the next month easily. This is not an opinion - this is a 100% guaranteed fact.
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:22:34
Okay but it's easier to win a series of 95% bets in a row than a single 20% bet. You probably have a 90% chance of winning 10 of those bets in a row compared to a less than 1 in 10 chance of winning the single 20% bet.

Fun fact: in 1995 you could buy 150,000 Bitcoins for under 1 cent.

If you have bitcoins you won't actually need government.

Fuck Google.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:49:23
Relax folks the crash is over. I just can't see Bitcoin going much lower - the support is just too strong. So many have tried to sell but we're never going to see sub-8k Bitcoin ever again. The recovery will be short and sweet.

Rumour has it the Australian Government will be purchasing $50 million worth of Bitcoin this weekend.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:21:59
This will cause nobody to buy anything. Why would you buy a Starbucks coffee when you can buy Starbucks the following year? This will hopefully cause the downfall of all the world's billionaires and trillionaires and usher in a new golden era of world peace and prosperity.

Why the fucking fuck is Bitcoin crashing? You guys promised me this thing would exponentially gain value forever. YOU LITERALLY SAID IT WOULD BE WORTH $1 MILLION DOLLARS EACH THIS YEAR.

Yes. Number of corrupt governments Bitcoin has toppled. The number of banks that Bitcoin has made obsolete. The more that the myth of fiat has been exposed.  
  
It's a revolution. I hope you're along for the ride.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:04:01
This is the end. Nobody is going to buy back in when it drops this much. Expect Bitcoin to drop to $500 or less. It's going to be at least another 3 years before it's near $20,000 again.

You can get apps where every time you buy something it'll round up and buy a small amount of Bitcoin. Over a lifetime this can add up to millions of gains.

Guaranteed $10k by November.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:55:10
I think we can safely assume this growth will continue for all eternity. I've just taken out another mortgage on my house and bought as many bitcoins as I could.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:40:11
lol the bank thinks they own your money. This is why Bitcoin was invented.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:14:02
I could get in deep shit if this came out and they realized it was me who leaked it but fuck it. Very soon various 401(k) plan providers will dictate that a portion of the investment should be in cryptocurrency. This is a multi-trillion dollar industry and it will cause crypto to go insane. Keep this under wraps though.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:26:48
This is too small time. I suggest buying an entire NFL team and renaming them to the Bitcoiners. All players will be paid with Bitcoin and you need to pay in Bitcoin to get a ticket to a home game.  
  
Before every game instead of playing some boring national anthem instead get various cryptocurrency programmers to extol the virtues of Bitcoin.  
  
During the game each team can score points for a touch down but also each team can have a group of miners. Every Bitcoin mined by that group gets added to the team total.

Some people are spreading rumours that the Bitcoin Gold blockchain is poisoned. This means that anyone will be able to steal your Bitcoin once the fork occurs so you should sell it off now. I think this is unlikely so you should probably ignore these rumours.

Daily reminder that Australia literally went to war against a bunch of emus and lost. Fun fact - the Prime Minster said that the laws of mathematics don't apply in Australia so they could easily crack any private key. Dumbest fucks on the planet.
