The same coins are bought and sold multiple times per day.

In the regular litecoind/litecoin-qt, you can use the command dumpprivkey. However, you would still need to import the private key for the address you're intrested in for it to work.

You should specify that it's for python 3, as it crashed on 2.7 for me. Also, please add the ability to write the symbol in lowercase. And I know I'm being nitpicky now, but I personally prefer formatting with a space instead of a comma. Great program anyways!

You cannot exchange crypto to fiat on bittrex, you have to send it to another exchange where it is possible. Coinbase is the most famous, but there are others as well.

I'm 18, and I've decided to put in $1000 about two months ago after watching the market since 2013. At the time, this was pretty much all my saved up money. Now that has turned into more than $10000. I could probably continue to put in another $100 every month, put that feels pretty pointless imo. I will start college after the summer, and when I finally graduate in 5 years and get a real job, I think the market cap will be so high that I once again will see further investment as pointless.
The only way I see myself putting another dollar into crypto is if bitcoin falls to $500 or ethereum falls to $50. Obviously I might still do it for the short term usage, but not as an investment.

Actually traded all BTC for various altcoins to get higher risk/reward. Most of the gains came from the 0.2 BTC worth of DGB which I bought at 80 satoshis and sold between 800 and 2400.
