bitcoin can by definition never be as efficient as visa can be, and a govcoin could be considerably more efficient than bitcoin can ever be.
the real cost of mining is far far greater than the cost you pay in bitcoin fees now.

i feel the site is basically halfway scamming people, posting dell, paypal as companies using the same TECH.
by this logic I could slap every company logo on the face of the planet on my website saying they trust the same tech as me - tcp/ip for example.
also, the "legally valid" claim is probably not quite as legal as you say, has this ever been tried in court? if so, which?

well then too bad that content owners and producers are not producing their work to get tips, but to sell it.
That being said, I have a lot of yardwork to do, paintiny my fence, that sort of thing, I would love for you to come do it, then you can leave a verified address and I could just press a couple of buttons to tip you. that is, if I feel like it.
sounds fair? great, PM me to get started.

stop saying "bitcoin" and "investing" like that.
Bitcoin itself is not an investment, it is a currency, you cannot invest in a currency, you can do currency speculation.
investment is something you do in companies and the like, currency is something you hold, and you can speculate as to whether its exchange rate will go to a certain direction or not.

remittances should be made illegal instead.
you people are ruining bitcoin by focusing on a destructive industry rather than something constructive
