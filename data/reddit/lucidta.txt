91BTC is a tiny drop in the bucket for the overall volume in the USD/BTC market. It would hardly "kill the price".

+/- 10% a day is not stagnant lol.

His reasoning was completely arbitrary. Numbers arent words, they don't need to follow the same conventions. I could use the same logic and say commas are stupid because commas indicate a pause in a sentence, they shouldnt seperate numbers.
And even if you agree with him on the spaces point, he never explained why 1,000.00 is better than 1.000,00 but apparently periods are "ridiculous" too according to him.

The middle class can invest if they want, its their choice to lose money to inflation. No one is forcing them to keep their wealth in an asset that is designed to lose value.
The poor don't have cash on hand for long enough for it to lose value.

No, the pound was already broken, he just took the opportunity to short it before it crashed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:03:14
It doesnt make sense to you because you've used commas your whole life. Spaces make perfect sense to me.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:17:38
Why 3%?

Non-exotic exchange rates move by fractions of a percent per day. Nothing compared to bitcoins volatility.

$12m would be no problem as long as you dont dump it all at the same time. Just spread it out over a few days/week.

Good old technical analysis, "it'll either go up or down".
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:54:06
Do you seriously think they use inflation as means to steal your money and not as an economic tool?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:45:38
I worded that harshly sorry, meant no disrespect to you either.

You can but you'd be make literally nothing. Phones just arent powerful enough.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:53:49
It has nothing to do with utilization, I'm specifically talking about the tech behind them, as was the comment post. Bitcoin is a rough implementation of the original idea of a decentralised currency. Many other coins do it better currently.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:16:29
Its not about the $300 its about the value of money and working for what you want. Throwing $300 at everything your kid wants is how your create a spoiled brat.

Blockchain technologies can and do exist without bitcoin. They are not tied together.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:02
That is true. I really dont see any technical reason that the popular altcoins would fail under load where bitcoin wouldnt but you're right that the proof doesnt exist yet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:42
The key word in the original post was "as a technology". In terms of tech, Apple phones are often inferior to their competitors. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:23:27
That wording makes no sense, you cant lose more than 100% of something. If i have 5 apples, and I lose 100% of them, I have none left.
Do you mean it was worth 400% more back in 1999?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:28
Currently yes, the tech behind bitcoin is worse than most other coins. Its just a brand at this point until the issues are fixed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:34:19
Lol yes, falsifying official documents is a crime. Just buy it off another service like LocalBitcoins or something.
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:53:08
Thanks man! My first tip :D
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:18:27
Looks right to me. 1, 10, 100 and 1000 are equally spread out.
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:40:03
MtGox is in Japan though so what is legal outside of Japan doesnt matter. They would have to move to implement such features.

All economists learn supply and demand principles. All the guy talked about in the video was supply and demand rising the price of bitcoin. Obviously there are different kinds of economists but this guy is perfectly qualified to talk about what he talked about.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:47:07
Because economists are trained in fundamental economic principles like supply and demand (like what he talked about in the video) that have nothing to do with large scale macroeconomics like countries and banking. 
Supply and demand works the same in bitcoins as it does with fiat and apples.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:25:45
Serious question: Isnt that intended in fiat? Obviously they dont want extreme deflation, but a inflationary currency encourages investment and spending on goods.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:25:39
My mistake, yes.
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:04:47
A website.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:59:09
Its designed to be a deflationary currency. Governments continue to print money, which means the value of a single USD will lose value over time. Bitcoin on the other had, will only ever have 21 million bitcoins produced, meaning that if demand continues to increase, the price is forced upwards.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:06:23
No I wont. If i make $100k per year for the rest of my working life i will pay ~$1.1m in tax. The health sector got 16% of the total budget for my country this year. Thats $180k I will pay to the health sector for my entire life for everything, not just a single operation/treatment.

No shit, thats how they make money.

So you posted something completely unrelated to BTC on a BTC subreddit? This thread should probably get removed then.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:09:26
But how much of the desirability is because of the hype generated by "Wow! Bitcoin up 500%" stories? Rather than its actual use? If most people are buying it purely because the price is going up then its more like a decentralized ponzi scheme than than a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:10:32
Why are you keeping your wealth in USD anyway? There are plenty of other investment vehicles that are vastly less speculative than bitcoin if all you are after is to stop your wealth from devaluing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:32:05
I do hope that's the case, I guess we will just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:41:45
You're a true hero. So brave.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:39:22
Ah yes, the classic "if we just capture 1% of the market our company will be worth billions!" line that every aspiring entrepreneur uses to value their business has made its way to bitcoin.
Yes his estimation is based off something, but the 1% is just a random number he plucked out of his ass. Why not 0.1% or 5% or any other percentage?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:36:06
How did this post get more upvotes than the original joke lol.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:20:24
Yes, comparing the Dow Jones to BTC is idiotic.

Its still money he wont have in his hands to pay off his debt if need be.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:55:16
But why is it bitcoin that will be worth $25 000, why not Etherium, or another coin that comes out in the future?
Most people dont give a shit that their money can be censored, they just want to buy their groceries. 
Im more of the opinion that crypto will remain a niche tool for those that need it while fiat will remain the standard.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:39:59
Why would it be?

Nah, this all stemmed from the comment:


By heltok.
While the post is about inflation, this conversation we are having is about the cause of the GFC which has nothing to do with inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:26:44
Money printing didn't cause the subprime melt down. It was caused by subprime lending, hence the name.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:38:58
This is up there with one of the most stupid posts ever on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:46:03
Its bitcoin. There isnt enough volume to keep it stable so any significant move one way or the other causes mass speculation and massive moves.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:30:49
How was the money counterfeit? Even if they borrow from the governments printed money, its still not counterfeit. The market adjusts to the extra money via inflation. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:09:21
Its Perth, where everything is expensive and good luck buying a house.
@_date: 2013-10-25 02:20:29
While that is a small part of the overall reason, it isnt the main reason. Bitcoin is too unstable to value real world products with. The value of bitcoin moves so much you would have to constantly change the price  of the product you are selling to match its "real world value".
Hence why you'd price something in a "real" currency like USD and convert it to bitcoin on the fly. That way you have stability in price, and can use bitcoin to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:53:59
Investors and profits. The GFC would have happened whether or not the government was printing money, they are completely separate entities. It happened because banks were lending money to people considered "subprime". It doesn't matter if it was the banks money or the governments money, the cause was the lending, not the source of the money. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:36:19
And you're totally helping by adding another useless thread to the mess. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:51:43
Don't try and explain how the global economy works on this subreddit, its a lost cause.
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:00:05
Non-disclosure agreement. It means you are legally obligated to not say anything about a topic. So an NDA in a business contract would mean you cant talk to anyone about how much money was involved etc etc.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:23:52
I think I found it:
It might just be because I'm from Perth but it does look like a large house on a huge block so $1.4m doesnt sound too bad.
