230F internal Antminer temps will fry your miners in short order.  
Ambient intake air temps can safely be up to around 100F.  I like to keep them below 95F. 
I also like to keep Chip temps below 85C, preferably below 78C.
The most important part of Antminer ventilation design is air replacement.  You need to have about the same amount of fresh air going into the front of your miners as is being exhausted out.  A good ballpark rule of thumb is 200CFM per Antminer in AND out. 
You can read-up on the factory specs and recommended ambient/PCB/chip temps in the various Antminer user guides available at  [ .

I probably spend closer to $48 a day for electricity. Not sure where you're getting your numbers.  Think less about the amount of power that I'm *allocating* to each PDU, and more about how much each miner actually draws at 240V.  Also note that I'm using ASIC Boost on the S9s and I have .10 USD power costs.  
Miners as follows:  
10 X S9 13.5TH/s, 1 x S9i 13.5TH/s, 1 x S9i 14.0TH/s, mining BTC  
4 x L3+, 2 x L3++, mining LTC.  
8 x RX580 8GB GPU rig mining ETH. 
Believe me, I'm profitable right now.

I've provided all of the info you need in the comments above to answer your own question.
Here's a good mining calculator -  [

Definitely using energy. Whether it's waste or not is subjective.

diatribe -  a forceful and bitter verbal attack against someone or something. 
You sure that's what my comment was?  
I was providing my opinion, advice, and actionable information to the viewers of this thread.
Sorry if you were triggered.

The Hot Room temperature is usually between 105F and 115F.

If you live in the US - Pay your crypto taxes.  Period.  
Use some legit software like [Bitcoin.tax]( or similar, and record your crypto income, sales, and trades, to calculate your capital gain/loss and net income.
Speak with a CPA that understands or specializes in crypto, like  [ . There are a lot of deductions and strategies available that can really help your situation.
It's not a question of whether or not the IRS *can* catch you.  It's whether they decide it's worth their time to catch you, and it gets easier for them every year. It will eventually become automated and they will go back through several year's returns.
People that tell you to not pay your crypto taxes are misinformed and reckless.

Hmmmm....  I'm guessing you didn't watch the entire video, or you would have realized that the mining shed is located *inside* of a garage.

I'm actually working on a plan to use the exhausted air to heat my house this winter (if mining is still profitable then), but it's Summer here now, so I won't need to heat my house for about 5 or 6 months.
I need to see if it's cost effective to make the required infrastructure investment to route the exhaust into my house's HVAC system. My largest monthly house heating (gas) bill is only about $150, so it all comes down to cost (and my available free time).

Agreed.  All newer technology has to learn to walk before it can run. Bitcoin is only 10 years old. Think of the evolution, efficiency gains, and user adoption that the Internet, electric cars, and mobile devices have undergone in their relatively short existences.  Kind of hard to imagine life without them now, isn't it?
On the bright side, for those concerned about the energy consumption of BTC mining - Due to a direct correlation of low energy costs and PoW mining profits, an estimated 74% of Bitcoin mining operation is currently powered by renewable energy sources. [
Besides, PoW mining will most likely be replaced by PoS, or another yet-to-be-developed process, at some point. BTC may not even be the predominant cryptocurrency 10 years from now.

I live in Southern Indiana, in the US.  That rate (residential) is pretty common around here for my usage quantity.  It's cheaper when you use a lot.

I've got .10 USD /kW-h power cost.  I've got a 200A service panel. The shed is using about 2/3 of it. 
I have 4 x 30A 240V outlets coming off of my 200A service panel. Each of these 4 outlets powers 1 x Tripp Lite PDU1230 PDU. 3 of those PDUs power 4 x S9s each (I have 12 x S9s total). One of those PDUs power 6 x L3+s and one of the GPU rig's power supplies. I am respecting the 80% rule on all PDUs. The outlets were wired by a licensed Master Electrician, and are code compliant.
I also have 3 x 15A 120V outlets coming off my 200A service that handle the ventilation fans, the networking equipment, the second GPU rig power supply, and misc other accessories.

Yes, you sure could, but it would take a bit of infrastructure design and capital investment.  More than I was willing to invest right now.  ROI wouldn't be quick.

Yes, the shed is inside my garage.  It has double-wall, insulated construction, so it's pretty quiet.

The Hot Room temps can get up to about 115 F, on hot days.  At the time of this writing, it's about 105 F.
I use this dual temp and humidity monitoring system - [
The main unit is in the Cool Room, and the dry temp probe is in the Hot Room. It has SMS and email alerting and I can monitor everything online.

Pretty loud!  Right now I have the S9s running in Low Power Enhanced Mode, which is a higher efficiency/lower hashrate mode, so they're not quite as loud, and I can be in there without ear protection. 
But when they're running at normal hashrate/power settings - I can't stay in there very long without ear protection.
