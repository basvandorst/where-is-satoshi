Ok I get all your points, but as you see the solutions are allrdy out there. I try to think of other problems. But for me it seems like a step backwards if I try to adapt a system from a lesser developed country just because our existing one does not work there.

if a currency collapsed I dont see how bitcoin is the solution. Same as before what use is gold, a house, art w/e if you cant eat it.

I agree that is why it is a great investement so far for me. But all this talk about changing stuff. I can't really understand.

Yes my point is, it might be as safe as you say. They also said that about the wifi encryption and a researcher found a way to hack it via an exploit, which nobody saw.
Besides this. Just whack someone with a shovel until they tell you their 12 word seed.
Its a good argument but not one which convinces me to trust bitcoin unconditionally.

exactly, thats why do not see a huge advantage in bitcoin -&gt; regarding safety.

but I can order something from the US or Japan via my credit card without a problem. Yes I have to pay some currency exchange fees but thats it. And bitcoin wont solve the problem of high transport cost + tax + import costs + longer wait time. That is what it makes undesirable to import stuff from far away.

sorry to hear this. this is a massive abuse of power. cant argue with that :)

1. I have to say that for me I feel more comfortable with my money being stored by someone professional. I mean they do a pretty good job, it works without a problem for me. Screwing up a bitcoin transaction has some risk in it and I have no one to talk to if it goes wrong.
2. I believe bitcoin/blockchain is secure. But people will be the target. So same as right now with credit cards.
3. everyday use of bitcoin for ordering something was just an example that it has no obvious advantages for the consumer to change its payment behavior.

1.3.4. I understand your points. But it seems like bitcoin is a solution for problems I don’t have. our world has many problems and it is hard to invest myself in all of them. We can’t even fight against climate change as one.
Can you see why it is hard to motivate someone if there is no immediate positive impact?
2. fees might get lower but someone will always pay fees. I agree this is a minor advantage but not world changing :)

it is hard to convince people based on speculation. Especially if the risk does not seem very plausible.
A bear might attack me on my way to work but I will not start carrying a gun.
But I cant really asses the risk of the inflation problem.

My bank account is free. the bank is called comdirect and belongs to the commerzbank. not all banks have free accounts but we have options.
I can say that SEPA transfers have no fee nationally no matter the bank. I also made some transfers to coinbase which bank is based in Lithuania -&gt; also no fees.
