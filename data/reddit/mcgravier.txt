I could argue about financial crysis (Greece problems could cause global domino effect) But technology is being pushed. For example there is growing deployment of 4G (LTE,soon LTE-Advanced) that should both cover large underinvested areas, and provide 50-100 megabit connections to end users

They refused to pay 50% of their debt back then. This pretty much means default
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:50:03
Nullc, you are forgetting two things: 
First, Gavin code stays true to Satoshis original conception. Every major change (like small block) should be made as an altcoin. Devs opposing block size increase are imposing their vievs on community of people who are here for something else.
Second. Can you explain how keeping block small will not cause user base drop in favor of other cryptocurrencies???
@_date: 2015-06-21 18:33:03
Fail article. This does not end any conflict. It just directs it to proper decisive body called "mining community"
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:35:38
Do you think community is going to wait years with 1MB block choking network? I dont thing so. I would rather expect migration to other cryptocurriences, or unplanned hard fork. Either way it is bad
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:11:41
Headers first synchronisation validates all blocks. I think you confused headers first with bloom filter used by SPV clients
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:57:35
You do understand it will end the day we will hit 1MB limit? Because free market competition between users to make tx included in block.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:38:46
Because they made great piece of software and need some funds to survive? 
Also, you dont have to. Noone forces you to use Multibit HD. Besides these fees are so minuscule you shouldnt feel bad about it.
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:27:39
BitID works the same way. It signs your current SSL session ID.

You need to go to greece personally, take cash from them, go back, deposit cash in your bank and buy. Then send it to their BTC address.
Other option is for them to make bank account in any EU country and deposit cash to that account and then buy via Kraken or any other european exchange. 
Now since capital controls are in motion you cant do much without cash and trip to another country

There were 3 main reasons why I dropped QT client in favor of SPV client:
* Bitcoin.org (and most of the community) recommended using SPV
* QT client was slow and resource consuming
* My new ISP put me behind NAT, so my node wouldnt contribute much anyway
Assuming no NAT issue, I wouldnt have any problem with running prunned node on my computer, but as I understand, current prunned mode in core client does not contribute to network health in any way.
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:04:28
Very relevant
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:40:22
Wait, hasnt core client started to use headers first synchronisation? Does it mean electrum server still dont support it?
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:40:05
Eh, no? Once block got included it requires two blocks of competing chain to orphan it. Right?
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:49:15
I think that's the reason Gavin choose 75% and not more. Still two pools could collude in order to block change, but it is very unlikely.
Also as somone said - userbase switching to other pools may be most important factor
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:53:13
The idea of merged minning is that it does not introduce any additional costs to miner - and assuming 1MB block will be maxed out, there should be some profit to be made of tx fees.
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:25:30
Peter Todd is wrong. Miners will reduce amount of included data in order to reduce orphan chance. Every orphaned block is a great financial loss to a miner who mined it.
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:43:44
The benefit od BitID on the other hand is compatibility (in manual mode) with all bitcoin clients that allow message signing
Besides it makes sense to keep sensitive data (identity and financial) in one secure place

@_date: 2015-06-28 03:56:13
It is called common sense. I know you cant handle one hit of it. Since there is strict hard limit on amount of transactions, and no upper limit on fees, it is inevitable that transaction costs will increase as the network is overloaded. Assuming there are millions of users and 1MB limit is kept, fees can go ridiculously high. Or which is more likely - users wont put up with this shit, and fork BTC or move to cheaper and more scalable altcoin

Cant chineese mines afford to buy an averange VPS that will do the propagation for them? I mean I can understand poor bandwidth aviability in some countries, but there are a lot of reasonable solutions to counter this. For example chineese miner could relay its block via IBLT-like protocol to their VPS that will relay block properly.
I do not see much problem other than lack of initiative and perhaps a little engeneering

First: There is no such thing as "recommended" transaction fee. This is artificial rate put as temporary measure in order to prevent transaction spam. It will be lifted further or later.
Second: In case of CC, fee is deducted from McDonalds, while in bitcoin it is deducted from consumer. (not counting coinbase/bitpay here)
I think, transaction fees should stabilise around 1c per kB in long term.

Polish Finance Ministry is full of incompetent morons. The crypto related tax issues were known since 2012. And nobody bothered to fix this shit.

The whole legal system in this country is full of shit. No wonder why local exchange (BitBay) moved to malta. Also, bitpay-like gateway services (Bitcantor, InPay) are registerd abroad as well.

Im not a developer, but im quite sure BitPay or coinbase could help you. Im seeing it as clicking in-app buy button redirects you to mobile website with transaction details and link that starts bitcoin app with all details loaded and waiting to push "send" button. 
In case of integration with coinbase or bitpay all security and legal compliance is handled by them and not by you. AFAIK they take 1% of every transaction processed
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:13:33
First off - do not start with everything at once - toy with like 0.1 BTC and test entire chain of operation. 
Do not keep funds in BTC - buy BTC only for transfer purposes.
I also suggest moving money bit by bit over few months. There is a LOT that can go wrong with BTC, viruses, keyloggers, exchanges go down ect.
Im not familiar with US AML procedures but there may be limit (im guessing between 10000-50000USD) of what you can exchange per month without very detailed verification
Expect fees around 0,5% for every exchange operation so overall cost should be around 1%
Fluctuations are not a problem since transfering BTC between exchanges is matter of around 1 hour. Exchange AUD to BTC, transfer them, and instantly exchange for USD once they arrive. Entire operation should be doable in ~1-2 hours

Localbitcoins is a terrible idea in my opinion. You do NOT want to travel with 25k USD in cash. It is simply not safe. I would suggest making an account on big exchange like bitstamp or bitfinex and verifying with ID and utility bill. Once done wire your funds internationally to them and buy your bitcoins. Everything should take around 7-10 days. 
And buy TREZOR hardware wallet to store your bitcoins. This is the closest thing to "unhackable" you'll find on the market. Dont repeat mistakes of people who got stolen dozens or even hundreds of BTC due to poor security measures
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:30:59
Well it cant hold blockchain for obvious reasons, but It may be possible to turn it into private key storing wallet. You would need generate priv key pub key and address on SIM, then send addres via SMS to third party that will provide blockchain processing. 
You want to send btc from your phone to somebody elses:
Ask provider via SMS for unsigned transaction, phone signs it and sends back via SMS again
It should be possible to use phone numbers instead bitcoin address as long as your payment provider can translate phone numbers to BTC adress

I know it is awkward, but expecting all customers to have internet range or forcing them to connect to local wifi is RIDICULOUS. Besides offline transaction mode is not mandatory by any way. 
Have you ever tried to pay with BTC in underground caffe? Had you rising line of clients behind you while you were struggling with GSM range problems?
It is absolutely crucial to have swift "emergency" way of paying in such situations no matter how awkward they are.
Since pretty much EVERY device on market is equipped with bluetooth, it does make sense to use it as bakwards compatibile interface.
Once Android 4.4+ will be popular, one tap NFC offline payments can be implemented (see coinblesk wallet), this is however future, and we need offline transactions NOW

You shouldn't and you probably won't. First there are institutions that do not perform fractional reserve, second - when institution puts your bitcoin in cold storage, you can always see your cold storage address in blockchain.

Hard question. Im not an expert - just enthusiast so I may be bit off.
 Telecom operator usually have keys that allow remote uploading of applets into clients sim card. So this is one big NO for security there. In order to have proper security it would be nessesary to change regular card to one that cant be manipulated remotely. There is payment service in Kenya called M-pesa that is similar to coinapult system described in original post, but uses local currency. AFAIK in order to use it you need to change simcard into new one (probably because of reasons described earlier.)
To sum things up you probably need to load your software onto custom sim card

SIM card is capable of executing "java applets" - small (up to 64kB) programs written in modified java. 64kB is enough to store private key and signing algorithm. Theoretically you could recieve unsigned transaction via SMS, sign it, and then send it back to somone who will broadcast it into the bitcoin network. In such case SMS does not need to be encrypted, since it is secured by signing the same way any bitcoin tx is. Somone "could" send to you faudelent transaction to sign, but recipments addres displayed on the phone screen would change

The issue is that in case of some big lightning hub faliure, theoretically there can be more channels to close than block space and time limits allow. 
This is purely theoretical - I have no idea of how likely is this to happen in real life
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:11:36
As far as I know the worst case scenario is when miners refuse to include transaction that closes channel - which is amplified by limited on-chain capacity especially when a lot of people want to close channel simultaneously.

"If the orphan rate is very low (say, 0.1%), the effect can be ignored.  But as it climbs, the pressure to join a pool (the largest pool) becomes economically irresistible, until only one pool remains."

@_date: 2015-08-22 22:42:45
I think its quite simple - consensus after 50 blocks is very, very strong, so you just need to calculate things on basis of, say avg of 500 blocks older than that. 
In case of some sort network clogging attack more orphans would result in automatic block size reduction, thus mitigating the attack
Trying to make orphans by minning is far too expensive to even try.
I just wondering if Im missing something substantial here?

Depends on centralisation level. Few very large nodes for whole network would be bad. But I dont see a problem with few thousand big or medium sized scattered around the globe


Well we have 7 billion people on earth. 25 million is not enough by any means. This means even with lightning, block increase is nessesary. Assuming 20 MB block, we could hook up to 500 million people which is more reasonable. So why so much argumemnt against block size increase i it is uavoidable - lighting or not?

Depends on personal idea of bitcoins future. If you expect full nodes to be handled by large companies/mining operations then its not much of a concern.
By the way, Im looking for some lightning scalability projections - are there any estimates how many users it can support with 1MB limit?
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:42:22
I could argue, that keeping 1MB limit will unnecessarily increase transaction fees, and keep people away from BTC due to being uncompetitive against traditional payment networks.
The real question is: Will it increase centralisation enough to be harmful to the network? Again, are there any estimates?
@_date: 2015-07-08 09:18:03

You mean It's harmful because it causes centralisation? Low budget nodes are being shut down because they wont keep up.

Greg also said:


From a bandwidth reduction perspective, this like IBLT and network block coding aren't very interesting: at most they're only a 50% savings (and for edge nodes and wallets, running connections in blocksonly node uses far less bandwidth still, but cutting out gossiping overheads). But the latency improvement can be much larger, which is critical for miners-- and no one else. The fast block relay protocol was developed and deployed at a time when miners were rapidly consolidating towards a single pool due to experiencing high orphaning as miners started producing blocks over 500kb; and I think it can be credited for turning back that trend.
Kinda confusing...
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:36:49
I wasnt talking about miners in this particular post - In practice abslutely nobody wants periodical spikes that max out connection - it disrupts all other services that are latency dependent.

You mean lightning? Its material for whole new discussion, and im too sleepy and tired to start it now :/ I believe lightning is viable, but i dont want to be dependent on it. Say, if I could use lightning by paying 1-5 cents per week for all the micro transactions it would be ok. But I want to be able to revert to on-chain transactions any time I want (at similar 1-5c per transaction price). Scenario when I am forced to freeze in payment channel more than weekly expenses is not acceptable for me. But sadly current development goes in direction of forcing users into lighting far more than that

I'm not a big fan of relay network, due to one-entitiy nature - to work properly, all miners have to be connected to single system made of bearly few nodes. Even assuming it works fine now, in case of failure (for any reason) miners would have to temporarily fall back into regular propagation. I believe that reason alone is good enough for implementing thin block just-in-case somthing goes wrong
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:14:26
Instead of transfering whole block, client sent header, and receiving peer reconstructed block from unconfirmed transactions stored in RAM. This way amount of data needed for block transfer were reduced from 1MB to 40kB (~25 times)
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:57:07
It takes a lot of burden from nodes with slow connections. It also helps solo miners - now you dont need to be connected to fast relay network, to have competitive propagatoin times. Also as I mentioned earlier, it should do good job penetrating china firewall.

@_date: 2016-02-26 21:50:13

You assume that every miner is connected to random peers - in practice it is safe to expect that miners will keep direct connections to each other. You cant have better topology than direct P2P connections, you also have no hops in between.
But I think, even better protocol for mining could be achieved - miners should be directly connected to each other AND share blocks they are working on.
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:40:36
But it leaves very nasty pattern of bandwidth usage - irregular spikes on avg 10 min interval - thin blocks removes this issue

So nobody will implement any replay protection? This is the worst case scenario. It's not about who should do what, but about adversary effect of two chains interfering with each other. If at least one side works up defence, then issues will be mitigated
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:21:29
Why do you assume the network shuts down? The issue here is,  that something wrong happens, and network accepts that despite it shouldn't.

If we have only one, such event could go unnoticed for a significant amount of time

Whoa sry, mistake on my phone, this supposed to be response for post above regarding resignation of netagio from bitcoin vs gold trade.
From your response I assume you are Netagio employee?
As far as I know, great, great majority of bitcoin users have below 1000USD worth of bitcoin. 100g of gold is currently like 3500USD. Even if someone actually have such money, there appears quantification problem - you can either buy 1x100g for 3500usd or 2x100g for 7000usd. This made Netagio service for wealthy investors only. People want initially to try it out and invest small sums of money like 100-200USD until they get comfortable. And there was market depth problem - as far as I remember there was bearly few bars on sale since netagio turned from just middleman into typical gold vs bitcoin exchange.
Bit of a shame because I personally expect myself to settle down in gold some years ahead from now, once my adventure with BTC will be over

Very nice article.
I do not have problems with giving up my privacy for BTC exchange, or, rather I woud not have if I lived in US. The great thing about bitcoin is not anonymity itself, but freedom of choice to be anonymous or not, depending on ones personal preferences. We did not have much of that choice in past due to practical reasons - its pretty impossible to do a large transactions in cash. Second best thing in bitcoin is fact, that it allows not only full ananymity, but full transparency as well. Imagine a company in far future disclosing all their btc addreses so shareholders can be fully informed. I love it.

Well, according to them its impossible to remove xrp entirely due to spam problems, and I belive it. Only wrong thing is the way the xrp is distributed. Everything would be all right if you could mine them - in example in order to make transaction ~10 minutes of mining would be required - this way there would be no central entity controlling supply and no danger of toxic monopoly.

Any idea, how xrp emission is going to work? Id love to have some, but apperently there is no way to obtain them. In case of btc this matter is simple and rules transparent - you are rewarded for your computing power, the more share of overall computing power you provide, the bigger share of btc emission you are getting. But how are the ripple creators going to distribure XRP?

I guess since that ATM is prototype, manufacturing cost is not yet evaluated. And since it is not in mass production, initial price will be high.

This is one of the questiones that would be answered instantly when this sub was ~5000 users big. 
While pool admins control a lot of computing power, they do not control the hardware. Because double spend attempt requires blockchain fork, it would be instantly obvious that somone is trying 51% attack (lot of orphaned blocks would appear). That would result users switching from malitious pools to honest ones, and in result honest fork of blockchain would be rebuild and took over the malicious one. There would be significant mess and victims, but by no means this wouldnt cause bitcoin payment network to collapse

spending does not equal income. Real income is measured in goods and services that you can aquire, while spended money does not always have coverage in equivalent amount of goods and services produced. Its the result of bank money creation and lately quantitative easing (it is STEALING and causes inflation). You thinking 1$ in = 1$ out so everything is in balance. 
But proper way of understanding this, is: 1 good produced = 1 good exchanged.
If deflation starts to kill economy, less goods and services are produced, and therefore prices are rising. Deflation simply kills itself - healthy economy should keep it in near perfect blance.
"That by controlling interest rates, we can keep the level of spending consistent with the amount required for full employment"
Stimulating spending by cheating wont produce anything. Stealing != producing. This will eventually burn out pepole who you were stealing from.
"this real rate of interest is completely out of everyone's control"
Its actually in EVERYONES controll.
Supply and Demand. It is the answer for every economical problem, do not mess with it.

When comes to altering the algo, it IMHO would be better to create proof-of-work + proof-of-stake hybrid instead.

I dont understand it perfectly, but on example of PPcoin implementation:
1. You have to maintain/sync full node once per 3 month in order avoid losing wealth.
2. In case of PPcoin there is no demurrage - there is 1% per year inflation exposure if you do not use your coins to create PoS.
3. Not sure here. AFAIK there is separate difficulty for mining (PoW) and minting (PoS)
[EDIT]: I think emission coming from PoW will end evntually while PoS emission is flat 1%
4. dont know. Cementing is term unknown to me.
5. Yes, but problem is, that buying ASIC hardware for 51% attack may still be profitable if market price of coin is relatively high comapring to difficulty.

I have a vision, what possibilities btc allows for semi-free mmorpgs (when i mean semi-free I think about free playing with paid premium stuff), here is few of my taughts:
- set yourself as middleman for trading to prevent fraud. You can charge small fee from in game btc transactions between players.
- most common items free, rare and unique items avialiable for BTC in in-game shops.
- from time to time you can make auction for random unique item.
- prices low enough to have at least some premium stuff affordable for bitcoins earned on sites like bitvisitor and such
- items can break with time like in diablo 2, repairs of rare items charged in BTC (again, cheap enough so farming  "free bitcoin sites" will suffice)
- entire gameplay designed so best players could actually earn some bitcoins by selling rarest items found during gameplay, to other players.

Actually bank will have your 100USD and interest paid by guy X. When loan gets paid back, virtual money is being removed from circulation.Removal of large amounts of virtual money from circulation in short time is the reason of deflation during financial crysis.

Look at chart above - they probably meant that due to price instability bitcoin currently cannot be seen as secure store of value and good unit of account. It cant work well as medim of exchange directly in most cases - special payment processors are nessesary to avoid problems associated with fluctuations.

How to protect bitcoin from politics? 
Dude, it should be: "How can politics protect themselfs from bitcoin?" 
And the answer is: They Can't!

I dont see anything in this document that would prohibit opening an account for US resident. According to BZWBK terms, you can send all required documents via post mail, but they need to be confirmed by notary. Notary is not required if you go to BZWBK yourself with your ID.
 You can get more information here:
If you decide to open bank account in Poland in PLN, I suggest to use one of polish bitcoin exchanges like  or simply mtgox since both have PLN bank accounts in poland. Its convinient since wire transfers in PLN iside country are cheap- about 5 -15 cents for every transfer.

Its possible. Currently its not allowed due to strain it would put on the network. But when such need emerges, that function of protocol will be expanded

1. Low transaction fees - bitpay takes like 1%? Credit card companies and paypal with their ~3% are not really competitive
2. No chargebacks. Transaction is final. Period.
3. Wery well suited for micropayment - with bitcoin buisness model based on extremally small payments might actually work.
4. Bitcoin community is still small, but very active - accepting BTC is great advertisment - it most likely attract some new clients.
5. You may attract clients from large distance, since bitcoin is borderless, its possible, that some people unwilling to buy your service/product due to currency conversion fees will change their mind.
6. No problem with lack of change :)
7. BTC is bank independent. If you accept BTC directly, it may do well as backup payment channel in case bank system is unavialiable - like in Cyprus
8. If you sell private, personal things, accepting BTC may bring some more customers who want anonymity.
9. In case of direct BTC acceptance blockchain offers transaction history - it may, or may not be useful in case if you lost your data.

Here where I live we use DMY mostly because it is short from common language: if you ask somone what date is today, he will answer "16th april 2013" format 16.04.2013 is logical consequence of common language.

They actually wouldnt even need to default. It would be like in case of Soros, who rebought later on lower price, and kept the difference for himself.

This is a matter that cannot be currently proven or disporven. This is also one of resons why nobody sane is investing in BTC more than he can lose.   On the bright side, accidental fork alredy happened before - community and develoers diagonsed and solved problem within bearly few hours - only one double spend happened and user who did it returned the funds out of his own good will. Also, when you use payment processor like bitpay, the risk is on them, so as a merchant you do not need to bother with this problem. This amongs other things makes me belive that total collapse in such scenario is unlikely.

The point of ban probably wasnt to prevent gambling, it was to prevent gambling outside of US. Internet gambling started to be threating competition for local gambling industry, so they lobbied/bribed for passing bill that prevents gambling online. Note, that even if you live in Nevada, you cant legally gamble on websites outside US.

Can this thing be integrated with BitPay/Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:13:30
As far as I know, joining Coinbase or BitPay doesnt cost pretty much anything - currently with coinbase there are 0 fees until you reach 1mln of total volume, after that its like 1%
One thing is that you shouldnt expect many clients paying with BTC - if they will have 1 - 2% of your total transaction volume it will be quite a sucess. There are additional gains if you aiming for world-wide distribution, and/or if you have low margin (like below 20%) on your product. Since BTC is well suited for international payments you may attract some  clients from forgein countries. In case of low margin product, 2-3% difference in transaction fees may be a real difference for you. 
And since you are saying, that this is e-commerce, it is possible that many of your clients are alredy aware of bitcoin, and you will provide them with additional convinience. 
There is a lot "Ifs", but since integrating coinbase/bitpay is cheap and easy why not to try?
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:04:11
Well, you drastically polished that game since I signed up. 
Small sugestion: combining ingredients one by one is bit frustrating, you should add "combine all" option or something.

I think, it would be far more interesting to unify Economy with Psychology - since everything we do comes down to fullfiling our needs, its quite obvious that reasearching crowd behaviour could explain a lot of economic phenomena.

Its nice, that small business are opening, but information about paying retailers in china is far more interesting. It means bitcoin is really catching on as wealth transfering system

Bitcoin protocol allows for putting additional data into transaction. This data can be used to mark bitcoin as special purpose one - so you can create bitcoin marked as your own private currency, or debt certificate or whatever. For lack of better term, this additional parameters are called colour.

Good, seems like massive adoption between payment transmitters is starting. In a few years from now accepting BTC will be as easy and popular as credit card.

Great idea, the only inconveinence is you cant currently choose custom sum. In example: in my plan its best to load phone with 30PLN, however, your site offers only 10PLN and 25PLN top-ups. Im not sure about other countries, but Im certain that in PL all biggest GSM providers allow custom payments by various methods.
And one more thing: It would be nice if your site located origin of my IP address and set country that I'm located in automatically.

Yep, sold most of my coins at $30. I had a strategy to sell slowly as the price rises, but I've never would guess that price reaches &gt;$100. Lesson for the future. After all this isnt the first bubble and probably not last.

Bitcoin doesnt play with regulators, just like torrent protocol doesnt either. It is the regulators who need to adopt themselves to new enviroment
