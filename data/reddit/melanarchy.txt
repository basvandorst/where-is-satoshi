You should never be leaving any balance in your PayPal account. Not even over night.
You should be transferring money out of PayPal everyday. PayPal can freeze your balance at any time for any reason and in those cases it may take months to get your money. If you transfer it out each day you'll have as much of what you're owed as possible.

The $20 bill over the 2005 cart was introduced in 1996. The design over the 2015 cart was introduced in 2003. 
But other than that this is totally accurate in the levels of inflation and deflation for the years shown and the goods the depicted currencies could purchase. TOTALLY ACCURATE.

You could apply for the license and continue operating, it's $5000 and some capital requirements to make sure you don't MagicalTux everyone's btc away. (  )

This was fun to watch.

What exactly is your fear here?  Presumably you'd be transferring from a bank account that already has your SSN?  I understand the innate desire to maintain anonymity, but even an OTC ETF transfer to someone else is traceable to some degree.  What will not participating give you?

Why on earth have you posted here but not contacted bitinstant?  Moneygram/ZipZap only know whether or not your money was sent to bitinstant (it likely was).  Bitinstant is likely sitting on your money waiting for you to tell them where to send it.
I know my friend accidentally forgot to send the random cents once (sent a whole dollar amount) and they were able to get him his coins.  They care.

Charging GBP for a bitcoin conference not BTC? WTF?
@_date: 2012-05-19 19:33:01
Okay great, but why?  Even cash has serial numbers.  Are your activities with bitcoin exclusively illegal?

If your email/pw was the same for linkedin, last.fm, or eharmony all 3 had pw db's compromised in the last 4 days and an attacker could be crawling through all of them looking for valid mtgox credentials.

I believe they pay everyday, and if your account is in BTC the rate is 6% which is in no means a "small amount" for interest.

10BTC isn't really that much money.  Assuming that you could use BTC for direct regular USD investments you could put it into a money market account at a bank.  Or buy a bond ETF that pays monthly dividends (TIP is one, of course $usd 50 won't even buy you 1/2 a share).
I think I agree that bitocinica interest is pretty much your only option.

1. Make a Dwolla account and link it to your bank account.
2. Transfer money to Dwolla
3. Transfer money from Dwolla -&gt; Mt. Gox
4. Buy Bitcoins on Mt. Gox
Bitcoin sites are notorious for getting hacked, so use unique passwords on all of this and don't keep funds or bitcoins in your accounts on these sites. (once you buy the bitcoin on mt.gox transfer them to a personal wallet immediately.)  This is especially important for Dwolla because if it were compromised someone could withdraw money from your bank account. 
I've never bought any coins but I successfully sold 2 on mt. gox, transferred the money to dwolla and then into my bank account.

20 years for the community to transition the protocol to a header with an 8 byte timestamp. We're totally fucked.

It's reasonable to expect somewhere between 200-400mHash/s from a single ati video card.

No sentence that includes the word invest has any right to also include the word Bitcoin.
