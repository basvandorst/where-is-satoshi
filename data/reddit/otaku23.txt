I just Finished Freedom™. It was awesome! I felt the plausibility of the Daemon was a bit romanticized, but that may be more to the content it was recommended to me in (as a techno-gospel). I enjoyed Loki's initiation the best, reminded me of an ARG with guns.
I'm going to pass on Kill Decision based on your last statement, and I'm more interested in [Influx when it comes out] ( :).
I also just ordered [Nexus by Ramez Naas]( since some else recommended it in another Suarez thread and I saw a lecture by the author recently by coincidence.

What makes it a Trojan Horse?
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:27:27
Bring on the Daemon.

Haha, we can collude!
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:23:26
Yes, quite the wake up call. Soooooo far to go with making it accessible.

Have you read Freedom? I'm close to finishing it.

What do you then, personally, see in the future of cryptocurrencies? I mourn the opposition, but I can't help but see the value of the technology and a decentralized system.

I love how both contradictory and rational your advice sounds. It HAS to be a bubble, at least based on the fact it it goes up much higher, more people are going to cash out and throw it again I think.
I'd argue it's becoming rapidly more liquid and usable through in proportion to this recent popularity burst. Between Reddit's Bit-tip extension and it becoming legal tender in Germany, I'm almost wondering if I people could make money consulting local businesses (or at least good friends) in adopting and accepting it.
Nah, you suggested something pretty close to my initial burst, which is only a portion of my overall intended investment. Thanks for your words.

You're not alone, I've been experiencing the same problem.

When to buy? As a newcomer, the excitement goes both ways. I really just want a stake in the thing, but I expect the price to bubble too. Still, more people are drawing more attention to it (i.e. Branson) and Chinese are moving more away from the dollar, then the German government accepts it aahhhhhhhhhhh!

This contest is awesome, thanks for the excuse to draw something Bitcoin related! [I'm open to feedback, this is a WIP.]( [Here's me drawing some of it.](  I'll get a few other people to submit soon!

In this case I don't think a less liquid market will drive the prices up. Sure, the War on Drugs make them more expensive, but didn't it create and inflate a massive prison-industrial complex which has bred levels of human suffering at insane levels as well?
I certainly think China backing out may strengthen the resolve of current crypto-activists, but that's balanced by others who will be unable or unwary to help them evolve as well.

I feel as though I see this conversation play out at least once a month, and more so with each new NSA or other USA human rights violation that surfaces. I think we're becoming rapidly conditioned to this type of reveal (those of that that are aware of the news or not) and our governments are doing as much as they can get away with while simultaneously focusing on developing and strengthening whatever apparatus will ensure their hegemony and long-term survival.
Personally, I feel the looming effects of climate change and our collective response to it specifically sort of dwarfs every other issue, but I also feel hardened and disillusioned by the rate things are moving, the feasibility of stopping it (collapse), or moving past it (geoengineering). Also, Soma everywhere.
I'm digressing. I'm simply curious about the history of your conclusions and opinions on what I perceive as a recurring conversation.

I agree with your sentiment, but as a very recent investor, this shit hurts. I picked a horrible moment to invest.

Sorry, I'm acting selfish. I should dissolve my surface emotions and ground myself more in what you're talking about, because I absolutely agree and believe in the power of a decentralized, open-source currency. 
No, I had no intention of selling them, I was simply watching for the past six weeks looking at the ideal price to jump in at with the small funds I have. The incredible volatility has made it hard to judge the true price, and reading the overall market, nature of the technology, and hurdles in its future have been challenging. 
I've also never purchased something at this scale or attached myself to something while my close friends and family continue to remain indifferent or overly-critical. I need to simply put on some pants, keep studying, and looking for ways to make it more liquid in my own finances.
