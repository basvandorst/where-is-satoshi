Roger Ver is name calling Bitcoin and engaging in underhand tactics. This is an understatement. My post has a name-calling shock value, and it is warranted. It is not name-calling, it is free speech. If it was name-calling it would be like I am lying or something, and I only speak the facts, 'Roger Ver is a cunt' -- try Googling it you will see!
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:12:22
ok you would be right if it's possible but it won't be. It's too risky to do without harming Bitcoin and it will help ChinaBU as they are not interested in profit right now..... they will lose profit to gain control and would be happy to see people go back to the Yuan. 
I had to ask since this is a tactic they might employ. (Selling to devalue).

This video is not elegant and he is no genius and most of the time states the obvious. Why post him everyday on this sub? People hero worship him and in Bitcoin we don't need that. Even if he explains well that's great, but he's not a hero and if it's not satoshi or even previously people loved ver and crapped on me for questioning that guy before he turned really unpopular. People post this guy too much and worship him.

The fact that bitfinex is doing this is bad. But it's up to people if they fall for it. I'm never using bitfinex and tbh in the future I will try not to use exchanges. I guess we will have more choice and competition in the future. I do hope exchanges are not able to manipulate the markets too much. I think this might be unlikely in that they would all have to collude together in every country not to be discovered price fixing.

That people get so upset about criticising Ver is laughable, like they are his friend or something, like he cares about them! Ironically this is the very reason, I must post this. We should question people's motives in every way, especially in this current spy climate. It's interesting Ver to me seems like he is working for the CIA or shadow Government. Ver could be a plot to take down Bitcoin or attempt to ruin it's branding by a highly publicised hard fork at this time. Who on earth feels they should be called Bitcoin Jesus or own Bitcoin.com and try to rubbish the development team? Narcissist much?

Hi mr shill
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:49:20
Bitcoin is not first come first serve. Plus this is the point, Roger Ver was aggressive in damaging Bitcoin first. He started trolling Bitcoin first. Bitcoin then responded to defend the attack. I am part of the defence. I am not leaving at the moment, but I will if he stays and ruins Bitcoin. (I am not leaving core, at least that is my decision at this time unless they prove to be bad for Bitcoin, which I do not believe is happening at the moment).
Who is watching the watchmen? We are!
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:53:22

As well as holding you have to have faith and so do I and of course this guy will check bitcoin can not be ruined but otherwise hang on to coins and give them to grand kids if u don't spend them. If someone dies with loads of coins they technically make all other holders richer and so nothing is wasted. Without people like this guy bitcoin would be worth nothing.

What if core is attacked? Do we have to just use core software to make sure we have valid btc? To me valid btc is the current core software with or without bu software on the chain. I don't want my coins to leave the core chain in any event. I believe electrum will have an update soon or I will try to master the console instructions but I hope it gets automated soon. In case it does fork tragically. And I would rather use electrum or core to send bu coins to an exchange to sell. This should help core too.

At the moment, until we can create ways to 'watch the watchmen' -- difficult in everything in society -- These character assessments are all we have to go on. It is fact that the consensus character assessment of Satoshi is very positive, we have all concluded. I use vile language because I am angry and also for comedy effect (sorry to any feminists who oppose; it is just a dig at Ver, you can call me a dick if you want!). We can conclude so far Satoshi is the only person/collective trying to do something for the common good.
Ver undermines Satoshi (until we do or don't learn more about Satoshi).

You don't need to go in to so much detail because it is no good owning Bitcoin run by a dickhead. And it would be run by dickheads who just care about money and not bitcoin. If I was a millionaire now I would set up core asci mining just to piss them off. I would not mine anything against decentralisation if I had the money also.

Yes and they do not want to make their own China DigiCoin at the moment as the population wants bitcoin.

It's got to the point where I am considering Ver is a last ditch desperate attempt to damage the solid brand breakout of Bitcoin by shadowy figures. CIA? GCHQ? or is he just mad? Either way he is no Bitcoin Jesus. 'Satoshi' is possibly! Ver is a narcissist. I honestly think some people have been tarnished along the way by money, governments, agencies, Goldman... etc. But still Bitcoin is winning! I hope it continues. Stick with Core.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:47:16
I think that BU will be valued more if they change their name to BJ Unlimited (stands for Bitcoin Judas Unlimited) But the market will flock to the free BJs and the BJU coin will sore in value.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:44:17
Like previous posts/replies say, it's not about block size, I now oppose any suggestions from BU because they cannot be trusted. Increasing block size makes it harder for individual people to vote with their own nodes and this will create a problem with the fundamental robustness and decentralisation of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is run by anyone in BU it will not be Bitcoin anymore. Even if it is called Bitcoin. Bitcoin should be more decentralised and should have Core running it until a better team can evolve. It is the problem with Bitcoin that it needs a genuine selfless custodian. Increasing blocks to make more money and get more power over the network is a solution that destroys Bitcoin of any use. It will make miners more money though. I don't care about centralised miners, I would rather find a way so everyone can go back to just helping with a CPU but we cannot find a way to democratically ban specialised mining nor would we really want to/be able to/should do. Trust is the most important part. Blocks don't matter. Scaling does not matter. This will all be solved in time. Why hurry?

You do realise all the politicians follow the same policies right? It does not matter who you voted for -- you voted for the establishment. You are a sheeple. And apparently in your universe, I am a prick!
You fail to see I was talking about the fact that just because Trump is in a position of authority, it does not make him a good person. It does not make him good for America. (Incidentally Hilary would be terrible for America too).
In the same way, Roger Ver is not good for Bitcoin just because he owns some bitcoin and he once bought some Bitcoin.
He is bad because he lies and assaults truths in Bitcoin. He seems to be destroying Bitcoin, his policies (intentional or not) are harmful to the decentralisation of Bitcoin.
It's probably true it will not matter. He will be hardforked or silenced. And I need to chill about it. Except I am very chill, I'm just engaging too!

Bitcoin isn't mature yet for small transactions. Despite previous uses. But if someone or a company decides to accept or not accept Bitcoin then that's a human problem not a bitcoin problem. And it does depend what you want to buy.

The term 'conspiracy theory' has now been weaponised by those who have promoted it as 'crazy theory'. 
Conspiracies have existed in the past and continue to be created and are ongoing. When theory becomes conspicuous it is no longer theory; it is real.
Since conspiracy theory phrasing has been weaponised as crazy, it is difficult for Core to openly preach the realities of Bitcoin without undermining their own reputation. Thus they leave it largely up to the market to decide. I really, really rate them for this. Bitcoin is so interesting as we get to see if the major consensus is 'good' or 'bad' and it seems to be good! I think people will notice. 
Everyone needs to examine the truth in this world, not just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is one of the biggest communities under threat of [fake news] propaganda. This has been going on for centuries and now the internet reveals lies to be more obvious than previously. Bitcoin is built on the internet to undermine mass authority.
Go Bitcoin!

His actions are the proof! His actions make Bitcoin more centralised (in a different way to fiat, but YES, 'akin' to fiat). If he got his way he would have to sign every Bitcoin transaction with his own name and he would own the name Bitcoin. This is terrible for Bitcoin.

Unfortunately the BU node is a menace to the ideals of Bitcoin, I do not believe it will prosper and yet it might. I cannot understand how this can be seen as anything other than a hostile take over. We can do all the name-calling on either side; it does not alter the facts. It does not matter who calls who what. That is the point of this post. What matters is that BU is bad for Bitcoin just in its existence and not the other way around.
You can have all the sizes and scaling of blocks to wet your pants, you can have side scaling, upscaling, downscaling and we can have our mother's scales too.
BU is a hostile takeover. Bitcoin is not trying to hostile takeover itself.
Bitcoin=Good from the past decade of data.
BU=Bullshit Unlimited
This post should not be called trolling, this post should be called a cry to help. The comedy side of things is there to appeal in a different way and it certainly is not name-calling.

OK so we need to approve a different way.

BU is not about block size. It's about diverting attention talking about block size or any other method to begin more power shifting to miners in any way possible so they can hijack Bitcoin. Understand that or consider yourself at minimum working on the same side as paid shills because you are propagating nonsense you do not understand. This post is pro-undermining Bitcoin whether you realise it or not.

Asics are not part of Bitcoin. That is up to miners to invest in. If miners have coins, then they won't be out of it if CPU based transaction solving or something else comes back in. Miners were never supposed to have a monopoly and they don't have any power. I could not give 2 flying fks about miners. Sorry if that hurts.

if the banks hold them they are worth more and those that hold in public get wealthier. If they sell all their coins wealth will redistribute after a period of time. Price will increase to previous levels since users are not declining. If the banks buy up and then spend the bitcoin they do the community a favour helping more users come in and see it as stable and viable. In all circumstances Bitcoin is likely to be robust and longterm holders should benefit no matter what. Genius huh!

The only reason he evangelised it is to further his own gain. I do not respect him, he is harming Bitcoin, his stock of Bitcoins makes him more dangerous to Bitcoin and even more reason to shout louder. His stock of Bitcoin is akin to what oligarchs have done with fiat money. I don't think you get it. I can tolerate him at the moment. I can stay with Bitcoin after a hard fork (if it's possible with BU), and yet I still do not want Bitcoin to split (re: Core warning). I am not in this to get rich. I will take advantage of that if I can. I am in this to bring about new DECENTRALISED systems of exchange. NOT CENTRALISED. I do not want to calm down, I want to call him names because I am powerless against his money -- except for some reason if I call him a name this seems to get some attention! Wahoo! I'm not doing it in btc (would I get away with that? Do I care?) I really want to ramp up the conversation about Ver. Who is this guy? How do we get rid of him?
If the PBOC or UK starts buying loads of Bitcoin will you be happy the price is pumping then? There are many scenarios where this is probably already happening on the quiet (so as not to increase the price too much). I can live with people I do not like in Bitcoin but give me the choice I will comedy bash the Government and Ver and others all day for their evils. I can take it back at me. I am happy to have a debate. They can call me what they want it's a free country. They have money. I have comedy. This is comedy, not trolling.
This is freedom of speech. This is silent weapons for quiet wars and right now people do not understand that Bitcoin is a silent weapon being fought over in the shadows and in the light.

The top-end or bottom end profits of mining are no concern to Bitcoin users. While it is a shame if they are true to Bitcoin and they feel threatened, they should also realise that businesses go bust all the time if they do not keep up with trends. They know when they risk buying mining gear to more aggressively mine against the principles of Bitcoin. Therefore they should not be surprised to find themselves on the wrong side of decentralisation goals.

It's the same method also as Mike saying Bitcoin is dead. Here is my theory: CIA does not like the idea of China getting more control over Bitcoin. Or some other reason, and before the CIA may have been pro Bitcoin. Now it's hard to believe people who were involved in the creation could Uturn so. Probably they are money motivated and on the CIA payroll. I cannot think of other reasons right now.
I don't think it's right after people are so reckless like pointed out, that people then say "Oh well Gavin/Mike did a lot for Bitcoin in the early days..." there must be good reason why they left then.

'....but Ver owns squillions of btc he wouldn't do that...' some people say in a very whiney voice may I add.

I am confused as to why anyone would run a bitcoin unlimited node or any other since these are poor copies of core. Why does Ver lie and say scaling is necessary and other lies when it is not right now at least? Why does he get so much wrong? Why does he engage in propaganda and bribery? 
To be honest I think the fact that I need to answer these questions is enough warning not to listen to him. But please, anyone who disagrees tell me.

BTW there is plenty of concrete proof. He pays bribes to increase his hashrate, he stamps his feet and threatens, he lies to the public and to everyone, he has been proven to do this over and over. Here is one example: 
Also you want more proof? He cares about more power coming to him which will be only the same as the power being with Core right now. Someone has to run the software, and I do not think a private venture capitalist who is deceitful and lies is better than the open source custodians who seem to not be motivated by money.
I don't know what else to say to you. If you don't see it you come up with arguments that show me he is doing good things in Bitcoin. How is he saving Bitcoin? I do know and I can tell and there is proof, which is why I am making this post because the idea that there is no proof that this man is a lunatic trying to steal billions of dollars and branding, is quite frankly, ridiculous!

That's right! China, Bitmain, McAfee, Ver... the list goes on... multiple connections where at the moment we see that Core developers likely do not deal in terrible drugs and prostitutes and promote dubious software for monetary gain and deceive people like McAfee and Ver. Core does not engage in propaganda, but we do have evidence of lies and falsehoods and propaganda from Ver and Co.
If you think that governments have not tried and failed already to bring down Bitcoin then you are naive/ignorant of the fact that fiat money is a huge part of the system of citizen control for the good of the 1%. This is why Bitcoin is so beautiful to me... most of us have no idea of the real score but there is a score. It could be Shadow World [2] Vs Bitcoin [10] or 55-1000 to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is winning! Let's hope we keep winning because private money definitely does not want people rejecting it and using a different money they do not control! This is fact.

It all smells so fishy and does not make sense. We at least know therefore we cannot trust Ver in any way. It seems Ver will make more money if Bitcoin crashes or if he wrestles control of it, or his other altcoins will turn more profit and control as a consequence of attacking Bitcoin. Also he could be working for anti-Bitcoin agencies or governments. Your post is great it is yet more proof the attitude and man is insane. I guess it is true he probably cannot kill Bitcoin thank god.
But Hearn rubbishing Bitcoin saying it's dead, and the quest to make Core software defunct is obvious. Gavin, Mike, and Roger want to kill Bitcoin. This is the only logical conclusion.
What are their motives? Financial? Surely they have enough money? They can short Bitcoin or wrestle control.....

I think many investors sold because they thought a fork was imminent or just too scary to contemplate. Plus they will want to sell before a dip. Plus China must be having an impact too, but this not as much, I think everyone in China is ready to buckle down if they want to stay in Bitcoin. China is so interesting; PBoC are really doing their best to try to control it over there!
I think the PBoC are kidding themselves! People will find ways around it. Probably PBoC funds BU. But why does Roger need the money or now hate BTC? His motives are crazy. Most likely: Roger feels important now. Roger likes feeling like he has friends.

Yes but there is nothing questionable about Core's actions. They have done more than what was asked of them and they have delivered more than asked too. There can be 2 sides, but for me at the moment there is only one side to chose. Other software is possible, but not necessary at the moment. BU software sounds like BS to me and I am not changing my mind. I do understand all perspectives and if it was not for Core I would not be into Bitcoin. Yes you are right everyone does have an agenda of some kind. Core keeps it professional currently. Roger Ver is the poster child for narcissism and some kind of greed and also probably stupidity. He is a brat; a small child stomping his feet and mixing with shadowy figures. 
He is definitely cohorting with China, who are all manipulating Bitcoin. If they take Bitcoin I am out. So don't try to persuade me otherwise! They are not going to take Bitcoin if I can do anything about it. I will vote with my node.

Nice idea, not going to work in that form. Propaganda can already convince more people a lie is true than fake. It would be better to validate truth by as many crossreferences of true sources as possible. i.e. If a news item has a link to a relevant real time-stamped verified document, plus 100 people from different credible places that can verify their own identity, then the facts are more likely to be real. In the end you cannot be certain what is real or fake. Only what is more likely to be fake and more likely to be real.

OK, I appreciate you answering me, I am not venting, just the writing style is direct! And I was throwing some potential ideas your way. I am massively against subscription model, I would like to see you not do that. I want to read it. I want to see it work. I appreciate if you say so, you cannot afford more than 10 journalists to start, and that you are not google! But I would not have thought you can do much with 10 journalists. I think it is better for there to be freelance journalists chosen from admitting articles. 
I was also being direct to test whether this really was you! I wanted to see your response. I see you do have bitcoin adoption on wikimedia as someone pointed out.
Fair enough -- you need funding so you are doing it this way. I would prefer to see it going in full swing but nice to see it start in the early stages. I was not talking about sources on wikitribune, not sure if you got that, but I would like to see the address on your twitter and some other way of proving the bitcoin is an official address (i.e. on your wikitribune page at least? More sources that prove you are who you say you are). I don't think you should ask for money without providing this address on wikitribune page minimum.
I hate the subscription model; it goes against the spirit of the internet. Also, sorry to assume: I thought you would have no end of backers after creating wikipedia. 
I like what you are doing and I will read and I hope I end up loving it. For now I cannot donate or take part.

I think we need UASF or something else to get rid of obvious mining problems ASAP! I agree not litecoin vs bitcoin, they are together... but I guess in my mind I am trying to evaluate whether I can invest in litecoin as well because I have none right now. If I already had litecoin like you I would not be selling it. But without having any I do not think I can buy it at this stage when I need to buy more bitcoin at the moment! I think ether is also better for making money, and possibly for payment, but more centralised. I want to invest all my money (not some!) in crypto, I am hoping for more options. At the moment with not much money to spare, I see the only option as bitcoin still.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:56:53
'Monthly supporter'? If this means subscription model you can kiss your whole project goodbye. 
Next problem: WTF: 10 journalists? Why do you not start this website without donations? You CAN afford to, it might even be free.
Next problem: is it not ironic that for a project claiming to validate sources you came on here with no sources? Then you only offer 1 source and you ask for bitcoin without a bitcoin address on your page!
You have done this incorrectly. I think people need to learn how to corroborate information without giving you money. Your site may help to bring valid information to the fore of discussion, but it will do no more than this.
Unless you change strategies, your project is doomed I think, as anything credible or more than a newsletter.

0KB blocks will still have information to transmit and will not be faster than light communication since the communication would travel at just under equal or likely much less than the speed of light. Most information is transmitted through optic cables at some point. It's all still faster than banks at 1mb. 0kb, ha you are so funny... not.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:18:10
I would have liked to buy Litecoin, and I have none at all. I would not know where to buy them or mine them. 
Now we have same ASIC problem with Litecoin and threat of bigger blocks after SW activation even if unnecessary. Jihan and his cronies said big block activation (and the guaranteed continuation of miners getting money how they want it, even to the detriment of the users/Litecoin in general) was the reason they agreed to stop 'illegal' manipulation attacking users. So SW was activated as a result of giving in to terrorists with the threat of them wanting what they want in the future?
Can I consider investing in Litecoin longterm with this being the case? I think not, and I am disappointed, I would like to. I guess it's just bitcoin and maybe ether a little...
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:18:04
This means Litecoin is worthless, unfortunately.

I am serious, just not sure about LTC but I like it. Have to be careful about what people in each coin's business represent. Values can tumble. I don't want to miss out on LTC, but I like BTC more. I appreciate the info, but 10K volume per exchange is also not enough for liquidity.

I contemplated for a while and now I am 100% in Bitcoin. I don't care if it tanks! I have had nothing before. Zero dollars and back up and down. This is my latest commitment to making money, I am so sure of the risk, but I am aware it is a risk. But I love Bitcoin and the decentralisation of money, I don't trust governments and I would rather have no money than fiat money now. Philosophically I don't want oil, war, nor fiat. I am not playing the con-man's game. Fiat money is one big pyramid scheme, and crypto and bitcoin is the only way out. I need to make money and then hopefully never convert back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:49:10
but we need open source ability to compete with miners, we can set up our own mining pools and more full nodes. This would improve things a lot. You might not be able to get much gpu bitcoin reward but at least you could get something. I am only concerned about 51% attack or other security risks from changing models. I am all for a change though the answer is out there to make it more decentralised which gpu will.

Jimmy even though you seem real, I would also like you to offer more evidence that any funds donated will go to this project, and that hackers have not compromised the accounts, since, apparently you have been heavily hacked last year. Also although I like the idea, this is all not the right way to go about it re: I agree with mentions here not to beg and you seem to only respond here mostly to questions about donating money, which is suspicious -- you are not engaging with the bitcoin reddit community like you state to want to do.
I am quite keen too for people to donate to my creative projects, but because I cannot offer proof of spend yet, nor can I convey my ideas concretely enough to value them. I will not ask to take people's money (yet at least!). You have simply come here begging without a plan yet, based on past reputation and not made efforts to comfort people with validation after it has been asked for.
You should put bitcoin payments all over your wikitribune if you come here asking for bitcoin. 
You dont even mockup how you are going to successfully do this. How about a beta test? How do we know you are not compromised in any way?
I love the idea and the passion to implement it but the proof will be in the pudding my friend, not in hype. You cannot ask for money based on wikipedia (in my opinion, I mean you should not with utmost integrity).
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:56:49
Surely any money put in LTC is better put in BTC? What about threats from Jihan and Co about future demands like bigger blocks? If you are right where do we even buy LTC? Are ASICS about to cause trouble in LTC?

You should implement smart contracts to automatically pay people and pay them in bitcoin. Donations should be handled by automation, with set rules. You suggest percentages, I think you should set this in stone and also how the changes will be made if necessary to this structure.

Is LTC in danger of manipulation without much liquidity -- it's not going to be bought around the world anytime soon is it? BTC is gaining ground much faster than LTC and LTC has been 50USD a long time ago already... I love to buy low and make money but it's too much of a risk compared to BTC at the moment for me. Perhaps I will get some on an exchange if it appears. How many active users and merchants use LTC? I wonder how fast the adoption could take. New money will most probably go in to BTC. LTC is more of a longterm bet than BTC, better buy LTC later and wait, spend now on BTC. Theories, just theories...
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:31:36
I tried to answer you question in detail! I thought I did that. In the Logs they talk about how they would like to manipulate litecoin and will do at a moments notice if they have to. They confirm they are extremely bad actors ready to mess with Litecoin, Bitcoin and SW and future progress not in their interests.
In my view while Bitcoin can handle this longterm, Litecoin cannot, thus is worthless and worth mentioning as a sidenote to the fact that ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE MENTIONED IN THE CHAT LOG AND SO I AM COMMENTING ON THE THINGS WE CAN DERIVE FROM THIS CHAT LOG. I think I posted in the right thread!
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:12:24
Litecoin is open to huge amounts of manipulation via miners, pump and dump, limited dev and community support, limited users, limited liquidity, limited support price and more. There is no-one rushing to make litecoin pos, there is no use for litecoin as a store of value either. Bitcoin can, at the moment, handle China and miner manipulation. Litecoin has so long to go before it reaches significant adoption the threat of certain dedicated manipulation on this scale cannot keep the network secure. Litecoin may well become stronger in the future, but at these risks, and the way it is set up is not the same and as secure as Bitcoin (mostly in numbers) why would anyone buy litecoin (except to trade) when you can buy bitcoin?
Litecoin's value hovers around $10-whatever, it can crash to $1 in an hour, and there will be this certain evidence as well as factors we do not know that can cause it. Litecoin does serve as a fantastic testbed for bitcoin, and it has helped us see extra evidence of bad actors here, for example, which is very useful to the bitcoin community, to corroborate what we have seen with SW resistance. 
Litecoin, at least now and in the near future is worth less than $1. Very useful to be around, but not worth anything.
I invest in bitcoin to use as currency and store of value in the future (hopefully to never convert to fiat), and Litecoin is not a safe store of value for savings.

@_date: 2017-05-24 23:40:52
I've been saying for so long that ether has much more unrealised potential than actual value. Its not dissing the ethereum concept to say so. There are a lot of people not thinking straight or at all. Money is coming in blindly to all cryptos mass FOMO. Microsoft and the alliances pump the coin everytime a new company partners but until finished projects appear its all hype from a coin with unlimited currently centralised supply. The ico mentioned are mostly hot air and saying most businesses fail does not give them value. Having made some of the crappiest software on earth �� microsoft are suddenly supposed to be cypher punks with a bitcoin widget in excel. Ether is not a currency yet and not a good store of value ever. Ltc should be worth 200. Other shitecoins are in bubbles but the money in crypto as a whole is well intended investment just no newbies are actually researching or thinking

No one can answer but the questions are valid. It would be more accurate to guess than sample. I jave also thougjt about this as I am sure many have. Of course if btc hits a final ath of 1 million it will drop massively and cause some panic but it would swing back and eventually stabilise for a long time. But we cant be sure. It will be important to have others like ltc and more for this and other reasons

True. I was just saying I disagree about there being other interesting cryptos. Only btc and maybe ltc have the qualities you praise and thats what its all about. Yes there will be many more good cryptos but currently only 2 exist as fair and decentralised enough, with enough liquidity to be worth valuing. And my language is colourful not acidic. Ether conning people is acidic 
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:18:51
There is growing evidence of shills and a bigger plan to remove users and value from btc and even ltc. This could just end up making bitcoin stronger though. The toxic stuff is often a red flag just like BU shills.

And uasf will still be like diving into freezing water on a hot day -- a shock at first (to many innocent users) but nice in the end and worth it. But i still wonder what it will do to user uptake and price. I cant afford to lose money i might have to play it safe and buy back in but more importantly i want bitcoin to live on more decentralised. But what about asic boost is it still there? And have they got it on ltc too?
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:00:09
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:41:03
Even if this is gospel (which i think in the statement there he says 'if' so its relative) technically uasf is in bitcoin spirit snd not a redefinition it is the definition of standing up to centralised actors and for decentralised users
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:33:19
You are not hated dude but you not getting that its not a compromise to make btc not free. You dont compromise with cunts and these guys are not honest people they are cunts trying to ruin bitcoin and then you cant undo the destruction of years if work. Thats gonna piss some people off surely ypu get that? If not go and learn why somehow

You are confidently ahead of time my friend we will do pur best lwts try to make wealth to play the game and beat them thats all we can do. Yeah cause they cant buy all the btc they are using eth to try to kill it but there is high chance it will backfire! If not now by next gen

People invest in ether to make a buck and the drivers of this investment think they missed btc and need to get rich another way. This attitude shows complete misunderstanding of these products by a large group of investors! I bought eth but then HAD to sell because i cant hold a product thats become overbought and misunderstood! People think a pyramid scheme type fast rise vindicates a false sense of worth! I think people don't understand centralisation and control and currency and greed. Since when did cheaper mean better. With ether the value of any savings use can go way down. Btc can increase even slowly forever. Bitcoin is designed to be currency ether is like said here a platform with overlapping use cases for sure. Its great to make money but this is not THE purpose of crypto. The purpose is freedom, decentralisation not speculation.

Explain how eth or etc that can go down more easily is safer? Explian how the code is more secure! Explain how its cheaper? Explain how centralised servers and control are better? Explain how eth/etc with tokens given to people first before release makes a fair currency?

me too but any time in the next 10 years might be the wrong time! I have some left, but I don't regret I put them in LTC because I dont want to lose 1/2 my value in the UASF.

But ether is imho a premined iso token creating inflationary centralised insecure unproven vulnerable corrupt  shitecoin
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:53:08
It has done nothing so far by the way. Very potentially overvalued at least currently. Non fixed supply and not set out with good ethics nor with genius code for a currency. Its not a currency which people invest in it for. Where are the smart contracts even? Have you looked at All the rubbish applications there are? Its all hype to take your money its the king of ico scams just like most IPOs where its a platform to create unlimited scam token bull ICOs by paying them. Without any useful apps its like an ICO IPO Scamcoin pyramid scheme

@_date: 2017-05-28 10:59:46
They cant kill btc i reckon they will lose but people with ether soon realise and it will crash as they have to do something eventually! Just fight the good fight like you are doing and we see. What they want in ether is to get rich thats most scams selling point! If people are greedy thats their problem but they may flip to ltc yet which is yet another fantastic use case for ltc to now help btc and they both live happily ever after 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:48:45
Why cant you get that compromise here would mean bitcoin is dead as soon as you do?

Not really segwit on ltc is the real deal, the miners did not care to push stress like they care more about btc. If this all implodes we will have to lose all our money and build a new fair true decentralised coin
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:31:05
I dont think so i think if you were a new investor ripped off you would possibly be put off crypto and bitcoin for life. Any investor would be better placing funds in an established reputable company or project. This is money permanently out of the investors pocket stolen. No good for btc or anyone! Don't justify any scam!  
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:44:44
Plus, you know, the fact that it's a premined ico, remotely delete-able, pumped scam where the best dapps are worse than Microsoft dos.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:00:21
Thats fine cause you blows bubbles and you dont know difference between correction and a bubble. Whatever. I think btc is great and you think its not and worth less and ypu so thick ypu don't understand of the price goes up higher than before that means no bubble as its because, in my opinion, btc way undervalued
