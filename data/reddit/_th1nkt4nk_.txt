Cool, nice little fella!

We need to buy BTC because is a good way for making transactions directly between us without a third party, and not for speculation. And because is good to have a decentralized currency. Simple as that! Love BTC, even if it goes down up or to the sides Lol... :-)

If people don't see he's a fraud just watching his youtube ads then, they are in deep trouble.
