Did you at least learn a valuable lesson?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:58
Sure, but buying your kid some bitcoin is a great way to get them started learning about cryptocurrency, which is undoubtably the future of money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:51:07
I'm a bit out of the loop too (I'm new to crypto) but he's a guy who's been writing and talking about bitcoin for years apparently. I'm watching his [playlist of Bitcoin for beginners]( right now and he has a fantastic way of explaining everything.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:22:22
Yeah, whether we like it or not, the same thing is probably going to happen to most of us as well. Fluid intelligence peaks in adolescence and starts declining progressively starting around 30-40 years old. The older that we get, the more set in our ways we get and the harder it is for us to really change our learn quite as much. My dad knows how to use a computer, but he'll never be able to become as proficient as I am (despite the fact that he loves computers) simply because I grew up learning about them and he started later in life. Same sort of logic goes for opinions/personalities.

@_date: 2017-12-04 14:22:38
Why is that a bad idea? Aside from the obvious "people know you have a lot of money and you're a target," which is a pretty silly excuse seeing how easy it is to secure a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:00:56


You really think it's okay for the government to hold hostage a basic human right (open, uncensored internet) for political payback?


Never mind, if you're this deluded there's really no point in arguing with you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:06
Right? What kind of advice is that? It's literally the sunk-cost fallacy. If you get into something and really don't like the way things are going, just get out asap and cut your losses. If you put in more than you could afford hoping to make a bit of money and it starts doing poorly, just get out before you lose too much.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:54:12
Absolutely, going to "x.com" when you want to find out about "x" is an absolutely awful idea. But non-tech people don't care about the address as long as they get something related to what they're trying to find, which is one of the main problems. They're basically squatting on that domain so that they can mislead people into buying into their bitcoin cash scam.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:38:01
That's exactly my point - supervise and teach them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:46:56
Well no shit, people are making money off of it and they're US citizens so of course they're going to tax it.

Where do you think the meteoric rise in price over the last year has come from? Average Joes? No, it probably came from big players, because they're the ones with a lot of money.

They theoretically could, but they haven't shown that they have any interest in doing so. Coinbase did yesterday. Why would anyone use Coinbase at this point rather than another exchange after they did something like this?

That's awesome! I wish I had saved up money when I was a teen, let alone invest it. I'm 22 and I just put $50 in bitcoin the other day (basically all my savings at the moment.) Cheers!

From what I've read about it, I'm under the impression that it's more like a relay network like Tor, which would make it inherently decentralized because anybody can make their own node and continue to build out the network without the program focusing more communications on certain nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:27:44
One of the top google results for it says it was made not by a historian but a random guy on the internet, and provides [a full debunking of it]( so I think I'll stick with that as well as what I've learned in years of personal and formal education, and keep my tinfoil hat off.

You sound way more worried than basically anybody else, you should probably just pull out now if you haven't already and then come back in in a month or whenever it starts to balance back to whatever "normal" is for us. Save yourself the stress.

He lost $100, from the way he's bitching about it you'd think he lost an entire Bitcoin or some shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:44:01


The vast majority of people (myself included) do not associate ".com" with "company." Just because it was originally intended to only be used by commercial organizations (that's where the abbreviation "com" comes from btw, not "company"), it hasn't been that way since the mid-90s and definitely isn't thought of that way in the collective public consciousness.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:59:46
Shit, that's genius.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:13:26


Yeaaahhh, no. It means it might be a bit more stable and grow faster than some other cryptos, but major companies definitely do not instill faith in long-term prospects.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:52:59
Why? Steam dropped bitcoin for a very good reason - for many transactions, by the time they actually went through, the value of Bitcoin had fluctuated so much that they weren't getting the correct amount of USD for the purchases. This problem will be solved by LN.

I mean, they literally launched a testnet that works very well like a week ago or so and they said with the progress they're making it'll probably be out next year. Crypto isn't going anywhere, there's no rush. Bitcoin is special among cryptos because it has the luxury of the creator being completely unknown, and thus is controlled by no single person, only the blockchain. Obviously it has its problems, especially since the lack of organization makes it harder for everyone to come to a consensus, but those problems can be fixed 
or at least patched over by stuff like LN and next year looks very hopeful.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:12:00


But Roger Ver said that he didn't become a bitcoin millionaire and that makes him a bad person!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:56
BCH is also controlled by people who want to use the name "Bitcoin" in order to profit off of it, and it's not decentralized. So go ahead if you think they'll manage to kill Bitcoin, but if you want to see the ideology behind Bitcoin succeed, you won't see it with BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:00:16
Jesus christ, are you serious? The person you replied to was talking about Bitcoin. You replied with a question that is clearly in reference to Bitcoin as a product, even if you didn't mention it. If you were just randomly commenting in a Bitcoin subreddit replying to a post about Bitcoin just wondering if there's ever been a product like that, then sure, you're right. But then you're also going randomly off-topic, and your comment would be pointless anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:54:53

That's not true at all, kids should start learning about investing and finances at a relatively young age, when they're old enough to grasp the basic concepts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:47:11
If that were really true, net neutrality wouldn't have been killed the other day and our government wouldn't be incredibly clueless regarding any sort of modern technology or science, because nerds would be lobbying as much as the people who are anti-science. Some nerds might be a bit wealthy from doing engineering and computer science, but the ultra-rich (and the ones who realistically control our government) are definitely not people who have the interests of nerds like us in mind.

Apple Pay is more complex than just scanning a QR code, you need speciallized equipment on both ends for that. For this you only need a QR reader and a QR creator, and you don't have to be in a certain proximity.

How the fuck is that assuming I know what people are thinking? If Bitcoin went to zero at any point, anybody who decided to hold is fucked, that's indisputable. In that guy's comment, he set up a hypothetical future where Bitcoin is widely adopted. His argument completely leans on that assumption.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:17:58


You're really showing that you have no understanding of basic economics here... They did this because the more incentives there are to save, the less money people spend, and generally if people stop spending as much money, the economy doesn't do nearly as well as if there was more spending. That's why they have interest rates and all that stuff set by the Fed, because individuals in general don't have the foresight to think about the bigger picture of the economy, we just want to make more money. Obviously they're not perfect either, but the notion that "saving is punished" just so that The Man can make a quick buck is foolish.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:44:02


I agree with this fully, but I don't think that's what the guy I replied to was talking about. Seems to me like he was just ignorantly blaming the big banks for everything like tons of people on crypto subs do.

@_date: 2018-03-21 20:47:45
The problem with "more saving=more future consumption" is that you're assuming that Bitcoin will definitely take off and gain mainstream adoption, which isn't 100% guaranteed. I think it has a decent chance of doing so, but it's not going to do that if nobody uses it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:08:50

Apple Watch is not a failure by any means. Google Glass was just a beta for a product that never ended up getting made. There are other, more promising "smart glasses" [\(this one specifically looks really fucking cool imo\)]( that use newer tech (remember, Google Glass was FIVE years ago) that plan on doing something similar but better.

I understand that the current system is flawed and full of greed, nowhere did I argue that. However, I believe that the Fed was set up with good intentions, as many things are. The early 1900s had a bunch of huge financial panics and people were scared. If things had kept going the way they had been going, the economy probably would have just collapsed altogether. The Fed was set up to mitigate risk and alleviate crises like that, not just to fuck over everyone in the name of money like you were implying.

Ehhh... porn is arguably what made the current trend of cheap phone-based VR viable. I remember the first time I tried one of those, just some random audiovisual "experience" or something, I wasn't amazed, but after trying porn on one? Hell, I bought a Vive shortly after that when they were released because VR porn is so awesome. It's miles better on the Vive. It might not be *the* reason that modern VR is popular, like it was for VHS and DVDs, but it's definitely a *huge* factor. I believe it'll be the same way with crypto - someone will set up a cam site that uses a cryptocurrency as their tipping token and it'll generate a lot of attention.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:35:35
Yep. Once US lawmakers start seeing the dollar signs, they won't want to touch it because of the potential taxes it could bring in. I just read that [in 2017, South Korean exchanges alone made $648 million]( and SK taxed it at about 24%! $155m in tax revenue just from exchanges, not to mention capital gains etc. The US government is basically wasting money by not legislating crypto.

I wouldn't even be surprised if somehow, porn is the industry to revolutionize crypto or make it mainstream. Hell, camming websites already have "tokens" that would make much more sense as a crypto of some kind.
