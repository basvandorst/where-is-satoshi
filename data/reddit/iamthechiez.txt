i was told this was a cold storage wallet for gox; its not so much the transaction size than the fact that it's empty. apologize if it seemed i was attempting to spread fud; i feel strongly about things like this and assure you this isnt the case. 
disclaimer: i hold no mt gox btc, nor do i intend to own any. and i need the price of btc to rise; i live all btc and have rent coming up pretty soon. FUD affects my survival/net valuation

Got my payout! everything went pretty smoothly, and the price jumped from .069 ltc at buy in to .073 (still holding). 
I'm quite satisfied; I'd highly recommend this service

I mean, I know current market rates wont let me ROI on GHs; ppl trade cex for the speculative value. I'm asking if the SCRYPT hashing of LTC (totally different difficulty situation) is profitable at the offered rates. They charge fees, so I kind of do see the merit in pre-selling something that may or may not make roi in order to assure roi (in response to them being more profitable self mining)

lol, why was this downvoted?

went ahead and took the plunge, all mining profits are 0% variance (they give you the calculated amount, not actual pool performance). not too shabby, but it doesnt have the merged mining that cex has (for the difference in price on GHs, I could care less)
