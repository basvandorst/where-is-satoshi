Yes, I'm well aware of the reference.

All BS
Someone logged into the Silk Road forum after Ross was arrested but before the feds shut the forum down? Someone like, say, federal investigators in possession of Ross's laptop and information stored on it? Information that allowed them to access and shut down the Silk Road servers?
Ross refusing to provide the answer to a challenge question that would incriminate him if he answered? Smart.
Ross Ulbright ran Silk Road. Even if there were "other DPRs", all that means is there's a bigger criminal conspiracy. "There were other DPRs, therefore Ross is innocent" doesn't follow.

You are confused. You didn't "turn your bitcoins into Etherum [sic]" by sending it to an "Etherum [sic] wallet". That's not possible. There is no one piece of software named "Etherum [sic] Wallet" either, that is a description.
What you did was unknowingly use a service called Freewallet that, behind the scenes, sells your Bitcoins and buys Etherium, minus an exchange fee. You will have to buy Bitcoins again by selling the Etherium.
Honestly, you should not be messing with cryptocurrency until you do more research and learn exactly how things work and what you are doing. Downloading random pieces of software that show up in search results without knowing what they do is extremely dangerous and will lead you to losing all your money.

Day trader definition from the article:
"The purchasing and selling or the selling and purchasing of the same security on the same day **in a margin account.**"
OP needs to read the entire thing. A margin account is funded from money borrowed from the brokerage. Perhaps OP can explain how this or any other part of the article applies to Coinbase, or the majority of Bitcoin users.
