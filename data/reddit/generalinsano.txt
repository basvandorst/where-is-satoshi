What does it mean concealing? Just not paying taxes?
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:17:13
Something like that...the only real security measure that I know of is 2 factor

Mine does a maintenance fee that gets automatically waived within a few hours (I've since forgotten the amount)

I know I've put a lot of my money into btc since I've started, but as we've passed the $2-300 mark I've pretty much cut down on my spending (don't have much to start with) but since then I've gotten back my initial investment and if I lost it I'd be seriously bummed but there are *always* other investment opportunities.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:14:44
Someone listed a bunch of btc for $320ish and nobody could get past until all of the posted btc were sold (essentially keeping the price from going up)
Will explain better when I get to bigger screen

I'm not too sure having multi sig will be too much of an issue once you have enough users as the time between one user would overlap with others

Sheep marketplace came in as silkroad v1 shut down and offered to fill the gap... and for a while they did but then they disappeared along with all the coins claiming they had been stolen
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:59:12
This is what I was thinking, that in maybe(though this thinking was when it was at the $8 mark) 20 years I'd have accumulated enough btc to retire early...I should've gone all out sooner but as they say hindsight is 20/20

Ah, I thought it was something similar to a heart arrhythmia. On the dehydration front I always have lots of water handy ;)
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:19:16
I think this may cover how quite a few people felt about what happened, at least this is how I feel.

"My autistic Swedish girlfriend painted this gem of our cat"
I think this was once an actual title for something in @_date: 2014-05-23 20:32:35
That's quite the tip :o

When bitfloor shut down I didn't expect to get any of my cash back from my account but sure enough after a while I did in fact get back all of my money back.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:18:27
Even though US bank told me no, they have yet to do anything about it (over a year now)
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:36:03
At this point I've pretty much convinced myself that those were the coins that o bought at $20...yup lost $80
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:38:37
Am I the only person who has had no problems with mt gox?
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:40:10
My coins weren't the problem it was the usd, which I got by bank transfer

This may be one drug I may never take(though I'd like to)
Due to possible heart problems (I haven't had any but there is a family history)
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:45:16
same, I've even checked my spam email...maybe the leak is from somewhere else?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:37:50
She even looked really happy for what she did while on the today show
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:46:08
Welp at least I lost 4 btc instead of the lions share :(
I couldn't withdraw my btc due ti verification

Regardless when a gain has been made whether by a trade or sale taxes have to be paid (25%)

I'm not sure for anyone else but when I asked my bank about bitcoin they didn't support it but they had bigger fish to fry/I don't buy enough to care
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:10:16
Its because its super edgy cutting edge technology
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:37:35
What makes this worse is that it seems like the "reporter" seems 100% unrepentant that she just threw someone's life into turmoil 
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:20:35
It's not corruption if it's legal /s
@_date: 2015-08-12 02:32:04
Considering that some of the holdouts were swayed by $4000 I'd say it's possible 
@_date: 2012-11-02 14:21:31
So true...maybe I got carried away by the promo
@_date: 2012-11-01 03:25:06
Phone != Mining source
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:16:16
Why not a qr code since it ours relatively easy to use with mtgox and it can't be read as easily as a rfid chip also with a qrcode it is cheaper to make said card
@_date: 2012-11-27 01:38:37
also everyone in their forums knows it is a scam...it is often shown as an example of an obvious one at that
@_date: 2012-11-01 03:57:20
Thanks for the info...it's about timeI added more money into my account anyway
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:07:34
I may start using etsy again as a buyer and seller
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:37:57
That promotional video was quite amazing, can't wait for them to release an official card. Also they mentioned the card would cost between $10-25(considering what good getting it's quite a steal)
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:27:32
My only gripe with the digital payment is that it takes on average 3 days to process on a weekday 
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:14:44
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:48:38
It seems to be hit or miss with packages arriving within a few days to a month
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:32:31
Cool, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:08:56
This is pretty rad, something to definitely follow
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:23:17
It didn't work for a while but they discontinued it in preference for credit card :/
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:45:15
How many commands are attached to the bot? The last ice seen was just a simple tip and now its beers and whatnot. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:04:20
Generally a few days
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:53:40
Its possible to forge weld a code...though if it would be readable(not sure on how much you can deform a code while retaining data) 
Etching on the other hand is super easy
Edit: look at some of ed caffrey's damascus work. The drawing and twisting is only to tighten patterns for a better mix of metal. You could have an edge of d2 with a back of 1080 to the same effect
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:36:33
At first I was pissed, until I remembered what happened last year when the price went from $16 to $8 within an hour... good things come to those that wait ( and are proactive about the lulls)
@_date: 2013-07-08 21:34:32
I've always used coinbase when I want to cash some btc when I'm in need of cash
@_date: 2013-01-01 15:32:20
If there is a Wal-Mart near you try using their transfer service as it only takes a few minutes
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:02:39
Probably not as I bought one in april and my order is still processing
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:55:15
Plenty of demand here...too bad my only outlet is through coinbase which keeps telling me that they are out for 24 hours
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:09:55
Ah, I had forgotten about the hacking...I hope they can at some point get their stolen coins back or at least reimbursed (though when the coins, if memory serves were worth $20 at the time)
I wonder if there is a way to figure out which ones were srolen and which were legitimately transferred.

Will an android app be planned for in the future? 
I do all of my bitcoin activities on my phone
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:00:33
Could you store btc in ypur armory wallet if your main wallet source was your phone (send coins from phone or other source to secure computer[only deposit])
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:12:09
I hope not, otherwise he is being awfully stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:32:13
I'm going to buy one next week when I get my paycheck... I've never mined before so this will be interesting
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:09:57
What about those of us who did the cash deposit?
@_date: 2013-01-25 12:50:43
I really like bitinstant since I use less than $300 at a time and it shows up as cash in my mtgox account. Though coinbase looks like a pretty nice alternative 
@_date: 2013-07-10 03:51:24
I'm halfway thinking of giving them the ultimatum of either giving me my single order of 1 jalapeno or to return my money...which is sad as I wanted to try them out
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:25:41
I feel as if I forget about my order it might arrive sooner
@_date: 2013-02-02 12:41:59
I just found coinbase a while ago and it is super easy to buy btc from them
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:21:04
For what?
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:48:57
I say we go bigger and make a 2 mile one using a few people per square to reduce crowd size
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:39:37
Bank of America
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:20:45
Because they are in the middle of doing a massive overhaul on their servers which could take up to a month
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:29:16
I still have yet to get my email from them
$299 trapped in my account
And as a further kick, coinbase is working for me again &gt;:(
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:15:16
How do you creat a bot to trade? The most I've been using(until the update broke the app) was using the mt gox trade scheduler
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:41:50
I still have yet to get any response from the emails I have sent them
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:47:16
Shit, that's what I paid for mine and its still the 5ghz
@_date: 2013-08-17 12:28:39
To all those who didn't get their btc back there was a fairly large window to withdraw your btc after the shutdown, I got all of my btc back 3 days after the shutdown
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:36:05
Or plywood/tarp
@_date: 2013-01-24 14:20:50
I remember thinking it was awesome that I bought 19 btc when other was at $10 when it rose to $15 then within an hour it dropped to $8
@_date: 2013-07-10 11:35:33
I'm more of hoping it will light a fire  under their ass to hurry up
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:06:01
Then why would he sell his btc?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:14:43
Same, though I am in it for the long haul as I know one day btc will reach $1,000 and when that day comes I will be glad I invested early no matter whether $0 or $999
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:28:39
Coinbase is my favorite so far (even though it takes a while)
