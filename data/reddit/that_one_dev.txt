Like the other guy said, it is because of crypto mining but not because of Bitcoin mining. 
Alt coins can be mined with gpus, not Bitcoin

Bitcoin miners don't use GPUs lol. They aren't the reason building a gaming PC is so expensive
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:21:51
That's not a good idea tbh
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:58:15
What makes you say that
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:59:03
Pretty much sums up this entire sub
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:45:52
The OP actually said "Unvalued" not "Undervalued" I read it the same way at first. I think they made a typo though idk

Paying for rent is not at all indentured servitude. Look it up.

Post this to for free karma
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:04:38
So you have no evidence they sold out?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:31:15
If you can get out now without losing a ton of money, get out. You should have never invested that money in the first place if it was so important. Take it out right now and if you want to leave an appropriate amount invested

u wot m8
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:52:53
Read the definition of indentured servant. I don't work for my landlord. I just pay them money
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:15:16
It means it has no value
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:25:47
How do you know where the bottom is. You don't
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:40:27
Are you saying you own absolutely 0 real currency? Bitcoin is a gamble no matter how you put it. Putting everything you have is a dangerous game
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:30:01
He already does by paying taxes lol

What I was responding to: 


How is that 23,200?

This sub just gives me anxiety lol. No one really knows what's gonna happen so I'm just gonna hodl until I feel like it. Peace out

It'd probably take a longgg time period of consistent bit coin growth for them to beat out zuck. 
Bitcoin would have to continue to increase and also increase faster than Zuck is getting money. Zuckerberg is making a fuck load of money everyday. Worth over 70 billion now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:25:01
I think that's more accurate too. $3.80 per pizza.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:34:22
Well you were absolutely wrong. Just shows that no one knows what the price is going to do.

It's a Christmas miracle

How does Bitcoin prevent inflation?

Were you trying to post a link or something? 
Whatever ur preaching sounds like a scam anyway
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:12:00
Ah makes sense. I always used my bank account
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:02:40
No one really knows lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:24:06
Cause it's a company... It's like saying I'm the CEO of Reddit or I'm the CEO of Facebook. 
Both of them have CEOs and they're both websites
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:22:04
The way I think about it is that you made a good and fair decision not to buy bulk amounts all those years ago. 
There is absolutely no way you could have known it would reach 19k a coin. Making the decision to dump a ton of money into the currency back then would've been an insane idea. Yes it would've paid out but it still would've been a bad idea with the knowledge you had at the time.
Yea it would've been nice to at least have 5 coins or something but you probably would've sold them earlier because you had no idea it would keep going up.
There is just too much uncertainty to beat yourself up for not buying in. You made a fair decision with the knowledge you had at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:22:54
We hit over19k a few days ago then it settled back down
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:23:09
I don't understand. I bought $600 worth of Bitcoin with a total fee of about $6. How on Earth would a fee get up to $232?
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:28:03
I'd assume they'd take that into account with interest
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:54:00
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:26:11
You seriously want to ban someone got saying not to buy?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:13:49
No, they're saying the next 3 months will be March, April, then May. I think they might be right here honestly
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:52:29
The common adage is "Time in the market beats timing the market". That's kinda true with Bitcoin but not really. 
If you timed your buy to buy a few weeks ago when it hit 6k you'd have almost double your investment. The same can't be said about really any other market
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:10:40
Do you mean track the price of them?
