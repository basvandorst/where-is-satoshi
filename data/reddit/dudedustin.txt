When you credit card was taken — the money was still 100% gone. It just wasn’t you who lost it.
The loss was charged to the merchant the thief went to.

Huh? Merchants are not “averaging out” loses “in a way that’s similar.”
The merchant that gets stolen from loses the money. There’s no averaging of anything. There’s no insurance of anything.

What you’re describing is prices going down. Let’s make it tangible — TVs, microwaves, and coffee makers have gotten mind boggling cheap. Let’s say they used to sell 10 units at $10 each. Now they’re selling 100 units at $1 each.
Has the market collapsed? Has the economy tanked?
The result of these changes is everyone can afford these items, even the poor.
If someone borrowed money on the assumption TVs, microwaves, and coffee makers would stay stabile in price — that’s called a bad loan. Hoping inflation will save you from your bad loan is your own mistake. One individual’s poor decision should not and does not destroy a healthy economy.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:25:51
“A lot of inflation is bad but some is good” is a weak argument.

In the USA people are supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A preponderance of evidence is not enough to legally convict anyone of a crime.

Responding to your comments in reverse order:
Deflation can happen during an economic downtown. This is a correlation. Conflating it with causation is flimsy at best and wrong at worst.
Said simply: recession causes deflation but deflation does not cause recession.
Venezuela, post WW1 Germany are two obvious examples. Roman coin is a fun historical one. Examples of inflation destroying economies are everywhere — somehow I doubt this is your question? Try phrasing it differently. In case you’re asking it in earnest here is a list of cases where inflation destroyed economies:
Rome, Austria, China, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Philippines, British Malaya, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.
If investors believe a currency will increase in value more by holding it than loaning it out than those investors won’t loan it out. Practice has shown such a bet to be quite a foolish one however, and for this to halt lending all investors will have to believe this. If that’s the case a bubble will ensue and the belief will prove itself wrong.
In practical reality you’re not going to get all investors to never invest in bonds. Some will suspect the currency cannot continue growing in value, others will be hedging their bets.
Either way there will probably always be a lending market. If people believe the currency will increase in value interest rates will go down to reflect that change in supply / demand for loans.

Your argument is flawed. I will use the same style exactly back on you.

3. Ya definitely.
1 &amp; 2. Long ago (before bitcoin) someone invented a mathematical formula that took an input “x” and produced a totally random 32 digit number. People were surprised how random the number was — for any input of “x” no one could guess what the 32 digit number was without using the formula itself!
This algorithm was called ‘SHA’.
Bitcoin uses SHA by making “x” be every single transaction in the last ten minutes. This “x” input is pretty big and is essentially always different.
Now every so often but very rarely, SHA will produce a 31 digit number because the first digit is just a 0. Even MORE rarely it makes a 30 digit number, and so on.
Bitcoin requires a certain number of 0s in the output of the SHA. The number of 0s required is called the ‘difficulty index’ and adjusts automatically every two weeks to how many people are computing these SHA’s.

They sure sound pretty narrow! You’re holding the easy economic principal that doesn’t require much thought. Sure it’s a common thought but that doesn’t make it correct.
For one, the gold standard was not left for that reason lol. A bit ludicrous to think so. It was left so politicians could get access that juicy inflation funding with thinly veiled excuses like saving us from ourselves.
For two, we’ve never had a deflationary currency on the supply side. Recessions cause people to hoard money, increasing its value. But that’s an effect not a cause. Don’t confuse the symptom for the disease.
Gold, fiat currency, heck even bitcoin are all actually inflationary. In a half or full decade or so we’ll get to see the first effectively non-inflationary currency in history.

The leaving of the gold standard happened over decades and many presidents. FDR made the largest jump away from it when he confiscated everyone’s gold. Managed to drop the value of the currency by something like 90%.
FDR made his purpose pretty clear. He was trying to save us from ourselves. Did it basically the first few days in office.
If somehow he had another meaning that he didn’t say “because it made poor money” that would be pretty weird. I mean politicians lie all the time but what would you base that particular lie on?

“This is more private than most other SPV implementations, which basically just tell full nodes "These are all my user's addresses, can you send me any blocks that have those addresses in them?"”
This is not quite right. They say “give me the transactions, with proof they are in a block.” Which is tremendously less bandwidth than sending the entire block as BIP157 requires.
BIP157 is around the order of 1000x more bandwidth than bloom filters and it’s important we all recognize that.

There used to be decentralized currency in the US during the free banking era. The US government created the secret service to enforce the ban on them and enshrine the US dollar as the sole currency.

It sounds like you’re misunderstanding lightning.

Every transaction can be verified by publishing it to the blockchain (and paying the associated fee).

Mining today as a whole does about 30 billion trillion hashes every ten minutes. If you had 3% of the world’s hashing power that’s still a billion trillion hashes per ten minutes — divide by 2048, divide by ten minutes and you’re roughly at 50,000 trillion combinations checked per minute.
A 10 digit password consisting of mixed case letters would have 52^10 combinations, or roughly 150,000 trillion combinations.
Now obviously miners today aren’t doing PBKDF2 HMAC SHA512 — so you have some security by obscurity there. But if these rough calculations are correct, then:
3% of mining equipment could crack your 10 digit passcode in 3 minutes. If your password was all lower case, they could crack it in 0.08 seconds.
Getting 3% of mining equipment would be relatively trivial in the future since the hardware deprecates to nearly free after a few years.

Honestly this is on the conservative side. If paper money (and its electronic equivalent) collapsed, the $20T to $70T value of the currency market (depending on how you count it) would need to go somewhere.
If it goes into Bitcoin, than Bitcoin’s market cap would go from $70B (today) to $20T to $70T. That’s roughly $1M to $4M per Bitcoin.
Obviously that’s in today’s money. In such an event paper money would inflate to nothing like Zimbabwe. So along the way we’d see things like a trillion trillion dollars per Bitcoin.

Payments are routed through multiple hubs to the recipient much like the internet. So you open a channel with a nearby hub and tell it where you’d like funds to go. Using the least number of hops your payment goes through as many channels as needed to get where it’s going.
You only open a channel up with a hub, like say comcast internet. With that one hub you have access to send and receive payments to everyone, just like how Comcast gives you access to everything on the internet.
You don’t make an internet subscription for every website you connect to and you don’t make channels for every person you want to pay.

Applying fictitious reasoning to those who might disagree with you is a great recipe to stay ignorant. You can justify any position at all with such an attitude — and you’ll continually have your head in the sand.

It’s an attempt to create a virtual money by 1) not allowing anyone to artificially increase their balance (without someone else decreasing theirs), and, 2) not allowing anyone to “undo” transactions after they’ve been committed.
It’s believed that if you can solve these two problems you have what is needed for a virtual money. Bitcoin is the first currency to solve these two problems without needing to trust some third party like a bank or government.
While there is no guarantee Bitcoin’s solution to these two problems is perfect — it has worked successfully for ten years now without a hitch.

Hi artof\_bug, thanks for reading the white paper!  
\&gt; "For example Coldcard HW users, if they follow instructions on generating the entropy with dice throws are immune against your attack."  
Unfortunately a hijacked device could pretend to accept your dice roles and ignore them. Since you're relying on the device to do your cryptographic calculations there isn't a practical way to verify the dice roles are used.  
\&gt; Of course most users do trust RNG and do not come with externally created seed, but it's a simple solution. You are right though that you still have a problem of knowing the external entropy was used, but that's making the attack much more complex than just RNG infection, which is somewhat simple.  
Good points! KoinKeep makes doing this approach super easy -- in fact it's the default mode.  
\&gt; Another example of non-vulnerable approach is the passphrase used in e.g. Trezor wallet.  
Passphrases are a great idea! It adds supply chain attack resistance for sure. Two things to consider when using this approach:  
1) The passphrase must be long enough that it can't be guessed  
2) The hardware wallet must never be used until it is used once withdrawing all funds. After that point the key must be considered tainted and never used again.  
This second point is because of the "chosen nonce attack." A hijacked hardware device can actually hide your private key inside of another signature. Here's a good primer to get you started on chosen nonce attacks: [  
\&gt; You have not described construction of this key, nor how the wallet is using its private key etc. That's important.  
A good point. The white paper doesn't go into detail on this subject but it is quite interesting.  
By using on-chain 2FA you're able to "stake" on unrelated supply chains in a way that can only increases security. Throw a key on the iPhone supply chain for instance, or Android. You could even do both, adding as many as you like. Each that you add increases your security. The attacker must infiltrate all of these supply chains to succeed and using existing large supply chains makes the attacker's task much more difficult.
In reality the key can be made anywhere as long as it's a different enough supply chain from the hardware.

The main value of running your own full node is increased privacy. Other nodes can see what transactions you request -- since a full node downloads \*all\* transactions, there's no way for snooping nodes to guess which ones are yours based of your download behavior.  
Uploading transactions however, is the same. It may actually be less private since nodes are often setup on static IPs. Running a full node through tor is probably the best way increase your privacy today.

Any block explorer worth its salt will show this easily. Let's take a recent block from [chain.so]( [
If you scroll down to the list of transactions, the first one says "newly generated coins." Other explorers will call this the "coinbase" transaction (not to be confused with the company that named itself after this concept). Here it is for the block we just talked about:  
[  
If you look at the output result, you can see this got sent out to \*a lot\* of addresses:  
[ (takes a while to load cause it's so many)  
This is surely a mining pool paying out to the participants in the pool. A quick scan shows some of these address are p2pkh, some are p2sh, and a couple are p2wpkh. Following them further would be a ton of work cause there's so many. But knock yourself if you're into that kind of thing.

AFAIK every crypto currency uses elliptic curves. All but one use the secp256k1 elliptic curve.
Monero is the only weird one. While still using elliptic curves, it uses the “Curve25519” elliptic curve.
Edit: Thinking about this for a moment, what else could a hypothetical crypto use BESIDES elliptic curves? They have the best key size to security ratio.
If you used say RSA, you would need HUGE block sizes to the point it wouldn’t be practical as a crypto currency at all.

“The private key is saved in your phone's secure enclave and backed up using Casa's existing secure backup method”
These two things are literally impossible on iOS. The Secure Enclave can never be read — that’s the whole point of it.
Following the link however the CTO specifically clarifies the key is NOT saved in the Secure Enclave. I guess the author of this blog post is trying to simplify for readers or they themselves don’t understand.
“Once the seed phrase is generated, we store it locally on the device by leveraging the secure enclave. When storing with the secure enclave, the seed phrase isn't actually stored inside of the secure enclave. Rather, a private key is generated in the secure enclave. We then encrypt the seed phrase with that new key and store it in the device's keychain.”

One example of a more complex smart contract is multisig.
Another might be: if Bob and Alice agree in the next month than allow them to move this money, if a month has passed allow a third party Casey decide who gets it. If two months pass Bob and Alice split it.
Another (perhaps more relevant) might be a multi-sig arrangement with thousands of signatures. Perhaps an organization wants to lock up funds such that 6000 out of 10000 people must agree before this money could be moved.

After reading Mike’s post and this very thorough work: 
There are some relatively easy ways to ensure bloom filter privacy. The main thing is to never send two different bloom filters (with overlapping addresses) to the same node.
Mike is advocating for a more complex solution involving “winding back” a dirty bloom filter but it’s super complicated and no one has figured it out.
So the best &amp; easiest approach I can see is bundle a ton of look ahead addresses in your bloom filter, cache it to disk, and when you (hopefully very rarely) update your bloom filter switch nodes when you do.
As best I can tell, this will get you like 95+% privacy. As a wallet developer this is super helpful to know, but,
TL;DR; if you’re not a wallet developer: some wallets (ie BitcoinJ ala all android wallets) are reducing your privacy by not using bloom filters in a specific correct way. This is mitigated by using tor or using a wallet that implements it correctly *cough*likemine*cough*.

I believe the main wallet won’t let you do anything hung until it’s synced.
A wallet like electrum will however.

I would consider some healthier alternatives for managing your anger than cursing out strangers on the internet.
It’s unbecoming.

Well schnorr signatures with conjoins can compress blocks dramatically (potentially up to half the size or so). MAST could knock out some space too.
Those are being worked on right now. There’s chatter about it on the mailing list. There may be a BIP for it now on github.
As to what comes after than? Perhaps nothing. I think Bitcoin is moving towards level 2 stuff for scaling. They’ll probably find it there but it won’t really be in Bitcoin. My money is on some combination of lightning and liquid — you could probably hybrid them together in some cool ways.
Lightning isn’t actually in Bitcoin. It’s just possible using Bitcoin. Lots of stuff is possible using Bitcoin.
As to actual links, you can see all the current BIPs here:
There’s a link to the mailing list from there.

It has much lower tx fees because no one is using it and also having bigger blocks.

Yes. The article states that schnorr and MAST are coming together in the same update.
That update will probably also include taproot, which are features built ontop of both schnorr &amp; MAST.

But what’s the technical analysis on this?

Would buy lol.
