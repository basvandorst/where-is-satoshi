and thats the kind of thing "communities" do. share. otherwise I dont see why you have an account... anywhere. guest can read from pretty much any site.
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:39:10
you mean it's open for anyone to steal from others? 
@_date: 2014-12-29 11:27:38
soo.. I just spent a few minutes the chat @ Hashie and its trolling. it has to be. I wont copy paste because no one will believe me anyways, just anyone else that was there will. Hashie official will reward 1BTC for any one that can cover the song on their site to avoid being sued by the artist, they will do they mixing/editing...
if that is not trolling, i dont know what is.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:10:58
so we did. have a look at the bitcoin talk thread. proven mining with stats (from another source..) partnership confirmed with rockminer and ahmhash what else could we have asked for? 
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:47:41
and whats to say AMHash is truthworthy?
@_date: 2014-12-29 09:09:21
so investors got f**ked? I put 0,5 BTC on that.. I just filled a withdrawal request and sent an email to support but I have a feeling none of those things will get replied. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:52:03
yes indeed. this is quality trolling. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:26:26
so you recommend selling on quickbit no matter on which market you are? and do you use a specific client for trading? because i just registered to bitfinex and the interface seems kinda poor. no graphs. i was using QtBitCoinTrader (only trustworthy GUI client for linux) so far but Id like to upgrade that too. A client compatible with bitfinex (seems apparently it is the most trusted and reliable) with graphs. does such client exist? im looking at  and it doesnt look bad.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:47:55
On which one are you? Im thinking on moving, realizing the withdrawals sucks on this one.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:46:52
yeah I saw that one coming, unfortunately. Is bitquick.co better than localbitcoins?
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:50:23
Thanks. Does it work good for USD withdrawals?
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:01:21
no no, what I meant is: seeing how shitty BTCe is, once I have emptied my account, to which trade so I move to? Also my bank isnt listed on bitquick. I suppose I have to choose SEPA transfer option. But I emailed them just in case to see if they work well with my bank.

the internet wasnt created in a day. you can not expect it to be remade on a short term. i speak from the inside of storj, and i can tell you myself and the rest of the team is highly motivated. does motivation lead to victory? No, it is not enough. hard work, support, skills, and other assests are required. This is true.
But we already on Phase 1 beta. Which is being a success. It prooves that the system work. Its no longer just a concept on a piece of paper. Now, thats a huge step in my book.
Of course it needs more work, tweaking, spreading, and pretty much everything a project needs. But it has to start somewhere, right?
Just remember what I began saying on this post, the two first sentences. And at this point, the project is promising, thanks to the success of Phase 1.
@_date: 2015-01-28 11:56:36
damn. its not bitfinex trading compatible.
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:33:30
Yes. Exchange. Sorry. Thats what I meant. Im in europe, belgium to be precise.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:28:06
hilarious. its so funny I dont know where to laugh from. next one, please.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:51:51
Nice input. Thank you. Then to which trade should I move?
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:44:26
Glad I could be of use. But any recommendations about USD withdrawals methods on BTCE? 
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:38:59
Withdraw BTC to bitpanda, sell there, and transfer  FIAT from there. Been using them since they launched. Very happy with them. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 18:24:50
Official doesn't mean the biggest crowd. If it was, bitcointalk would be the "official forum". Anything bitcoin official would be ran / moderated by satoshi. And or major devs of the bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:49:51
Define official. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:08:43
It's hashie all over again. I will pass this time.

Dios que pesado y poco espabilado eres.
Si tu te vas de viaje a Alemania, ¿que idioma vas a usar comúnmente por la calle para pedir direcciones? ¿Vas a imponer tu idioma de turista, el latam, o vas a ser un turista inteligente y comprarte el típico libro de frases hechas alemanas para turistas? O como mínimo mínimo hablar el idioma "universal", el inglés.. 
Se llama respeto y sentido común. 
¿Ves en TODO este canal de reddit algún post que no sea en ingles aparte del tuyo?
No es necesario que contestes, callate ya. Tu post no sale en portada. Nada va a pinchar en tus enlaces de referido que es a por lo que venías. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:21:31
I stopped reading at "coinbase". Also, I am a Spanish speaking user myself but.. This reedit main language is English.
Thanks.

Classic scam website layout. Skype and Gmail contact for the admin which we don't get the full name even less any kind of history to vouch him/herself.
Stay away from that scam website. You get cryptoaids just by looking at it. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:29:04
No, eso no es inclusión. Es invasión y falta de respeto a la plataforma reedit más precisamente al canal inglés. Si eres tan amable de irte con tu spam de enlaces de referido a otro sitio... Gracias. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:30:36
Please help clean the place by reporting the post.

they updated their blog it says they're under ddos.
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:15:52
thats unfortunately not the case. I would be starting small, with the 4 THs I have right now. Why invest in PThs worth of miners if they wont be rented right away? If succesfull (and I hope so..) I would be expanding progresivelly.
@_date: 2015-03-06 04:44:13
nevermind. it's back. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:30:12
Interesting. I had no idea such website existed. But like I said, I would like to start my own business, hash power will grow as demand grows.
So far the option I have seen is:
Using magento with subscription sale option + bitpay. payouts would have to be manual.
@_date: 2015-03-07 03:16:08
great... 
@_date: 2015-03-06 04:28:26
the site is up.. doesn't mean the service is. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:40:14
Ask in smurfland, its their main currency there
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:59:45
at least he has a job..
