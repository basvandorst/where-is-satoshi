B, but I just noticed the transaction I originally sent to Coinomi says it's in the mem pool. This was from over a month ago and it had already appeared back in Core though, so I'm not sure if it tried to re-send the BTC to Coinomi?
Edit: Forgot to mention I looked up the transaction ID for said sent BTC to Coinomi but the explorer says it was never seen.

Thank you for the follow up question about the unconfirmed ID, that was all spot on. I'm trying my best to learn, but this stuff is beyond me. I'll wait for it to clear since I didn't plan on using them anytime soon. Again, thank you!

Yes, it was running for a while before I transferred the BTC from Coinbase, which it sat afterwards fine, then I tried sending it to Coinomi, but I didn't set my fees correctly and it never went through and ended up back in my wallet, which is sat afterwards fine.
And without any activity and letting Core run in the background for a while I noticed it was just gone today. No new transactions.

It shows an unconfirmed transaction after tracing it to Coinomi and stops there. This is also after the BTC ended up back in my wallet after failing to go through to Coinomi.

Either way good on ya, he's got a future as long as you're involved :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:20:26
I mean, everyone wants that.

Yes, to the qr code that Bitcoin Core had open when I hit request payment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:08
Bought on coinbase, want to get them from coinbase to core, so I generated a qr code on core and scanned it with my phone on coinbase to send the BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:21
This confirms it for me, thank you much. Limbo haha that's a good way to put it. I know shits crazy right now I just got scared.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:07
Oh, you know what, Bitcoin Core just lit up with a notification saying a new transaction has been made. I think I just jumped the gun and got impatient. I appreciate the quick feedback though. I love this community. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:19:11
There are those who watched the video, then there are those who used it to identify with to make a statement.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:31:20
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:34:12
Yes, its been done for a couple days now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:53:22
How did the term gain momentum in the Bitcoin community? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:53:11
I'm not saying you're a liar, but I don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:20:10
Thank you stranger! :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:10:08
No especially since they're both better off now than one would have been 3 years ago. I feel ya tho, I got an 8 year old as well and her savings are currently tied up in stock, but not for long if I switch that to bitcoin as well.

Greyson. It's not a family name, but it carries some weight with my own life. His mother, my soon to be wife, let me name him and I love her so much for that :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:34
I just checked and it says pending, but there were not changes that came up on Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:31:28
Thank you :)

Thank you :)

No, this is sound stuff, thank you :)
We have a ton of scrap book material for everything leading up to his birth and we'll be taking tons of pictures and videos. We don't plan on any more kids but you never know lol

Come to Arkansas. There's like 40 of us here in our complex and there's 15 or so kids. I have room and board and will gladly accept BTC, but if there's something going to the kids I don't mind someone staying no charge. Could use some help figuring it out to be honest lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:30:02
That's funny but no haha

That's why I asked, I've never seen anyone use the term FUD until I started browsing this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:54:43
What does FUD mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:26:30
I was mainly concerned about the FUD thing. I used bitcoin about 5 years ago for silk road shit, had no idea it would turn mainstream. I'm sensing people are kinda butt hurt about the bandwagon of people.
Anyways, thanks for the info :)

I feel like the point of cryptocurrencies is to make this entire post obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:29:37
Thank you :)

I feel ashamed for not buying in sooner. I had bitcoin a long time ago to buy drugs on the Internet but after that crashed I didn't know what would happen. This year all of a sudden we have a bunch of millionaires and because of my turnaround with drugs I didn't go back to bitcoin.
Well, last week I got $200 worth and so far I've been watching it go to 205, then 210, then 215, and now I'm almost at 220, but it makes my mouth drool. I want to put more in but I'm afraid of spending my cushion money on it now that it's over 10k.
