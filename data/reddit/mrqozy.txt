That was my point people crying because they lost money and saying everyone is hating on bitcoin.
I got my BTC at 1000 and my Ether around 40
Don't worry I'm not losing anything yet

Well even a bet has to be a good bet. Betting on USA to fix your country is an extremely idiotic. Based on past USA interference you have to know no good can come from it.
And no Iraq wasn't ruined because of the "resistance"
USA made sure to fuck it up so they can get a government that is a puppet in their hand, plus destabilize the region which the USA benefit from.
Can you imagine a powerful middle east? That means bye bye zionist land(aka Israel)
So yeah, fucking up the middle east was intentional. And they will fuck up Venezuela because of your oil.
