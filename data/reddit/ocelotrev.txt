What about this pre-opening period? How do we get an idea whats going on there?

This is the closest I can find, delayed 10 minutes; apparently CBOE sells real time market data, but I think you need to be a large investor/company to purchase it.

Thats how coinbase is making some of its money! Price you pay for the service. If you think its going to go up over the next few days, its a small price to pay to secure todays price, they are charging you only 0.6%

Is it possible to have a "price stable" crytpocurrency, or rather a crypro that has a fixed inflation? The whole point of crypto is that it doesn't need any external validation, so we have no central authority targeting a 2% inflation by monitoring the price of goods. In fact, we can't even rely on the price of goods if we wanted want to somehow control the supply of a crypto to a "natural" level. I'm very curious if anyone has thought of a crypto that would somehow stay consistent in value. Could you base it on hash rate, or transaction rate? Could each amount of hashing power get a vote on how much to inflate the crypto, and then the price gets tied to the price of hardware and energy? Could there be some biometric validation, like somehow a vote is tied to your DNA, and each person gets one vote? 
I just see the big issue of the current currency system is that money is printed and it basically goes to banks, but it should really be used to lessen inequality. I think it would be great if there was a crypto where it's users could vote on where it goes and inflation could be tied to something fundamental so prices don't jump all over the place.

Deflation encourages people to horde money and stifles demand for using it as a way to buy goods and services. My main gripe with bitcoin is that its  inherently deflationary. If they could find a way to peg the supply of bitcoin to a combination of transaction frequency and mining activity, we would have a great currency!
