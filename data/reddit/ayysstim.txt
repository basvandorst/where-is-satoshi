Why does what I practice have to reflect my beliefs?
Many people love watching professional sports and have never played it in any sort of organized capacity.
In sure you appreciate some forms of music you can imitate, does that stop you from enjoying the intricacies of it?
Many college professors teach a subject they have no practical experience in, does that mean the lessons they teach are not valuable?
I've found that I usually need to include minimum three examples in a comparative response like this as there is always the response of someone taking figurative language as literal and responding to it.
I don't ever read someone's history when arguing/talking on here. It can sway me negatively or positively and make me respond differently based on shared or different interests and j don't think the past "you" reflects on the today you. It can give a good idea, but it's like a burned out star, you only see what was there and not what is.

I think bitcoin was the proof of concept, but we're all still holding on since it was first to market

I'm sure my reddit posts have given you great insight into my real life persona and thoughts.

Side note to my response, Plain text on forums hardly provides a platform for subtlety....it's almost like something visual...an image of a scene if you will, would be more sufficient in conveying subtlety when you're communicating non verbally with someone through the Internet/text. 
If only there was such an alternative that let us do that when faced when we needed to convey a message without being there in person

The lack of subtly or sub text makes me want to  punch the author in the face.
I be they are the type that explains punchlines

And according to that picture they're categorized nicely and named "hax, lulz cannon, router back doors for routers that don't even have walls, super secret keyloggers" and maybe a text file with 000001-Zzzzzz for easy copy and paste brute force
I dunno this whole thing just sounds pants on head, I'm positive they wouldn't rest until they found these guys...would this be cause enough for war if it was in fact Russians? I mean they have whole teams whose sole job is basically monitor in and out like those old school switch board call operators. 
My mom worked at the cia and they aren't nearly as serious as the nsa and whose stories I'm basing a lot of these assumtpins on

Kind of a disproportionate response, but whatever. I have a degree in Comp Sci, what I " think" is far more educated than what you believe...where did you even pull that number from? O your asshole, gotcha.
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:07:15
And you being in GayWeiners247365.com's database is a far cry from being on the Nsa's "possible dissidents" db

It was never going to be bitcoin that gained widespread adoption, but it paved the way. I've said this since the start
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:15:22
Ahh invoking the fallacies of argument, the go to for every poster that has no counter argument...it does in fact give authority.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:18:42
Or a further attempt to discredit btc, out potential persons of interest ( which if you clicked that link you probably now are).
Snowden gaining access to sensitive data is one thing, some group hacking the agency that  invented the tools to do it probably 20 years ago? Yeah fucking right

Using a singular picture to express your ideas brings a certain implied subtlety, or "Smartness". If you use it that medium, then explicitly outline your point of view through text or otherwise other blatant means, what's the point of using that medium at all?
Why draw a picture, then label it *Insert my opinion in plain text here*?
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:15:15
Either total bullshit, or false flag/attempt to consolidate/out threats.
The NSA isn't simply "hacked". Even if they were, I'm sure they don't keep all of their tools in a file callled "Lol NSA Stuff Don't Hax"

I'm impressed that someone her age would go through the process of learning what it is and acquiring one

I see the point you're trying to make, but that comic has a great message that many people could apply to their everyday lives.

No idea, I've been out of the btc scene since mt"Rape My face I'm a huge bundle of sticks"Gox stole my hopes and dreams :((
And other than the past few weeks I've never had much of an interest in our politics, so not enough knowledge to know about that company/group if it's outside of btc and related to voting
@_date: 2016-01-03 08:34:04
I was thinking the collection would be more of a public forum type thing, like in Rome where you cast your piece of stone in the basket of the politician of your choice.
It would be overseen by a collective then become a "coffer" node that was used for mining fees.
Like I said, I have a very rudimentary understanding of the btc tech, but from what I understand mining fees will have to be sourced once the 21m coin is mined and that people clearly like these transparent systems that remove manipulation through their public nature so why not start incorporating some of our more archaic systems such as voting while we're still in the fledgling days of these technologies
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:02:26
I was thinking a more positive spin to "degenerate incentive structure that currently plagues our modern governing systems"
would be giving back to the community and incentivizing with a transparent voting system...but clearly my understanding of btc and reality are two separate things

I've been with buttcoin from the start, if we see this sustain for a month or so, then I'll get interested again, but this is par for the course at this point
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:53:42
Seconded, I can have coins without linking my bank account and have them in minutes

It only took a few years, but we finally found the Navy Seal pasta in real life

Care to iterate?
I got burned with MtCock

I run a business in a similar field selling food products.
How many stores do you cold call everyday? Do you work with any distributors? Do you have an rep companies that represent you in different zones?
Cool product, I can definitely give you some info of all the things I went through at the start
@_date: 2016-05-24 11:42:23
Cars too, you don't have to put gas in a horse every few hours on a road trip.
They're just so much more convenient.
