The 8MB is just maximum size, but only what is needed is being transported.
Since we use trucks as analogy, let's assume 1MB is 1 tonne. The bitcoin trucking company can transport 400,000 tonnes of cargo per day. The bcash trucking company is quite new (just 4 months old) and less popular, but they have new model of trucks that can use trailers that can fit 8 times the cargo. They are currently transferring 38,000 tonnes of cargo per day, but are capable to move 3,200,000 tonnes per day.

It is available at any time you need, and you can pay with it if the other person accepts it, but if you want to exchange it for national currency you are bound by limitations of the exchanges.

Sorry, but at current time bitcoin is more of a gambling than investment. Also, if you look at historical data the price only goes down since the MtGox collapse. There currently is 65% drop since then. It is just confirming that the price was artificially inflated by MtGox

So how does it work as a backup?
If you upload the file to Dropbox you have it in two places at very different geographical locations. So if something happen to one of them chances are the other is still perfectly fine. I don't see how ownCloud accommodates that.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:18:29
I don't know ownCloud but as I understand you can install ownCloud on your home computer which enables you to access your data from anywhere else. In that scenario you still have one copy so if disk dies you still lose data. If you use it on separate computer then for example in case of theft chances are that both of your computers get stolen.
Perhaps my confusion is because I'm unfamiliar with ownCloud.

Right now bitcoin is equivalent to some kind of virtual gold, except unlike gold it is not tied to anything physical. All of its value is purely speculative, there is even a danger that its value can turn to nothing overnight.
What is bringing value to bitcoin (and any other currency) is the ability to use it as a payment.

When BCH forked from BTC, anyone who had BTC received the same amount of BCH.

"I'm not advocating, but I kind of do"
Let say in have huge amount of money infested in gold, it is sitting there gaining value, but at one point I want to reinvest it, or perhaps use it for a trip to Mars.
Withdrawing it will lower the price, does that mean I should not be able to sell it because it decrease other people's gold value? Should I wait for everyone else to withdraw first so no one is hurt, but then my stake is worth nothing.
Don't you think this is actually a witch hunt? If single person's withdraw could cause a crash that means the currency is not very stable, and if you are investing in unstable currency you can have huge gains but you also should be prepared that you might lose your money.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:12:33
I don't think this is accurate, and regarding that topic the same rules apply. The banks that give you loan doesn't have the ability to print money.

There is nothing preventing then to do the same with bitcoin.

If you use just the satellite link alone without internet access you only have single now that tells you what the block chain is. They could theoretically produce block chain which would tell you that you received a payment, when in reality nothing like that happened.

The way exchanges work is they make some money whenever you sell or purchase. If the price would not change, and you would purchase a bitcoin and then sell, you would had less money than you had before. This is because you pay money to exchange for their service.
If bitcoin is illegal those exchanges would be a risky business, so they would require a higher cut (this is where the price would increase). So yea, purchasing bitcoin would be expensive, but so is selling it.
At that point I suspect the bitcoin hype would settle and its value would be based purely on:
- whether it can be used to purchase goods
- how stable it is
- how hard would be to convert it to a different currency (i.e. get your money back)
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:12:01

Ok so I'm just a lurker on and and have yet to hear an argument why it is illogical to increase block size. Currently the logical thing seems to be increasing.
Bitcoin currently requires large fees when transferring the money + long confirmation times, which makes it useless for what it was meant to be (a replacement for fiat currency). Seems like all solutions appear to trying to solve it: Bitcoin Cash, Segwit, Segwit2X, Lightning.
From all these solution seems like Bitcoin Cash is the cleanest. It increases block size to 8MB, all the other solutions seems like hacks to me and Segwit2X is a hard fork anyway (one thing they all have in common is that they acknowledge that block size is indeed the problem).
Ok, I heard one argument, but I still don't buy it. The argument is that to run a full node will require now to have more powerful hardware, but it is 8MB (in case of BCH) that seems like nothing today, it was a lot in 90s.
Anyway if we are all acknowledging a problem is block size, what's illogical about a non hacky solution to it.

It's not, but it doesn't stop me from having snarky remarks. I mean even if his money weren't stolen, putting life savings on bitcoin was not a smart move.
Many people won't agree with me, but investing your life savings in bitcoin is comparable to talking your life savings and going to Las Vegas, except in his case someone robbed him before he got to the casino. Worst of all, since bitcoin is equivalent to cash, there is no option to reverse transactions.
Don't invest anything (whether it is bitcoin, stock, whatever) that you aren't ok with losing. Bitcoin might have larger returns, because the risk is much larger, and the risk not only includes unstable price, but also losing money due to theft and lack of knowledge.

Its value grows because people are buying it, and people are buying it because its value grows.
The currency most likely is also used in some questionable things, if you observe the block chain you can see some transactions worth millions of dollars. There's speculation that Russia for example uses bitcoin to get around [Magnitsky Act]( It might also be used to get around sanctions.

I can understand CD ROMs, but what do you have against BD XL. These can hold 100GB each.

I'm just a lurker, and I've seen people posting similar things when MtGOX went tits up, and saw this subreddit posting links to suicide watch.
Before the crash you could see tons of posts with excitements how the value grows, you could see articles with people investing everything they have in bitcoins, some even taking loans. I am starting to see the same thing again.
You needed to realize that this is a zero sum game. For every person that gets rich doing this there is or will be a person who loses a lot.

Actually it happens that I do know the history of the Internet and it had something similar, and the solution was not increasing capacity.
There was huge scaling issue in late 80s, when the network slowed down to be practically unusable and continuously congested (congestion collapse).
An user on the network tried for example to send email, network was congested so many of his packets were dropped, this prompted the software to resend them, which again was dropped due to congestion, and essentially the user was also contributing to the congestion. Also adding more capacity did nothing to help in some cases out even made it worse.
It was not until a physicist known as Van Jacobson implemented congestion control in TCP, which fixed things, but in order for it to work everyone (and given how TCP/IP operates the change was needed to be done primarily by the users) had to update their TCP/IP stack with the fixed version.

Do you think it will grow like that forever?

I've been keeping track since it was below $100 I did not invest, because I think it is too volatile. I don't regret it much though, because I did well on less risky investment.
BTW remember that you did not made any profit until you actually sell it.

This picture reminds me of the old personal computers that were integrated with keyboards, such as this:

Looking at the rate it accelerates I believe that might be next month.

It will stabilize once all people that want to purchase BitCoin will purchase all they want/can afford. The higher the price the less of those people will be willing to purchase it and the sooner that points arrives.
Once no one will be interested to purchase it, the price will go down. At that point all people will try to sell it which will speed up the whole process. Looking how quickly the pricve changes it will probably happen overnight.
Those who sell it earlier will make tons of money on those who won't be so quick.

When companies are withdrawing and transaction fees grow beyond reasonable to make it unusable it looks like it is returning to status close to a ponzi scheme.
Bitcoin is losing all utility it previously had (it supposed to be a payment method) and essentially it is no better than trading Magic the Gathering cards (except that in MtG you actually have something physical in your hand)

Exchanges? Or anything that uses it (e.g. smartphone applications, hardware etc)

In my language there is a saying that I think applies here:

Thanks, I was not aware of it.

Was about to post same thing, but then I searched for "Dollar", "Berlin" and looks like they don't mind to define names.
The definition is a bit off though. He should define that Bitcoin is a type of electronic currency, not the electronic currency.

No shit. I posted genuine question about bitcoin vs patents wanting to learn more about it but my post was immediately downvoted because it implied something negative about Bitcoin.
Seems like the only thing you can discuss here is how great bitcoin is.

I can assure you it isn't. I seen same billboard on Robertson Blvd, and actually that's what caused me to find this thread.

Edit: Just to clarify. I initially ignored those misspellings, thinking it was too rude to point it out, until I started making them myself.
