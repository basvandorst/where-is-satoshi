I was asking about how to get USD out, not how to get Bitcoins out. I want to get USD out because I've sold some Bitcoins and am purchasing something that is only available in USD with that money.
I thought that I was pretty clear that I was trying to get USD out into a US bank account, not get BTC out or continue to trade them.

Oh, OK. There is still a bunch of text on their site saying that verified accounts have a limit of $1,000 per day. But on [this page]( it says that verified accounts have a $10,000 a day limit, and you only need to go up to "trusted" status to increase your limit to $100,000 a day.
In that case, it sounds like bank transfer is my best option, since I can transfer it all in one go without too much in fees. Thanks!

Why would you wait for 6 confirms? A restaurant usually serves you before you pay, and you could just walk out at any time. There's already a certain amount of trust there; why would someone bother trying to spend a few BTC for their meal just to double-spend them, when they could just walk out instead?

I said "a week or more". 
According to the FAQ: "Note: Wire transfers are currently taking up to 1 week to process due to the volume of withdrawal requests in queue... Withdrawals typically take 2-5 full business days to reach your bank, provided that you have included all required information such as your full name and address as it appears on your bank statement."
I haven't tried it yet, so I don't know how accurate the FAQ is. Hence why I'm asking the question.

[Good discussion of this on Hacker News](
TL;DR: pretty damn unlikely.

Except, there's no one in my area who wants to buy the number of BTC I would want to sell, and everyone in my area who is buying BTC is offering considerably less than the market rate. So if I did manage to scrape together enough interest in the area, I'd probably get 10% less than what I would get at MtGox, which is worse than the fees I pay getting it out by bank transfer.
