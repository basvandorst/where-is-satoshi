Coin control is pretty basic if you want a minimum of privacy. It's also very user friendly, which is why we need to do something to mix coins by default at protocol level so we just need to click "send" without having to worry about inputs and outputs.

Don't you understand that the amount of MB for a blocksize needed to quickly move microtransactions in a massive site like megaupload would be insane and nonviable unless nodes were ran by big corporations?
Do you want nodes run by big corporations?

Unfortunately it seems it cannot be turned into the default Bitcoin transaction, will need to go through a sidechain or something like that so im not sure how this will end up working like.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:33:30
This seems like the thing I've been waiting for for ages. Something like this should be the default Bitcoin transaction. No more blockchain analysis and people spying on your shit. No more having to send your coins in god knows where so some other people mix the coins and no more coin control headaches trying to keep track of ins and outs, just press send and be sure that your money isn't going to be traced anywhere. But im a not a coder tho.
Let's remember again that Bitcoin's whitepaper says "electronic cash" and something like this is needed to meet the definition. 
Hopefully nullc and the rest can finally make the dream come true.
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:55:36
Yes it could, Core never said we should keep 1MB forever, so you wait until Core raises it to 2MB when it makes sense, for now we are waiting for segwit etc, so deal with it.

Roger Ver is an incompetent doofus that has been proven to lack competency over the past few years on several occasions. He just wants to buy another faggy yellow Lamborghini with the imaginary pump that he thinks his agenda would deliver.
That, or he legitimately thinks he is doing good for bitcoin but due his lack of technical and economic knowledge realizes it's the total opposite.
Please, stay on your lane and let the smarter people work on the complex problems that scaling a decentralized network poses.
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:22:49
The market has decided that they want to keep Bitcoin running in a decentralized way and not in Coinbase (tm) Datacenter or whatever other "specialists" emerge after running a node in a personal computer is nonviable, this is why XT was a failure and so was Bitcoin Crapssic. 
Core devs have been working day and night coming up with truly great stuff like SegWit, you know, the stuff that actually takes hard work. What the fuck have you been doing? Get real.
The blocksize increase will come, but right now it's not the right time, no matter how much some people cry about it. It seems not even after the ETH disaster people can't learn the lesson on how key it is to stay conservative with this thing.

Brian Armstrong has fucked up several times with his predictions on XT, Classic and now the ETH hard fork. Facts my friend.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:25:50
Im not sure. Store fiat and crypto deposits separately so if something like this happens deposits aren't affected? There must be a way to make it so the exchange owners aren't holding the crypto. They stay in some sort of decentralized limbo and if shit goes down everyone receives their coins back. Maybe with LN and payment channels something like this can be built. I am not a coder tho.
In any case FIAT needs to go, it's what making Bitcoin progress slower, but of course realistically we are stuck with it.
@_date: 2016-08-27 13:11:18
Im tired of telling to people how Bitcoin is important and the system is a scam, they ignore everything and don't give a fuck.
People is stupid and cannot be saved, they will cry later on once BTC is 100k a coin in 10 years. The fact that few people get it is precisely why we will be rich as fuck. The all time graph will look like the BRK.A stock, there will be so much butthurt looking back at nocoiners.

I said the game had insane potential, but it got ruined due no multiplayer. Exploring together in groups would have been cool.

Bitsquare is a marketplace for grandpas. We need a decentralized proper exchange for rapid transactions and fast speculation that can be a real replacement for exchanges. This does not exist yet. Let's hope LN can allow for this. Until then we'll keep seeing hacks.

It doesn't matter what Satoshi said. Satoshi was wrong if he thought centralizing nodes with "specialists running them" was a good idea for the long term survival of the network in a non-corruptible, censorship resistant way.

I have been in the Bitcoin game since the early days and have never lost a SINGLE fucking coin.
Guess how I did that: I didn't gave my coins to anyone, I held them on my wallet.
Of course, everyone loves to speculate with alts from time to time, so I only have coins outside for very shorts amounts of time, then its all back to my wallet.
We NEED to start having decentralized exchanges as the default to-go place to buy BTC. ENOUGH of this bullshit! We can't let absolute MORONS ruin Bitcoin's reputation. MtGox, Mintpal, Bitfinex, all of them will eventually fall. We can't trust people, we need to have decentralized exchanges. It's the only way to truly ASCEND.
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:22:28
The game is out and its a disappointment. Reminder that I was right.
As I predicted, it gets old without the building element, and its not even a proper multiplayer. Apparently you can't see other players ever even if you meet at the same spot, so developer was lying.

Common sense and physics. The core of Bitcoin has to be decentralized, and you cannot have real decentralization with centralized nodes.
Constant raising of the block size is a direct road to actual decentralization, LN isn't.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:15:02

This proves you either don't know shit about how LN works or you are just FUDing. Please go study and come back when you are able to talk about this.
Running a node is a pain in the ass already for a lot of people. Go on the forums and read how no one but huge nerds can deal with downloading the entire blockchain with the full node.
The least thing we need is doubling this to alienate even more potential node runners.
Also good fucking luck if you are in places like Venezuela where you would need more than anywhere else to run full nodes, if you start raising the blocksize. x2 is right now a pain, just imagine if Gavin's delusional BIP101 went through.
Big blockers can't swallow the red-pill: 5000 nodes across the globe run on random people's basements thanks to an affordable block size is way more secure and makes Bitcoin more valuable than 10000000000000000000000000000000 nodes run inside MrCeo's big datacenter.
Doubling the blocksize so only first world country basement nerds can run their nodes is the first step towards centralization.
If you don't see this reality of life you are coping.

Even if he moved the fucking coins, it would mean nothing. Anyone from the early days that had a connection with Satoshi could have stolen the private keys. His email pass got stolen and im sure his profile on the p2pfoundation website is also hacked.

Satoshi didn't say black or white about how to scale it.
Guess what Satoshi said in the whitepaper too, "p2p cash", and Bitcoin is far from being p2p cash because it lacks privacy features, which are being pushed by Core devs btw (Confidential Transactions for example).
@_date: 2016-04-03 13:33:45
You can build centralization on top of decentralization, you can't build decentralization on top of centralization.
Raising the blocksize centralizes nodes, therefore centralizes the very core of Bitcoin at a protocol level.
Only retards of your magnitude that have never been involved in the fine art of scaling a protocol, would attempt to scale it worldwide all under the very fundamental level.
LN doesn't centralize shit compared to the ridiculous plans people like Gavin has. Go study.
@_date: 2016-04-11 11:09:09
I hope Craig Wright isn't Satoshi, it just would mean Satoshi is an attentionwhore desperate for approvation.
Only delusional retards are calling additional layers in protocols to scale them in a realistic way "tier 2 solutions" in 2016.
What's funny is, no matter what proof Craig Wright has, it would never prove shit. Even if he moved the coins that are supposedly owned by Satoshi, there's no way prove that the private keys weren't stolen.

1) Charts disagree. On a long enough timeline, it always goes up.
2) Yup, at this rate fiatola is sure not the real bubble as bitcoin counter-reacts to it:
2a) Plenty of investments happen on Bitcoin. But since people value Bitcoin, they think twice before investing on garbage.
2b) Again, people value Bitcoin (unlike USD) so they don't do mindless drone consumerism. When you need to you spend it, example: I pay VPN services every month with it.
Also the fiat-rich let their money sit on banks as investment themselves since the interest rates are enough for the millions to keep raking more millions.
3) Who said USD is going to be outlawed? they make the laws themselves so their bubble of infinite debt never crashes, except laws of physics will eventually make it crash. Thank god, we have now a global decentralized ledger that doesn't care about laws other than it's own code, and the elite cannot arbitrarily create supply on it behind closed doors to save too-big-too-fail corporations while the rest stay a cuck.

FUD so normies can write headlines about how Bitcoin is crashing (once again) because that's always a juicy title that gets a lot of hits (clickbait guaranteed). Just saw fucking Vice talking about how "the dream of buying coffees with Bitcoin is over". Can you fucking believe it? This is what happens when liberals can't into Bitcoin.
FUD so scammers can sell casuals Ethereum, Dash or whatever shitcoin is promising delusional "Bitcoin 2.0" dreams.
Agendas, bro-coders and bluepilled casuals that think they can cook the cake and eat it (scale Bitcoin to worldwide levels with all-on-chain transactions without any tradeoffs, and don't understand how Lightning Network is going to save our ass to reach big volume of transactions in the future).
I hate having to deal with so much bullshit. This is once again a Mike Hearn moment, wake me up when the clueless whining it's over. I hope that all the FUDsters have already sold so they kill themselves in a year when they have 0 BTC once the FUD is over and the price is climbing like fuck.

This is more obvious paid shilling by the Gavinista agenda. Pathetic, but daily reminder that it's not working, they are wasting their time.
I can't wait for Lightning Network to be operative so they run out of excuses. I guess they will shill with how LN transactions are not as pure as on-blockchain transactions or some nonsense along the lines.

Since im assuming they aren't complete naive idiots and understand the tradeoffs of their "scaling roadmap", the logical conclusion is that they have an agenda that serve their particular scaling roadmap.
Gavin gets the job done so Bitcoin can be controlled once society goes cashless (obvious CIa rogue agent)
Brian establishes himself as a main player on the node-running corporations once running a Bitcoin node goes the mining route.
Toomin gets his ego fix and becomes Bitcoin's main developer.

Segwit 


BU doesn't work. Emergent consensus and flexible blocksizes are unfortunately a meme in 2017. Unless someone comes up with a better idea it is what it is. I wish BU worked, but I CAN'T trust my money long term under a team of amateurs and a change that opens a can of worms.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:09:56
Consider this: An actor with trillion-tier pockets (China) bribes the couple of miners that have massive hashrates into causing this clusterfuck by pushing for a HF with dodgy software which creates uncertainty, thus damaging bitcoin's network effect.
No matter what the outcome is, if they complete their task (HF and create as much chaos as possible) they will get more money than they would get by being rational.
This explains why those miners are pushing for something that is objectively a kamikaze mission.
So how are you supposed to incentivize those miners, if they will make more money by destroying BTC?

Miners are acting irrational by going against 80%+ of nodes which run Core by supporting a software that can jeopardize everyone's holding by running extremely unreliable software and is based upon a flawed concept called "Emergent Consensus" that doesn't work as peer reviewed by every expert on the field (which copy-pastes 99.99% of code of the same team they want to attack, so they keep consistently fucking up with the 00.01% of code they add, and they expect that the original Core team keeps working on their software so they can keep copy-pasting after being attacked and killed) that can lead to loss of funds of holders, loss of funds of exchanges, and ultimately loss of funds of miners as the network effect of bitcoin is irreparably damaged due this clusterfuck taking place.
This is absolute Nonsense, therefore:
1) Certain miners are low IQ goons that can't see past short term profits and don't care about anything else (even if it will ultimately kill the entire thing)
2) Certain miners are being paid to cause this mess on purpose in order to kill bitcoin (let's not forget bitcoin is tiny and there are actors out there with agendas and pockets deep enough to bribe them into making more money than they would ever make by continuing in the bitcoin ecosystem)

Bitcoin Unlimited being a buggy mess that goes against 80%+ of nodes which support Core and is only mined by a couple Chinese goons that are threatening with attacks that would kill bitcoin are also facts and yet your dumb ass stays "neutral" to all of this when it's your responsibility to clearly say you aren't going to support this abomination.

You guys (Core guys) need to start going satoshi nakamoto on this shit by getting involved anonymously.
Getting involved publicly is probably a mistake because the BUcoin trolls will use whatever they can to attack.
By going anonymously all they can do is keep the conspiracy theories going.
I would be in favor of doing this only if the code is as solid as Core standards. Code is code so if it is good people will run it.
PS: If anyone from Core decides to do it anonymously, take full measures like VPN etc when accessing github and so on, you never know with those trolls.

And this is only the beginning, wait when the anti-cash agenda goes global.
We are approaching a cashless society nightmare, YET we still have dumbasses around not understanding that node decentralization is the  priority and that we must keep running a node as user friendly as possible.
What happens when running nodes becomes "specialized" and the parties that run it are basically coporations instead of people on their bedrooms behind Tor? Exactly, you are FUCKED.
That's why the core of Bitcoin must stay as decentralized and privacy friendly as possible, then develop a Layer 2 solution (Lightning Network) on top of this foundation, so you still have the core of Bitcoin as decentralized and censorship resistant in case something goes wrong, but of course, despicable beings like Brian Amstrong don't give a FUCK about any of this, they just want to be at the top of Paypal 2.0. Absolutely disgusting. I hope everyone still contributing to this FUD about how Bitcoin is collapsing because you can't pay for your coffee on it with on-chain transaction, how Bitcoin need a blocksize increase tomorrow, how Core devs are evil and so on, get Ebola. 
In the small chance that you fuck it up, don't cry once you are living on a society with a Bitcoin that transformed into an abomination that's basically TPTB's ultimate dream: Total control. If that happens, you cunts brought it on yourselves. Until then, we must resist the power grab backed by developers and companies from Blockchain Alliance trying to decrease the influence of cypherpunks.

@_date: 2017-03-07 01:16:45
We don't decrease it because it's not worth it, 1MB is a good sweet spot, it's good enough, it's what we have, and hard forks have to be avoided as much as possible. Ultimately, block size increases are useless since they will get filled quickly, and we wil never scale anywhere notable onchain, but im ok with it after segwit if that makes some people sleep better at night.
What I mean is, any mainstream tier usage of bitcoin will be with centralized datacenters running nodes if you want it onchain, and it will still never compete against VISA etc.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:16:34
Thats why BUcoin is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:18:21
The logical next step is segwit, blocksize increase after segwit, anyone with a brain agrees.
BU is a meme and will fall by its own weight. I want them to fork off, my problem is, it will crush the price, and the bitcoin network effect will be damaged (ETH/ETC disaster)

BU will not become the new standard because it doesn't work. The current political problems in Core will be on steroids under the flawed BU model.
The pros have guaranteed that your bitcoins have never been hacked in 8 years and are now worth more than gold, they also got a ton of cool updates that miners like Jihan are rejecting because they want even more control on the network (which BU gives them). Looks like you drank the koolaid.

You could do that in the past because few people used bitcoin.
To compete against VISA on chain you would need insane levels of node centralization killing the point of cryptocurrency.
LN is decentralized enough as far as I've researched, satoshi talked about payment channels so he had it in mind. LN will need further block size increases anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:33:16
You are still ignoring the very valid premise of a global attacker with enough resources to bribe miners into doing something that is against the vested interests of bitcoin.
Case in point: You own the PBOC, you have trillions in resources, you start getting worried about bitcoin ("they fight us" phase).
Bitcoin cannot be hacked. So what do you do you ask?
Well simple, you bribe miners into causing a clusterfuck that irreparably damages bitcoin's network effect (the HF + supporting dodgy software that will bring added uncertainty). Divide and conquer. It's working as we all can see.
Miners are short-sighted profit driven goons, as we have seen by the chinese posts on Weibo. If an attacker with enough resources pays them more money than they can make by acting against the vested interests of bitcoin, don't doubt for a second they will. Just look at any video by Chandler Guo, that guy has a brick for a brain. He is also known to go from planning an attack on ETC to mining ETC and becoming a bagholder in a matter of days. This is the kind of people we are dealing with.
The assumption of thinking miners cannot possibly act against the vested interests of bitcoin is stupid and naive at best. It implies outside forces don't exist.


Another ridiculous assumption. Thinking a HF is not a bad idea when the network doesn't support the other software is Insane.
The miners build valid blocks. 
The validator node network (non-miners) decide the blockchain
. 
The miners are directly linked to the market price through exchanges.
The base interests of the miners is being kept in check by Consensus.
In Bitcoin, no one is supposed to Trust anyone, especially the miners.
Byzantine General's problem was that you CAN'T TRUST the generals (miners).
Satoshi designed an answer so we do not need to trust the miners.
Why are so many idiots saying we can trust miners now?

Roger Ver profits from all of this while ignoring the technical details (just like politicians). Why isn't Roger Ver telling on all those interviews of BU has crashed several times and how Emergent Consensus would mean bitcoin with inflation? what about the control BU gives to the miners?
He never gets technical and never goes beyond "fast bitcoin with cheap fees now". He is not able to understand game theory, tradeoffs and whatnot (or ignores them in purpose)

Of course I also want to see bitcoin getting used widely in payments, so I hope this clusterfuck gets solved soon and we can get segwit, blocksize increase and LN so everyone is happy. Anything else will lead to too much uncertainty so even the store of value network effect is lost no matter what.

Look around, when people start using Bitcoin, they can't already be arsed to run Core because it takes a fuckton of time to download the actual blockchain. So the bigger the blockchain, the less altruistic people that will have also the resources to run said node. The network will always be more decentralized with a conservative block size, this is a fact.

Why you ask? well simple. Government has those nodes perfectly located, which means Bitcoin is not decentralized, it's grabbed by the balls by the government. I guess you cucks want that, but not everyone wants Bitcoin to end up like that, so please, next time you shitpost, consider the valuable information that I just gave you.
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:14:34
Anyone with real life experience that hangs out with normal, non geeky people knows this. No one knows shit about Bitcoin in the grand scheme of things. Didn't say it would take 20 or 5 years for mainstream adoption, im just saying right now we are far from it. So all this rushing of a blocksize increase is just a forced meme.
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:12:11
Wrong, it's not magic.
With 1mb which is what we have, you can extract data, and that data says we ALREADY have a low count of nodes, so raising it is absurd.
Again, decentralization: 1 node = 1 person all across the world, not big companies running nodes on buildings, or wealthy people running node farms etc.
By the time the mainstream catches up we'll have Lightning. Big whales and people in suits will get in way before the average Joe gets in and raises transaction volume to the next level.

I've seen him in interviews routinely showing how he is absolutely moot to the tradeoff of increasing block size when it comes to node's decentralization, which is the fundamental pillar of Bitcoin. He just doesn't care if nodes end up being run by "specialized" entities (probably because he would invest on those as well). He doesn't understand that a big building with 1 million nodes is useless vs 5000 nodes widespread all over the world when it comes to a network that is supposed to be decentralized. Guess all those VC/CEO-of-something don't give a flying fuck about any of this and just want to "buy services" at all costs.

@_date: 2016-06-29 21:07:16
Exactly. The fact that we CAN'T have a decentralized network while constantly hard forking to increase capacity by increasing block size since the nodes would eventually become centralized AND in the long term it doesn't fix shit (not to mention the constant risk scenario of hard forking every now and then), it's a red pill that most short sighted people can't swallow. They just can't deal with the fact that the only way to scale worldwide is through a 2nd layer solution and eventually all the blockchain will be used for is to settle those big packages of tons of transactions done on said layer 2 solutions.
They cannot swallow this redpill so they think blockstream is a conspiracy to cope. (Even tho anyone with a functional brain should know this, and know that Lightning is an open source protocol and lots of private companies will compete against each other as well).
So you either have a centralized network with big blocks and big volume onchain transaction s
A decentralized censorship-resistant network with blocks small enough to make node propagation worldwide viable and solve the limitation in transaction volume through a second layer while keeping the core decentralized thanks to a limited block size, so in the case that blockstream or whatever fucks up, we can go back to using the actual blockchain for direct transactions while still having random people all over the world running the nodes instead of Coinbase running a building with 1000000 nodes.
Pick one and only one.
Right now, a decentralized network with big blocks, cheap fees and big volume on-chain transactions while delivering worldclass encryption like PoW's Bitcoin does, that coin, does not fucking exist! It's sci-fi, so this means making tradeoffs, and option 1 is the only possible option unless you want to turn Bitcoin into a fancier Paypal. Deal with the facts.

Again, when was the last time Satoshi Nakamoto told exchanges to stop trading in the mist of a panic selloff?
Get real, Vitalik acted as a central banker and that sets an ugly precedent. Anyone defending the clusterfucked named Ethereum needs to flush himself.
Make no mistake, both Evoorhes and Andreas are invested, but even Andreas criticized Vitalik acting as Ben Bernanke about it.
This is why if this smart contract shit is a success, it will happen under Bitcoin as a sidechain or it will not happen.
No cryptocurrency will be a success when the creator is around, his figure has way too much relevancy. If he acts like an idiot, like Vitalik did, the whole thing gets haloed by this aura of fail and fragility.

There's nothing to agree or disagree. Im spitting facts, you are just coping with an alternative reality where a magic coin with massive onchain transaction volume stays decentralized. Also nobody gives a fuck about Bitcoin in the grand scheme of things, get out of the basement and talk to real people for once.
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:35:36
Legit. Those low-IQ people screaming "big blocks now!" "kill Core devs and their high fees!" should take a look at ETH right now. This is why optimization, and doing things slow, but solid, is how you sustain a decentralized network for 7+ years without odd shit happening.
This is a reminder on how hard it is to lead such groundbreaking projects. There's people that wanted to put some amateurs in charge just because they would be willing to raise 1MB of block size in exchange of giving them control over the project. Hard forking around like it's nothing. Can you fucking believe it?
One mistake and we are Fucked.
Solid, focused progress over catering for the "but when can I buy starbucks with my BTC??" morons.
We will get there, once layer 2 solutions are perfected and heavily tested. We will conquer the world and everyone will pay with BTC, but the Core of Bitcoin goes first. We need perfect digital gold for perfect digital currency.

I will tell you what users don't want: A fucking third Bitcoin that will cause another crash for no reason, because we don't need to rush a hardfork immediately after segwit gets in, you technological illiterates.
Users certainly don't want USG agent Jeff Garzik as the main dev.

It's impossible to escape the government when it comes to real state... for cars too, I would no try to get away with owning an unreported vehicle.
So buy and hold until you have enough to buy property, cash out the amount the property costs in fiat+tax and report the thing.
Keep the rest of BTC unreported, they don't need to know.

Satoshi Nakamoto wanted p2p CASH. If nodes are controlled by corporations, then it's not p2p electronic cash, so pick one.
In any case you are taking Satoshi's posts out of context and also not considering the fact that payment channels where there since day 1 (so he envisioned Lightning support), but guess what, it ultimately doesn't matter what Satoshi wanted, because if he wanted what you said (nodes run by big corporations in other words centralized nodes), he was wrong. Bitcoin's value is in it being a censorship resistant tool like Tor, not a fancier Paypal, because a fancier Paypal has no value. We already have Paypal, geez.
When big corporations run nodes, all a government has to do is knock on said corporations and tell them to do this or that changes to the network, and if they don't, they get out of business the next day. So guess what would happen in an scenario where nodes are perfectly located, bribeable and non censorship resistant, + the already centralized mining scenario. It's legit over for Bitcoin by then, it's fucking useless and redundant. Everything that makes Bitcoin special and valuable would be over, so I doubt Satoshi wanted that. But I guess you guys aren't bright enough to see this point.

Why are you big blockers determined to ruin the price rises every time?
We were on a price, then XT hardfork hit the news and the price crashed.
We were on a price rise, then Classic hardfork hit the news and the price crashed.
We were on a price rise, then Unlimited hardfork hit the news and the price crashed.
We were recently on a price rise after segwit lock in, then Bitcoin Cash recently crashed the price again.
After the Bitcoin Cash scam is cleared out, we will go to an all time high, and you corporate low IQ terrorists will crash the price again with the segwit2x crap, pretending to hardfork in 3 months to inferior software developed by a guy that has ties to government blockchain-analysis tools (and has already showed how he wants to add seeds that redirect to his company in the software)
We have segwit now, we don't need a blocksize increase. We must test segwit for at least an entire year and see how it goes, then MAYBE start planning a proper hardfork. If you don't, you will be responsible for another price crash in November. Risk this at your own peril.

Cash is incompatible with big blocks, because big blocks centralize the network into the hands of corporations.

Now we will have segwit, almost 4MB of blocksize.

All experts, including non Core devs like Andreas Antonopoulos, agree with the fact that a blocksize increase before segwit is activated is fucking stupid, so there will not be a blocksize increase unless segwit gets activated.

The thing is he doesn't have any beyond getting rich. He pushes his agenda because he thinks bitcoin has more value as a fancy Paypal than a censorship resistant protocol.
The funny thing is, his vision of bitcoin makes it valueless, and the way we will get rich is through the decentralized core+layers on top approach, no other way arround this. So Ver, get with the program and start signaling for SegWit already if you want to get rich.

Not everyone is that lucky. Where I live I can't much more than 2MB and I live in a first world country. I will be forced to drop my node as blocksize goes higher.
The main problem tho is, it opens a can of worms you want to avoid. We'll hit 2MB limit soon and the complains will start again soon because dumb people want free fast shit and dumb people are majority.

@_date: 2016-12-08 16:57:38
So people will dump their gold because gold cannot be used to buy starbucks?
You can blame the people blocking SegWit if Bitcoin never becomes a viable, fast and cheap world currency.
Btw, protection against Fedcoin depends on how easy it is to run nodes by random people, therefore raising the block size goes against this protection directly.
Im not saying let's keep 1 MB forever because that's stupid, im saying let's get SegWit activated, monitor how things are going and reassess the situation.
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:58:12
And who is dumb enough to think that raising the blocksize to 2MB would change anything? Get real, only LN can allow millions of underbanked people to get in, unless you want to run nodes in datacenters, in that case Bitcoin becomes a fancy paypal and a cuck to governments all over the world, so pick one.
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:30:08

What do you think about the Libreboot T400 laptop? I was considering buying one, and using it to run a full node which I would use to broadcast transactions, maybe even use it as a permanent wallet, since I wouldn't use it for anything else so I doubt it would get compromised.
How else could you run a node with more privacy than that? It gets rid of proprietary bios, drivers, ME stuff etc.
Unfortunately it's a core2duo CPU... would it have problems running the node? You can get it with 8GB of RAM and 1TBB HDD so that would be enough, but im not sure if the CPU will do the job.

Dude swallow the goddamned redpill already: Bitcoin will never scale worldwide by doing ALL on-chain transactions. LN solves this by making blocks of transactions and once it's big enough that it's worth spreading across the network, then it gets sent.

This is exactly why we need a pro-node decentralization, pro-TOR dev team, in other words, Core dev team, and not fall into traps. There is a clear war going on to avoid Bitcoin becoming the safe haven from total control as they remove cash. Just imagine the price of Bitcoin when people find out it's the only way to make money (get paid directly in Bitcoin) and move money outside of the Orwellian nightmare we are headed at.

He wouldn't listen. The only thing Roger Ver cares about is shilling his Bitcoin.com website, and the confusion about blocksize and theymos's "grumpy admin" halo are a good way to get casuals on his side. Marketing noobs is way easier for big blockers since they don't need to go into the details of why it's not a good idea. It sounds good on the surface, too bad it doesn't work that way.

What's the saddest part? To see low-iq CEOs like Brian Armstrong or Wences Whatever from Xapo circlejerking about Bitcoin Classic and "upgrading to it" to show some support (watch their twitters).

Well, once the governments kill cash, people will flock in desperation to whatever alternatives they can find, and Bitcoin will be the best,  alternative to make financial transactions outside of the dystopian, gov-control-freak society we are inevitably approaching.
We better have Core on charge by then and not some stupid dev team with their altcoin hardfork attempt, and we better have Confidential Transactions and BIP47 and Coinjoin and all that, all nicely wrapped up on the software so everyone is using that by default. Then we will have a realistic opportunity to fight back.
As it is right now, Bitcoin still needs a lot of work to become anonymous enough to challenge the Orwellian nightmare we are headed at that nobody seems to see.
@_date: 2016-02-21 13:58:59
Once we have Lightning Network operative, all the low IQ hard fork shills will have less and less excuses to demand it. I think it was a good compromise on Core's part to decide to raise the blocksize so we can buy time and have everything under a calmer environment as Core devs work. 
In the future, there will be less and less excuses left for a hard fork like this to happen again, but right now it was a good compromise so the casuals and paid CIA shills shut the fuck up for a while. The more good work done by Core, the more features developed by Core etc, the more the opportunist hard forkers will have to prove if they want a chance to ever reach enough consensus.

The so called "people of the world" have no money, so their opinion is irrelevant.
The ones that call the shots aren't governments, and the ones that call the shots have an incentive to hold Bitcoin long term for reasons you would understand if you actually thought about it.
Granted, peasants will have to deal with "government backed crypto" while the elites deal with Bitcoin, just like peasants have to deal with taxes while the elites deal with HSBC and co, increasingly less so since Bitcoin beats the competition, and they are already allocating their capital on BTC OTC while dumb ass nocoiners spend their time on Reddit (nocoiners which will continue to do so in the future, specially after missing their last chances of owning 1 BTC)

Who on their right mind would listen to the so called "community" in order to engineer the most complex, robust and decentralized software of all times?
Last time I checked, people still freely choose to run Core nodes in majority. Why you ask? well simple, because Core has the best devs, they have a level headed, conservative approach, coming up with stuff like SegWit and actually making it work under a real scenario, making decentralization of nodes a first priority, making privacy a first priority... and so on.
The risk we don't need to take is voting for stupid hard fork attempts by other devs, and certainly not rushing things. 
Even Satoshi knew that not supporting Core after 0.1+ version would be a disaster.
We are making progress, have patience or run a node for XT/Classic/BU or whatever the fuck is out there nowadays and go shitpost with Roger Ver on the other subreddit if you are too immature to wait.

\&gt; Well no actually that’s not how it works in economics, you see what  makes the dollar such a winner is it always got constant demand, people  want dollars.
People want a currency until they don't. In other news, the world is decoupling from the dollar already, wake up.
\&gt; Hoarding is the opposite it kills demand, and because there is no demand it effects the whole economic chain. [
People wouldn't magically stop needing things in a society where money stops growing on trees. Exponential consumption that is damaging the environment and general hallucinations such as socialism would end. Not an argument.
\&gt;real economic models don’t work  like that.
Let's briefly point out that "econ lesson time" and "hundreds of years of accumulated understanding" are nothing but woefully unwarranted presumptions. There's no such "hundreds of years" and there's no such "accumulated understanding". There is Kensyanism, which is a post-WW2 affair (not quite one century ago yet), and which is  pretty much the only significant school of thought (aka church, faith, religion etc) that seriously proposes inflation as a solution to anything. Yes, it is currently popular. No, it is not sound (in the same  way neopaganism is not sound) nor is it scientific (in the same way psychoanalysis or more generally "social sciences" aren't scientific) nor is it valuable *or proven*. It is widely held, which makes it *fashionable*, and that's all.

I don't use reddit much beyond so im not sure about that.
Also im not sure about the specifics of tax wealth on Spain so I would need to check that out, since the passive income must be high enough to not end up with peanuts after that tax.
Parking spots are also a good thing to have, I think you don't pay much tax and it's yearly, also it has 0 maintenance, so owning a couple for some extra monthly gains is a good thing. I will inherit some of these luckily, it's not much but it's a good extra 300 bucks if I manage to rent them all.
And yeah 1mm doesn't let you ball. I think at 10 million you are set. The hard part is getting there. Im on the "21 BTC club" but still very far from hitting 8 figure Yellencoin portfolio. I would need to take some risks with my BTC that I can't afford since I would lose my long term position if it goes south.

In reality, they are scared shitless that their shitcoin gets dumped for real Bitcoin.
The fact that they are using all these shady tactics like disguising nodes, not adding proper replay protection and considering absolutely clueless users of their services as de-facto, sentient users in favor of the hardfork, renders B2X supporters as terrorists against Bitcoin.

Let's say you have 1,000,000 EUR which is around 1,176,500 USD
You retire in a nice place like Czech Rep or Spain for a better climate.
I think in Spain it's around 25% tax if you've held for 1 year (50% if you held for less than 1 year)
So let's say you cash out everything (a mistake since you should always have BTC, but just for the example)
After the 25% tax you end up with 882,375 USD
You buy a nice 2 room penthouse in one of the main cities either in Madrid, Barcelona or Valencia, around 275,000 USD. This can give you a rent of anywhere from 1500 to 2000 USD monthly since the location raises the rent higher.
We are at 607,375, which gives us access to a second residence. You can buy a really, really nice house with a pool in an urbanization outside of the main cities for around 500,000 USD, which leaves us at 107375 USD.
Notice minimum wage in Spain is around 775 USD and you are getting 1500 to 2000USD ish from the rent alone, so at this point you have 107k in savings, 2 properties, one rented in the main city, and a sweet house with a pool in an area with no contamination or noise. Of course, you are going to need a car if you choose to live in the house, so if you don't have one, you can pick a car and still have savings, which you could put in boring stuff that could deliver a guaranteed passive income, or invest in buying parking spots and rent these for added monthly income and you could keep buying amounts of BTC monthly.
Granted, this doesn't allow you to have a lambo and live a ridiculous lifestyle, but you have guaranteed monthly income well above minimum wage with the rent and parking spots, you got a nice house, and you are able to save for future investments and get the lambo, all without having to work if you dont want to, and without needing to move in a shitty third world country.
With that being said, im sure we will hit 100k per BTC in the next decade so you will be set. Even those in the 21 BTC club will be able to afford the lambo since if you repeat my example with a 2 million budget you'll have enough.
Also this same 2 property plan would be way cheaper in Czech Republic I think, which could allow you to buy the lambo.

To the contrary: the pleb are being pushed into segwit addresses.

LTC has the oldest blockchain beside BTC, it has no risks of getting delisted from exchanges, and now is Coinbase. It also has exactly the same code as BTC so they can keep updating it with Bitcoin Core's solid code, this is why segwit in LTC is important.
The logic is clear. LTC already did his homework for long term mainstream adoption. BTC only has uncertainty ahead.
Stop bitching and complaining about how LTC has no full blocks so it doesn't need segwit. It doesn't work like that dumbass. You get protocol updates like segwit as soon as possible precisely to not end up with the current clusterfuck in BTC.

So once you get the population pissed about this, they will give us the solution: centralized e-fiat, and they swallow the koolaid with open hands.
As a result: The real big fish still keep their wealth outside of the system without paying taxes which should be the ones paying the most if anything, while the rest of suckers with low incomes and next to no savings are getting fucked with ridiculous taxes left and right.

3) Once more and more people want to use crypto and they see the slow speed and high fees of BTC, are they going to use it when you can use LTC which is the same but faster and cheaper and actually viable for OTC payments with LN? Yes

Also, we don't have a single relevant exchange making a statement about listing the UASF chain and August is around the corner. It's too rushed.
I'll keep supporting UASF but im hoping we don't need to use it. Jihan is risking his life if he does anything stupid.

The fact that people are still being naive about Gavin's motives is laughable. Time to swallow the redpill: Gavin has been involved on all of this series of incredibly weird events.
And even if you are naive enough to think otherwise, the fact that he got tricked by Craig disqualifies him as someone that isn't be bright enough to be part of the Bitcoin development team. No one in Core dev would have signed that thing and no one in Core dev would have been tricked by a closet-doors key-signing simulacrum.

Yeah, why you wouldn't take seriously some that is known for a BIP that would have ruined Bitcoin if it was implemented?
This piece of shit is Mike Hearn 2.0, but he has more resources since he was the guy selected by Satoshi to "take the lead", bad fucking mistake by him, unless this was all part of the plan, which is also a possibility (let's not forget that for all we know, "Satoshi" could have been any 3 letter agency at work)
In any case, the facts remain: Gavin is a shit tier developer that hasn't contributed anything useful to Bitcoin in ages and all he has done is spread FUD about block size and other issues, while failing to take control of the project with their hard fork attempts in numerous occasions. This "Craig Wright is Satoshi" thing is an obvious social engineering powergrab attempt combined with yet even more dodgy "proof" to try to gain Classic consensus, you will notice how this Craig Wright guy will start shilling Classic or more subtlelly, demanding a block size increase soon. Then the plebs will think, "oh, even Satoshi thinks Core is evil and we must support Gavin's Crapssic". Now everyone in the Bitcoin circuit that has some public relevancy can get a couple million dollars in their pockets by saying "I meet this guy too privately and im convinced he's Satoshi".
Pretty fucking obvious, exactly what I would do if I had Gavin's resources and his vile mentality.

None of those details matter for the end user. Both VISA and Paypal are the same for the average joe. The average joe doesn't give a fuck as long as the money goes from A to B fast.
Thats why LN will be a success, while keeping the core of Bitcoin as decentralized as possible, while LN offers a quick cheap way to use Bitcoin that's infinitely times more decentralized than the other existing alternatives.
Btw, kids are already buying games in Steam instantly and no one is complaining about block size or delays:
The definitive answer is being able to run 1 node with 1 computer that's reasonably affordable. If the block size is too big that it starts making this impossible and things start shifting towards specialization (just like happened with mining) then the network is fucked because the nodes will be less and less spread across the world.

I respect you as one of the best bitcoin developers out there, but your fundamental analysis on the Litecoin/Bitcoin dynamics is wrong.
Facts: 
-Litecoin has segwit.
-LN developers are moving to LTC because they are fed up with wasting time on the testnet as segwit will never arrive and they want to put their effort into a real network to have a real impact in the world.
-Litecoin will benefit from this, and all other cool technologies segwit will unlock.
-The price of LTC will go up as a result.
-As long as segwit is not possible in BTC, LTC will enjoy this uptrend.
-Realistically, BTC is not going to get segwit, EVER, with miner agreement, which leads us to a very rocky path with massive bumps in between (UASF, hard forks/splits, miners attacking each other and all kinds of drama: uncertainty: price going to shit)
-Meanwhile LTC is smooth sailing with no drama
In what planet LTC isn't a steal at current prices? How is it a scam if it will deliver what BTC can't while getting rich in the process as an investor?
Pretty sure the ones that feel/will feel scammed are the ones holding BTC hoping for something that will never happen (segwit, LN, fast payments and so on).
Could you tell us your plan to get segwit activated so LTC does not steal BTC's lunch? Since you seem to be convinced "BTC will get segwit eventually". But tell us how/when, because if it takes too long, people may get fed up and LTC may gain network effect as the payments coin.
Have you considered maybe this is BTC's and LTC's destiny? (BTC to remain an immutable -so this includes no Buggy Unlimited or anything else but the current BTC as we know it-, on-chain only blockchain, and LTC to be the fast velocity payments coin with off-chain approaches)

Who cares about this sub. If you get some guy in the media as Satoshi, that's Satoshi for the 99% of population, that's what Gavin and co wants, they don't give a fuck about anything but mass media control and shifting people's perception onto what meets their agenda better. I've spoken to a lot of people that saw the "Bitcoin creator found" news in TV and since then, Craig Wright is Satoshi to them = mission accomplished. Just lol if you think they care about some nerds on that's not how things work buddy, you get control by controlling the masses, not the small group of intelligent geeks that will question what's being told to them.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:02:06
Actually, it wouldn't be that bad that a guy like this was Satoshi for mainstream appeal's sake. I would rather have a guy that looks like he's in shape, dresses well, sounds confident, than a guy that looks like an absolute dork and sounds like a robot in public, (yes, im talking to you Vitalik, time to get a haircut and hit the him buddyboy).
If anything, at least be a charismatic likeable persona (Dorian would have been a great Satoshi, actually my favorite Satoshi ever)
But here's the thing: Bitcoin was designed to not trust others. I don't want to have to trust Gavin, Matonis and whoever signed that top secret non-disclosure contract. I find it insulting, that we have to trust some people, when the whole point of Bitcoin here is to trust cryptography. I doubt that Satoshi lost his PGP, his genesis private keys, and his block 9 keys, which would be pretty heavy proof that he at least controls Satoshi's keys (ultimately it's impossible to prove that those coins weren't stolen from the real Satoshi, but it would help him a lot more than doing this nonsense about demonstrating stuff privately, only to a couple of people, which should raise alarms for everyone in here).

You have been asked numerous times how you expect segwit to activate in Bitcoin. You claimed "it will activate eventually" while calling all altcoins scamcoins, when all indicators point otherwise. It's like you are applying your delusional faith into segwit activating, since you are incapable of giving us a sound argument.
Sorry, but facts stand:
1) Litecoin is now technologically superior to Bitcoin
2) Bitcoin is never going to get 95% miner agreement
3) Alternatives like UASF are a disaster and will cause uncertainty while Litecoin smooth-sails with miner-agreed segwit
In case you are hoping that miners and Roger Ver will get scared of a possible Litecoin flippening, think again. Roger Ver and Jihad Wu may have positions in Litecoin and ETH and whatever other altcoins and may be forcing the flippening to make a lot of money. They may also short Bitcoin and enjoy seeing it burn. Remember that Jihad Wu may actually be on a mission to destroy Bitcoin as requested by PBOC. These actions would result in bigger gains than finally giving up and activating segwit. Roger Ver may also have been contacted by a triple letter agency along with Gavin and so on to push the BUcoin agenda until the end.
I wish we could get segwit but I only see drama and uncertainty and price crashes ahead while LTC will pump into ATH and beyond. I don't want to be the idiot holding BTC into the next big crash. Im still 100% BTC but im getting tired of this bullshit. Hopefully the market values BTC as an immutable currency to hold wealth at, but eventually people that actually do daily transactions are going to move into LTC because it's objectively stupid to wait hours and pay $1ish fees when you have LTC with segwith and LN working.

1) Decentralized network thanks to conservative block size which means nodes can be run all over the world by individuals that have no relation with each other. Governments can't cohere the network due the widespread nodes.
Usage of layer-2 solutions for massive amounts of cheap transactions with decentralization and security 1000 times better than what the traditional banking system has to offer, and if you want on-chain transactions only, you can still pay the fee and get it through.
2) Centralized network thanks to nodes being run by datacenters, easy for governments to target them. Cheaper and bigger amount of on-chain transactions, but still shit nothing compared to any traditional payment system volume like VISA, you still need layer-2 solutions if you want to compete anyway. So not only you have killed Bitcoin's censorship resistant network thanks to having a block size that's too big for individuals to run nodes, discarding the optional on-chain transaction throughout a decentralized network by paying a higher fee, but you still need stuff like Lightning, so you come full circle after getting fucked in the ass by any global attacker with an agenda and resources. You end up with a centralized network at it's core, and you can't build decentralization on top of a centralized core.

Guess what the whitepaper says too: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"
Bitcoin is far from being electronic cash due the fungibility problems it has. That's why it will not be cash until transactions are mixed and amounts hidden by default. Work is being researched on this direction by Core devs.
And guess what a fundamental pillar of what "electronic cash" means is? Decentralization of the nodes.
If the nodes are run by Coinbase Corp or whatever, then there's no cash to be seen that day. What kind of fucking cash is that? Get real. The Bitcoin you are picturing is a fancier Paypal, it's the absolute opposite of "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash".

1) They are legit illiterate when it comes to how Bitcoin actually works.
2) They make sudden changes on their narrative which suggest they are getting paid to shill and FUD.
Avoid at all costs.

Roger Ver's incompetence is offensive.
Again: What's so hard to understand about the fact that, it's not only about how many nodes there are running, but HOW WIDESPREAD THEY ARE?
AGAIN: A network with 5000 nodes (current count) with people all over the world that don't know each other, running nodes independently, some under Tor, VPN's and whatnot, it's a million times safer, and censorship resistant, than literally 10000000 nodes run by Coinbase Corp and the couple of guys that may still afford running a node by themselves once the blocks are simply too big for individuals to do so.
So get real: DO YOU WANT A MORE FANCIER PAYPAL OR DO YOU WANT A CENSORSHIP RESISTANT NETWORK?
Time to address the situation and come clear here. Enough of this rhetorical bullshit. The Roger Ver types either are unable to understand this reality, or they do understand it, but do not give a fuck about Bitcoin as a censorship resistant tool, they just want a meme currency and push their VC crap, and think that bigger blocks will make the price higher as well, which is nonsense.

Listen buddy, it's 2016, if you are still holding relevant amounts of Bitcoin in centralized sites (specially Coinbase) you deserve what's coming to you.
The fastest way to get it all out of it ASAP would be to create a BIP38 secured paperwallet, make like 30 physical copies. If someone finds them it doesn't matter because they will need the pass anyway.
If you are scared to lose papers (understandable) make digital copies of the QR code image as well saved in .png or whatever. Save them in several pendrives, save them in several DVDs, save them in all of your harddrives, save them in fucking floppy disks... you name it. The more diverse the better.
At some point it will just be impossible that you find yourself in a situation where you have no access to your Bitcoins since it's impossible that all of your backups have failed in a particular point in time. This is worth it for 100k+ type of money.
Personally I use Bitcoin Core and own several backups in offline hard drives, USBs and so on, but I wouldn't risk a single minute more with my coins in Coinbase, and downloading the blockchain will take hours.

You guys are tiring me. Not only have have you upvoted absolute nonsense FUD like "The Terminator mining plan" a bunch of times to get it on the frontpage to push for your delusional agenda (specially in key times when the price was going up), but the software you are promoting gets no support because the developers are lightyears away from Core's. 
Get some good coders, come up with stuff like SegWit and so on, then you'll get your recognition. Then you'll be able to talk. It's not Core's fault. It's not Blockstream's fault. It's your fault. You fail to deliver something better.
Do something productive and stop trying to fix complex problems with lame ass solutions that involve centralization of the network.
Until then? All you are doing is shitposting and crying about the block size, that's all.
Here's my message for (im talking to you too) before I go out for 2 weeks. I really need to take a break from this shit. Im gonna get some sun. By the time the im back, you better have come up with something better than Bitcoin Crapssic, if not, then admit defeat and move on.

Legit. Not to mention "Electronic Cash System" is the first thing you read on the whitepaper. When people think "cash", they are not thinking a transparent ledger of all transactions for everyone to see, and sticking to what the average end user thinks by cash and fungibility is all that matters. It should be easy and sharp. Anything beyond the "click send and go" experience is detrimental. The user must know no one is posting their transaction on an internet forum for people to theorize and be curious about it. "Wow guys look at this transaction! this guy is fucking loaded". Just lol are you kidding me? This needs to go tbh.
The transparency bitcoin delivers is amazing and really useful for certain cases, like a public institution, charities and so on, so you know the money is being put towards what you expect and not blown on hookers and coke, but in general the default transaction shoud be the opposite. The optional transaction should be the one that shows amount of BTC transacted and doesn't mix it to make untraceable. The default one should be as close as possible to "electronic cash transaction", in other words: only you and the other guy receiving/sending the bitcoins should know. 
When you pay someone with cash, what information is being shared? that you are giving the guy X amount of dollars or whatever... that's all. So we should aim for that as the default experience with bitcoin. It's no one else's business how much are you moving.

Yeah hostility towards Gavin, the guy that proposes a ridiculous block size increase schedule that would have been disaster and still maintains Craig is Nakamoto.
Mike the guy that said Bitcoin is dead and wanted to the be the benevolent dictator (with Gavins approval on this)
Roger Ver the guy that tried to manipulate people with this shit:
Meanwhile Core devs busy working on stuff like Segwit. That's the difference.

I hope he doesn't waste too much time with Ethereum other than to point at the fact that the creator attempted to stop all trading on exchanges to try to stop people panic selling during the DAO disaster. 
Judging by this pathetic behavior alone, ETH is already doomed in the long run in my book. The precedent of Vitalik crying on Reddit trying to halt all trading is simply too much of a brutal blow to the thing's credibility.
I hope he also addresses the on-going block size flame wars, were some people want to raise the block size at all costs because they don't give a flying fuck about the network's decentralization, and they just want to push their VC meme startups which require more volume of transactions NOW!!!11. 
It needs to be strongly pointed that they don't care about the fact that Bitcoin becomes a fancier Paypal if nodes become centralized due a bigger block size. It needs to be pointed that the censorship resistance tool that Bitcoin is, gets obliterated when datacenters start running nodes and governments can conveniently knock knock on "Coinbase Corp" and stop the entire building running nodes, or coerce it to do what they want. 
Want to run a certain version of Bitcoin instead of Core's pesky pro-privacy, pro-decentralization software? Just make people running those big datacenters point to whatever version they want to run and there you have your hard fork activated in no time.
What people that care about decentralization of the network like me and Core devs want is a model where instead of "hey govs here is a big building full of nodes here", you get "hey govs have fun trying to shut down a network with thousands of nodes widespread all over the world and those nodes having no link between each other (run by individual parties)". This needs to be pointed enough times so the mainstream understands it, because it's very easy to sell how "Core devs want to make Bitcoin more expensive to make money with Blockstream and -insert flavor of the day software like Classic, XT or whatever hard fork attempt which lives off the hopes of Core devs continuing to release updates so they can copypaste the code- are the good guys that want a cheap and fast Bitcoin", and Joe Rogan has a huge audience so it's a good time to put this clear for once.
You either want Bitcoin to stay a censorship resistant tool, then buy layer 2 solutions like Lightning on top of this decentralized network, or you just don't give a fuck about that and want cheap on-chain transactions with big volume at all costs, including centralizing the network making it a castrated version of Bitcoin (and the irony is that no matter how big you make the block size, you can never compete against centralized payment systems like VISA without Lightning anyway).
It should also be explained how Lightning is an open source protocol and everyone is free to start their own company to compete against other companies (such as Blockstream or Blockchain.info's Thunder to mention some) to get the best implementation (an usual FUD is that Blockstream somehow own's Lightning).
The fact that thinking "it's just people naively having different visions of Bitcoin" is a joke, and needs to be also understood. There are agendas here battling against each other. Those CEO-bros of whatever that don't even know how to code, want to get rid of the cypherpunk influence on Bitcoin to turn it into a tamed puppy version, while Core devs are the ones that want to keep the network "cypherpunk-friendly" and then build on top of there. They are the ones that understand the tradeoffs and not only are coding the best software, but they have the best vision if you want the core of the network to survive from global attackers.
This is a war and there are agendas being pushed left and right. There's a lot at stake, a lot of people has a lot to lose if Bitcoin becomes unstoppable for TPTB, since they want to get rid of cash and once they get rid of cash, all that economy will go into Bitcoin. Once they start fucking up even harder with interest rates, all that wealth will go into Bitcoin, once they start confiscating gold, all that will transform into Bitcoin... and when that happens, you better hope the network is not run by datacenters but by random people on their basements instead.

Well yeah, but no matter how cool your procedually generated algo is, it will get repetitive eventually. A building made by an actual human would stand out much more. Precisely because it's so hard to find people, the odds to discover something made by an human would be way higher if everyone was allowed to build things. Imagine finding a colonized planet where a lot of people has gathered and are living together, terraforming and building edifices and ships and shit... you'll never find this, just random looking creatures and different coloured shit and that's all...It's a waste of potential.

Fees are legit laughable. You can send transactions for 1000 sats, we are still faaaaaaaaar from fees being a real problem.
But people want speed + cheap + high volume onchain transactions, and that's sci-fi.
Also, there's no p2p to be seen if nodes are run by datacenters.

ETH is even worse, doesn't scale, why people keep parroting the meme of ETH being "more advanced"? Are you new?
I have no idea about XMR, but it doesn't sound good given the bugs that we've found along the way, also not sure their dynamic blocksize solution scales.

It doesn't matter what he does, he could have been one of the guys that was in the "Inner circle" in the beginning, and he could have gotten control of some keys. This guy is not Satoshi, he is obviously someone involved in Bitcoin since the early days, but not Satoshi. It's impossible to prove who is Satoshi anymore. Just like his email got compromised, he could have lost control of the private keys. The fact that he used some gmx email account and lost his password proves that those things can happen, specially back then when Bitcoin was literally worthless.
The theory that makes most sense is Gavin using this to further push his sinking Classicoin agenda.
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:43:13
Wrong. 1MB is what we already have and it's good enough, no need to risk a HF over it. With Segwit we'll deal with it until Lightning Network. A lot of people couldn't be bothered to run nodes if size is coming at twice the rate, including myself.

There's no way to guarantee a hardfork will happen, only low IQ idiots haven't realized this fact yet. In case they are stupid enough to hardfork and split bitcoin into two, the non-legacy chain will get crushed by whales dumping on the non-legacy chain.

This game is such a waste of potential by not allowing players to build bases on the planets. The factor of discovering human-made structures is lost, so you only get to explore prefabs... and maybe meet some other player once in a bluemoon.
Im not asking for being able to dig holes and stuff since thats probably too hard to code, just building on the surface could have been great. 
I just see myself visiting a couple of planets and eventually getting tired since you never see traces of real players.

You pretend that anyone without and agenda or brain damage is going to be ok with firing Core devs and putting a bunch of morons in charge of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. Not going to happen sorry. The rushed hardfork will be a failure as well.

Big blocks end up in corporations only being able to run nodes, which makes bitcoin useless as a long term digital gold asset, since governments could shut down those corporations when they feel like it.

So that's what im saying. You are out of touch with that the average person on the street is doing. I couldn't give a fuck about your team, the fact is: No one cares about Bitcoin beyond geeks and businessmen trying to push their services at all costs, even at the cost of centralizing the network.
We are still on the very early stages, get some perspective.

We need more non-chinese rich people to jump in. It seems McAfee is about to drop some billis on a mining operation.
Also as long as nodes stay decentralized, we have a shoot. As soon as running a node is too difficult, it's over. That's why big block bros need to flush themselves.

1) If you own several business (different webpages), unless you have control of your inputs/outputs (by using coin control when sending BTC) people could guess that you own those separate business. This is annoying if you want to keep those business separated as if they are independent from each other (so they can't know you own both).
Example I receive a payment from business A in address A. Then I receive a payment from business B in address B. This person making both payments is the same person buying stuff on both of my sites, but he doesn't know that he has paid the same owner basically (which owns those 2 separate business).
So anyways, after getting paid I want to buy some shit and I make a transaction, which is of higher amount than the latest bitcoins I received from address A and B. This means that the resulting transaction in the blockchain will show a joined transaction of address A+B+whatever else until the total amount of BTC I paid for the stuff im buying is covered.
So now if this person looks at the blockchain, he knows that I own business A and B.
To fix this we need something like coinjoin to be the default way transactions are sent. If you need to use "coin control" to protect your privacy, and be worried about inputs/outputs... this is as user unfriendly as it gets and everyone should have high privacy by default.
2) Receiving donations: You put a public address to receive transactions and everyone can see how much money you have received which is stupid. Confidential Transactions should take care of this, which coupled with coinjoin or whatever, should make it impossible for people to try to guess where stuff is going to.
That's pretty much it tbh... those are 2 practical scenarios that I think are very usual. The whole thing (CJ and CT) should be on by default so the end user doesn't have to care about anything beyond pressing "send" and knowing your money is not going to be scrutinized by 3rd parties. Anything else is not cash or fungible.
Btw threads like this is why anyone with a brain should stick with Core... the rest aren't going to care this much about privacy neither can pull it off when it comes to solving real problems. Let's just hope they find a way to make Bitcoin truly "Electronic Cash System" which is what the whitepaper said. I think Segwit and Schnorr sigs should get us closer towards that goal.
