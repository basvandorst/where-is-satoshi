Not a true HODL. You sold for brain surgery. You SODL!

I believe you have to wait until New Years to be able to sell BCH on Coinbase.

Well, how does it get to one person without distribution or production? And even after production, every additional one person to see it is part of the distribution chain, regardless of whether they continue distributing it.

Damn, if they’re puzzled by this why am I even paying taxes on any of my income. “*gee that’s weird, last year this guy had no deductions and now he’s claimed enough deductions to max out his refund. . . . Puzzling.*”

Really, the main thing is to just hold hold hold. Over time, the fluctuations don’t matter much. Someone who bought in at $7 isn’t regretting that they could have bought in at $5 if they had only waited another week. But someone who bought at $5 and sold at $7 is in absolute agony right now.

Why don’t you post some nudes of yourself (include face) and then tell us it doesn’t harm anyone if we spread it around.

Well, if it doesn’t go down to 5k, and it finds support at say 5,500, then that could be seen as a huge positive and then it could quickly shoot up to new highs. If you are out, you could miss a fast rebound. But if it does go down to 5k, you’re probably right that it will take a bit of time before it fully recovers.
