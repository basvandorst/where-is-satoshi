I see what you're saying. What I'm saying is that I bet a physician would explain all that, if asked. At least I've experienced that frequently when I get inquisitive with them.  I don't feel they would hold back the info is all I'm saying.
But yeah, to the original point. A project manager would help with client relations.

Poor analogy choice because that's exactly what physicians do. They explain things very simply and direct and especially if you ask. There are better analogies such as this quote from Tommy Boy. "You could get a hell of a look at a T-Bone steak by sticking your head up a bull's ass but I'd rather take the butcher's word for it." Or something to that affect.

Oh ok, yeah I get ya.

I actually anticipated this, didn't anyone else? The real Satoshi would see that Dorian's life is in danger and not just sit idly by. He had to make a statement or Dorian's well-being would be on his conscience.

But how does overtaking the network make them money?

Just musing, but it might be Apple's decision.  What if pre 7.1 they didn't allow bitcoin apps because all their devices were vulnerable to attacks?  Then after 7.1 is when they announced they can be put on the App Store again because they patched it.

I see a lot of people complaining about this and I see a lot of people saying what not to do. How about coming up with suggestions on what to do?  At least this person is trying and I'm sure it's effective for some people.
How about creating a community marketing fund where professionals in marketing are funded for coming up with and enacting marketing campaigns purely for Bitcoin adoption?  That way guerrilla tactics aren't our only means of spreading the word?  If that already exists, sorry for mentioning it but then my point stands, donate to the cause! Don't hate.

Indiegogo actually takes a higher fee if it doesn't get funded and the campaign decides to just take whatever is raised. They have options. Kickstarter is funded only.

You can use cb or circle to buy btc. They're centralized ya but then you can transfer the btc out to your own wallet and duplicate all the functions of cb and circle without centralization. What happens when you take cash out of PayPal and your bank? You lose the ability to transfer over wire.

What do you mean nothing is being done about it? Coinbase is expanding in new countries at a great pace. This cuts out almost all your steps and only mandatory step being ID and bank verification, which WU requires ID too. And that's with only a 1% fee on either end and facilitates instant buying sometimes too. I'm sure Circle will follow which is free direct to/from bank. 
The transfer to bank takes a bit but getting robbed outside a western union is a thing too. 
My point is something is being done about it. So it's weird that you say it isn't.

Clearly, this is a hypothetical showing each currency as an isolated, dominant currency. However, as we know, that is an impracticality when fiat is the dominant currency. This is just a table showing inherent features. Volatility and acceptance aren't factors in this hypothetical because there is no volatility when there's nothing to compare it to and no acceptance factor when it's the only option.

Are there state licensing fees and laws that prevent the lamassu atms from working that smoothly? Are you saying that people have to verify their identity and pay large transaction fees right now?

This and Silk Road 2 gotta be inside jobs. How do you just not notice? Too much of a stretch. Really easy to pull off with collusion.

Nice post. Once you think of all the bitcoin subs as just a decentralized trollbox then the noise becomes so much more obvious.

Why not?

Agreed. I wouldn't use "wealthy" for 2 million. Was going back to your point about 8+ million.  I think that works.  2 million is almost enough to imply a pattern.  Where 1 million may be a fluke but 2 implies you've got some sort of repeatable process. 8+ means you've got the goods. :)

I'm in the same boat as you. I have zero records of my balance besides the database on cryptsy that is now inaccessible. I asked the firm if they have those records and they simple don't. Convenient that they can claim a certain amount based on our guesses yet they can't honor us with that claim amount after the settlement. Any luck on your end? Does someone have a cached page of a crypsty wallet section?

So, is someone with 2 million leasing a mercedes too?

Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. I guess the term is just "wealthy" then. I live in SF bay area.

Wow, plenty of haters. The fact of the matter is that this was bound to happen at some point and needs to happen. So, be happy it's happening. Congrats on the fund raising!

No, sorry I was merely summarizing the article. None of my comment was from my own opinion. I'm not in the prediction business whatsoever.

Tldr; 
Capitalism is dying from an overdose of itself due to not being balanced by unions. People will seek alternative currencies and alternative energy sources. 
Japan is the leading model of post-modern, post-capitalism simplicity. 
Still 30-40 years out but the 2008 crash won't be the last one we will experience. This will be a difficult transition.

Just to set the record straight, my comment contained zero personal views. It was entirely the article summary.
