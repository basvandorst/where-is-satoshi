You'd be a fucking retard.

What's your definition of failure? So far we have an economy that produced the internet, one of the greatest technological revolutions in human history, the foundations for Bitcoin to even exist.
Too the money isn't back by nothing, it's back by goods and services of the United States.
I'm all about the bitcoin train, but man this sub get corny

I'm going to hijack the top comment to point out the weird accounts interacting with each other. 4 year old accounts with like 100 karma rallying against core. Fuck these clowns. It's all paid for.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:10:48
LOL that's awesome :D
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:32:38
Scrubadub might not be. The other two 100%. 4 year old accounts with like 100 karma. Unlikely
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:45:56
This is excellent!
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:51:05
It's any number of news organizations. It's certainly a style that fox news is traditionally famous for. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:17:34
You have more than �� karma man. Don't feel bad, I wasn't talking about you
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:47:17
I'm not trying to make a political statement. It goes beyond mendacity. It's a willful shaping of information. The term "alternative facts" moves beyond lies. It's literally the construction of alternative realities.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:30:51
Auto correct fam
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:43:15
Feels hostile to me. It's evident by the almost fox newsesqe split you see in the community. Lots of misinformation, bit coin publications that seem Co opted, people saying coinbase is insolvent with no proof of any sort. Information wars ya know?
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:56:01
Probably just Reddit and then they pat themselves on the back for how well informed they are
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:26:22
@_date: 2019-10-06 21:40:11
Can't really seize it if it's in your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:49:02
This is a meme
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:27:16
Not your keys not your coin I think will always be a barrier to entry for many
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:34:51
Don't sell. It's a long term buy
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:15:26
You shouldn't be buying anything with bitcoin if your identity is a concern. Transfer it to xmr before you spend
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:30:36
Kinda. But the protections surrounded money are far greater than Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:45:52
I think what he's saying is that if you're so interested in pushing 2x the go start If you want a coin that is not Bitcoin and can only exist of Bitcoin tanks then why are you talking about it here?
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:48:44
Hodl as they say.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:59:25
Coinbase didn't support the first split? Idk where they're at now
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:48:00
Then go start a new sub to help them. If you want to promote a coin that requires Bitcoin to tank then why are you doing it here?
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:03:07
That's why we're in the 2x sub? Oh wait, we're not. Why don't you start it and all your buddies can join. If it's so popular, then the community should hard fork as well?
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:25:15
What if you converted it to a currency that does not tax and then just did a fiat swap?
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:26:07
Lol right? It has nothing to do with with Reddit and your time on it, it's everything to with you lack of credentials and the fact you're just a random guy on the internet
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:51:25
Naw. XMR is a good one too. It's popular in darknet markets
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:58:53
Those for 2x, why? I thought most of the community was against 2x and then you see guys in this reddit talking about it like it's going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:56:36
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:48:13
I thought 2x was bullshit? Like it centralizes bit coin which defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin? This is an honest question. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:40:26
I believe humans are superior beings to any animal. I'd prefer animals to be treated well, and buy free range when I can. I don't lose sleep on it though. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:53:09
It's how it started though I think. Who wants a currency no one is using? There's no financial freedom in an asset no one uses. One day steam wasn't like hey we should accept bit coin. It started in underground markets.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:20:11
For sure. I have little stake in it, but I'd like to see it fail before it becomes a central bank.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:33:19
"Teh" as in bi"teh"coin or b"t"c. Unless I'm missing a joke.
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:42:06
Well ya businesses are for it. That's the whole point. It centralizes.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:54:30
What is the value of an exchange? Why not keep a wallet and just store your coins there?
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:46:26
Your link doesn't mention anything about function. It's a link about how circumcision can reduce HIV transmission. Based off a shoddy study with few controls and a limited sample size. Not to mention that's what condoms are for. Female genital mutilation, is a type of genital mutilation (which by the way isn't intrinsically bound to a religion either. Don't be that guy).  But because it happens to one sex doesn't mean that the definition of the word is bound to that sex. The English words "genital mutilation" as their combined definition describe circumcision. Period.
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:02:35
Look at that you are still going. You said you were done. I was hoping you were. Again. Go click on the foot notes. It was one study, in 2005, and I can't even get to the study. The cdc link links to an abstract article which links to a site that my DNS doesn't resolve. The statement you're making doesn't even have a legitimate backing. But let's move forward on the premise that a single flawed study was right. I rarely sleep with random women and when I do I use a condom. It reduces transmission rates by 99.9 percent!
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:13:34
One, you're way off topic at this point. You made a comment about this "dickhead" in a bitcoin sub, when what that market was laid the foundation for bitcoin. Now? Sure, not relevant. Major companies accept bitcoin and it as an asset has value which begets it's self. Underground markets were the first to utilize bitcoin as a currency. Then, onto your off topic statement about not living by exploiting others. At the very least your clothes are probably made in sweat shops as is most of the shit you own. You also strike me as half retarded. I can't imagine you have a job, that pays you a reasonable income that isn't shady.  
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:43:30
You get that drugs are one of the few reasons bitcoin has value? It started with drugs. It's what built the foundation of value. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:02:43
I mean, I'm circumsized and don't care. I still don't think I'd do it to my child. It really is actually fucked up when you think about it outside of the context of your own lens. It is quite literally genital mutilation. Why is not doing crazy to you?
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:25:15
You really don't get it. What's your background in and how much do you make a year if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:09:57
Well, they can regulate purchasing of it though. Like I bought it as a currency to use. Like not as an investment. So trying to make the conversion can be regulated.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:41:29
Is that not what I just said? I must be crazy.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:41:52
Sounds like it wasn't really coinbases fault
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:04:57
Tu quoque doesn't apply when your statement is that you don't benifit from the suffering of others and the fact is that you do. Also I don't sell drugs on the dark net. I was making the factual statement that someone must accept a thing has value before it has value. DMN helped with this tremendously. In any case you're silly and I'm done with this.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:26:30
When you cut off a portion of your genitals, you are literally. Like in the appropriate use of the word literally, disfiguring someone's gentials. With a sharp instrument. It is mutilation. Also your little -7 needs a source. I think you sound like an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:18:32
My penis is circumcised. I like how people are trying to make it personal. I did a bit, but that's because the whole thread started with some guy saying "circumcision crazies". It's not a conversation on if there are pros vs cons. It's a conversation as to if this is genital mutilation. It is. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:57:28
Makes it a pain too for using it. I'd rather not have a currency I use fluctuate so much
