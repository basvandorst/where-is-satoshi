And they will remain voluntary correct?

Huh, I thought that was one of the benefits of bitcoin, that there were no transaction fees.

When the light is on, turn it off. When the light is off, turn it on.

I'm just curious, because I thought it was somewhat of a good point if it is true, how do miners make money after the last coin has been mined?

I think there are a lot of people who just lurk in this subreddit at this point for laughs.

I laughed my ass off when this showed up, thanks for posting.

May I ask which dispensary you run? I'm a patient in AZ and would love to buy my medicine with bitcoins!

It looks like it is on the way back up, but you never know. Don't invest more than you are prepared to lose.

No, people would find out really quick if something malicious was in a build. A compiled version from source would have a different hash than one which had malicious code (assuming same compiler and settings). Also, if you are that paranoid, build it yourself.

For now.

I am a newbie, where should I trade?
I just bought my first few bitcoins on coinbase.

I never said it was, i responded to you asking if malicious code could be injected into builds of open source software, and I gave you an answer.
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:04:19
I'm pretty sure if someone found malicious code (via hash mismatch) in an open source project it would be all over reddit, so unless you got everyone who can check a hash in on the scheme I doubt it's going to hold very long. Im not arguing for or against open source, I'm answering your question about malicious code injection.

Thanks. 
If I'm just cashing out to USD and not day trading, then using coinbase to do so is sufficient?
Edit: I'm more interested in using these bitcoins at some point, but I'll also definitely cash out some if the value increases.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:21:20
Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it! I was just thinking about the tax side of things today, so I'll definitely take note of that.
