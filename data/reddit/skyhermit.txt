Just wondering. How would you answer when people ask what do you do for a living? Would you be honest saying you invest in bitcoin?

Never heard much about Bitcoin in Taiwan. Have they started accepting payment in Bitcoin? Will be traveling to Taiwan in 2 weeks time
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:01:42
I don't really get it. Do you mean you use RBF(replace by fee) to bump the fee? 
Does the 2nd transaction come from the same address as the first one? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:24:47
Will CME and CBOE have same futures price? If they are different, will the difference be a lot? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:26:23
But the thing is how do you know if that is ATH? Like litecoin is at around 150 dollar each. It seems like ATH but who knows it might go higher or lower tomorrow

As I travel a lot, I don't bring laptop. The most I can do is plug into my android phone. Does it work with Electrum mobile wallet app on Android?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:20:57
Oh I get what you mean. But the thing is I already sent a lot of bitcoin to that particular address. I don't want to spend more. So I can only wait
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:46:46
Sent a transaction with 100 satoshi per byte for a normal transaction 9 hours ago. Still 0 confirmation. Any idea how long should I wait to get at least 1?

Are litecoin address and Bitcoin address in the same seed in ledger nano  s?

It is true, but it is the FEAR of recession coming that people will hedge their hard-earned money in either crypto or gold. With the recent trade war with China and a lot of recession news coming up a lot lately in mainstream news, I believe this will drive up the price of crypto and when recession finally hits next year, then people will sell their crypto

I plan to use Changelly for the first time to convert my BTC to altcoin. Since transaction fee is expensive now, can I lower my transactions fee so that it might take longer to receive 1 confirmation? Or do they accept 0 confirmation?

What does 'export private key' actually mean? 
I am using a mobile Electrum wallet app, let's say I have 5 addresses in that wallet and each address contains 0.01 BTC in it. If I just click 'export private key' on one of the addresses, what will it do? Does it show me my private key or something? Or will my private key be exported out to somewhere and thus I can't spend the 0.01 btc balance in that particular address in my Electrum wallet?

Question regarding 'change address'.
Let's say I have 1 BTC in my electrum mobile wallet app, i send 0.8 BTC to another guy, then the remaining 0.2 BTC goes to my change address.
Is this change address (the one with 0.2 BTC) under the same seeds? Which means after I format my phone and reinstall electrum wallet and restore with the seeds, I would still be able to spend the 0.2 BTC found on that change address, right?

I sent BTC for 5 satoahi per byte 3 days ago and still not even 1 confirmation. Any idea why?
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:28:19
if that's the case,I cant spend the 0.01 btc on that address with my electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:54
I buy a lot of coins by using Dollar Cost Averaging. In my country people only use Luno exchange or Localbitcoins.com. The miner fee is high if i want to send bitcoin to my wallet. So either we keep the btc in those exchanges (free) or incur some dynamic fee (about 0.00122 btc) to send to desired wallet.

I am all-in Bitcoin now, should I dilute some of them to altcoins? like maybe 70% BTC, 30% alt coins? or 100% bitcoins is the best?

i am new to bitcoin world. May I know who is him?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:55:26
As long as you get 2 confirmations (no matter how long it is), I will get the coin desired right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:57:14
So I am still able to spend the coin on that particular address on my Electrum wallet right?
And also if I were to copy the private key, where can I spend the coin in that address other than Electrum wallet?

That's why I am worried. Last year I did a translation project, which took much of my time (around 1 month) since there are a lot to be translated. I was afraid that by the time I have finished the project and send the project to the host and he didn't pay me the money (not bitcoin, regular international cross border bank payment). So I insisted that I would do half first and send to him and if he likes it he pays the half and I would do the remaining.

If you are a HODLER of course it is easy. What if you are like me who have been DCAing everytime I receive paycheck in Fiat. Of course I want to find the best moment to buy at low.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:12
How would I know if they would pay me after they get to see my project?

Can someone explain what does market cap mean?
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:39:19
Do most of these freelance jobs have escrows? For example, if I have finished a project, do I have to send my project first before getting paid in BTC or vice versa?

There are two ways you can see it.
1) If they want to buy altcoin they need to go through Bitcoin thus increasing value.
2) altcoin maybe unlimited but Bitcoin isn't. That's why they are called shitcoins
