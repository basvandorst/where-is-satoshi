If you think that by having bitcoin youre anti establishment maga trump huhus hurr durr, youre in for a wild ride.
By the first rule of capital, rich get richer poor gets poorer.
 
If the establishment wants your bitcoin they can get it in matter of minutes. With the amount of capital they have, purchase power, military and governmental capabilites, youre naive if you think youd stand a chance.
Im not saying bitcoin will not go to the moon 500k MAGA HUHU.png , but maybe it wont.
and the last thing youre going to regret is not selling when you had the chance and make 500% your initial investment. 
If it does goes to the moon. I congratulate you. If it dont, then dont be suprised. Read that book. Then youll dig what im about. Can you dig it?
Edit: its a good bet if you have a lot of capital to waste, if it does go to 500k MAGA TRUMP HUHU.png. youd 1million% your initial investment. It can be a good gamble. 
But if you work at mickey d's paying rent on the trimonthly basis. Id argue, use that money to buy that book. Thats all from me.

Thats the truth right there. How id wish i bought at 100bucks and sold at 19k.
Then again hindshight 20-20.
Most people would dream to become millionaires, i dont ever doubt that boy.
But when you work for the masters tending fields, you lose that bit of you little by little. Id know hoping that these shackles on my feet aint going nowhere. Id still be paying 10% interest for 30 years to own a house. 
Capital boy. Dont you ever forget that. Thats the best advice you can take. Slaves dont become masters. Thats a pipe dream however much id like for it to be contrary. Can you dig it?  MAGA TRUMP IRAQ FREEDOM HUHUS.html

I never attest to the knowledge of the future boy. Like i say, bitcoin can go MAGATRUMPHUHU.png moon 500k, or it will tank.
