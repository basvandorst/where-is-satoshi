i am doing this to study bitcoin... i am simply looking for some php code to do mining, i dont care if it is fast enough to make profit...
if it demonstrates the process of interfacing with the cli, i am very happy to find this..
thank you.

i am not asking if it is fast enough... i am asking how the process works, and is there any php code available to do this?
thank you.

oh my, do they teach this at major universities yet?
this is very detailed stuff... thank you..
this page, by itself, is a lot to digest.
very nice.

I am kinda stuck on C language..

The thing that I thought was so cool is that there are languages listed on that site that I have never even heard of, lol, and I have been a coder since 1983..

i can remember when i first began studying bitcoin, they said that there are only a limited number of bitcoins and that that is one of the reasons that they will hold their value...
nonsense.. every other dickwad with a pc has created his own digital coin, and the market has been flooded with god only knows how many digitally counterfeited bitcoins.....
i will say this in defense of bitcoin, if someone does something original and they fix a few of the issues, it is possible that bitcoin will turn around, tho i suspect that it will settle at some very low amount(perhaps $45.00 per bitcoin) and it will remain there...
gotta go.

i am saying that it is going down, whether it goes to sixty or fortyfive or $145, it is all the same, down is down..


most likely maybe not.


the doors have always been open for institutional money, just not officially, and when the door officially opens for institutional money, omg, little hackers that think they are in control of this new world currency are gonna get tossed out the rear exit door with the trash..


i have nothing to be nervous about.

this reddit system and it's busted ass voting system is so funny...
reddit bitcoin diehards think that they can downvote me out of existence..
all of you know, deep down, that bitcoin is on a dive..

yes, that would have risks associated with it..


yes, that is what i am saying, there are people that are actively jacking bitcoin, go ahead and tell us that it doesnt happen(and fairly frequently)


the success of amazon has nothing to do with my working on a forex project and amazon's success or failure has nothing to do with bitcoin.
i am saying that the concensus was(before the crash) that people are afraid of bitcoin, and they dont understand it..
the concensus(after the crash) says that people would rather mud wrestle a hyena than to buy bitcoin.
and now a few people are hanging on for dear life at $3k.
fyi, at the bitcoin meeting that i went to, one of the participants there is in the business of selling miners(by the containerload, lol) and he is so optimistic about bitcoin, he swears that the proper value of bitcoin is $80k... bullshit,.. he swears that he has the electricity cost issues under control... bullshit.
i will buy bitcoin when it hits $60.00

the sec wants to control your bitcoins..  and just because they setup some etf, does that mean that the price wont drop?
in order for bitcoin to be useful as a currency, it needs to stabilize, meaning that it cant drop of $20k to $3k overnight.
i wont be surprised at all if bitcoin drops to something like $143.00, and the sec controls all of your bitcoin transactions and all of your mining operations..
omg, are some bitcoin enthusiasts gonna be in for a wake up call..
bitcoin aint goin to no $80k, like my mining systems seller said at the meeting last night..

crap? as if i could crash bitcoin by rambling some bullshit while driving my car, lol..
