@_date: 2014-10-22 15:57:32
I store bitcoins in my database as satoshis.  It does NOT matter what you call bitcoins at the exchange in relation to how you set up your accounting software.  It simply is not two things that affect each other.

CPU mining is not profitable, unless you are going "really long" with your BTC hoping that 0.01 BTC becomes valuable 10 years from now.

@_date: 2012-07-21 05:33:32
so you'll make $4 a month.. in 3 months ASICs come out and a few months later the reward halves.. you are unlikely to get $25 by the end of the year and then you're toast.  why don't you just sell the card or take $20 a month and buy bitcoins off the exchanges, this way if bitcoins hit some crazy high value you at least have some, and get them by tomorrow when the price is low.

@_date: 2012-09-12 22:48:04
It's at the correct time, in bitcoin world.
When the clock strikes 12:00, or every revolution, the reward halves.  
When the minute hand goes around, the difficulty adjusts.
The second hand goes around every day, it's a bit more pointless than the other two.

one comment says "I was also excited with this but then I came to the conclusion that it was nothing more than...
Πρωταπριλιά! ("April's First Day" in Greek)
Nice spoof by the way."
&amp; another:
"Here's what they say on the website:
No matter how you call it - Prima Aprilis, April Fools’ Day, All Fools’ Day, Aprilscherz, Jour du poisson d’avril or Hunt the gowk Day - thank you for your sense of humour and thank you that you took our joke.

you could always sell bitcoins through any number of exchanges into the fiat currencies which you need to do those things.
plus if they had an extra $250k in bitcoin, and only spent it as they needed it, the value of the coins could increase and they would have more money.  
they could also use Bit-Pay and get the bitcoins turned into USD instantly.

I spent like 20 minutes trying to figure out how to use this.  You should boldface the text "Once the image is written, remove and re-insert the USB stick."
You CANNOT configure live-miner from itself.  The OS itself has no usable interface.  You have to configure it from Windows by formatting USB, unplug, plug it back in, and then edit the file in the folder there...  
@_date: 2012-07-13 20:45:26

i don't think a rig this size would have any noticeable impact on deepbit's hashrate, but it's always good to mine for the other pools so deepbit doesn't get too big.  I mine 4 GH/s on EMC, I like the merged mining.

i appreciate how there is no USD anywhere, that's a bonus.  coin trading only!
@_date: 2012-06-14 18:24:36
my method: PURCHASE THINGS!  well, if you're mining and you get BTC for the cost of electricty, just spend the bitcoins as you get them.. gear and goods shows up in the mail, never have to worry about losing your wallet when you save up for one item at a time.  if you're investing BTC for trading and stashing away.. that's a different story.

they say "Thank you." twice, awfully nice of them.
@_date: 2012-09-07 01:12:11
Once you have bitcoins, you have bitcoins.  The story is over.  Getting them is hard because this world NEEDS BITCOINS.  Credit cards, paypal, all other payment methods are B-S.  The fact that no one trusts Paypal and CC for bitcoin transactions is the reason that everyone is adopting bitcoin, and the reason the world needs bitcoins.  
If there was another currency that offered the same features as bitcoin, it would be a simple transfer to obtain bitcoins.  But there isn't.  I hope this makes sense.

i don't think gold is going to become obsolete anytime soon.. but it is a pretty useless metal, maybe 100 years from now people will see bitcoin as the winner of that battle.  the thing about bitcoin, though, is that there might some major hack of MtGox or something and zillions of bitcoins get sold on the market and the price of a bitcoin crashes to zero overnight.  with gold, it's physical and the price should be stable for the most part.

I use cavirtex all the time, they are my primary bitcoin exchange.

If the Mt. Gox price is going up and down a lot, it increases the windows size for the buy/sell on Canadian Bitcoins.  If the price has been really steady, buy/sell prices get closer together.

I've been waiting months for my 6-issue combo that you offered, when can I expect it?
@_date: 2013-09-04 16:45:52
If you want a rig that pays for itself in 2 months, don't order a Butterfly Labs unit which won't arrive for 10 months, impossible to do the math when you are unsure when it will arrive.  
$274 for 5 GH/s..  not actually worth it these days ($54.80 per GH/s), despite the long wait to receive it.  At [WTCR.ca]( you can buy a 13 GH/s Block Erupter Blade for 5.79 BTC ($67 per GH/s in fiat) and get it IMMEDIATELY.  They accept fiat (credit cards) so you can hedge USD with it.

I got a bum unit too.  Seems they don't test them before they send them...
