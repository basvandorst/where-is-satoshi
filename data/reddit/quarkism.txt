Why is inflationary a bad thing ? It gives users a incentive to spend and propagate the currency... instead of horde it in obscurity. Inflation is what separates currencies from stores of value.... and these cryptos are supposed to be *currencies* right ? Value growth of a currency should be natural... based on the things utility... not artificially baked in.
- Incentive to mine
- Incentive to spend, spread, share
- Incentive to consume
- Incentive to accept
- Incentive to *make an economy of it*
Frankly, I think that will be the downfall of Bitcoin. The creators were to defensive with its valuation. They didn`t trust the market to give it any *natural* value.... and in turn have sabotaged its ability to propagate to casual users.

Bitcoin will become centralized. The mines are drying up and the pools of capital will now begin to merge - just like every other industry. They only way to prevent this would be to implement inflation and allow for new capital pools to form. That has its own problems though.

Webdev here. Thinking about accepting bitcoin for digital goods. There any service providers out there? Service should include a callback to my server - not just an iframe. A .net lib would be doublegood. Anyone have any experience with this ?
