Bitcoin transactions can have many outputs. so maybe compare these numbers, i.e. how many recipients there are, with ethereum transactions? I don't know though, not an expert on that.

Technically, it would be easy to decide if that response email is fake or not. If you go to "show source" in gmail, you can see the whole raw text of the email. In the header is a DKIM signature challenge, which can be checked independently and based on google.com's domain data. 
inside gmail, you have to click on the gre-ish drop down next to the "to" email names at the top of the email. the popup would contain a "signed-by" information - that's the processed signature.

what compromise exactly? what was decided on which technical basis? 
it's a closed door agreement, no outsider knows what NDAs or side-letters there are. Many of the involved companies are financed by the very same investmentment fund, etc.
The stated goal by at least one participant is to "fire core" and take over the development. That's also a dangerous move.

wikipedia article traffic is also nice, let's see where it will settle …
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:28:10
you have to think about why there is a mining reward in the first place: it's because miners are supposed to check and confirm transactions. if their "optimization" is causing empty blocks or bogus transactions to be created (instead of collecting fees from "real" transactions), the whole system is no longer well balanced. being segwit-incompatible is just a side effect, and not really relevant for that argument I just gave.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:12:39
yes, it's in full, but why not in desktop? for me, core is a desktop wallet. for example, there is classic, where even bitcoin.com says

@_date: 2017-09-19 08:14:02
yes, better than the other ones modifying the author and breaking the licensing
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:38:17
The wallet is "mbw", which is licensed under [MICROSOFT REFERENCE SOURCE LICENSE (MS-RSL)]( 
the idea is you can reproduce the software based on the license to study it and check its inner workings, but you cannot redistribute or modify anything (which are the bare minimums to be open source).  
this is also not automatically bad, because there are good reasons to avoid ripoffs from the viewpoint of the company. probably also some security implications. it's unfortunate if you are looking for a true open source wallet.

AFAI understood it, the original claim was backed by running some cellular automata (outside of Bitcoin) and storing the data in the blockchain. It's Turing complete like a paper in a typewriter. Everything else is unclear, lots of deceptions and confusing words...

@_date: 2018-02-12 11:04:00
well, assuming the monitoring system is unbiased, it can certainly check if a node is online (determine the uptime), see how often which settlement types did happen in the blockchain, etc.
I think it could be a big problem, e.g. think about the case of hostile  nodes in LN itself, which start acting in a harmful way. I know, it's costly, but still possible.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:58:23

Idea: start a full Ethereum node today and watch what happens. e.g. when are you up to date with the latest block? memory and CPU usage?
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:49:39
Why do you think this "quick bump" is easy or safe? I'm really curious.
Segwit is super elegant and backwards compatible. What you don't see with such a "bump" is the 100% certain split into two Bitcoin-coins – which kills it for me and many others. It also doesn't solve the asicboost issue and well, nor does it solve full blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:15:31
I was telling anyone who asked me even back in 2011 about increasing fees once there are more transactions. It sounded too far away and simply increasing the blocksize sounded like a good idea for later. Nobody realized that increasing the blocksize only makes spamming cheaper and hence blocks will always be full no matter what.
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:46:21
a change in the nonwitness-blocksize is a hardfork. me, and many others, will not support that and hence it's a dangerous move.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:51:02
does scaling the time-x-axis makes any sense?

How is your calculation for assembling and verifying such a 30gb block? I'm curious.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:07:39
Bitcoin was always titled as an experiment, and whatever was written about the purpose in the white paper was a possible interpretation out of thin air. IMHO today in retrospect, it's much clearer to see what's possible and what's not.

False. I wasn't allowed either.
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:23:16
my perception is there is nobody in the uasf camp fundamentally against bigger blocks in the long term. short term, there are other options on the table, which will help much better and don't add the dangers of a hardfork. once these safer options are exhausted, there will be a reasonable block size increase.

I'm mainly thinking about assembling them and in particular about all UTXOs. They need to be available, usually in memory. I assume there are orders of magnitude more of them, so validating does not only take up more memory, but will also require to have a sharded service to query them. I want to know how in your assumptions the time to assemble a block stays (say) below 1 minute...

Well, all I wanted is to get emails when they appear on the mailing list (i.e. lurking), but I got

Please point me to "2x" in 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:50:40
that's an incompatible implementation, hence it shouldn't even have "bitcoin" anywhere in its name
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:25:47
For future predictions, you also have to compare to VISA's future number of transactions. I bet they also increase exponentially...
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:52:06
... and bitcoinABC?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:07:34
So, just to summarize, a 50x increase in transactions and then a decline to the levels before while the price stays roughly the same, signal to you an influx to altcoins? Honestly, that makes no sense to me. A more natural explanation would  be to classify these transactions as spam. Especially, when you look at them, you'll see that many have unnatural patterns.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:03:04
I think the author is 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:15:58
aren't those scaling pressures solved already, and fees went down?
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:56:46
I see you've never read Luke-jr's BIP proposal for increasing the blocksize: 
(I assume you don't like the content, but it is a bs increase, and it is far in the future)
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:55:47
there is no "2x" part of segwit
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:08:12
so, that's why they also sold all their bitcoins and bought alts?
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:21:49
any block size increase is a hard fork. bitcoin's true power is that it stays honest with its roots. these two aspects do not go well together. "core" only embraces that fundamental truth, and pursues to exhaust all soft-fork improvements first. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:10:13
I also voted yes, because Segwit increases the blocksize. They should clarify that...
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:57:47
comparing virtual problems to real constraints always goes wrong.
one could argue that there are much better video codecs than in the 90ties. the fun contradiction is that the amount of data sent through the wire also went up significantly. therefore it's something that goes hand in hand.
Segwit "1.0" solves some technical debt which needs to be addressed first. That's the clear path forward. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:15:53
you base your argument on what? did you follow the discussions and attend those various presentations about it?
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:11:03

First, you didn't answer my questions and just deflect with something else. Therefore, I have to conclude you haven't follow any discussions. Ok. I'm neutral towards newbies.
Now you counterargument by nitpicking about "only" or not. So pointless.
Layer 2 solutions are massively important and I can't follow why it is bad to help them emerge.

segwit is a cool update solving a couple of issues. that's why it's necessary for bitcoin. why shouldn't we have it? is it broken? just because some miners are against it?

rough summary:
* bitcoin is decentralized
* not anonymous, but it's usually unknown who owns which "number" (they explain it a bit as an analogous to a public telephone book)
* venezuela, the government is against bitcoin users, etc.
* blockchain: could be used to organize more than just data (land, etc.)
* ethereum, nobody could interfere with running programs
* they write about  
* smart contracts
* online gambling on top of ethereum ("Rouleth")
* if "bitcoin == pocket calculator" → "ethereum == iphone"
* vitalik is weird, wears fluffy house shoes at a conference, but ether increased 25x
* in the end it goes dark: smart contract to assassinate
 a politician (no real explanation how it works, just that the "killer opens an address and gets the reward" ???)
* some silk road 2.0 fantasies
* ends with “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.” ― Albert Camus
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:39:21
my understanding:
ad 1: there is no NYA signal, just some information about potentially signaling later, to signal a real signal. (there were complaints about segwit being complicated, their signalling rules beat that)
ad 2+3: I never clearly read that the 2mb hardfork comes after segwit activation. Hence the outcome could very well be that (2) isn't reached, segwit not activated, and then there is still a 2mb hardfork. I think this is plausible, because it uses confusion around segwit as a smokescreen to pursue their original agenda.

that's nonsense, multisig isn't only for corporate interests. do you just babble along technical jargon and mix in "corporate interests" and similar terms? besides that, multisigs are **also**  transactions, not something else.

in theory, it's a "logic puzzle", but in reality, a much better explanation is a "distributed lottery".
anything about "math problem" implies there is a solution and it contains viable information, etc. "lottery" captures the idea about randomness and being distributed much better.

This, and all similar coin control features, are really missing and should be implemented and exposed on the UI level. But at the same time, scalability and security is more important. To fix both at the same time, Bitcoin needs more developers! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:52:18
are you using randomly assigned ip addresses? (vodaphone and on 3g hints this to me). that's why you're probably using an ip address that has been blocked in the past. toggle network off and on, maybe you get a new one, or just wait a bit or use a proxy.
however: pro tipp: do not post your IP address publicly, it's at the bottom of the screenshot
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:10:45
for me this isn't surprising. it's also no surprise to me that segwit is considered unfair because it penalizes  transactions with a large number of outputs.
