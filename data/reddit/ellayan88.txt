I’ve heard that it isn’t banned anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:29:38
Exactly. That never made sense to me.

I know what it sounds like. I just want someone to completely prove it wrong. To show me why it’s stupid.

Wow ok, so I guess the mystery is solved. Thanks for sharing.

No, it didn’t extend past my iPhone screen. I read it all.

I’ve thought about this before, and what if the FBI knows he’s Satoshi? How do we know they didn’t stumble upon evidence that he was Satoshi? We’ll never know, though, because we’re all on a need-to-know basis, so all we can do is theorize.

So, who is Satoshi?
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:10:07
Satoshi will always be anonymous as long as we don’t know who he/she is.

Maybe there was more than one Dread Pirate Roberts...?

That statement doesn’t exclude Ulbricht from being Satoshi. Maybe what you mean is that Satoshi is probably some guy who isn’t “famous”. Why do you think that Satoshi isn’t someone we already know or have heard of?

I saw a documentary on Ross’s life and know all about his endeavors, but we need to keep in mind that maybe it’s not all out there, that we never really know what someone is up to. How do they know all those things? Did Ross tell them his life story himself? I don’t think so , it’s all from researching and asking around. Ross seems like a private person, and he’s most likely an introvert. You’d be amazed at what most people can keep secret. We’ll never find “good evidence” from googling info. Just imagine what people would say about you if your story was told from your friends’ and aquaintances’ perspectives. It would be pretty incomplete, right? I know mine would be. I just think that we don’t know everything and we need to keep that in mind.

I suspected this. I once saw a documentary where they got one of the best hackers in the world, if not the best, I forget his name now, but they told him to try to hack the bitcoin code and he said that it was like "intelligent code", that it would look like there was a way in way in but then would block him and make that "entry" disappear. 
This is why some people think bitcoin was created by A.I.

Not miners for sure, but maybe future bitcoin millionaires...?

Yeah, the law will probably catch up��
