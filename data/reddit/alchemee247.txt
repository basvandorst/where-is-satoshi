No bitcoin is a waste fo energy and zero practicality. Don't you get it gold is a way better store of value you know with the 20time more power and inflationary model. Who even likes fixed supply's. And I just love it when mining companys find huge deposits and the every increasing supply. pfft Bitcoin is bad at least that's what my 60 year old commerce teacher said
