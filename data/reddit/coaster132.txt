Corrections after spurts of growth are normal and necessary, even on a small scale. We're still above $11,500 so I'm not complaining.
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:21:23
I will admit that he's not wrong about the wages point. People's salaries would be randomly doubling and cutting in half.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:24:54
underrated comment
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:20:58
Ehhh 7k is a bit of a stretch
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:38:10
Hit it at 11,800, hopefully that's right.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:52:59
My gut tells me we'll stay around 11k for a little while, but nobody really knows.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:27:23
I get the feeling that the worst is over, but it's not too late to buy the dip...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:46:17
I don't like comments like this. Optimism is important, but it's also important to realize that we don't know ANYTHING for certain about where the price is going.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:59:38
"alts such as bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:38:29
get those vibes outta here
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:39:05
It's not GDAX's fault, its the bank
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:42:21
Too low
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:32:07
If everyone believes the price will go up, the will hold on to their currency and not sell. If nobody sells as others/new people continue to buy, the price will go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:45:21
I bought already at 11800 yesterday thinking I had scooped the dip, I don't have big enough balls to buy again...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:22:40
Same here my man. Let's pray it bounces back soon.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:49:16
Close enough. To the moon we go.
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:40:56
How will the contract expiring effect bitcoin prices?
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:32:05
Thought I was getting to bed at a reasonable time tonight... guess not. Gonna try to time this perfectly.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:46:18
I had one set at 10,800 which filled like 30 minutes ago, and I've got one waiting at 10,500 and 10,000. I'm not sure the 10k one is gonna fill tonight, but you never know.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:25:18
I've set buy orders to buy the dip, which I wouldn't do if I didn't anticipate it going back up, if that helps
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:07:59
The price got within $20 of where I had set my sell order, then it just dumped. This requires a lot of patience.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:54:18
Keep selling, folks. I've got a buy order set for $10,650 that I want filled today ;)
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:26:11
Up we go
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:05:59
I don't know if you know this, but this is the thread for daily discussion about Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:26:44
What are you basing that on?
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:42:27
It honestly blows my mind that people think it's going to hit 7k. That's insane. I doubt it will go below 9k at all, let alone 8 or even 7k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:44:28
When it's flying high, everyone wishes it would dip so they could buy more. When it actually does, everyone flips shit and panic sells. Chill out, buy the dip, and you'll be thanking yourself in a month and a half.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:47:40
I don't know who told you we'll ever see 6k again, but I wouldn't count on it
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:03:36
I think it would take some serious manipulation for it to fall below 10k. I think this is just normal movement, and we all should just be patient and wait for it to do it's thing.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:49:24
It's good to keep an eye on it, but you have to be careful not to obsess over it or you'll lose your mind.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:28:33
This is some wild shit going on right now
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:55:31
If you're already signed up on coinbase, gdax might be easiest. The website is a little clunky on mobile but it works.
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:42:40
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:08:08
Reminder that everything here is just speculation and no one knows for sure where the price is going. Invest carefully and intelligently.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:03:57
Made some solid progress in the last hour, you guys think we'll break 11.5k tonight?
Edit: Jesus I look away for half a second and it's past $11,550 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:06:53
appreciate it homie
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:53:00
Lmao if that ain't me. I have a buddy who is still in bitcoin and is now taunting me, and I had even started to tell myself I wouldn't rule out getting back in if it took off
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:48:23
Holy shit.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:41:12
idk if I would call it bullish though, btc was waaaay oversold after that huge leg down so a little reverse bart was overdue
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:14
Dammit, I sold mine last night at 12.2k. There's more to life than money, there's more to life than money...
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:50:31
I hope y'all shorted lol.
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:38:11
Look up margin trading on bitmex, and how to use leverage
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:53:57
Literally nobody knows. That's kind of the fun of it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:05:53
Oh, I guess that makes sense
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:16:40
I'm 20 and in a similar situation, and I just dropped $1k on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:58:56
I honestly doubt it's even going to dip past 7500, let alone 7000. Just my opinion. I just bought some more as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:02
I bought at 7,300 someone hold me
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:26:30
WHOOPS TO THE MOON
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:10:02
What did coinbase do that ruined it?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:22:04
lmao... this isn't twitter
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:02:29
I just bought as well. Up we go.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:16:31
It's funny how when the price us flying high, everyone wants it to crash so they can buy more. But when it actually does, everyone panics and goes "What's happening should I sell!!?"
Calm your shit and just buy the dip. You'll be thankful. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:08
might be about to go below 10k again...
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:19:15
I'm kicking myself more for putting some of my bitcoin in bitcoin cash for a brief time, I lost some money on that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:50:54
"What am I doing this for again?"
"A reddit meme now shut the fuck up and hold this phone"
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:28:11
But if you do it with a credit/debit card on coinbase it's instant, just with a 2.5% fee if that's worth it for you
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:17:02
In my opinion, I don't think it'll be going below 7500 again, unless there's another attack of some kind.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:56:42
I just bought 0.1 BTC, if the price suddenly drops more I'm gonna be kicking myself
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:19:56
*2 hours later*
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:12:40
Same homie. Hodl. It'll get better, just give it time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:16:03
The last one started around this time of night as well.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:43:19
ergh I'm so anxious about it
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:06:22
$7,211 here.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:34:57
There's a big wall right at 7500, so it's really unlikely that it's going to dip below that. Just saying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:10:08
I don't think I can type that fast
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:59:24
I'm (almost) willing to bet it won't be dipping lower. But hey, no one knows for sure. I bought at 7502 anyways so it's just a waiting game for me now.
@_date: 2019-12-07 10:49:22
I cant believe this was posted unironically
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:01:01
There's a big wall of 170 BTC holding it up, so it's not likely.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:49:57
Looks like we're gonna test 8.4k-8.5k resistance again. Here's to hoping.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:04:19
My guts take offense to that.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:06:48
looks like a textbook dead cat if you ask me
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:37:50
what the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:51:18
God dammit.
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:37:54
????? dude this bitcoin chart is from like august or something lol. If you posted this with an updated chart it wouldn't fir at all
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:17:34
I can't bring myself to sell... I'm too afraid it'll moon without me. When should I sell?
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:10:37
fomo bought a bit lol. hopefully it doesn't bite me.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:28:44
Nobody knows how low it's gonna go, and no one should care. It'll come back up eventually, just be patient.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:25:49
Fellas, set alerts and get on with your life. Trust me.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:12:36
Agree 100%
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:46:58
oof yikes. never use robinhood for crypto dude its garbage. their stocks/options are great but crypto not so much
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:50:11
To be honest, my gut is sorta telling me the same thing. I don't have the balls to sell though.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:33:41
what the entire fuck
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:24:18
Inverted head and shoulders my asshole. It all means nothing. The price goes where it goes, no one can predict anything.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:17:47
That's an excellent way of putting it.
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:09:47
you could have used a limit order on coinbase pro and paid literally 0 fees
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:31:34
Totally organic movement. Nothing to see here, please move along.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:47:35
We're about to test that 8k buy wall.
Edit: And here we go. Buckle up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:57:06
10k might be a stretch... I'm rooting for 9k
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:37:31
Bitcoin isn't here to entertain us.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:56:00
I got a hunch we'll scratch 9k at some point before morning
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:15:52
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:47:07
When exactly is Robinhood opening it's crypto exchanges? Does anyone know yet?
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:10:46
Can you be a little less obvious?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:19:25
With enough will power. If we all open the charts and clench really hard, something might happen.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:44:04
Is that because of the chinese new year?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:09:48
Double bottom?
Edit: Guess not.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:57:38
Did you buy at 11.7k or what? Also you haven't "lost" anything unless you sold.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:43:47
All three of these accounts have no previous post history....
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:07:32
Hello fellow Crypto-kids, how do you do?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:25:19
You know what... Close enough.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:14:18
Don't have weak hands guys. I don't think we'll go super low tonight.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:59:19
What a joy this is to watch
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:13:09
I've never seen so much fomo. Please be careful, guys.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:37:18
I decided to start day trading about 3 weeks ago with $2500 - I'm now down to $1,700. Haven't given up though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:57:45
Call me a panic seller if you want, but I'm out. I sold it all. I don't think we've seen the bottom yet, but when we do I'm getting back in. I've got an order in for 6.5k.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:33:42
These daily threads are becoming nothing but FUD
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:20:59
Was that a new bottom? I kinda hope not, cause I had a stop loss order at 7999 lol.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:57:43
You can edit your post
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:02:01
at least you didn't panic sell at 6.2k like me
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:09:10
This shit really needs to slow down so I can buy lmao
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:43:25
I'm pretty sure coinbase is airing an ad
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:39:30
Baseless FUD attempt. Get out.
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:43:27
I sold too early and now I'm getting fomo :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:16:22
I sure hope so
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:06:54
Not again..
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:23:32
guess I sold at a bad time huh 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:57:48
...I don't think that's that he meant when he said poor.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:20:33
What lol?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:11:20
Threads like this are why I come to this sub.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:51:17
That 8500 wall looks mighty tough
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:48:59
I'm getting a little sick of your baseless optomism
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:00:12
That's a bit of a stretch mate
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:45:26
Looooooooool. Humor goes over people's head sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:59:23
$0.11 within the next 45 minutes everyone sell now
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:46:08
Does the Chinese New Year really have an effect on bitcoin prices? I went back and looked at price trends around CNY and couldn't really make out any discernible trends.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:19:09
Keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:32:43
yeah of course
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:03:56
Resistance at 8k is strong, but I really think it's going to fall below it tonight
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:09:44
Welp I bought at 9000. Guess I'm going down with this ship.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:29:07
That 8700 wall is a real tough cookie
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:37:10
I'll come back in 2 hours to see if you're right. I sure hope you are.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:07:24
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:57:57
ouch that wasn't fun to watch
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:59:53
I've heard this said before, but I just feel like the downtrend won't last that long, given the amount of adoption that's happening thanks to recent mainstream attention.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:36:20
I'll set a stop order for some of it, but where do you think the bottom is going to be? How long before we get there?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:35:11
If this isn't a bull flag I don't know what is
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:47:53
What do you use to set alerts?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:19:12
Holt shit dude congrats. You timed that perfectly. I had mine set at 6.5k lol so I got nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:09:18
to the moon bubble and lambo
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:38:37
why would you sell right now lmao
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:07:57
damn, must just be me then, thanks
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:31:23
Probs gonna bleed for a few more days, no big deal. Just be patient, and maybe buy if you can.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:09:30
Price predictions for the evening/night? I personally think it's going to stay around the 8k - 8.4k area for a while, before making any sort of significant swing up (or down, who knows).
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:00:18
I don't know why this sub hates daytrading so much. It's difficult and takes time and effort to learn, sure, but is certainly more rewarding than hodling is.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:51:31
go away
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:00:46
All hail this guy who can apparently see the future
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:41:11
got fomo and bought at 9,064 lmao
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:24:17
Even the title is worded like a trump tweet
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:25:17
Just traded for a profit of $18 don't @ me.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:20:12
You know it's going to happen again. This downtrend isn't done yet.
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:28:54
Ignore people like this. Ignore anything that is baseless, hype or FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:07
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:29:45
Literally as soon as a buy it crashes
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:15:02
Possibly never
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:20:42
I'm not convinced yet
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:36:48
How much do you guys think the whole Robinhood adoption will actually effect the price?
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:08
There's no way it holds 6.5k tbh
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:24:29
I bought at 9500 lol. Just wait it out.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:13:55
Totally organic jump nothing to see here
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:32:46
Pretty bullish of you. my gut is pointing in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:41:14
Those look pretty slick not gonna lie
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:40:57
it's been a year
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:58:44
The guy also bought most of his coins in January.
