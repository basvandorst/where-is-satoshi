If you have your own money, buy bitcoin through localbitcoins. Nobody will know but you. Tell no one.

Why? Because it's Bitcoin. That's what it's designed to do. When everyone slowly figures this out the price goes even higher even faster, drawing more attention and curiosity. Yeah. Hodlmuch?

Processing has nothing to do with storage limits. Small blocks are sustainable. Large aren't. And nobody gives a shit about Bitcoin forks. Buy Bitcoin. It's simple.

Not sure, but this seems like a good way to have your Bitcoin stolen.

Bitcoin doesn't have the privacy that monero does. Spending bitcoin on illegal purchases is a bad idea because it's a public blockchain. The transactions are there for anybody to see. Use your bitcoin to buy monero. Then don't anything illegal with it. Also, there's drug testing services to make sure you got what you got.  You should always test with a kit to be sure. Harm reduction, they call it.
