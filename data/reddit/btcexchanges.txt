Bitstamp needs to prove they still control coins right now.
Sign messages with cold storage addresses. No excuses.

What do they have to hide?
@_date: 2015-01-05 08:53:02
The person who withdraws. I recently learned that there are exchanges who already do that (and more), but naturally they'll have a tough time gaining users for a while. That's why I hope to make some noise in the Bitcoin community, to raise awareness.

They *claim* to have lost 5 million dollars. How trustworthy is someone who may or may not be insolvent?
It's on them to prove their words.
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:14:20
Bitstamp owes us proof for their claims of BTC reserves.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:31:58
The fact that they don't provide this, or even talk about audits doesn't reflect well on them.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:05:22
The fact that they still haven't put out any proof of reserves speaks volumes about them.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:34:45
I completely forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder. It's sad where their priorities are (android app and trading UI).
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:42:24
How about multi-sig for withdrawals?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:25:51
Yeah, this "audit" thing would be really nice to have.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:46:52
Less words, more address signatures proving how much BTC Bitstamp presently owns in cold storage.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:38:04
Stalling in a similar way to MtGox.
Still no proof that they control a single satoshi.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:58:46
Yes, you wouldn't know the percentage, but judging from past "audits" of Bitstamp where they revealed total BTC, it would be a good gauge of how fucked they are. 0% or 50% coins is a big difference.
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:57:00
Or maybe Bitstamp is hiding something.
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:51:38
Hell, they still haven't proven that they own a single satoshi.
Signing messages with the cold storage addresses should be standard procedure after a hack like this.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:36:31
Where's the proof of BTC reserves?
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:40:27
They need to prove how much cold storage BTC they have right now.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:30:49
How about point 1 and 2?
It may be that multisig is unworkable, but bitalo at least claims to have implemented it, and someone mentioned yacuna. I can't vouch for them, so I'm interested if you have any criticism in how they do it.
I'm not an engineer, how is it my job to do this for Bitstamp? Is it such a terrible thing to suggest that ways of reducing required client's trust in exchanges should be at least *explored*? The only thing we have been doing in the past is switch from one exchange to another, and they all have the same faults.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:01:35
How about they prove it?
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:55:05
Proving they still have funds would help.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:58:24
All we have so far are words from a hacked company that may or may not be insolvent.
They haven't proved they still control a single satoshi. Why?
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:12:24
After reading up on how bitalo does it, it seems the way is to have an entire wallet, so they can just send to the next address. If you use a deterministic wallet, you only need one seed and you will be able to get the private keys for all the addresses to sign with.
I can't say much more though, this is only me speculating with my limited technical Bitcoin background. I just know that it can and has been done. I'm hoping some actual wallet/exchange devs can chime in and clear things up.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:03:21
In the meantime, they should provide proof of the funds they control. All we've had so far are words.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:12:24
Thanks for the response, though multi-signature is something different: Users hold a private key and the exchange holds one, so noone can withdraw from the exchange without your private key even if it's hacked.
Unfortunately, it seems that Kraken still requires you to trust in their team. I don't know if that's more warranted than Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:42:27
Even if it's not a Gox 2.0, we deserve having exchanges where you can be sure that your BTC cannot be stolen even if the exchange is hacked.
The fact that people are panicking over what should be a minor inconvenience says everything about the state of the exchanges.
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:00:25
They *still* haven't proven how much BTC they control.
