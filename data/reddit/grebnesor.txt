Yea, I always feel like I have to correct, even though I get the down votes.  I love bitcoin, if it makes any difference and own it as well.  That does not change the fact that it is fiat.  Thanks!

I don't really understand your problem, you are just being a DICK!  This dude has produced a product, for our consumer driven economy.  Yes it's more expensive but who gives a fuck.... Don't buy it then.  You really don't know much about his product but are trying to refute his claims, with your baseless claims.  Get back in the dirt you pig, does not sound like you really need a comb any ways!

Hi Friend,
Thanks for the response!  I don't think you understand how bitcoin or Fiat actually work, which is totally ok, it can be very confusing.  I am going to try to go through this quickly as I don't have much time.
Government fiat, the idea that you stated above is partially correct and partially incorrect, and I can understand how you made the mistake.  Government fiat is backed by the word of the government, yes, but it is actually not backed by any physical assets.  For instance, lets say the US dollar started to slide, the government could not/would not, come into the market place and say, well we are going to back this with all of our military supplies, so the value of our currency is at X.  Also if there is a slide in the currency the government will not dole out gold or other assets to back the currency.  Fiat currency is defined as: "a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of."
So fiat currency, like the USD, is determined by economic health, and is floated on the international exchange.  Traders make determinations about the health of the economy tied to the currency and decide values based on the economic indicators.  I can see why you would be confused though, as your quick description makes more logical sense.
Ok on to bitcoin, bitcoin like the USD is a fiat currency.  The currency is a part of a larger economy, which was created on the internet for all sorts of different things.  From your post above it seems that you might not be aware of all the companies now accepting bitcoin like overstock, dell, travelocity, and the California State Government.  I know that its easy to see an article or two saying that bitcoin is only for nefarious dealings, but this is inaccurate.  I say inaccurate, because you are correct bitcoins can be used to buy bad things, but so can cash money from any government fiat system.  So I kind of fail to see your point.  
Regardless holding money created outside of the influence of government provides many advantages and freedom minded individuals around the world see these merits.  I understand you might disagree with them, but the sort of pandering you responded with will do no good to change anyone's opinion. 
I appreciate your candor about this, and hope I have been able to clear up some misconceptions you had.  
Have a great day!

So quick question please explain why government fiat has value, while internet fiat does not?  In this humble man's opinion things have value if people affix a value to them.... Diamonds are just rocks, but if we affix a value to them, they are worth fiat.  I don't think people are saying that bitcoin is a commodity, I believe they are saying it is an alternative fiat.  Fiat currency has no backing, only the expectation that others will give it value.

I disagree, Deflation is not only bad in Keynesian economics, its is also bad in classical, neo-classical and our current economic methodology which we might as well call post-modern classical :). Deflation still has effects on revenue and inputs, saying a blanketed its not bad is to ignore any possible negative effects, even if you disagree about their impact.   
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:00:53
Because inputs, such as labor, would not decrease.  How you would envision paying employees less money because the value of the currency is increasing?  Seems like a tough sell...  Labor intensive companies would have decreasing revenue but stagnate, at best, costs. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:19:31
In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.  Source Wikipedia.  Please don't limit definitions of words so you can try to make a point.  I am not saying any of this is bad, I am trying to extrapolate the effects of deflation on a bitcoin economy.  Do you think that honest discussion is bad? Why?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:17:43
Great response!
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:52:30
Deflation means companies are earning less currency.  This means revenues would be less year over year.  Declining revenues are bad for companies.  Declining revenues mean that GDP would be less in an economy.  Less GDP is bad in a comparative world of different economies. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:37:09
This is a great point, thanks for the post!  So this is what I was trying to get at.  If bitcoin is standing on its own, as in it has become the dominate economy in the world, how would this work?  We are not comparing it to USD any more, and there are deflationary pressures still present, since inputs are lowering.  How is it being dealt with then? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 12:15:49
This might be the best answer in this whole thread!  So in layman's terms, as output from the bitcoin economy starts to increase, the rate at which trade is happening increases, therefore the rate of bitcoins being transferred in the the economy is increasing.  So even if there is a fix amount of coins in the system since these coins are relatively rapidly being traded prices would not be effect? 
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:46:47
The issue is a company would be earning less money, what would be the correction for this?  Sure investment might rise in the currency itself, but people tend to not invest in a company that might be profitable but has declining revenues year over year.  Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:59:23
Awesome response and 100% correct!
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:56:56
Turns out you are correct sir, here is an article explaining your general observation 
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:01:57
Negative interest rates do not work the way you have described.  Negative interest rates refer to the rate the government, some banks, and highly rate companies receive for bonds.  This means that when they get a bond for 5 euro, they only need to pay back 4.5 euro, if they had a negative 10% interest rate.  This does not extend to personal loans, or even loans in general.  Deflation is not a good thing for Europe and the Euro is currently trying to fight against it, which is why they are getting into the game of quantitative easing.  The issue with this premise is we are getting into interest rates and deflation does not need to explicitly deal with interest rates, and it brings a lot more complexity to the question I was asking.  I appreciate the input but don't really want to go down that rabbit whole today, others are more than welcome.
Please demonstrate how lower revenues would not mean a lower GDP.  GDP is calculated based on economic activity, but is a basis for output.  The best metric used to demonstrate this is currency accumulation/revenue.
The basis for currency competition is based on GDP, economic health, debt levels, and I am sure a lot more.  When comparing the strength of an economy we use GDP to better understand how different economies measure up against each other.  Currently economies around the world are compared regardless if they are inflationary vs deflationary.  Are you suggesting that economies should not be compared to one another?

Viability as a stand alone economy, sorry if I did not state that.  I believe in bitcoin, but this is an inherently economic question.  I never said anything about economic collapse, but a lot of what I have read is about a long term transition over to crypto.  My contention is I don't see how its possible with deflationary pressures to have bitcoin standing on its own, as in it will never get to that point, so doomsday scenarios about collapse are irrelevant.   
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:50:26
I disagree with your only questions that matter.  If bitcoin is to function as an economy, then businesses will be denominated in bitcoins.  If this is the case people would be hesitant to invest in businesses that have declining year over year revenue.  Businesses would be negatively effected by the increased value of currency and would have rising costs.  These rising costs, as human capital would not be decreasing, would mean that gross revenue would be decreasing and negatively effecting the profit margins.  Can it be stopped/is it secure has nothing to do with this question, the question has to do with long term viability.
Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:56:18
  this supports what you are saying. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:24:27
This brings up a great point, loans.  In  deflationary system, loans would be infeasible.  I borrow 100 bitcoin from you today, at a 1% interest rate for the next 10 years.  Meaning that I pay you some where around 10 BTC for the loan, and 100 BTC to repay.  Right now those BTC are worth a total of around $25K, but lets say deflation continues, and each BTC is worth $1K, which means my loan is now worth 4 times what I took it out for originally.  Would we no longer have debt and loans?  How would this issue be solved, or is it all just hazard of the borrower.   
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:22:27
It is a position held in economics, that when money gains value people tend to hold on to it for longer, waiting for prices to bottom out/value to rise.  When value of a currency is decreasing people tend to spend it as fast as possible as they want to extract as much value as they can from their diminishing currency.  If you look at bitcoin, a lot of people are holding bitcoin waiting to see what will happen.  I am willing to bet the savings rate within bitcoin is extremely high.  Where as if you look at most other economies with high inflation you will see the saving rate is very low and people spend their money right when they get it.  Extreme example would be the Wiemar Republic.

I mean yea, plainly stated Deflation is bad for debtors and inflation is bad for lenders.  The thing to remember is that bitcoin is still a fiat currency, which is the same as all the others, the only real different is that there are limits to the creation and control of the currency, which governments/people can not get around.  I think its a stretch to say its like gold since gold is a physical asset, but as of now the valuation as been mimicking that of gold.  
All the other stuff about captial goods, I can't argue against, its true on the basis of elastic and inelastic economic theory.   
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:15:02
100% agree, this is exactly how I feel and how I save.  Lots of pots all around, some in the market, some in retirement, some in savings, some in gold/silver/copper and some in bitcoin.  Each one has a specific reason and a specific length that I plan to hold it there for.  The world is not an all or nothing game.

Take a look at this article it dives a bit more into the topic and does a great job of explaining why conventional analysis of deflation seems backwards 
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:27:04
So each year you would need to renegotiate wages with your employees, essentially giving them a negative raise?  eg. Deflation was 7% this year, so we are only going to reduce your salary by 4%, since you did such a good job this year?
I have less of an issue, and by less I mean no, with the price of other inputs like raw materials decreasing.  For me it really comes down to wages.  But the more that I am thinking about what you have written, the idea would be deflation exists, but the decrease in inputs would or could be constrained by the stickyness of wages.
I do not think that deflation is necessarily a horrible thing, but when you think about it in relation to the business cycle, it certain causes issues, especially in the short to medium run.  When coming off a system, which at its basis, relies on inflation, deflationary pressures can cause problems when comparing two companies which are valued in the two different currencies.  That said the more I think about that, the decrease in revenue and profits from a bitcoin company would necessarily be offset by the increase in value of bitcoin vs the other currency.  In-conclusion, as bitcoin is rising to prominence the issue of deflation should not be an issue because of the relative value on the free float exchange markets, and once bitcoin becomes the dominate player in the markets, the issues of sticky wages will be solved with new ways of dealing with wages, such as a negative raise?  Would you say this is correct, or am I missing something here?

Sorry for my ignorance, I am not sure that I understand why people would be against this....  Is it because if we can hard fork for an increase in the block size, we can hard fork for other things, like an increase in the coin supply?  Sorry for the uneducated question but I have been reading about this for a while and have not see why the increase in the block size would be bad.

SO I agree and disagree with your statement.  Gold is very easy to buy for the normal person and you can get it by the gram which is about $44.  Its a great store of real and sustained value, as has been proven by time.  That said the growth of the investment in gold is only sustained by inflation of fiat currencies, so essentially gold is only a hedge against inflation, not an investment.  Bitcoin on the other hand is both a store of value and an investment as the value vs other fiats rise faster than the rate of inflation, and will continue on this path as more acceptance of the currency and more transactions are processed.  Have an up vote!
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:54:14
I buy my gold from reputable foundries, they are all 100% guaranteed, and if you are not doing this when buying gold you are a fool, its easy to do.  But yes the fiat currency of the USD is paying for a physical asset that has had value for thousands of years.  Beyond the intrinsic value there is also real value as it is a material used in may industrial and commercial products.  If you track the real value of gold, in terms of the things that an OZ of gold will buy you, it has held its value for hundreds of years.

No one is saying that purchases stop, but they do slow, as people hold the currency longer expecting prices to fall increasing their purchasing power.  Yes food and fuel would still be purchased, but cars, computers, houses, etc, would have a slowing effect.

This is a question, so please don't down vote.  I am invested in bitcoin, but I am starting to hear about side chains and changing the chain to allow for larger blocks.  If we are able to make these changes to the system, is it not possible that down the road, people/governments could try to change the block chain to allow additional coins?  I understand that changes have to be accepted by the community, but lets say the US government buys a huge block of coins, would they not be able to overwhelm the system in modifying the code to allow the creation of additional coins?  I have not seen this addressed before, sorry if its a dumb question.
Edit:  Thanks for all the replies, this makes sense to me.  I do think there is still risk that if the USG decided to become a major miner of coins that they could effect changes, but its seems unlikely and people would get wind of it.  Hopefully being able to head off the changes that the "mega" miner would be doing.
Thanks!
