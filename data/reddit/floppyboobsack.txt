That's the best description of a bubble I've ever read.

I really REALLY want another viable service other than PP. But is BTC it? The value fluctuates so wildly so as a currency it has some shortfalls. There is no protection for the average user against user error like more traditional money transfer methods. If my CC falls into the wrong hands, the bank has safety in place (as does PP). As I understand it, if my wallet info(key) falls into the wrong hands there is nothing to be done, right?

Well, I am NO fan of Paypal but the problem is often that people don't know the ins and outs of taking money from customers. It does not matter if you use a Paypal account or a merchant account from a bank, if someone charges you back on a credit card you can be screwed. In that case it really has nothing to do with Paypal, they simply provide the CC company with your proof. 
If you are talking about a PP dispute, you should have sent an invoice specifying a *service* was being paid for (as opposed to a material item) and then you would have likely won the dispute. Also it says your account was limited when you received the money in the first place which might have been part of the problem.
The best thing to do with PP is DO NOT LEAVE MONEY IN THERE. Transfer it out immediately.

I'm checking into bitcoin out of curiousity... and am I missing something? How are you not completely freaking out that you just lost ~10k in an instant with no hope of getting it back. At least with banks you have someone to call and all sorts of security in place. Everyone in this thread seems to act like this is the norm.
