It's absurd and illegally and immorally.

Then how could I send YOU a btc, now that you provided such an address?
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:48:24
1 btc = 1 btc
or 1 btc = $30 million because $1 today = $60 then.
1 btc = infinity China currency, because I don't think China can last thus long.

It's better to use coinbase if you can.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:09:36
Hi coinbase, it's not neutral. 
You said Poloniex did not sign, and kraken remorse after sign. All the partial facts you picked are negative and implying they support ChinaBU. 
What you tried to hide is that Poloniex supports core although they did not sign that letter, and Kraken reiterated that they agree with the letter after the concern you talked about. 
It's not good to pretend to be neutral.

Sure. But I think it's not compromise-able.
This time, that ONE China super big miner wants to control Bitcoin code. 
They failed to control Bitcoin code. So they built an altcoin, and want to call it "Bitcoin".

@_date: 2017-05-07 05:22:39
Stop spamming nonsense.
Typical double standard. Maxwell could actually act as a proxy for current core.
Unless you know wthats happened and happening, you cant understand why so many people see Blockstream as a potential risk for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:29:41
But BS does not think so. If you read the past words of BS devs very much, you will know they does not care. Yes they certainly can give us many excuses, but they cant provide any resonable explanation.
The worst thing is that, [they certainly **can** stop any further blocklimit lift.](
Without competetion or being balanced, any power can become centralized and eventually become absolutely malicious.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:53:15

Hey, please don't tell lies.
Miners are NOT claiming they are the law. They said "POW is the law".
Also, blockstream devs can't be the law. BS was founded in 2014.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:00:50
So we shouldn't depend on the decision of blockstream devs.
Especially when their decision is as ridiculous as the one you referred to.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:18:35
Nonsense. All of it. You're either balls deep on Blockstream or you're a moron. Which is it?
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:17:30
Actually, mods have used "split the community" as the excuse to ban all the people who support BU.
If you think "silence anyone who is causing problems for Bitcoin" is bad, then they shouldn't have banned so many people.
Think about that for a minute.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:48:14
You have been trapped in the lies spread by BS. Sigh.
Try to find more information before repeating those ridiculous lies.
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:39:40
Stop spamming misinformation. I have already warned you.
If you continue to do, then you are no longer a moron. You become a liar.

@_date: 2017-05-08 07:38:51
You are a liar.
Could you stop spreading lies against miners? Don't be so unashamed, please.
If Blockstream could stop spamming lies, then this community will be better immediately.
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:42:49
We are all Satoshi. If you blockstream want to fork, then just fork. Stop spamming misinformation to trap the morons like pb1x to support you, please.
Soon, BS will say “Let's  (Blockstream devs Activated soft fork), we only have one shot” to play with those morons.
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:30:56
"approved &amp; promoted", not "proposed". Corrected, thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:21:19
So if miners refuse, then user decide.
If users refuse, then they are not users.
Anyway, BS devs decide.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:19:58
You post this right after spreading blatant and obvious lies about miners and Roger Ver... The irony.
Give it up troll.
BTW, what lies I have told about you? I am curious.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:55:21
Strange? I oppose BU and UASF. 
I opposed Roger when he ~~proposed~~ promoted BU to split the community.
I oppose BS When it ~~proposed~~ approved &amp; promoted UASF to split the community.
If you realize that BS devs were and are not selfless and righteous, then you will know how evil they are when they viciously disapproval any proposal of blocklimit increase.
BS is not only not bad, but also evil.

@_date: 2017-05-08 08:21:44
You are so unashamed, a liar who sounded like Maxwell.
Your BS mate  wants to meet you to know why you smeared his race.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:48:33
So it's annoying that BS told lies to you about what UASF really means.
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:12:28
No need to sigh for your crime.
1. It's you who broken the HK agreement first, not miners， although your Maxwell spread lies saying miners broke it first. Do you dare to admit it? Liars always tell lies.
2. More people are willing to lift blocklimit, why do the devs of your company disapprove all proposals? No one buys the excuses you give. Where are the users then? Devs follow users, or users must follow you blockstream? 


A typical Blockstream lie. If users don't agree with BS although it has a beautiful name, then users are no longer users because they are not "~~informed~~" brainwashed.
3. Current UASF is a break of Bitcoin mechanism, why are you spare no effort to support it while saying nothing about its risk? 
4. Why are you smearing miners and so many bigger block supporters "maybe they dont care and are just trolling the ecosystem"? Why do you smear people who disagree with you without any evidence? 
Stop hijacking Bitcoin to your vision to make your patents and company valuable, please.
If you disagree with Satoshi on Bitcoin and you believe you can code well......fork...with your bs devs.
Bitcoin is far more than code. No banksters would have paid you without blockchain based Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:46:53
Yeah, I said I was Chinese American long ago when I opposed BU, that's right. I still oppose BU now. Wait, your BS mate Samson also claimed he was Chinese. Were you implying he was lying? Then if he saw your post he will refuse to pay you.
Then where are you from, BS liar? Your posts sound like notorious u/nullc.
You have been caught telling lies by many users before, haven't you? 
Maybe you shall register another id to spread lies for your BS company. And tell BS they shall pay attention to their paid shills' low quality.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:30:11
Yes, but it will become dangerous when miners or devs support it.
Miners supported BU, so it's dangerous. So we oppose BU.
But when blockstream devs like Luke-jr supported UASF and other hard fork ways, it becomes very dangerous. So we must stop Blockstream.

 a person who sounded like notorious Maxwell used a new id to smear you and he "has proven" your race is more liable to lie.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:41:27
That means you have been brainwashed by BS lies. So your logic becomes ridiculous and you become being abusive to others.
Only some big block supporters support BU. I am a big block supporter. I oppose BU, and I oppose Blockstream devs.
If you oppose big block, go away and hardfork your altcoin, since it is so superior in your eyes and your ridiculous logic.
From the beginning, Bitcoin has been expected by all people but BS banksters and their followers to be big block.
