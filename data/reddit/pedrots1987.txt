Yeah, if the exchange has low liquidity SL won't matter much as explained in my above post.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:48:38
Yeah totally ridiculous. Most of reddit are probably in the top 10%, if not higher.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:27:37
Why will it return? 
  It came easy and fast because people thought they could get rich overnight. 
  Now in a bear market that won't happen. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:55:39
It is not an investment because it is not a cashflow generating asset, like real estate or a bond.
  Thus, it is speculation or gambling, whichever you preffer.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:17:17
Not really.
  I can get my money out in less than 24h.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:17:49
You do not know that.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:11:20
It can happen when gaps are generated.
  Ie. if BTC is trading at 11,000 and next executed order is at 10,500 your stop loss won't be executed because no one wanted to buy at that price.
  Best stop loss systems execute below certain provided treshold at market prices for that moment.
  In my example your SL would've been executed at 10,500 despite you putting 10,648.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:31:43
Cryptopia is the paradise of the pump &amp; dump coins. For BTC it has relatively high volume, though
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:15
Prepare for a freefall under 10K. Stop losses will be executed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:13:12
No. That person can also lose, and the next, and the next.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:24:01
It seems you are more scared of people selling their BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:15:39
OMG this is the most retarded logic I've seen in a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:33:18
All is good until you start going into the tails of the distribution.
  That happened with VaR models in the last crisis. People underestimated risk way too much by relying on models they don't understand, that in turn are based on unrealistic assumptions, such as normal distributed prices.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:25:05
That's your decision. If you're happy with 9x, cash out. Or take your initial investment out.
  I cashed out at 5K when I got 10x. At the moment it'd never crossed my mind that it could reach 20k within a year (I was in the red from 2014 to 2017).
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:41:31
No. Bonds produce cash flow.
  Gold I agree.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:55:24
Yes they are. 
  
  Put your salary there. I'm not rich by any standards yet I'm in &lt;1% worldwide by income and &lt;5% by equity.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:11:17
That's my point. Today, +90% of people have gone towrads BTC to make a profit not looking to store value.
  If they leave, for whatever reason, demand will go way lower.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:13:09
Why will it implode? Are you new to pegged exchange rates?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:30:15
What utter bullshit.
  Using past history to derive price statistical distributions. 
  This guy doesn't even do statistical goodness of fit tests to compare distributions.
  Just an amateur trying to appear smart.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:15:26
No stocks are not dead, and won't ever will.

1,000%? Thats only btc some coins got 10,000% or even more. I bet some coin out there got 100,000%.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:48:00
The futures are net position.
  For every long position there must be a short position.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:38:17
If that happens then those orders will execute.

You don't have to give me shit. I already have 'em.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:41:38


 I don't mean new exchanges push the price higher in itself, but they became more available and widespread, even in countries where previously there had been none, such as in mine. This of course makes investing into BTC available to a whole new group of people.


  Why would people stay in stocks and make 25% a year (like the S&amp;P did last year) when they could get 1,000% or 10,000% per year in crypto? That's the logic I'm arguing for.


  Yeah, it seems like an oxymoron, but with the prior points on the table I think there's no other way for BTC but down.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:43:01
Yeah kidnappings are a matter of time.
  I mean you could kidnap the creator of several coins, force them to transfer the coins and puf, you're gone.

You need to do it through a broker, but you can't buy fractions of contracts.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:20:26
Arbitrage is really difficult ATM.
  That's one of the reasons why Coinmarketcap dropped Korean exchanges from its price calculations.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:39:39
Market capdoesn't mean 200b have been put in, maybe only a fraction of that, 20b or so.
  Valuation, which market cap is, is only market agreeing on a price. That's all there is to it.

How can it be real if it's trying to pass for the real CNN website?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:48:00
You can have accounts in several exchanges. Some don't have limits.
  If you have accounts in the biggest exchanges you can probably withdraw 10m per month without issues.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:59:19
Does Bittrex accepts USD? For me it only works with USDT.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:28:52
BTC needs people to survive; what's good for a currency if its not used?
  If the fad fades be sure it will drop a lot further.

They don't.
  People just don't know how future market contracts operate.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:15:39
There's no explanation.
  Every other day people will ask the same question: THERE IS NO ANSWER.
  It is not like 'btc drops every cloudy day' or something like that. It is mostly random.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:36:38
Bitcoin should not be valued at 14k. Its true price is way lower than that at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:02:53
Yeah I sold at around 5K. Had been holding since 2013 though.
  Been trading swings since.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:13:46
I think bear.
  But will buy if it goes upwards.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:21:56
You can fork it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:23:02
Lmao US banks predate on people so much.
  Here in my country, you just get hit by daily interest (which is high for overdrafts ie. 3% monthly), but never in a million years would you pay $200 overdraft fees for a $10 transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:47:19
Why do we need a Gold backed crypto? is USDT not enough?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:19:08
So, if you put $10k usd that you can afford to lose it can get x10 and you can put it as a downpayment.
  What is so hard to understand about that?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:14:17
Yeah but if people stop using BTC it'll be no good to store value.

Yes, it makes your exports more competitive and the income generated abroad more valuable.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:15:34
Maybe, but in the meantime the price has gone lower, and the enthusiasm faded.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:04:42
Being hard plays against a higher price. Stricter regulations, KYC rules, long verification times, etc; all plays against it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:40:37
I mean do the work as find which coins would you arbitrage.
  Remember that sending coins is not instantaneous and it implies fees. You need a margin of safety big enough to make it work.
  I believe it is no doable for those same reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:56:17
If it falls through 9K, there's a support at 8k. Then maybe goes to 5K.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:47:48
If it continues to move laterally, it will IMO go down, as every day investors will take their money out as it seems that the party might be over.

It is a bubble when its marketcap is higher than many productive companies in the world that actually create value and positive cash flow.
  BTC provides none.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:23:49
Edison's lightbulb would work the same, be it 1 lightbulb or 1,000,000 lightbulbs.
  The ones behind bitcoin design never visualized the scale it now has; it has been rendered totally worthless from a practical point of view. It is just a speculation vehicle right now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:50:22
It is a bubble, but no one knows when it's gonna pop.

@_date: 2017-12-15 12:08:03
Not really. You just settle price differences, you don't need delivery of products necessarily.
  That's how it works with commodities and fx.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:03:21

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:00:18
  You're confusing value with cashflow. Your pay is cashflow; BTC is value accruing over time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:36:56
Yeah a system, but has no value in itself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:42
From Nov 2013 to Jan 2015 it fell almost 90%, so that means it could reach $1,800.

Bittrex is overwhelmed with new verifications. Especially if you require a manual verification.
  Waiting times have surged recently.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:06:59
Yeah, but for 99% of the population it has no use.
  Buy a $5 soda? wait 1 hour for it to confirm, and pay $25 in fees.
  Cryptos might be a thing in the future, but it very well might not be Bitcoin. It may be ETH, DASH or a crypto that hasn't been created yet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:18:08
Not necessarily. If you got paid in cars instead of dollars by your employer would that mean that you wouldn't pay income taxes?
  Yes, you still need to pay taxes.
  Whatever thing that has value attached to it, you need to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:04:29
I'm no tax expert but IMO you're liable when yo do the trade, not necessarily when you sell the house again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:19:19
You cheap bastard. You need to pay more if you want quick confirmations.
  My last transfer I paid around $40 and it was confirmed in an hour.

Bitcoin is truly better than other cryptos? no such thing, buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:48
There's no explanation.
   Just market forces doing its business.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:04:27
The thing is this only happened in coinbase.
  Didn't affect 99% of the exchanges worldwide.
  Difference being that stocks are traded in 2-3 exchanges max.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:52:04
There's never a single event. Just price inflections, ATH dissapear, people start getting their funds out of exchanges, chaos ensues.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:08:22
around $40 bucks with around 1 hour of transfer time.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:48:14
Tell that to the IRS when they start coming at your door.
  The exchanges will gladly share information about your trades if the IRS asks them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:43
Lmao you can say it is a bubble, and it may be, but you can't predict the pop.
  Therefore you can go bust easily if you short an 'irrational asset' like crypto because of timing issues, not fundamental issues.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:08
Binance is Chinese, you only can add cryptos directly. You can't add fiat to it.

So? SWIFT is a system, not an asset. And at this moment fees are comparable.
  And SWIFT is only useful for interional transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:58:47
You'd be just paying yourself. The fees are deducted from the transfered amount.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:29:03
It is.
  When your granma wants to buy bitcoin you can surely bet there's a bubble.
 
  When will it pop? no one knows.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:19:38
If your position is losing a lot, the exchange will ask for additional collateral (margin call). If you don't post more money they close your position.
  This assures your counterparty gets paid.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:23:09
It amazes me that people send +1K plus to a site that they don't even know.
  Every time I start funding a new exchange I start small, and doing more funding over time. In that scenario I don't lose much if the transfer goes south or if the exchange is shady.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:19:36
Not necessarily.
 
   The company can pay dividends or do a share buyback, which gives value back to shareholders.
   If the price doesn't rise but profits do, current owners will get dividends significantly above market rate, thus, driving other investors to take such surplus. Demand for shares will raise the price and get the dividend yield back to normal.
   And of cours we're talking about legal companies here. There are Enrons in the whole world, but the % is minimal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:06:47
That's why I don't hold BTC anymore.
  I just sold and put money into a bunch (~20) other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:02:08

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:56:00
The same as a stock exchange.
  You've got bid/ask spreads and last transaction price. If the next transaction is higher or lower then that'll be the next price you see.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:27:12
No. If a productive company increases its profits due to better products or higher sales its share price will rise, despite not having new money coming in.
  But bitcoin produces no value or cashflows in itself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:09:05
Try to save the private keys and import it into another wallet.
  I only used btc core for some bitcoins I found from 2013.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:16:30
Just diversify BTC onto a portfolio of cryptos.

It can take up to 1 month.

you can on kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:30:29
Wow, surge in demand equals increase in price? who would've thought?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:06:06
I see it going to 13-11k based on past dips.
  But no one never knows for certain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:56:16
Yeah, you need more money for big swings. Doesn't mean it can't happen, though.
  Happened in 2008 with trillions of dollars in the Real Estate crash.

Here it is also at 18k (Chile)
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:53:35
It is 0.6 Trillions or 600 billions.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:20:20
Bitcoin itself is not. But the hype and inflated prices are.
  The price can only go higher if new people start investing, thus it is similar to a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:16:34
So do you think a company is not an economic resource? Why are investments in companies listed as assets then?
   This is the definition 


@_date: 2017-12-25 17:49:40
No, people will realize cryptos don't have practical value AT THE MOMENT, so they're pretty useless; price will go down regard all cryptos.
  Same happened with .com, most starts were useless or couldn't turn a profit. The world had to wait several years so profitable startups emerged after the crash (amazon, google, yahoo, now netflix, etc.)
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:50:19

Yes. But bitcoin has no value. One could argue it has less value than before because the fees now are higher.
  If you want to have a system you better improve the system that exists. Now it isn't much of an improvement over swift.
  And most people will never use swift in their entire lives.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:43:53
You need to get it through an exchange that deals with real EUR otherwise LocalBitcoins or other solution.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:54:00
No you're not. Picasso paintings are scarce and unique, and Picasso is dead, so he's not doing any more work. And art doesn't provide monetary value, it is subjective. So a person who paid $100 million for a painting very well knows that he might no resell it for the same or ahigher amount.
  I already said bitcoin in itself is not a pyramid scheme, but ITS price acts similar to one, because it is based on new money pouring in for it to increase, as it has no practical use whatsoever at the moment. People are only speculating with cryptos; they don't provide any practical value at the moment. Bank wires or credit cards are an easier and faster way to transfer money or buy something.

Are you a resident for tax purposes in the US?
  If yes, you need to declare taxes of your worldwide income in the US.
  That the banks won't share the info doesn't mean that you shouldn't be declaring taxes on it.
  And banks that do business with US banks need to inform of the transactions they do. It is part of anti money laundering efforts.
  I have an USD account in a bank in my country and I had to fill paperwork regarding this US anti moneylaundering laws, and I live in southamerica.

@_date: 2017-12-28 14:27:58
But why does bitcoin needs to be value at $20,000? why can't it be $1,000 or $10?
  It will work the same way. Its value doesn't affect the system.
  In fact the system is the valuable thing, not the BTC itself.
  Someone will come up with a better system/crypto and it will gain mass adoptance, rendering BTC obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:33:37

  People here think BTC stores value: wrong. They're mainly speculative; 99.99% of BTC user have not used it to buy anything.
  They're used to trade, not for really anything else. That these can change in the future doesn't mean what's going on now.

Oh it surely does. It exactly proves my point.
  Uses for it haven't changed, yet one year gold is worth $200 and the next is worth $1000. Why? its value surely hasn't changed, it is used for the same things. Merely speculation, that's all.
  Same as BTC.

@_date: 2017-08-19 22:57:20
I know how they work. They only can issue debt, which in itselt doesn't devalue currency.
  Of course they can go bankrupt, but the chances people who believe in BTC give them is far way greater than what reality suggests.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:26:01
It won't.
  If BTC did that, all the circulating money in the world would be invested in BTC, thus it is almost impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:27:46
Can someone help me with these questions/doubts?:
* AFAIK is 'insecure' to withdraw BCH from BTC as you have to share your private keys, ok.
* What happens if I create a new wallet and transfer my BTC there? Will the BCH still be attached to the former wallet private keys?
* If above is true, then this would be a very safe way to take BCH out and not risk any BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:14:14
A 'run on banks' is just the symptom of a panic. If BTC is in a panic it'll be worthless; the medium is different, the result is the same: you have 'money' but you can't use it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:41:49
BTC or gold don't have value. What can you do with a BTC or an ounce of gold if no one wants to buy it?
  That there is a finite number of BTC doesn't mean it is backed by anything; it is still the product of supply/demand for wanting bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:49:30
Lmao, you can do that as well with bitcoin. As I've been saying, it is called lending.
  An exchange could start lending bitcoins any time they want because they hold a lot of bitcoins that people are not cashing out. If people panic and try to withdraw all the same time the Exchange would go bankrupt, exactly as a bank.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:50:54

@_date: 2017-08-19 22:54:07
Greece and Argentina got fucked because of their currency problems not banks.
  Greece because of the Euro and their impossibility to devalue their currency, and Argentina because the couldn't hold the USD/ARS parity to 1:1 any longer: they had cheated themselves, as new minted ARS wasn't backed by reserves in USD to hold the parity.
  Again, Germany was fucked of issuing new money, which is their Central Bank problem, and an issue I haven't even brought up here.
  My country has had bank crisis, but not bailouts, or at least minor.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:56:19
I know how banking works it is not the point.
  Banks can issue debt, not money. Bank debt by itself won't devalue the currency. It surely can bankrupt 'em though.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:28:14
And exactly what does back BTC? And people still buy and sell BTC for FIAT CURRENCY! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:24:24
FDIC is a different story and it is for when a bank goes bust. I don't where do you live, but here we haven't got cases like that in like 40 years. 
  If some hacker steals USD100m it won't bankrupt a bank.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:09:33
Well in my country that is protected by law, so the bank loses the money not me. They have to replenish it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:48:32
Yes, the IRS will tax bitcoin, but in USD.
  And no, society that works purely in BTC won't happen, as the price is too volatile and can be traded for other currencies.
  For example in this hypothetical country everyone owns and pays everything in BTC, and prices in BTC are stable.
  1 car is worth 2 BTC year after year. But if the BTC/USD soars then someone would trade their BTCs for USD and buy the car outside the country (price arbitrage, because it is cheaper), then everyone follows suit, and now everyone uses USD and not BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:51:17
Yeah bank runs are a thing. Same can happen in BTC, although worse, because as there is no Central Institution to block people from selling BTC, panics can be a lot worse.
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:08:51
People can also make a 'run on bitcoin', panicking and selling. It surely can go to a -50% very fast.  And Exchanges can fail way more easily than banks, and they are not regulated nor disclose their financials. What happen if there are no exchanges? how are you gonna buy/sell? it gets hard really really fast.
  I'm just critizicing how people tend to look at BTC much more safer than banks when in reality it isn't. There is just way too much koolaid drinking in cryptocurrency believers.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:44:31
Guys, this is clearly a troll.

Most of the world is unbanked because it is poor. They can't even afford a bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:47:11
Then again you are trusting a 3rd party to do things for you, same as banks.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:33:47
In that case the max price is much much lower at around 1.2 million USD.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:48:45
Man, the more I read about bitcoin the less future I see for it.
  I was totally unaware of this so far. Fees are killing BTC for sure: if you can't transact with small $ amounts, what's the point? not everyone is using BTC for 1k upwards per purchase/transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:16:56
No it is not just more spotlight, it needs hella more cash to get raised from 3k to 4k than $1 to $10.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:09:38
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:48:41
Because most sites won't handle fiat. So they only use USDT.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:33:39
Let me check my Crystal Ball, brb.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:36:08
There's a company that can create tether out of thin air. You can then transfer tether to a site and buy cryptos.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:17:48
Lol I bought a BTC in 2014 (at $ 700), left it almost forgotten until it reached $2,000.
  Had to found an old HDD that I had BTC Core installed on and retrieved my long lost BTC! Now planning on selling it, but having it reached 3.3k I think I'm just gonna wait.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:15:30
You print USDT out of thin air, you transfer them to your USDT wallet on any site (Bittrex, Binance, etc) and buy BTC with it. More demand for BTC drives price higher. Then you transfer the BTC to a Exchange that deals with BTC/USD directly, and then you cash out.
  You never swap USDT to USD so the price never varies.
  And USD=USDT will remain because people think it is still valid.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:41:02
Yes they do lol.
  If you buy something with a lot of money it will go up in price.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:10:50
Go away spammer.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:55:23
The point is the system as it is in not efficient. If you want to send/receive bitcoins you need to download the whole blockchain which is a big leap of faith for everydaymen to do on their own.
  If you use an exchange then you are at a bigger risk of default than if you held your money in a bank.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:58:41
Yeah but look at the orders placed to buy and sell.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:44:18
It is completely different. You can't buy gold or silver with USDT or a currency created by a company.
  The thing is the indiscriminate creation of USDT is what caused the upswing in price.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:56:29
Issuing of money is done by Central Banks, who CREATE money by lending to commercial banks.
  If you deposit 20,000 and you get a loan of 100,000, the other 80,000 needs to come from a) other people deposits, b) Central Bank loans or c) the Bank own capital. They don't create money out of thin air.
  You need to learn accounting.

As BTC has no instrinsic value, as per stocks or bonds, there's no way of telling how much undervalued or overvalued it is. My view is that it is overvalued.
  Same happened with .com stocks. People went crazy, said tech stocks couldn't be valued as traditional stocks as the technology was way too disruptive; wrong, they can. And all those companies were bullshit -&gt; prices crashed to $0.

You have lost only 3K. You can still cash out and take the loss before it goes even lower.
  Next time don't go all in at once. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:38:29
Well China has like 1/6 of the world population so yeah, it is big in the scheme of things.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:41:28
They pump it up a bit, then drop some btc. Repeat.
  They're probably exiting their big positions slowly.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:22:29
Still they can't operate in China, and they'd LOVE TO.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:29:53
The aren't.
  People need to get a loan? they still need banks. Companies? banks. Investments? banks.
  I trust more a bank that can hold my money than myself. Storing BTC is draining; you need to keep track of them, backups, etc.
  With the bank I just let it go.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:40:42
Can't help but facepalm at things like these.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:12:47
Yeah right, troll. Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:46:36
Yeah, and the price there is already 3k.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:05:06
It is the same. If you sell now and buy cheaper you're taking a loss IN THE HOPE you can make it up again.
  What if it keeps falling? will you sell again to buy in at a lower price again? when do you stop?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:43:00
The thing is, at the end of the day, I can buy food, services, rent, etc. with USD. Can't with BTC.

As with every asset you don't want to go all in all at once, invest at increments.
  If you have $5,000 to invest, do it maybe at $500 spread over a few days each. This way you avoid getting in at local highs.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:52
Evidence to prove otherwise?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:56:31
no one can see the future. you're just shitting in your pants watching the price drop.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:08:58
If something goes up with little volume (trading) you can wrongly assume that it is starting to go up again. So you buy.
  But as it went up with very little volume it doesn't hold as a 'valid point of reference' so to say. That's why I suggest caution.
  Is like when people pump coins with very little volume. Someone sells afterwards and it comes all crashing down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:13:40

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:19:24
You know what margin is? You BORROW money from them, that's why they only close losing positions, so they don't end up under the water.
  If they don't close losing positions under certain threshold, they will be losing money instead of you.

It is not crazy. You don't know, nor anyone, when the fall is going to stop. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:48:48
I bought at a semi-peak in 2014 at $700. Then it went down at like $200 and stayed below $700 until january this year, when it shot up.
  I just didn't give a fuck. It was $700 that I had available and willing for it to go to zero. It was a gamble. I never even looked into it in 3 years, almost forgot about it.
  I only came back to check when it started getting close to 2k, then up up, until 4k. Then I sold at about $4.5k
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:36:52

I can assure you 100% that JP Morgan has no propietary position in BTC. The market is too small, illiquid and volatile to be profitable for JP.

Well, if you got no capital to begin with most of the time you can't do actual innovations (actual times, think medicine/pharma/TI). That's why corporations demand a high payback on their innovations. Also copyrights don't last forever, they last 10-20yrs in pharma at most.
  Back in the day you could create something great in your basement (ie. lightbulb, the telephone), but those days are long gone. Same as physics discoveries.
  All 'easy' discoveries are gone. Think of Marie Curie or some 'homemade' experiments that discovered the neutron, electron and so forth. Now you need a particle accelerator worth billions of dollars to prove the existence of the higgs boson or whatever.

Yes, downward support (it is the opposite for upward) is when there are several red candles that rebound at a same/similar place, but then keeps going upward. i.e the downtrend is not strong enough to 'break the support' and thus reverts.
  If a red candle breaches the support then one should look at the following.

They have vaue within their economy. You pay wages in USD, costs in USD, receive revenue in USD, and so on.
  BTC provides no solution or improvement on the USD system. I can pay $10 for food today, and will pay probably $10,01 in a year due to inflation.
 
  No asset or commodity like BTC or crypto has stable prices.
  Stocks provide a share of the company profits (positive cash flow), bonds pay you interest (positive cash flow); cryptos and commoditties do not.

  I don't see the market cap going x5 or x10 in the near future.

Replica market is not based on innovation, they COPY what other people have created.
  It is profitable? yes, of course.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:51:44
I did at $700.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:10:36
It is not. It is until moving through its downward trend.
  Even though that momentarily it can go UP it is STILL in a DOWNARD trend.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:26:58
I can assure you 100% that JP Morgan has no propietary position in BTC. The market is too small, illiquid and volatile to be profitable for JP.
  Also JP Morgan is a retail bank not an investment bank.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:59
As with every asset you don't want to go all in all at once, invest at increments.
  If you have $5,000 to invest, do it maybe at $500 spread over a few days each. This way you avoid getting in at local highs.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:07:41
I mean orders, not individuals.
  Every order is matched. There's no unmatched order in an executed trade.
  If you bought 1 BTC one or more people sold to you 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:09:00
Yeah but market cap was what, $100m, $200m? Now we're at $50b market cap. It took x50 so you could have a x3 investment.
  I don't see the market cap going x5 or x10 in the near future.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:10:36

No, you don't know that with certainty and no one does. You can't gamble your life savings that way.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:26:12
It can still become the biggest dip. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:11:23
It is entering overbought territory. Careful.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:39:21
Thoughtful about the market? Wtf does that even mean?.
  Every man should look after himself, not the market. That's how the market is neutral.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:26:59
Don't know anything about that.
  But it depends on the BTC to BTC loan ratio. If they're leveraged substantially even a slight run on them could cause the exchange to collapse.
  But I guess no one haves that kind of information.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:50
It seems you don't have quite an understanding of how banks or the crisis worked.
  There was no divestment from individuals or institutions. They had put money into investments that were now worthless. Banks didn't have money for day to day operations, so they'd gone bankrupt unless the government stepped in.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:11:11
Doing pretty fine :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:48:31
Dude, if you don't got evidence how can you say it is false? it makes so much sense that almost everyone is speculating. The daily volume is $2b. How much of that do you think people is using to trade for REAL goods?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:25:53
Worry if it goes below 3,200
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:09:55
Supply and demand, of course.
 Do you realize how retarded that answer is? 'The market went down/up because supply and demand. That's not the answer we're looking for.
  If there are more orders are the sellside, the question is WHY is that? and the answer is not 'because there are more sellers than buyers'.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:08:53
I just sold mine and shorted.
Let's see where this goes.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:32:22
Well it is a 4x in market cap then. 
  And that surge came all in this year. It was 4 years of flat BTC.
  I think this will be flat for a long time if there are not more uses for BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:04:07
Banks don't give a shit about BTC. It won't hurt their profits in the minimum.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:50

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:34:36
Sure, you can choose who and what to believe.
  But I've worked with banks (I work in finance) and I can assure you banks take financial risks very seriously. I don't think they're invested in BTC. They're more regulated than ever.
  And retail banks don't do investing with propietary money. They have other companies or a subsidiary investment bank to do that.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:17:16
Looking at a candle chart at DAY candles. If you look at monthly candles, next support is at $500 lol.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:04:37
There's no evidence, just common sense.
  If you can't provide arguments for why my reasoning is wrong, then so be it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:49:14
Not really. It is not legislation, but regulation.
  Different. If it falls under the SEC, for example, they can just pass new rules to the exhanges to abide by.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:12:27
Piracy for software is easy, that's why every company is migrating towards cloud services. Office is now on the cloud, so you need to connect to a server an pay a fee. Same as Adobe. They're gettin around the piracy thing. And it is working for them.
  I used to pirate a LOT of software and still do with movies. But companies found a way, at least for now, to circumvent that.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:30:38
Dude, I got in in 2014. I already cashed out. Was trading some spare change on Kraken.
  The withdrawal already went through, so it is ok now.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:34:23
The question is still relevant, cryptos are the like of electricity. Is BTC AC or DC, which one will be DC in the end?
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:58:05
Lol missed that, sorry.
  I'm really not familiar with asian modern innovations overall. Do you mind sharing which ones?
  The only ones I can think about are apps and online business, which value doesn't derive from IP but from network effects (Aliexpress, Didi, Wechat, et)
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:52:08
They're corrupt in other much more profitable ways. Don't think old guys from the communist party are sitting at their PCs hoarding BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:33:31
BTC is not regulated, therefore they're just whining.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:16:01
It is still on a sideways trend. No clear path yet.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:21
Yeah. That's for sure.
But if the exchanges are serious, they will have cash available.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:21:35
Yes, downward support (it is the opposite for upward) is when there are several red candles that rebound at a same/similar place, but then keeps going upward. i.e the downtrend is not strong enough to 'break the support' and thus reverts.
  If a red candle breaches the support then one should look at the following.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:46:56
And that's the price in Coinbase only.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:11:23
It is entering overbought territory. Careful.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:03:59
I know what a power law distribution is lol. Everything in life regarding money/success is power law.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:20:52
Hope it goes down.
 
This price mania does no good to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:48:55
Most exchanges have limits on the amount of cash you can withdraw per day or month.
  It would take a while for you to get out every $ in the exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:11:48
The USD is also appreciated against the other currencies this week, thus, far weakening the BTC.

First rule of investment:
  NEVER EVER give family or friends advice. Just give 'em facts and let them decide.
  Shit like this can end friendships and tear families apart.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:04:38
It is very important.
  How do you get people to use it with a volatility this high?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:53:21
Several people here in this sub.  And people constantly now posting that it isn't true.

@_date: 2017-09-20 19:02:07
Please stop whining already.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:24:53
It is not crazy. You don't know, nor anyone, when the fall is going to stop. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:27:02
You can't.
  You'll get hit with a spread when you sell BTC for Euro. Can be even worse than USD to EUR spread.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:01:20
You always can lose more money by waiting and selling even lower ; )
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:18:10
Chinese don't use BTC to buy things, they used it for gambling. It is banned now.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:20:07
This is shit advice. Please don't do it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:26:39
Would you be happy with losing $100?  I want them back, of course. It won't bankrupt me though. That's for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:56:48
Sure you did man.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:36:23
You cannot extrapolate from the past.
  That BTC has never gone down 90% doesn't mean it can't.
  On top of that, trading history is WAY too short. We have like 5-6 years of price history?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:14:08
No it is not. In my country inflation is under 2%. That's not speculative if inflation is under 3-4% year after year. It is almost certainty.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:40:24
I get you. But the mcap figure was to make a point about a thing that might not repeat itself in the future.

Let's see if this 19-year old is still a millionair in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:08:38
Yes. Every exchange is a closed environment.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:35:48
If they make an investment difficult to accomplish and to liquidate... why do you think people will keep doing it whereas there are other alternatives?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:46
Same question:
  What has changed since bitcoin was $100 til it hit $20k?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:21
Yeah. That's for sure.
But if the exchanges are serious, they will have cash available.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:18:10
Chinese don't use BTC to buy things, they used it for gambling. It is banned now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:14:31
Yeah I also got at a somewhat high point in 2014 and got my investment x6.
  But that doesn't mean it can happen again, or that the market conditions are the same, because they're not.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:25:20
Both have different uses. Same as cryptos can have in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:54:41
Stfu you blind zealot.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:34
This is shit advice. 
Cost averaging in a bear market is suicide.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:14:31

  But that doesn't mean it can happen again, or that the market conditions are the same, because they're not.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:26:12
It can still become the biggest dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:29:39
But they can ban exchanges, ban use as currency, etc, etc. making it all useless.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:53:52
Yesterday wasn't 4%
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:30:13
Have the cash loaded in already maybe?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:42:17
Those already do. I mean corporations and individuals that seek a profit.

It makes no sense to borrow in BTC if you can borrow in fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:57:52
I understand how it works.
 
  Do you realize how retarded the answer 'more sellers than buyers' is?
 
 When in fact there could be more orders at the sellside, the real question is WHY there are more sell orders than buy orders.
 
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:40:43
That an event hasn't happened in the past doesn't mean it can't happen.
  History has taught us many lessons.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:21:23
Download bitcoin core and import it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:38:30
Yeah and that's meaningless. The real question is why people are undercutting rach other: fear or what?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:07:33
This is the start.
  It'll keep going lower, more and more people losing money. Some of them won't be able to take it, will sell, propelling prices even lower.
  This is just the start my friends.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:42:58
not really.
  Just a few % points higher.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:08:49
It doesn't have value. Period.
  Whoever says the contrary is insane. And I own BTC and ETH. But they don't have value.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:33:13
BTC has bid/ask spread. So if you buy BTC with USD and sell for EUR you'll get hit by that spread.
 If you exchange USD for EUR there's also a bid/ask spread so you need to see which one is smaller and take that route.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:38:45
Then you can't contest my claim. Simple as that.
  It is what my common sense indicates. And hard to prove otherwise.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:09:33
Good for you buddy.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:31:25
Seems having trouble gettin past 3,450.
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:28:08
They can't regulate bitcoin, but they can regulate Exchanges.
  If you use one, you'll probably be regulated in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:07:37
The market is not analyzable under Game Theory, nor it represents a Nash Equilibrium. You don't know the pay-offs and it has a huge  amount of players.
  If you want charity don't invest in the market.
  It is every man for himself. That's why the market is the market.
  
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:11:02
Good if I invested now, bad if I invested at or close to 100K
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:07:59
It didn't really break 5,000. Fell short by a few dollars.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:25:18
You just recommend people what to do with their money. Families tear apart and friendships end because of that.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:06:31
Depends on the exchange that you look, there are small variations in price.
  Highmark 1190 on dec '13. Low mark 100 aug '14 -92%
  
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:06:42
yeah, no doubt that 3K is a psychological support.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:22
It is $70. Consider it gone.

But take his opinion very skeptically.
  He's very biased towards his own financial interests.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:59:24
the left chart is actually much worse as it is in log scale, and right in linear scale.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:26
If they ban exchanges BTC trading will become extremely complicated, as you need to trade with another individual, involving greater risks.
  BTC will lose its appeal in that way, at least for the majority of people.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:59:48
Yeah, but you never know if its gonna climb up again.
  I bought in in Jan 2014 @ $700 and was in the red until Jan 2017.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:59:58
If there's a run on the exchange then eveyone's gonna be fucked up.
  You just need a rumour going on to generate a run.

Lol, these kind of posters are desperate whiners.
  First they want people to adopt BTC (because they will profit), then when they sell the insult them and call 'em weak hands ('cause they're losing money)
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:01:02
You can't discount how many people started investing just because of the hype, "500% returns in a year!".
  They won't get 500%, not even 100%. BTC is already flat, if not falling. They'll soon see they investments are earning nothing and exit, and probably lose faith in it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:38:16
That's a different story. 
Still it is going down at agreed trade prices between buyers AND sellers. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:42:10
You're fucked. You sent it to an unkown address. No way you can have it back.

Unless it comes from the richest guy in the world, right?
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:00:40
Lmao Path of Exile is copyrighted. They have microtransactions for real money.
  And I get where you're going, there are more alternatives that in the past. But the big things, the world-changing inventions or mediciones won't see the light of day without IP.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:08:03
Well you're fucked. I just read the rules.
  Better read 'em next time.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:42:29
Some fee to take out, then some fee for confirming the transaction.
  That's why you don't take out BTC and instead take out other coin like ETH or LTC

Lmao this guy is crazy. It is impossible that 20% of ALL capital gains are from Crypto only.
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:36:19
Yes, that's what I meant. I have it on a pdf on my gmail account.
  How can you do those commands on a wallet? I'll try to download pywallet at home today.
  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:24:29
But every time your encrypt the wallet the public keys are reset.
  So first question should be; if those public keys are reset does my wallet retain the BTCs or are they lost? how to recover them from this point onwards?
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:15:28
Yes, the words have been the same since 2014.
  I'll try it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:19:39
I tried to install Pywallet and failed miserably. Do you have by any change a for dummies installation guide lol?
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:36:48
I'm not by any means advanced in bitcoin knowledge so thanks for the info.
  Regarding your points, my root-key has been the same (for armory paperbackup), I don't know how to check for private keys or if those have changed with every continuing backup (I did a backup on the backup, don't know if that fucks things up). It is possible that this has been screwep up by me unintentionally?
  When I get home today I'll try to check in the old wallet.dat. Is there a way to check if there are BTCs in there without updating the entire blockchain?
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:14:13
Yes it is. That's why I can't find any public keys in it.
  I'm gonna try that as well. But the odds are that the BTCs are on the paper wallet probably. I did it at the time to avoid the hassle of loading the entire blockchain each time I needed to transfer/receive money.
  I read in an old reddit post that what I need regarding the paper wallet is achievable: see it [here!]( I need help doing something similar.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:26:03
Yeah, and the guys that bought at the peak got fucked pretty hard.
