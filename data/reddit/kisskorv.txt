0-day exploits, I bet they can be bought with BTC. Then it wouldn't really matter if you used a live-cd, if that OS is compromised and has a network connection, your BTC are in danger.
Virtual keyboards can still be sniffed, is it common? Probably not, but the incentive is there should it become popular, if not you're probably employing a security model that has not been thoroughly tested.
We're dealing with negative security, if anyone claims their system is 100% secure when it's exposed to the internet, they are lying or clueless. Not saying you're any of those.

The Marxist labor theory of value only deals with "goods that can be reproduced on any scale"
So in a free market, the price of a freely reproducible product will equilibrate around the cost of production when supply and demand (driving force according to Marx) has acted on it for a sufficient time.
But Bitcoins aren't freely reproducible, so that part of labor value theory doesn't apply, but doesn't invalidate the theory as a whole either.

It is still attacking their present concept of the state, but using it as a means of organizing themselves in the new society.

Ok, feeling like the only non-AnCap in here :)
I think states should adopt their own competing cryptocurrencies alongside BTC, it would be enough to accept taxes in Bitcoin. Bitcoin already is an "officially accepted" means of payment in Sweden. But..
In my country 96% (2012) of payments are digital and the tax payments are controlled by private banks, from the privatized (national/postal) giro. All digital day-to-day payments are controlled by banks and telcos (two entities). IMO a private oligopoly is far worse than the state monopoly.
You could envision a system with national cryptocurrencies (all "competing" and with different parameters), parliament can funnel out money for housing, public funding etc in a consensus based or democratically controlled curr. All valid means of affecting economy in a positive way, a good way to "steer the economy", compared to now.
To which degree these would be incorporated, I don't know. But I think cryptocurrencies are coming and the idea of Bitcoin does not feel alien at all. You can still have taxes as others have pointed out, but the concept cryptocurrency is too good to fail.
