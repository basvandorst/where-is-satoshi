My follow is just a data metric. I know he is not my next president, but I want someone to see the data on a screen somewhere and say
“Damn, he clearly gained followers when he came out in support of crypto.”
I don’t see how it can hurt.

It wouldn’t. Crypto takes over governments. They are squealing a little now, wait til they see the writing on the wall. Humans will overthrow the state, and use Bitcoin to manage resources instead.

Bisq sucks nobody uses it and it is an unwieldy UI, it was difficult to connect my bank, not sure if I ever did. I believe dexes are the way forward but Bisq needs help even though it’s currently the best.

I always knew somehow, vaguely in the background, that we were slaves. Questioning religion with my peers as a kid was eye opening. Questioning the socioeconomic premise of “scarcity” and talking about BTC with my peers as an adult, clearly shows that we have a system of human governance that relies on participants happily enslaving themselves. 
The internet loosened the chains, BTC will break them. It is important that a socioeconomic premise of “abundance” be established in the ensuing power vacuum left behind by the disruption of market systems. We will have another “holy shit the king is dead” moment like after Charles of England. This time there can be no Cromwells looking to usurp. Only decentralized governance looking to evolve.

I did bitwage for a bit. I was very annoying , I must have emailed them 10 times. Every single time the problem turned out to be me being a dumbass and then them professionally and courteously fixing it for me. Really great support. Also it was cool, it worked as advertised. It would sometimes take over the weekend for my Thursday paycheck to be avaibs and that was kinda stressful but it’s not like that wasn’t explained
I really want my employer to offer this.

Well, I certainly don’t begrudge any of my fellow redditors from employing that strategy.
I think the long term strategy that would pay off most for the majority of the 99% would be to take dollars out of the traditional central bank system, and lock them away inside the bitcoin network. 
This simultaneously starves their beast and increases the power, security, and network effect of the people’s currency: Bitcoin.
Hell even if your aim is to cash out BTC into dollars at some point, the strategy still takes money from their system and raises the dollar value of bitcoin. 
So until the decentralized infrastructure for human governments is in place, which will take decades, it might indeed be best to cash some out into dollars in order to enact change through established channels. I haven’t done enough thinking about that.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:43:46
How about you tone down your patronizing attitude and lighten up a bit chucklefuck. You are wrong about Bitcoin, get over it. You underestimate it because you’re indoctrinated against collectivism. I don’t why why you would confuse optimism for militant bullshit but it’s probably because you are a jaded unimaginative normie. You can suck my dick on soft you mouth breathing simpleton. Fuck outta here.

Maduro IS a better leader. He was democratically elected with 67% of the vote. He represents the voice of the poor. He is the legitimate President. The people called a constitutional Constituent Assembly in order to overthrow the executive office which was taking the profits from commodities and privatizing them, leading to heinous inequality. Today, Venezuela is still around 70% privately owned. They aim to slowly socialize the means of production, and all they ask is to be free from harassment while they develop this model.
Maduro and his people’s nascent self-determined democratic model are constantly struggling against sabotage and western encirclement and sanctions that amount to economic war against the pueblos of Venezuela. The United States has spent $50M funneling money to the opposition party and training paramilitary groups of fascist “opposition protestors” to harrass chavistas and the general public. The privately owned media accuses Maduro of the most obnoxious things.
This is all because socialism is a threat to the capitalist model, which concentrates the surplus labor value as private profits. Venezuela has THE largest reserves of crude oil in the world. America the empire has installed puppet neoliberal governments in most South American countries. Not much has changed since the United fruit company and the CIA turned it into our “farm”. The people have had enough of living in shanties and barrios, they are organizing to end capitalist exploitation. Because of all of this, Trump is trying to recognize an illegitimate would-be usurper in Guaido, a guy who wasn’t even on the ballot in their last elections. In order to justify military intervention, our leaders are sowing misinformation and violence.
Venezuela’s elections have been called the fairest in the world by 1500 intl observers including the UN and Pres Jimmy Carter.
What we are doing is lying our way to another war of aggression for oil profits. Like Nicaragua, Chile, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria etc.
¡Viva la revolución Bolivariano!
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:11:44
These are not the facts. The people organized themselves and called a constitutional Constituent Assembly to overthrow the executive office that was privatizing profits and taking the wealth from them.
Maduro was democratically elected with 67% of the vote. Jimmy Carter calls Venezuelan elections the fairest in the world.
What you have in the propping up of Guaido and the assembly of 2015 is capital’s response to an attack on its model of privatizing gains and socializing losses. It is no different than what we did to Allende in Chile, to the sandinístas in Nicaragua, Rojava in Syria etc. Guaido is illegitimate and his opposition party is funded by the United States to the tune of $50M! This is quite frankly classic western imperialism.
This is precisely the use case for Bitcoin and crypto! By tokenizing the Petro, the Venezuelan people can bypass US sanctions and inflationary sabotage of their currency. They can sell the oil that is their birthright without foreign intervention in the form of economic warfare. 
¡Viva la revolución Bolivariano!

Jokes on them. It’s not teaching us about investing, but how illegal and dangerous the Wall Street’s financialization of the government has been.
You think I learn about something as revolutionary as Bitcoin and then go and trade stocks?
If anything, Bitcoin led to me learning about what real, sound money is. It led me to learn that most capitalist nations foreign policy is not funded by sound money but by debt subjugation and resource theft abroad.

What is a Keynesian with belief in classical liberal philosophy doing in aBitcoin subreddit?
Bitcoin can usher in the next evolution in economics.
The micro transaction aspect of bitcoin’s value transfer will enable organic public works and more direct government. 
When we replace the banks with real money, the govt (the cartels’ PR firm) will be irrelevant, and we can finally move on from private property and neoliberalism.

It’s just that stupid people are incapable of comprehending the depth of their deficiency. They think they are smart because they can’t imagine how someone else could have a much more robust, granular understanding.
Neither of us are citing anything so let’s not pretend we’ve lobbed anything but baseless assertions into the field of discussion. Bottom line is I think you are too stupid to really delve into this issue intelligently with me, you aren’t a dirtbag and so I’m not interested.

You sound like a self- righteous windbag and your ideas are shitty. 
Govt controlling monetary supply is debt subjugation in practice. Take away their debt enslavement apparatus, take away the state. We have been loosing the yoke of “authority” for a millennia, and are now moving into “cooperation”. 
Clever technologies like the printing press and Bitcoin are the tools we have found to fight a repression we cannot always articulate. Have you learned nothing from Bitcoin about money and class struggle? What the hell have you been doing this whole time?
