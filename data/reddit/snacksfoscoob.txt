live it up is my point. you wont be able to experience this again after the mining is done and international regulations are in place. buy and hodl until the last coun is mined. that, again, is my point. then go buy a f*****g latte and move on with your life, having sold off your BTC and received your BTC international debit card. god, why can’t I ever get intelectual feed back....

you may be missing my point, friend. what i mean is, when bitcoin is established as a currency, at the ‘starbucks’, our fiat converts to bitcoin then the bitcoin goes accross the counter to the dead eyed barista, the dead eyed barista rings it up converting it back to the fiat of the country you are buying your latte in, then the dead eyed barista spits out a sociopathic ‘have-a-nice-day’ then you piss off. 
The beauty part is, you can then go back home and use the same card and visit your local dead eyed barista and enjoy the exact same sociopathic exchange! win-win! and it WILL be LIGHTENING FAST. 
what you may be reffering to is the time consuming, hemeroid enducing 15 minute exchange of bitcoin for fiat and vice versa. c’mon man, use your brains dude! no offense.

True, but when folks realize how the introduction of cryptocurrency works, there will be no more ‘rockets’ or ‘running’ or money to be made otherwise because the game will be up. 
what i mean is, live it up now while we are using bitcoin like a shady biopharma pump-n-dump. it will eventually flatline to a level the international community agrees on, after the mining, and it will never change after that. never.
