Of course paying $287 for a vulnerable digital code was and is a bad idea. If even companies like Bitstamp can't protect their funds, how in the hell is average Joe going to succeed in securely purchasing, storing and using digital currency?
* Buying LTC between $0.01 and $50.00 was a bad idea.
* Buying Bitcoin over $5 was a bad idea.
* Accepting dogecoins (for free, or even getting paid to accept it) was and is a bad idea.
2015 will be the year of crypto's dead. Mark my words.
Litecoin will never see $3 again (it was and is a ponzi scheme of the Lee brothers, Charlie created it, his brother pumped is on his exchange).
Bitcoin will never see $400 again (maybe some small jumps over $300).
All other coins are practically dead already.
R.I.P. crypto.
Congrats on those who became rich. I respect you guys for making suckers like us (that includes me, I too have lost around $15k so far) believe in getting rich quick schemes. 
R.I.P not only to crypto, but to everyone who has committed or will soon commit suicide because he/she invested in this ponzi scheme.

Dont put too much trust into pieces of easily hackable digital code. Warren Buffet and Bill Gates advice against Bitcoin and have name it a pyramid scheme, a fad. Thomas Lee, bull-&gt;wrong. Tim Draper, bull-&gt;wrong. Charlie Lee, bull-&gt;wrong. See the pattern? Bulls are all wrong, bears are right. bitcoin will son go sub $5k and after that DOOOM will capital letter DOOOM.
