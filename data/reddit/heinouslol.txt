Why should btc have been 15k all this time?

Bitcoin is falling and all the coins follow.

This feels like a troll or attempt to mislead people. 
1. A spread between buying and selling price is to be expected on all things, including bitcoin. That's what exchange fees are. 
2. A spread of 15% is excessive. You have either been foolish and chosen a blatantly bad option or did not research your product. 
Gold bars, when purchased as bullion **and not collector pieces**, have a more transparent market price. 
It seems you bought gold that was not investment but a collector's piece. 
3. If you did indeed buy this, I am sorry for your new found understanding and '15%' loss. 
However, even still, that is part of the nature of diversifying. Some assets will go down and others go up. 
Would you be posting this if bitcoin went down 20%?

What are the impediments to bitcoin going 'mainstream'?
I am aware there are solutions to things like TPS; however, how realistic is it that a concensus will he achieved within the community of miners?
Secondly, how true is the fud surrounding tether manipulation?
