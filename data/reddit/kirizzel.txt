Why would a country prefer an even less stable currency, than the Euro?

The problem is, Dell never touches Bitcoins. The Bitcoins are exchanged for $ and then transferred to Dell. So the real winner is Coinbase.
Checkout the discussions on Hackernews ( We are building a centralized institution around a decentralized currency. But maybe this is necessary for Bitcoin to become popular in the first place.

I think it will go down further. On bitcoin.de people are selling huge masses.

But just because a bank doesn't keep it's money in the ECB, doesn't mean they are going to put it in speculative assets. As a bank, I would buy some government bonds, or just let it rot on internal bank accounts.

No matter what, FIDOR BANK will work with BTC!
@_date: 2014-07-19 09:05:09
No, it's because i.e. Coinbase operates mainly in the US with big corporations. The real winners of the Bitcoin hype are the third parties.
To name a fresh one, Dell doesn't come in contact with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin you pay them are exchanged for USD the moment you pay. Coinbase gets their cut.

Imagine what would happen, if Putin said, that Visa and MasterCard are not allowed in Russia, BUT Bitcoins are. Would be HUGE.

Ok, I see. So accepting Bitcoins directly is more about gathering Bitcoins, than accepting a reasonable payment for a service/product.
Let's say your service costs 0,02 BTC per month. Today you can buy those 0,02 for 6-7€, but maybe next month those 0,02 BTC will cost you 20 €. Should the price still be at 0,02 BTC per month?

How come, a community like wouldn't know about this...
And talking about "the only explanation" in terms of Bitcoin is pretty nonsense.

Why don't do the following:
1) Find a trustworthy person/organization
2) Let them start a kickstarter
3) Fund the project
4) Buy the Bitcoins
5) Give Bitcoins away for charity
Something flawed with that?

How about the use case of transfering money for free around the world? I know Bitcoin can also be used for this, but Ripple is specifically designed to.

Sooo, what does your service do? Why should I use it? Why should I switch, if I use something similar?

@_date: 2014-06-15 09:42:07
I have seen other projects getting a huge amount of money. Just find a trustworthy project starter, then buy the bitcoins and give everything away for a good cause/charity. This will create, I think, positive news.

Never said that this is something new. I'm just saying that the biggest german exchange now allows you to trade your bitcoins for gold.
(is full with "X now accepts Bitcoin", which also "isn't new", but part of the development of Bitcoin as a whole.)

Just bought a Dell U2414 from amazon. If they make it possible to buy with btc in Germany, I'll buy the second one there.

Was the algorithm changed somehow? I can't find anything in the release notes that is actually causing the confirmation time to go down.

How do you deal with volatility? Or is the BTC price calculated depending on the dollar price at the time of the payment?

I also don't get it why companies always give incentives to new customers, and not for paying, long-time members. It baffles my mind.
I assume it's because the numbers on the marketing slides need to be higher.

Could you tell me the difference between running a node and mining? I thought they are the same.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:58:31
How come? Is it because of the amount of the transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:11:13
Selling such an amount would have huge influence. People will start following the sell-bandwagon. If you have so many bitcoins you should sell on different markets, using many transactions.
