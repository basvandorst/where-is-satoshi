Revolut is pretty nice. I put most of my salery there as i live on the border. It has free exchange between currency and using their card is also free. Some limitation for a free account thought. Max 6000 USD usage per month or something and max 2000 in ATM withdraw. These are unlimited or very high if you have a premium account, but i have never past those levels. You can actual buy bitcoins in there too, but the fees is highish, not really ment for that
It also has some nice features for protection against skimming. Not exactly what you asked for but can strongly recommend. I stoped using any other debit card now.

Well kind of, but not exactly.
Card is 10 Euro total with delivery, atleast for me.
There is an algorytme that after a month of just having money there, they ask you to start using it proparly and then give you the card for free. You need 10 Euro or more for this to happend.
And yes ATM might be those for a normal account, i might have added a zero, but i always only pay with card, so i do not really withdraw money.
So i guees if your main use of the card is to get money in and then withdraw, then yes, this is not the card for you, but if you actually use a card to shop online or buy things in the store the limit is around 5000 Euro per month for the free account.
Hope this clerified something. And there is not hidden fee, which i like, they are quiet upfront with everything and every max limit you have is seen in the account options.
