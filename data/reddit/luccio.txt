Bitcoin is more like a form of banking, where everyone is his own banker.  The installment of this process must come first.  When a poor country needs money, it comes out with an ALT coin.  We saw this in Aurora, and Nautilus.  Then they trade their Alt for BTC and part of the global wealth goes over to that country.  The richer countries invest and the poorer countries take.  sort of an equilibrium of wealth at a global level.  Auroracoin tried to reinvest in its country by returning coins to its people, which they could of traded for BTC.  Eventually the people will get their phones accounts and bingo, they're in business.
My real worry is that crypto-currency will provide the poor with abundance, and market share for everything will more than double eventually!  The true question is does the planet have the finite resources to provide to this new crowd of people.  For now Bitcoin will help with the world problems of poverty, but we won't be able to sustain at this rhythm.

Centralization is more apparent, you are right, and you don't have to like and neither do I.  Right now, it's profitable to mine and you do see those big pools trying to stay up and running, but in the future when BTC is at 3 coins per block their won't be this centralization occurring.

The BTC is getting ready for the arrival of commercial money, but bitcoin is not ready yet.  Right now bitcoin is a way for little people to take $2000 of their money and make some sort of investment.  It's about you and I taking our hard earned dollars or whatever out and putting it back into the system.
You can invest BTC in Coince, BitStrategy, AimBTC, however commecial money will come, just a little later, and this is why we have yet to see the twins get their fund yet... but their ready!

The very first paragraph in this article.  Ya, the one underneath the picture...  That there people is the signed sealed and delivered promise that Bitcoin is going to work, dominate, and succeed.  It may take some time, but it's coming...
We live in a predefined world of laws rules and regulation.  This structure keeps us from moving forwards.  Imagine not having to buy permits, special machinery for a particular task, to do something your way, simple and efficient.
In simple terms, any bed of rules choke any process of evolution.  Then the Bitcoin community asks world governments, yes... like Canada, to not interfere with the new blockchain technology, or bitcoin.  Was this Satoshi's plan as well.
Divide and conquer...  So, no pertinent law, rule or regulation can stand firm.
If you want to succeed, don't be haltered by any bodies of rule.  Clear and simple!

Those instating this crypto-currency need to promote a slow and steady growth!  Would you buy a bitcoin or a part of a bitcoin at $14,476.24 a piece, if you had just heard about it for the first time?  No, it wouldn't catch on!  
There are still lots of people who don't know what BTC is still out there.  What i'm saying is if you implement to fast you may lose adoption.  It takes time for adoption to occur. 
 
So when it goes to fast, oops, a negative news comes out... criminal activities... hence silk road, meanwhile the relentless push for adoption is in occurrence, OverStock, Dell, NewEgg, Top notch wallets for Android, but nothing for Iphones, faucets, etc..
Don't get it wrong, it'll all come around.  Hell, the bank will transit on Blockchain technology and charge fees to the user who still can't adopt to change.
As we speak, new technologies are being built on this BlockChain, we are seeing the birth of SegWit, and Lightning Networks.  This will add to the accommodation of adoption.
I count my crypto in mBtc today and I can still fraction it out to uBtc...  Which means someone knew that BTC would one day be expensive.

Appreciate all the nice work, I'm not a novice at Pi3, and just trying to understand this Node make it so much more interesting.  I've come across a few nicks here and there, but then i'm a NOOB.   I thought you might like a few insiders as to how a NOOB installation is going.  It maybe obvious to many, but here is where I run into trouble in your guide.  
It maybe obvious to common users of the community, when installing Bitcoin Core, you have the first cmdline to move the /bin files, but nothing on the others! I had to figure out how to install the /include, /share, etc.  They may not be require to run the core, I don't know!  The incident helped me get around Linux some!
I seam to be stuck at creating the bitcoin.conf file.  I can create it anywhere, but where it is suppose to go.  I'm guessing on the external drive in the bitcoin directory.  It looks like /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin is a pointer, but then i could be wrong.  Anyway around this issue, I'm sure you pros got this all figured out?
Looking forward to the rest of my installation... thx for all the good work

@_date: 2018-01-17 05:44:55
2nd layer protocol 'Lightning Network' will settle this issue.  Sometimes when we have to make due with limits, such as block size, it helps push the technology to new heights.  Can you imagine if we went from 1mb to 2mb, then 4, 8, 16, 32 and so on, without trying other solution to growth.  Hell, it would end up taking a 500mb HD for just a block some day.  Without block expansion, we discovered how to 'off chain' transact.  Saving tons of HD space and confirming much faster.  Sometimes it is best to leave a product in its original state and develop around it then to actually modify it.

To hodl BTC is one thing, I guess one could wait 5yrs and get rich...  BTC is more than just a get rich scheme, it is a vibrant technology that is being pushed via a value payment technique.  LN, Atomic Swap, and other evolution are what make your BTC valuable.
What if MicroPayment in open channels become the next best thing for BTC.  What if all that could be done with BTC is open micro channels.  It's unlikely, but still it would be prudent to try to understand how BTC will evolve within the next 5 yrs.
I do agree, we all reach our moon, when we can just sit back, ignore the FUD, stop watching the price constantly, and HODL to what we have! MOON here too...

I understand bitcoin, blockchain tech., public ledgers, etc.  I also recognize the power of divide and conquer, the FUD in r/bitcoin.
BCC is a division a fork of bitcoin 'the original'.  it is deemed worthy of being called Bitcoin Cash, but it is just another AltCoin.  It will make its way in such, grow in the manner it originates from, have an existence worthy of its creation...
I find nothing wrong in this doing, Altcoin, scamcoin, whatever you want to call it.  However what puzzles me is WHY you find this coin unworthy of existence???  Why does every new comer need to be aware as if such an Altcoin is dangerious.  Maybe your just part of the publicity stunt for BCC.  Talk about it, good or bad don't matter, as long as we talk about it!

I guess it's more about exposure!  Say you had 350BTC, worth 100,000each.  No problem, all is good and exposure might be ok, and probably is!  That is, as long as those around you have some form of FIAT currency, than can make by with!  Look at you and say, "He's the lucky one."  
However like every good currency conversion, this one will be unique, it has a different form, it is digital, and very volatile.  At least for now, volatility!  They only way to move to a crypto base monetary system is to remove eventually the Fiat system.  This will remove volatility and businesses can use it finally as a currency.
So now, you are left in an exposed environment filthy loaded with BTC, while other close to you have NOTHING because Fiat is worthless, Pension are gone, and so is debt, by the same token...  Some will see that as greed, you as a scrooge, and their basic need will turn them against you.
Either, you expose yourself and learn to share now, or keep quiet and make it low profile.  I prefer the mix of the two... Low profile and share when the time comes!

Besides, she may not be wealthy after the crash, as such a crypto owner might be, but all forms of debt she has will be alleviated.

I fear a strike of mass destruction on US soil, by US, and a pointing of the finger to Iran.  With USD gone most other world Fiat currencies will follow suite.
I see a civil war, but at a global level...  I walk with a ugly picture in my mind all the time, and no matter how I think of it, it just keeps on happening.

We are in the transfer of wealth mode, money moves into Bitcoin.  What we need to understand is past that point, when Satoshi is the monetary system.  When I say 125sats for a cup of coffee, I'm not translating it to the gone Fiat value, for it is no more.  By removing the current monetary system I can set a price for my coffee, that pleases me.  Not have to fear if the value of that cup will drop or rise due to volatility, for that also will be gone with the old Fiat system removed.  
Now, does anyone have an issue with the old system being remove.  Does anyone not see the Death of Fiat just around a corner.  It can be hard to conceive, a concept hard to grasp.  The Fiat method of doing money is dying as we type here today.  Taxation, Inflation, Corruption, even Law(the permission giver) is choking any progress, for nothing gets done, its too regulated!
In order for the 6billion who don't have readily available banking to get on the bang wagon with the new Crypto method of doing money.  The current money will have to go, cause I don't see someone who is bankless buy Bitcoin at an Equivalent of $1,250,000 a bitcoin even less 10,000.
The only way for BTC to deliver on its promise to bank the unbanked, and free the people... from what, else be law!  Is for Fiat to Crash and Burn.

Maybe not at 10,000$/BTC, but at 634,877$/BTC hell ya!  They won't want to hurt you, just put the coins back into circulation.

Well not really,  Remember BTC is about banking the unbanked too.  USD and BTC will co-exist for a time, as that's whats going on right now.  One day the price will be too volatile to do business with, so many will stay with FIAT.  Would be sort of a dead end street for BTC if that was the case.  Not to mention the unbanked won't be able to do shit with BTC, even if you gave it to them.  
If BTC stayed along side Fiat and Gov regualated the shit out of it, nobody would do anything without permission.  This would seriously slow the dev to a crawl.
Dude, I don't like it anymore than you do... But Fiat has to die, for the unbanked to get banked and/or for new ideas come to life and fleurish.  Don't be to sad, Your debts will be wiped out, no more mortgage, by the same token your pension will be too, buy hey!  
I see the world looking like Venezuela right now someday in the coming future.

Sorry man, you are assisting the biggest transfer of wealth in all of human history.  From physical format to electronic.  This change must happen ever so slowly, this is why the media or propaganda shoots out a negative or doubtful remark once in a while.  No matter how much we want to think, this is a bubble, a scam, or whatever.  It is still growing to this day!
To pull the plug on crypto in general, means Billions of dollars would be lost, for how much is all crypto worth?  And if such a thing did happen would any human being ever invest a penny in any crypto again?  The Genie is out of the bottle, the tech is hear to stay!
For now we will take your doubting remarks as an attempt to slow down growth, but when mass adoption occurs!  You, world governments, nothing will be able to stop this!

Change and Innovation requires new symbols.  There is nothing wrong with the current $ sign.  However to prolong its use would refer to an old monetary system that has brought on Debt, Slavery, and Corruption.  A new start, a new physical representation is needed not only to enhance, but to rid of the ancient method.  We understand how you feel, but the old $ sign just won't do.  Change is coming and is healthy.  Please don't fear it, but embrace it!

The more laws rules and regulations you have the less you produce.  It's amazing anything ever gets done in the world. 
I say, "fuck it", let laws, rules, and regulation, fall along side the current monetary system!  Let Bitcoin be ridden of the last Fiat cancerous parasitic symptom, 'Volatility'.  And move forward to a new dawn of age, where talent, ingenuity, and development, bring forth to the human race, the benefits of our labours and research from all to all.  
Letting us come as one, censorship resistant, border less, decentralized...  Mr Draper is right, to many laws out there, and the current establishment can't turn itself off.  So the USA is fucked if it don't capitulate on its debt, bringing down law with it!  This is gonna hurt but a better necessity for the masses!

Anytime you hold back from buying BTC is a wast of time.  I told my friend back in May(3.6k) to buy some, you're hesitating for nothing.  "Bah!, I'll wait till it goes down below 1k", "The Bitcoin Bubble has popped. it's over." 
So, I bet with him, 1 beer... it goes over 10k and he was sure it would go under 1k.  We all can clearly see who won this bet.  Maybe if you don't understand money and bitcoin, you definitely can't see the transfer of wealth, that it about to occur.
Put it this way!  By crashing Fiat we eliminate global debt, 1 chain off the ankle.  Crash of Fiat, brings on the crash of Gov..  That entity that has slowed any for of progress to a crawl with its laws rules and regulations. 2nd chain of the ankle.  How does that bring prosperity, you might ask??  6 billion new buyers, that now can transact with a phone, whereas they could with a standard bank before!  The wing that will propel commerce to a new level.
Buy, now or buy later, one thing for sure, it coming soon!

I came to me pretty easy, I never read the White Paper.  I did read the chapter of Revelation in a new testament and did see the fall of money.  I though of BTC as just another money that would eventually fall, for the longest time...  
Then one day, someone showed me this site called fiatleak.  It still exists today right here :    Back at the time it was somewhat different.
Then things started to make more sense about what I had been reading.  The Beast(money) that takes a fatal blow to the head, but lives.  How the fuck is anyone to understand that.  Fatal meant dead and yet it lives!  Clearly I began to understand the Death of Fiat and the Birth of this new Bitcoin thingy.
"So that no man may buy or sell. else he be marked in his hand and on his forehead with the number of the beast(money), and his number is 6 three times of 6"  Just another mathematical calculation!
With all the Fiat money in circulation today, how in the hell is no man able to buy or sell?  Then it dawns on me, Fiat is going out the window, and crypto with the phone in one hand and the PIN in memory, will be the new and only accepted way of purchasing or selling.  Even the unbanked will get a shot at money!
I'd watch as the ring would go up that webpage and understand, how value is being transferred into crypto from and with Fiat.  If ever crypto is to be used as a currency, Fiat would have to die.  This is normal, you can't sell a car for an equivalent in Satoshies, if the value of that is going to tank 20% next day.  Best is just to stop comparing it to a Fiat equivalent.
This happened to me in 2012, bought just a bit back then and as they say HODL on.  I'll never be rich and famous with what I have, but I consider myself to be "ready" for a Fiat Crash, that eventually will have to happen.
Today I see even better and the visions grow, like a seed of mustard, the smallest seed comes the biggest tree.  The world will rid itself of the financial debt, the law will fall, and the unbanked will get their cell phones.  Prosperity and innovation will come to life with the debt and regulation chokers gone and 6 billion new users online!

10000 is indeed a marker in BTC history!  The hodlers are happy, the noobs are all anxious, those who bought and never bothered to inquire about the technology, are all ready to sell...
And so we find, the educated are still hodling, the noobs are all ready to jump in, and the uneducated selling.
Hodlers... You held good, give yourself a gift in reward to your deed.  Go out a get yourself a little gift on-line, and have it shipped in.  If you want to help BTC move up, buy someone a little gift and have the 'Paid in BTC' logo on it!  Show them it works.  As for the uneducated, leave them their fears, for it was written, that the lasts will be first and the firsts will be last.

It's not just about the ride, it's about all that is learned along the way!  If the majority knew how money works and where it comes from, there would be a revolution like never seen before.  The arrival of bitcoin will kill the use of Fiat, weather it be by usefulness, the need for mass adoption by the unbanked, or whatever reason.  The mere acquisition of knowledge of the FIAT base system will push it out of use.  We are headed towards the financial collapse of Fiat, that's for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:06

I think it's an indicator to manage 'adoption', and you will see it stay btwn 50 and 60% for the longest time to come. Adoption is done through a game of trade, remember how we all started with Dogecoin, and moved on up!  
The more new comers, the more dominance goes up, because they buy BTC to start with!  The more they trade BTC for other coins in hope to make a quick profit, the more dominance of Alts go up, thus BTC dominance comes down.  
When there is not enough number of traders, they provide and incentive to promote adoption, this is why we see the spikes in price, those big up swings like the 19900USD, we saw last December.  
After a price swing, many new comers begin to notice BTC.  They buy, trade, and the Dominance adjust newly.  Adoption slowly occurs, and the world slowly moves off FIAT paper money to e-cash, Bitcoin.
Remember for any crypto to succeed long term, it must have a slow adoption rate.  Would you have tried to adopt BTC if it had come out to the market at 19900 a bitcoin way back in the early years?  BTC will stay in power 50-60%, but it has to leave room for Alts 40-50%.  It needs alt to allow itself to grow!
I don't know if I make myself understood, but all you need to remember is, if BTC Dominance grows to high, not enough new comers, meaning too slow of an adoption, price hike in upcoming future!  If Dominance goes too low, means newcomers are trying the Alts. they have something to adopt to!  For what do we do with our crypto right now???  I see billions of $$$$ worth in the system, but my streets are not anymore filled with Lambos.

Some bought some at $600USD, some are still happy to say, I got 20$ and i never invested a cent.  I begged other to just prepare.

4.  Thou shall pray Cyber Security with all thy heart and thy might !
5.  Thou shall HODL with all thy strength in the midst of darker times !
6.  Thou shall buy only in thy Dip !
7.  Thou shall ignore FUD and FOMO, but stay connected with thy revolution !
8.  Thou shall praise Bitcoin onto others, as others praised Bitcoin on to the !
9.  Thou shall not claim where thy "Price" will be in the future, for only God knows !
10. Thou shall not be tempted by another coin !
When cometh the war against "Fiat", I shall call on my wrath to each and all, big and small, rich and poor, freeman and slave, first and last.  To those who followed these commandments and enrichth the in thy new light, remember from where thou has fallen !  For on the new day of crypto, ye shall be called to share with loved one.

I like the part where you promote bitcoin.  I adhere others to wallets and give them a little bit.  They get bitcoin, they watch it at first, they see it go up and down.  Some hodl, some spend, some convert back to cash at a teller.  They get the sense of responsibility with managing the backups and keys.  They learn what kind of economic system they live in right now.  It's more than just a get rich scheme.  They might hodl, but then some won't waste BTC on a LAMBO, or other expensive over gloated useless things, the actually learn to see the necessities, all in the while banking another 4 billion people.  I do agree, we should be doing our part in the growth of BTC.  I did talk to McDonald's, Second Cup, and many small franchises, but they are franchises.  It's harder, it's not just a local store, the charge needs to be implemented through out the franchise.  So bitcoin might be off to a slow start, but i see one day, along side ApplePay, GooglePay, Bitcoin, then we can all spend responsably.

But to try to understand, now that is much harder than judging, and that pretty much goes for everything.  Just try to see it when you judge things off.  As for what would of been for BTC, you would have been judged by thy own words.  The days BTC hits $2500+ you would be crying why God has kept you in the dark about BTC.
Remember, nothing is good, nothing is bad, everything is just different!  Welcome aboard, your repent should not be left unnoticed, here is your first tip!  Right now the BTC is tanking and will continue to do so til the 15th of April.  Between now and then get to a BTC ATM machine and buy $50.00 worth of BTC, for after the 15th you can expect a rise!

They could sell all their Gold2.0 and then shut it down, but that would lead to a global catastrophe!  OR  They can eliminate the dept fiat system.  Install a crypto, such as bitcoin, let it evolve and WHAM O... Nuke NYC and let the USD implode, bah just blame it on the Arabs right!  Many countries hold USD as it has been a world reserve currency for a while now!  Their countries would also undergo financial collapse, making the crypto a dept less new world reserve and a new one world currency unit.

Wow, I thought the deal was... 'Invest only what you are prepared to lose'.  My advise, bring you average down, only if you purchased high, put it all on paper wallets, put them away safe, and then.  Remove all BTC apps on your computer, phone, office, everywhere, and move on with life.  Take a scuba diving course!, learn to play saxophone, change you mind from BTC to something else you'd like to do, and not have to do!
In a few years from now, see what gives!  You will still have your BTC, if your average is low and the price has gone up, you're on top with the upper hand only because, you are now a great saxophone player, and dive the Caribbean ocean!
BTC is a complement to life, an excitement to life, it is not life...  You did your share investing in your future.

The banks don't care, the goal for the IMF, is one world currency unit.  The BTC.  Keep the price on a flux, up down.  Down, new comers get in. Up, they make money.  The IMF doesn't care who gets the money, either it be you or the banks, as long as it goes one global currency.
2) Corporate acceptance of BTC,  it should start with all major airlines, and pleasure cruise-liners, you know the things we have fun with, the things we want to take our money out for!  Recreational Vehicle Camping sites.  That Mediterranean cruise, including airfare, all in BTC.  Trains, etc.

In the case of 100+ BTC.  I's very simple. 2 things.  One, you want to keep an eye on that, so as they don't just disappear over night. Two you want that off-line, far from the prying hand of hackers!
My suggestion, is break it down into 4 paper wallets, generated off-line, 25+ each.  Each using a unique pass-phrase or password.  Paper wallets are stored in a plastic zip-lock bag for moisture protection.  The private keys associated with their corresponding public key should be copied to a SD, USB, or a removable media device by an off-line computer, and that to should be zip for moisture!
Paper wallets can be stored in a safety deposit box, along with the SD/USB device at a local bank.  No sense in banking crypto if your gonna have a version hanging around the house.
The four keys should be installed in view mode only on an Application such as Mycelium, or links to the blockchain should be created in your browser, as to keep an eye on them as you move from day to day!
If long term banking is required, then only passwords can be kept around the house, say in a cookie jar, picture frame, etc.
Enjoy crypto man it's alot of fun!

For bitcoin to rocket blast, i first need users.  You know, give everyone a chance to get on this ride.  It's people such as you that buy their first 5BTCs that push the price to many Ks.  Now if BTC went ballistic overnight, and then you saw this, you probably wouldn't of jumped in.  Then the price of the coin wouldn't go up!  The few user would have lost everything as BTC would die without users. 
So don't expect to see any return anytime soon, but it is a wicked good investement right now.  Keep in cold storage, away from hackers.  Remember hard drives will fail and paper will burn.
5yrs down the road, pull it all out and check it out all over again!

Thank you all for so many replies.  I guess time is what BTC needs to become more popular.  I thought that the most efficient way for BTC to get public awareness was to have it jump to $4247.00USD, and then come down back to $1200.00.  Just like the first time BTC went from 129 to 1100.  The media can then raise a few eyebrows.  It was that first jolt that got my eyes open!  Another such event would be successful for sure.

To instate, 1 global currency is a tricky thing.  Rise to fast and lose half the planet for users.  Sink to low and lose the current users.  Trick is a slow spread not to much climb.
Step 1: make it noticeable, that first 1200$ climb, grab that attention.
Step 2: get as many BTCs to control growth, silkroad, MtGox.  Good news promotes growth and bad news slows growth. After step 1, bad news was needed. (silkroad)
Step 3: get some BTC ATMs out there, everywhere, this is the next big business opportunity! APPs for Android Mycelium, etc, is progressive, add Iphone and growth is to fast.  We control Apple, and don't worry, we will eventually let you people have it on your Iphones.
Step 4: Stock Exchanges, commercial money, investments, mutual funds, etc.  This will bring your next rise...to the moon..., making it more popular, in turn adding new global users, but we will have to slow that down for the need to add commerce will be at hand.  Everything from subways and McDonalds up to large international companies.
These steps will take some time, so if your in for the long haul, hang in there.  If your the next business venture, get a ATM in your city. Just don't expect to see this jump like some company stock like Facebook, Google or Twitter or a population of rats on an island, this only occurs in an uncontrolled environment.  As you see it get more and more popular in your local area, and the price of BTC is still where it is, you'll understand.

I think this is just another step in BTC growth.  Btc wants to make the NYSE.  Seems we are getting ready for corporate investments, Mutual funds, etc.  Is it just me, but with a name like 'Second Market', the only possible way to build such a big firm in just the right time, is by reinstating MtGox technologies...
Anyways, this might explain the slow climb in BTC value these days!

Everyone is entitle to his or her opinion on BTC, to share it, embrace it, be passionate about it, which ever way it goes, for better or for worst.
Is it so hard to understand that we, in common, look to BTC as to relieve us of our pain of Fiat, and that some of us might hurt more than others.

Guys, the man has a point!  The Elites own and control the banks, banks control Gov. .  The very first bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, Canada was supplied with an operational contract from the Bank of America.  It commonly known that Canada is a test market for the USA.  A few cryptos out there are actually run by banks!  Bitcoin US Banks, LTC Chinese Banks, FTC Barkley's Great Briton!

There is a tons of money to be made around BTC.  ATM machines, indirect stuff like that!  Bigger still, the USD is world wide accepted, so it is easy to make BTC a global currency.  Making BTC legal tender is the next step!
But know this, if BTC was a menace to the USD, something would of been done about California's legal tender bill, which means, BTC will one day DOMINATE.

When Senators buy BTC from an ATM on Capitol Hill, it is safe to say that BTC will take over the world.  We knocked off Mohamar Kaddafi because he wanted to move the oil from the petro-buck to the gold dinar.  This BTC is a way even bigger threat to the USD than Kaddafi was.  It is thus safe to say, BTC is created in America, by Americans, and pushed or controled by American Gouv.
So go out and buy some, sit on them for a few years, because according to my calculation, BTC will have a slow climb as not to lose anyone on the way...
Eventually they, the gouv., will have to take a stand on BTC, but then again that may not be in their best interest.
We'll see!

Bitcoin is a tool, used to move the human race from type 0 to type 1.  It will be painfull, after bitcoin has taken over the worlds economies, we will just turn it off.  Look at it this way people, no matter how you look at it, bitcoin is the last form of currency the human species will ever know.  Type one civilization will have no need for currency, and gunk at the very fact we used it, no matter what the form!  Hey, such is the process of human evolution, which BTW has come to a complete stop, because of currency!
Yes, all our live we have payed the banksters, and now the banksters are letting us off the hook with BTC.  No, no, people... nobody does something for nothing!  Remember the words of Christ, 'He who is not against me, is with me'.  Yeah, banksters want you on BTC, cause I don't see them going all up against BTC.  Money and government go hand in hand, this BTC does give us the feel of freedom.  A pushed example would be, if the usury of money crashed, law would crash as well!  So, your government is giving you liberties now, cause they're purchasing BTC on capitol hill.  Again nobody does something for nothing!
Please remember folks, it's not about what happens with currency, it's about why currency is being changed at the price of banking system failures(a good thing) to giving people freedoms again(another good thing).
Theoretical evolution dictates that the end if type 0 is soon at hand, enjoy while the going is good, cause it's all about to come to a complete halt!

Since money is not the issue here, but the multiplication of money!  May I suggest taking 11K, 1/2 of the amount of your funds, and hold them in BTC for 5 yrs.  After 5 yrs, see who did best!  BTC or your account!  Sure 37% in 5 is good, but what's better is 37% every yr.  It's not like your loosing money, the original 16k is still there, and after 5yrs if you don't like BTC...sell them!  
Oh, and it's not insane... There is a psychological barrier instated when it comes to playing with money... No one like to bet, take chances, gamble with retirement funds especially!  But I see it going places!

I know you're impatient, BTC is not moving, if anything it seams to be dropping.  Remember this cryptocurrency, this electronic money, is a globally intended way of trade.  In essence we want the whole world on crypto.
If BTC goes up to fast, I will lose a lot of players, and I can't have that right now.  Mass adoption is priority!  Things like the BitDrop in Dominica.  Then a few more countries...
Remember it's mass adoption that will give you that $14000/BTC in the future.
Please hold on for a few more years, as time moves forward adoption will be faster, and then the price will rise.  For now, put your wallet aside or in a vault or whatever, and let it go.  Pick it all up in 5 years and enjoy!
You have the advantage of getting in early, very early!

Well, I think BTC will jump some in 2014, when I don't know.  Demands where made to add BTC to NASDAQ as a title, including other Exchanges.  Right now the majority of people are not sure what BTC is, less how to go about getting some.
Once Btc is on an exchange some investor will try to cap on a rise in price, driving the Btc up.  I call this cooperate money, whereas right now Btc knows only individual money.
I talked with an old friend last week, she had no idea what Btc was or is.  Let coorperate money have a go, let the media sell Btc over TV and papers.  This will cause a sharp rise, but when...  I don't know, I just know it's the next step for Btc.

Good Idea Sir, just too much.  If BTC is to succeed in being a currency as much as a store of value, then those 21mil coins have got to be in circulation.  Give that in 30yrs the price of BTC maybe very high, 210 coins might be outrageously to much.  Your son, even though well educated, could go from something to nothing.  It is a proven fact that when a human being become too wealthy, he become broken, dysfunctional, distorted, and twisted.  EX: Trump.
Get him 1 instead, he will live comfortable thanks to you.  If the number of coins is your issue, go LTC instead, a much wiser choice.  BTC value of Lite has dropped in Satoshies, but the price remains at 3.75 to 4.00USD.
Variety is the spice of life, and diversification never hurt.  Who is to say what will be in 30yrs.  I say 1BTC, and 500LTC, but a wise thing to do for your nextgen.  I got some for my 3 kids!

Well my old graphic card miner is pretty much useless at hashing Sha256 on its own, and in a pool it returns peanuts a day!  So I thought Litecoin, but the same problem there!  The miner is still good, gave me a lot of dogecoin as well back at the time.  Now, it's time to mine another coin.  So I set it on the third core wallet after BTC and LTC.  My little miner makes 37FTC a day.  Maybe the developer team of these three wallets will one day give FTC some note of interest.  For now, FTC has gone Neoscrypt and the network maintains btwn 300 and 400 megahash.  It's not wasting time, just borrowing time, I take a chance that one day FTC will make a come back!  No, I don't think it is a waste of time!

it's fair to say BTC will continue its ascension, not just price wise.  Developments, advancements, new apps, new uses.  It will do its thing, which is lead the way to progress.  Not to HardForf, or SoftFork, but to just stay the way it is as a pillar in the structure of evolution.
ETF adoption, goods and services offerings for BTC, etc., will rise, and all the time the price will adjust accordingly to a slow but progressive growth.  We'll see economic systems of Fiat crash, and in the misery, adoption come about.  It'll be fast, the next 2 yrs are going to be very interesting!

I created a wallet on their phones, providing it's an Android with a complete Mycelium Backup. 2mBtc gift, hell it was worth $0.52 CAD back at the time.  I kept a copy of their backups, in case they really didn't give a shit.  They laughed at me.  I had done this for many work friends.  Their curiosity made them accepting, and some of the comment where, "$0.52 cents... YOU CAN'T BUY COFFEE WITH THAT."  This was in late 2015.
They held on because I worked with them.  When they changed devices I asked them where their mBtc where?  "I don't know!"  Some of them didn't care to save their backups...
Now, their 2mBtc is worth $2.92CAD,  That's 2 coffees in our machine at work!  Occasionally one come to me and says, "My $0.52 cents is now worth $2.92CAD. nice"  Then, this is where it gets FUN and where the true nature of Bitcoin comes alive!!!
I tell them, "Imagine if you had bought $1000 dollars worth back at the time!" and then I show them my wallet, "I did!"
You only learn that fire is hot when you burn yourself at its flame.  Most of my friends now take their 2mBtc a little more seriously.  They have their proper backups and recognize their importance.  Some invested as much as $80 dollars.
Finally when my phone wallet had more money than my back account, they where all stunned!  A few are still skeptical, but in time they will realize what is happening and jump in before the ship leaves port!
Most people laugh and comment, but when it's time to get free virtual coffee money, they listen.  It's all in the approach! Enjoy

Hey you wanna see how BTC acks, for the majority of your statement is right, but not all.  Your right, it doesn't get much media when it goes up, but when it drops! WOW, the news are quick to report BTC lost 30% in 5hours or 5Days.  Now it's back over 1000USD, but no hype anywhere.  The behavior of BTC is largely constructed with this in mind.  If your a 3rd world country we are giving you time to catch the boat, if your first world country, we are asking you to stay off the peer!  1st world countries implement the infrastructure but will make it hard for you.  3rd world get first dibbs, why, because the idea of corporation is to wealth the unbanked so the can buy shit.  The 1st world has money, banks, and shit.  I'm not saying that BTC is controled, but it might be lead along by some powerful people!  Nevertheless it is fun to watch...

1- there is the first world countries, and the third world countries.  They range from rich to poor.
The First world countries have currency, and plenty of it! The move to crypto would be sooooo slow, whereas the Third world countries would pick it up rather quickly, but then why would the Third world countries adpte crypto, if the First world doesn't use it or hasn't adapted it yet.  Can't buy a TV online from America if America isn't half adapted.
First world countries need first adapt their crypto and then the rest could join in.  4Billion First world users first, and then the other 3.5Bil. can jump.
Maybe bitcoin can change its name not so much for what it can do, but more for how its going to do it.  Become the One World Currency Unit, or the 'GCU' Global Currency Unit'.  
And how do we get the First world to adapt to crypto?
We take away their Fiat, or devalue it slowly over time.  The price of oil has dropped tremendously, hurts the job sector across the First world countries, less income, less taxes, etc.etc.etc.  Economic crash looms, and all of a sudden the crypto heaven opens up.  This is in the making as oil is not going up anytime soon.  No wonder they lifted sanctions on Iran.
But back to the New Name of BTC.  It would have to hold the ancient dollars and cents denominations.  Something less sophisticated and easier for the Third world to understand, and many of the First world for that matter.
Global Currency Unit, GCU.  1Unit, 53 Parts for $1 and 53cents.  Units being the current uBtc denomination.
Besides when it all said and done, we will be exchanging at the satoshi level won't we?
I say call it the GCU.  1Unit53 = 0.00000153sats = $1.53c.  No more words like "coin", "bit", remember we have a world to conquer with crypto.
Any other ideas??? We are open to suggestions, and PLEASE before you call the name stupid or dumb, you come up with one, and why you chose it that way.

Now Now people, before we send our friendly time traveler back to anywhere, or have him take his meds, lets take a big eye view of what he's saying...  I read, someday BTC will be a OneWorldCurrencyUnit (OWCU), and I ask of you, if not true is it possible? Yes!
If Crypto was to become the only means of exchange, people wouldn't take cash anymore.... safe to say!!! Yes!
Without our cell phones going off in our pockets, and the system did crash, would we all not be broke? Yes!
If everyone in the world was suddenly broke...For a piece of apple would we kill? Yes!
If BTC was a tool to have us better turn on each other, would they also not send out the drones? Probably, but unlikely!
As for time travel, Einstein came out with E=MC2.  Prof. Alcubierre, has derived the formula for warp travel, or bending space/time... In essences time travel.  So will it be readily available in the future? Yes, again!
As the producers would say, "Same plot, new twist"
Meanwhile, I have this guy who says, "No man can buy or sell if he not be marked with the number of the beast, and that number is 6, 3 times 6.
As for the 'no man can buy or sell', the hell with that, we all have a form of currency, Dollars, Lires, Pounds, Baths, etc., however if people won't take your money, your purchasing power is dead, and you can't buy or sell, right? Yes!
Bah! same plot different twist this traveler guy, Jesus did the same thing 2000yrs ago, and who believes him?  They thought he needed his meds at the time too.
So here's a truth, there is a master slave relationship with the usery of money, either it's in crypto or not!  When the masters are done with the slaves, they execute them, else the slaves turn on them... strictly a question of survival.  So when the time comes, that technological paralysis can no longer be withheld, and capitalism must fall.  Making it fall will be a cinch compared to many different local currencies!
Is mass extinction in the making? maybe so!

It is in my opinion that the SEC don't want to get their hands dirty on Cryptocurrence.  An ETF will come to pass, and it will rise in the 'consent by silence' of the SEC.  If such a thing happens this way, then it is in the work that one day BTC be turned off, how I don't know!  I only know nobody does something for nothing, and if they do nothing it is for a reason as well.  The SEC in due time will come out and say, 'Sorry we never approved this, it just went through by default'.  It's called the Art of Washing your Hands.

Fear not my fellow BTC and LTC believers... It's only a shift in wealth... In order for BTC to grow it must be used or exchanged.  Those who held on to BTC for the rise to power are now getting a good exchange for LTC!  BTC is back in circulation again through this exchange.  Then the market rises, and when BTC comes short of circulation the BTC/LTC becomes good again.  The wheel turn for another extended time.
Meanwhile, Apps, Killer Apps, Publicity, awareness, grows and grows! soon enough the value of BTC is at a record high and LTC is just behind...  Think of LTC as a life insurance to BTC.
Now, would you let BTC's life insurance die, until Btc was well enough established to live on its own?  No, so sit back, relax, enjoy the ride, this is great new times and technology.
it'll all go back up!

No, this is a live and learn situation for miners as well.  While BTC is expensive to use 'fees', I don't use them, I hold instead.  Miners are losing my expensive fee!  Right now, I could use BTC for online purchases, groceries, local pizzaria 'yum', in my town.  Miners aren't getting my higher fees!  To bad, I would of like to use them once in a while, but it's unreal right now.  I won't encourage this just yet.  Hold for now!

The Elite's Goal is a One World Currency (OWC).  They knew that the creation of such a crypto-currency, would eventually lead to the fall of their own dollar, hell; it's in the plan!  Yes, they are in the places of Bank Directors, Corporate Directors, any many other high places.  But they don't care, the Hegelian Dialect of the World Trade Centers was just the beginning of the length they are ready to go, to achieve the Goal.
The fight in the Middle East, War on Terror, Muslim Propaganda, are just the first signs that lead to such a Dialectic.  The Americans need to have a bad boy for their West Coast as well, hence North Korea.
Bitcoin is part of the plan, it's just a tool to buy some time to push back the inevitable time frame to Global Civil War.  When Bitcoin reaches 100,000.00 or more or whatever, a coin, we might all be rich, but our riches will be short lived.  IMO, it all stars with a Nuke on NYC, how MH370, when soon, why OWC.  This is the picture of my road ahead.
The SEC voted no, because it can't vote yes, or else upon default of their own money, the USD, bitcoin would also fall, maybe not all, but some or enough.  BTC not ruled, or governed in any way, is the only way it can come to life, by which I mean, the only means of exchange left to Human Kind, and or what is left of Human Kind.  
Once USD out of the way, the moon, but will you and I still be around?  You from Canada?  I'm from Quebec, Can

No matter what anyone says, look around you...  The corporation I work for doesn't accept cash anymore...  We are moving into a cashless society...

Maybe you, as an investor, should wait on negative interest rates from your bank holdings before you move into cryptocurrencies, but buy then, you'll probably have missed that boat this article is talking about.  You know, where it says you can win big!!

You agree first countries to adopt get BTC at a much better price, then the last one to adopt.  BTC is a money of misfortune, by that I mean, it grows on a population when things like hyper inflation, topping off bank accounts by governments, reprinting old bills to new ones in the name of corruption.  These reasons and other will push a nation towards adoption, but what about the last nation to adopt?  They get BTC at a much higher cost, and since they are the last to adopt, they will have to be the wealthiest countries in the world.  The richer the country the later the adoption.  Most people there won't want it!  Why buy 5000 satoshies for $250, when we have a perfectly good fiat system in place.  I fear that the push for this new One World Currency Unit, which is what it is, will eventually have to force some latecomers into adoption.
What misfortune do you think will be reserved for which final adopter?  Anything anyone!!!

The actual mark of the Beast is 6, 3 time 6.  Just a mathematical computation I guess.  Just like cryptography, a mathematical computation.  You got into bitcoin, made a wallet on your phone, and your left hand is where I believe you might hold it.  You gave that wallet a NIP, right?  Something you keep into memory of your brain, somewhere behind your forehead.  That's where I keep mine.  So yeah!  Implant or not, you have been marked all along...
We all know in biblical terms, money is the actual "BEAST".  That beast that has taketh a fatal wound to the head, but lives on.  My question is how can a beast, something pertaining to life, take a fatal blow, but live on?
Time for wisdom, the beast is not a live entity, but a changing one!  The beast that takes the fatal blow is FIAT.  The beast that lives on is CRYPTO!  This is the reason we write the 666, mathematical computation bit.  
However, thank you for noticing that we are in the "END TIMES", after all 666 is part of the Apocalypse or the Revelations chapter.  The wealthy Fiat people are not going to give up on their riches, Fiat will be taken out swiftly, I guess we can say, like a blow to the head.  Then crypto will take shape!  
We are type 0 civilization, get ready for the coming of type 1.  The death of Fiat will take many with it, careful not to get caught in the crossfire.  It is good to see this coming and never to forget that you are foremost Human to Cyborg! ;-)

I also have to add...  What's in it for China then?  Easy, China opens up a new market of 4Billion people who don't have readily available banking and can't make trades or purchases.  The Chinese see the possibilities with the technology and so the mine intensely.
America clears it dept!
China gains a whopping market share of new buyers!
Meanwhile the technology explodes and us small time bitcoin owners... well we sit on a few coins and wait for the price to provide for a happy retirement!
My notice to those who don't have any BTC yet!

Hell, I've even to them about the inability to cut copy and paste by computers.  They looked at me as if I came from another planet... Loser with a capital L   So, I gave up...

Curious... ok, here how it's gonna go, and it is the same way it's been going all along.  Btc does fluctuate, new technologies as this one are volatile.  1)Btc need adoption.  If Btc goes through the roof, or to the moon as they say, we lose adoption and without adoption Btc dies a slow death.  This leads us to 2.  The halving will make Btc rise for sure, but that same rise can lead it to it's death.  So coins must be reinstated into the market, or if you prefer, Satoshi Nakamoto must sell a shit load of coins to compensate for the rise.  3) When mass adoption occurs, that 'S' curve, Btc will rise and a few more coins will be pumped back into the market as to smooth down that growth rate.  
This is all done in a context where we are trying to give third world countries like Bangladesh, a certain purchasing power, and bring them out of the dark ages.  The idea of Btc was not to make you rich, you have available banking, the idea is to make the world a better place for everyone.
Got a few bucks, buy some.  I go once a week to a teller and put in 20-50$.  Hold on to it, it'll rise, then fall, then rise, then fall, then rise, and in time... you will come out on top!

@_date: 2016-06-04 05:57:56
I agree, BTC will probably have a major drop, then it'll hardfork.  After all does it have a choice?  People don't fix things till it's broke.  I've been expecting this for a while now and have calculated that it will fall to 239USD, 200 is a bit low, before it's up and running again!

When a country goes tits up(that's after the US screws it up), we usually go in with donations.  The goal is not to rescue the hungered people or supply them with necessities , even less electricity.  The goal is to force them off FIAT and into CRYPTO... Of coarse bitcoin is to the rescue!!!  
The cash is in the streets already...poof hyperinflation til it's gone.  Now, Credit Card companies.  I wondered how they where going to get that out of Venezuela.  It's not like you can hyper-inflate that out of existence.  Just cut the service under pretexts that the local government is corrupt.  Yes, Maduro is working with the global Elites, this never would of happened under the Chavez gov.
I watch it all unfold, and it gives me the heads up as to what will be happening later in other countries!  All in the while, crypto adoption is instated, pushed or forced down our throats.  BUY BTC Now, or stop the machine, but one way or another, you will be getting crypto!

And THAT'S the point.  What BTC spending actually does is, it reduces useless spending, such as Lambos...  It encourages only the very useful and necessary spending.  An economy where it makes people stop gloating on excess, by the same token, providing worldwide to the less favourable.  Bitcoin is the Robin Hood of economics, making the rich Hodl, while the Third world come up to par with living standards.  
How will it replace Fiat?  Well, their test market 'Venezuela' is proving to be good with the plan of making the USD collapse!  In due time, they will nuke NYC, and the whole American economy will plummet to the ground.
Who's they, you ask??? Why!!, the USA itself...
A new economy, for one world with no borders.  From a gloating to a well managed society, from a rich and poor world population to a more equal global shared wealth, towards a better outlook not for one but for all.  They will spend it, but only for what they truly need.  Enough with this planetary rape of resources to move the golden arrow utterly useless wealth for a few people.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:56:08
Here Here!  Furthermore, as mass adoption occurs regular fiat losses more and more value.  It is in my predicament that eventually the means of exchange by which the world trades as currency or money, in this case the USD, will have to capitulate.

It's pretty obvious, if we want SegWit turned on in BTC, we should encourage pools that support it.  Maybe, we should all mine a side coin for a few weeks.  Eg: FTC.  Pools that lose hashing power, lose BTC.  If a pool begins to see a drop in Hashrate, they just might wake the hell up!
You see, in Canada when the people start to boycott Petro-Canada for a week or so, nothing changes for the oil company.  The oil industry comes to terms btwn each other, and just lower the price of fuel all around.

Well, at least one thing is right, it is a makeup of people Satoshi Nakamoto is not just one person.  The other thing that is right is, the cryptographers are America based.
The real question is, if America 'HIDES' the accomplished deed of creating the BlockChain technology, Then their must be a reason for that.  Else, why not just do like it usually does, bragg on, on how good they are at saving the world.

I'm listening, keep writing...  I agree the first sign will be HyperInflation.(HyInf)  I think the USD has taken a global position as the pillar of currencies.  My CAD is worth 0.67USD , your country's money has a worth as well, also measured in USD.  Many countries have a monetary system measured against the USD or petro-dollar as some would say.  If the USD suffers hyperinflation, what is my Canadian dollar going to be worth?  Will my canadian cup of coffee cost me $10.00CAD  Finally, if they make their monetary system fall, beginning with HyInf.  Once it has fallen does mine still exist?

That is what give BTC value, not an ETF.  However if owning btc in the form of an ETF will promote adoption with it's new owner than it could help adoption, but sadly, investors care not about the technology or pushing it forward, they care only about their numbers and Yatchs

One must first understand the relationship between government and taxation.  A story that goes in short like this.  
The masses are asked to pay taxes, or charged as per government law, rules or regulation.  The sums are accumulated in a Consolidated revenue fund.  In turn these fund are spent by government for the benefit of not one but the society.  A city tax might build a new arena, a bridge, or community transport system, then pay to maintain these systems. 
 At the federal level this would be the same, with the exception that every fiscal year the left over amount in this fund is divided into the states or provinces.  Federal Government not only pays National parks, pensions, etc., it also pays remittances.  I don't know about the USA, but in Canada, that is nothing less than every bill we get that has a '96' written in the bottom right corner.  
This is a paid for bill by federal gov. from the workings of our forefathers on our land, but you can reinvest in the company if you like, hence pay the bill.  however we have all been incited to see the remittance as an obligation to pay, and so we all pay them.
If there is no taxation on Bitcoin and it becomes mainstream currency, then there is no more need for Government and all its laws, rules and regulations.  Kiss your government pensions good bye!  Lawlessness at a global level because BTC is a global currency.  So when a government agent pushes for tax free btc, he or she is pushing themselves out of a job.
I wonder if everyone see the ramifications of this crypto thing and the changes it will bring on not just a country, but on the world.  OH!, Mr Paul is retired... he still has his pension to lose then!

Cher Mr. Debré,
Il est toujours plus facile de juger et condamner ce qu'on ne comprend pas ou comprend mal.  Vous savez que l'implication du bitcoin est non seulement essentiel mais primordial.
Je comprends que ce fléau vous tue, mais voilà, vos jours de gouvernance s’achèvent pour vous et vos semblables.   Votre corruption a atteint sa limite, votre système monétaire s’implose.  
De plus, la technologie de ce ‘Bitcoin’, non seulement sauvera la France de ses tourments en temps et lieu, mais apportera aussi des fonds au plus démuni du tiers monde.
Je comprends votre craint et votre peur du changement, ce fléau est normal chez l’homme.  Je reconnais que dans la politique, ralentir la croissance de ce phénomène est une pratique que vous êtes obligé d’accomplir.
Par pitié politicien de l’ancien monde, laisse ce phénomène tranquille et descend de ta hauteur avec grâce et dignité, car en vérité je vous déclare, vous etes vaincu.

Media outlets only repeat what someone wants them to say!  This is gonna be interesting.  
Are we trying to incite the masses to not buy cryptocurrencies as the price rises due to the influx of institutional money?  Ever since day one, I've seen Bitcoins associated with, Drug money, DarkWeb Services, Criminal Activities, Climate Change, etc.

Wow, loved the read.  Makes south America and South Africa sound safe.  There is a better way to achieve the collapse of USD, else all this destruction, violence and death.  Reading this was so fun, I have to give you my thoughts.  
I guess we get the point, USD is no more!  Bitcoin without InterNet, not gonna happen!  Rerouting technologies are well into place.  As for why people would use BTC? For the same reason they use Fiat today.  The human race doesn't know how to live without currency, it hasn't learned, and probably will prefer to die than to try say... sharing!
As for scenario, I see it more like this.  The US banksters have succeeded it owning it all.  Mortgages, dept at an all time high.  The pyramid scheme worked well as long as there was something to grab, but now it's over, they own everybody.  The system begins to implode, not just for the USA, but at a global level!  In an attempt to re-stimulate global economies, the US starts a war with the help of its allies in the middle east, using Hegelian Dialect.  The World trade centres are brought down and millions of jobs are created around the world, anywhere from airport security to screening machines, zip-lock like bags, and so many more non-sense type jobs.  While this helps continue the dead end use of fiat, the bought time is used to instate a new world currency unit.  Bitcoin!
Today's fiat system also maintains law.  Government,remittances, taxation.  It's the way we use Fiat that has to go, not the currency itself!  Bitcoin creates this currency without this way of using it.  After relentless effort to instate it [Hodl], a final blow will be given to Fiat... 1 nuke over NYC, maybe a few dirty bombs over western USA to make sure the USD implodes.  The world debt is alleviated, the governments are dissolved, and law falls.  Making a perfect platform for 'global' businesses.  We banked the unbanked and now have a very big market share to take from, with bitcoin leading the way as a new form of payment.
Although world population is becoming a problem, this fiat coupe would be the perfect time to Hegel our way into reducing it.  At the same time, we use our allies religious differences to sow hate at the fundamental levels of the heart.  This can easily be done taking out the Catholic Pope by the Muslim extremist.  this can easily be achieved by flying an airplane and detonating it over Vatican City... Say MH370... but this can only work if the division has been sowed between the two factions.  a thing that has been in effect from Osama Ben Laden to today!  
Welcome to a more probable scenario, but I did enjoy your read.  In the end, only the USA gets plastered by nukes, and it is done by the USA, pointed at the middle east allies as to not say they did it themselves and to bring forth a new way of using a new currency, ridding international debt, reducing population and creating new market shares.

@_date: 2017-01-22 16:51:02
Yes I agree, but the question is!!!  Knowing that one day the petro dollar will have to give way to bitcoin, say it becomes the new world currency!  How will the USA do that?  I don't know... Slowly remove bills in circulation, like India.  De-value the $ like in Venezuela with hyper inflation which occurs when the IMF doesn't pump new money in that country.  Technically USA is the riches country, and will probably be the last to convert to BTC, by then a lot of citizens are going to say no to BTC, to expensive and i lose too much.  The rich won't want to give up their wealth.  The richer a country is, the more drastic the situation need be to make the move.  Any ideas on how this move will take place say for a country like USA???
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:59:34
Reason  you are from a first world country! USA, Canada, Aussi, whatever.  BTC is progressively instated to the world to wealth the poor or third world countries.  India, Venezuela, China, etc.
2) you have readily available banking, when you need $10,000.00, you go to a bank and voila!  3rd world citizens don't even have a bank account.
3) Bitcoin is about putting a purchasing power in the hands of the needy, not the filthy rich!  20% of the world population consumes 80% of the worlds resources.  They have found a solution to even this out... A redistribution of wealth.
4) Govs make sure to slow growth of users in first world countries with laws, rules and regulations, but tries not to hinder the process of evolution of BTC, as per Andreas A, BTC expert.  Which means BTC will be coming to 1st world populations in the future.
5) get some while it's cheap, not just for a bet, but for yourself.  Pay through a Bitcoin ATM, or BTM as they call it.  Pay the fees and hold on to your private keys.  It doesn't have to be much, it just has to be now, or in this time frame.
6) Give thanks your in a first world country, and show yourself merciful for those who have next to nothing.  I'm talking about those who earn $2/day.

When the cat sees a mouse, it runs after it.  It's a pursuit.  What does the mouse do?  it runs away.  As long as the mouse can run, there is no conquer.  Such a pursuit can only last so long, and eventually has only one fatal ending.  
The same way we run for SegWit, it just seems to swivel and swerve along the wall, escaping that cat, yet once again.  
Until it meets, 'THE CORNER' !  Then the true nature of settlement is fought out.  The cat gets the mouse or the mouse gets the cat, but the battle is fierce and vicious.  
SegWit doesn't come along until it is a do or die thing with Bitcoin.
Those who hold back on SegWit will hold back as long as they can for whatever reason they think!  It be an issue of $$$$, or whatever.
As bitcoin grows with the war on money, and the blocks being full.  The slow confirmation times and the menace of another coin to take its place... say LTC.  Then the mouse gives into the cat.  They capitulate into SegWit or lose everything they have made or worked for, or could make.  
Nov 2017.  because the war on money pushes on, and the next battle will push bitcoin into a utility so great the if SegWit doesn't come along, BTC might fall, and give place to another coin.  One with SegWit already incl.. I say Nov., but fall 2017 is more the term.

Back in 2014, I grabbed some girl I hardly knew, took here phone, made her a wallet on Mycelium, and showed her how to back it up.  She seemed more or less interested, but played the game with me.  I dragged her ass to the ATM and I bought myself 600$ BTC.  Then I looked at her and said, "Fuck, I'm not allowed to do this, Mrs Pond, but put your key up."  I dropped 70$ to her wallet, and clearly stated that in October 2000 something she will have to refund that 70$.
This October she will be asked to either refund $70Fiat or return the BTCs. They are now worth $425.  It will be of her choice to buy BTC now, not mine.  I just bought her some growing time.  That is how we give people Bitcoin!!!

The thing is sir, you are a newcomer!  When I first started Bitcoin, it would flex up and down between $20 to $40 a day!  You get use to it after a while, i guess!  Now a days it flexes between $100 and $500,  Bah! who cares.  In the future it will probably flex in the $1000s a day!
The way around this is to keep in mind how much BTC you have and not so much as to what they're worth.  Studying the technology of cryptocurrency is also a good method.  An emotion is a state of a non rationalized event.  Understanding crypto allows one to disconnect emotionally from say a drop of $3000 in a daily flex (possible future event).  And then there is TIME.  Bitcoin has been around for more than 6,7yrs now.  Give yourself 6/7 more yrs and you'll be good with any flexes it should have.
Else, if the pressure is to strong, step out...  The last thing a human body needs is more anxiety or stress.  It is not healthy and can cause premature death, which goes beyond the reason for having BTC.  If you should feel this is the right choice... Damn you my friend, RATIONALISE your emotions please real fast, cause BTC is not done with its mood swings.  Else send all your BTC to this address 15bF9fZvxMRXywef6igqgHcGAXAYGY4ksq, and make out nothing ever happened. lololol
Have a good day, and be safe, BTC buddy!  Enjoy it, embrace it, because in the end, it's not weather you win or lose, it's all about playing the game, about all that's learned along the way, it's just a ride! ;-)

Hell, there are 3 ways of getting BTC.
1. As you mentioned, An Institution.
2. A machine (BTM)
3. Via a real human being.
Institution make it hard, IDs to death, accounts, e-mails, etc..  I agree, not the best choice!
The BTM is a little more expensive, 7 to 11% fees, I agree! But, then your in and out in seconds and as far as purchasing is concerned, hassle free, no need to meet anyone if you feel a little more anti-social, or just want to stay in your bubble.
In person!  Now that's what I like! get a buddy, meet up with someone, somewhere and do a cash trade.  Fees are better!  You don't walk away without having you crypto in your account. The person who trades with you, meets with you to supply you with digital money.  Not to mention, if there is a lack of respect, any of the party can just walk away.
Fuck this ID shit, it was just to make your purchase harder, for the true nature of cryptocurrency wasn't to provide for the first world country, but to give the 3rd world unbanked a viable solution.  I still say the best way to buy e-cash is with p-cash(papercash).  In person or ATM, but hurry, BTC is dirt cheap, fees will be nothing, when BTC hits the $14,000.00 a coin in the future.

Whatever the reason... One has to keep in mind, CHANGE!
When we add a change in society, it takes time, lots of time.  corporate change doesn't happen over night, anyone who runs a big business knows that.  Where making a change in the Global Financial System.  The simple wallet application has to grow, Blockchain technology needs to evolve.  These things take time!
If the price of BTC went ballistic before it's time, it would certainly fail.  Yes BTC is under evaluated, but hang on folks, SegWit, Lightning Networks, smart contracts, etc., they are coming, BTC is changing, and growing accordingly.
Maybe someone somewhere is influencing the under evaluated price per coin, but then that someone is not letting the carriage get in front of the horse!  That there might be the proof we all need to understand that BTC will prevail... long term.

Fungibility and privacy is an attribute we need because of the noisy others who want to know your stuff.  You have nothing to hide, yet they are in your stuff.  Then they lose your stuff to some other noisy people who want to capitalize on your info, by some corrupt employee.  The cycle never ends, then you think of buying something for someone and suddenly the whole world knows!  Your bombarded with precise info guiding you to a choice that sometimes you may not what to make.

Not new no!  I joined this Reddit when subscribed readers was at 54000.  I've watched BTC sink from 700$, swoop down to 250-300 and now watching it rise to 750 again.  Not new, maybe excited, as people around me now seam to have heard of bitcoin, whereas before they had no idea what it was!  Not new, just excited about the 750 mark, as it was at this price when I first entered the BTC world.

WW3 will look somewhat like this.  Elon Musk is putting up Satellites for Internet.  A Nuke is hitting USA more likely head of finance state, yes NYC. The USD implodes and all Fiat measured against the USD pillar falls with it.  This in turn starts a Global Civil War.  Where the long instated hate for Muslims by Christian will help in reducing world population.  Bitcoin's role is to be a replacement technology currency that will open doors to new and innovative people, who can now live free from ancient government, as that will falls as well.  It's going to be a rough ride, this so called transition, but it coming.  Because we can't continue with the Fiat system, it's usury creates greed that would rape the world of its resources, then we would really be fucked as a species.

The way I see it, if you want to make a buck real fast, and don't have all the low down jargon on trading, you best be buying in a penny stock.  You know 10cents a share, things like that...  Since access to these small stocks is sometimes associated with buying big software trading programs and paying big fees, I thought it be best to buy a crypto instead... Seems legit, and the crypto scene is doing well.  After all, one of my friends did buy tons of ETH @ 25c., and made a fortune...  So which coin will give you a best return, 198&amp; is good, if you have a large number of coins.  So I went with FTC, 12cents, btwn 10 and 100 thousands, and now we wait. could take 5, 6 years, but when the time comes your making that 198\+&amp;  I believe to true success to trading is in Positioning yourself, but then I know nothing of trading...

For one thing the source of money is endless, just print as much as it is needed.  The idea of a crypto funded economy is much better than the dying Fiat.  The gains are enormous, possible 4 billion new human being with a bank account opposed to not having access to money.  Imagine the purchasing power.  Suppressing BTC makes it affordable, another crucial tool for allowing adoption.  
Fiat has almost meet its crossroad with death.  We have no choice but to change monetary systems.  Banks control government, yet have you seen anyone try to illegalize crypto.  This is a new technology it needs time to grow, its potential is so great that it progress must be hindered as to not grow out of control and die.  If BTC went from $1 to $500,000.00 in 6 months, would any of us be here on this sub?  Why look into something we can't afford anyway!  
This is a controlled ascension, like it or not, some of us detect what you see, some not.

Obviously the US treasury can or has associated people to their BTC or LTC addresses, right?  Which means they can do that, just as much for you and me!  The last thing i'd want is to be in any way or form associated or possibly associated to these people.  The faster they get me out of their system the better!  Just let them hit delete on anything they might have that can associate me, this way I can live in peace.  After all, aren't they not the one responsible for the financial crisis we are all in.  Better still, if this kind of institution would die, the world would be a much better place.  Hopefully Bitcoin will take care of this!
You know when BTC forked to BCH, I knew all those who sold their BCH for BTC had tinted their BTC addresses.  I don't understand how it is possible to remain anonymous.

With so many trying to keep up with the rat race, the amount of time needed to come up to par with money, its creation, where it gets its value, or how it works, is just to long for some.  This is another reason why the incorporation of Bitcoin will need the collapse of the current Fiat system.

Some of us express our opinions on these reddit subs, others are just there to shoot'em down or devalue them.  But my new question is!  Why is it people like you express your opinion with a form of suppression for someone else's?  Would of it been not good enough just to write, "I think it's Wash Trading!", than to actually go in with the effort to discredit someone else's opinion.  
I probably would of ended up asking what the hell is Wash Trading, more than submitting this post!  Finally what good is it to share an opinion on Wash Trade if it was only to insult someone as if they didn't know what they where talking about.  How is anyone here ever to ask you what Wash Trade is, when you express yourself in this manner!   Boggle my mind, this still exists!

Truth is!  Probably reinstating more bitcoin into circulation as to uphold the current price.  As Bitcoins slowly get sold to HODLERS, more are need to be fed into the machine to keep the price in check.  BITMEX liquidation of longs are just an entry point into circulation of new bitcoins.

Bitcoin is the long waited e-cash Milton Friedman was talking about way back then, so there has been a look into an e-cash for the longest time.  Which means Bitcoin has been in the works for a while, and now that they have figured it out.  They launched it.

Well look at it this way!  The current monetary system has created debt by the banking cartel.  This debt is chocking everyone, everywhere, to a point that nothing gets done anymore.  We save save save!!!  I mean it would work if I could endebt new users and continue down the rabbit hole, but new users don't even have a bank account even less a valid ID from which to create one!  This system just has to go!
So up comes BTC!!! We bring the technology to life, right, the white paper!!!  We let it evolve, come stuff like lightning networks, other coins, etc.  Let the value of the current economy flow into it!!!  Then, at one point or another, just chuck the old system or the one we use right now out the window!  Global debt is gone!  6billion new users come aboard a new financial system, and prosperity comes back to life!  It'll have to happen, just a question of when!  Beside, volatility in the price of BTC is of occurrence as long as it is measured against the old monetary structure of Fiat.  For it to really make sense, Fiat would have to go.  
I transfer airline reservation systems, same shit there too...  Implement new system, transfer database of reservations, and pull plug on old system.  Same with Bitcoin, implement new tech, transfer value, and then pull plug on old Fiat.  Difference is, we cutover when all the network is ready, I'm not sure the death of Fiat will wait til everyone has BTC or the going crypto!  It's my vision, but then again, this is the first time, value gets transferred to a network of computers.  Before it was all printed on paper!

Full implementation of Bitcoin, requires full removal of Fiat currency.  This means those who have not adopted during this hyperbitcoinization 'transition' time will look pretty sad.  Times will get rough!  All of the E.g.s above are societies built on Fiat, besides work and transport, where you actually used crypto as a Form of Payment, all other institution are susceptible to death along with Fiat.  The Coupe de Grace in globalization!  As for thinking, that this might happen only in years from now, as a long and slow hyperbitcoinization conversion, think again!  Fiat will be removed overnight...  Bank accounts! overnight gone!  Credit Card usage, overnight gone!  What little paper money in your wallet is left, overnight devalued to nothing, gone!  Investment portfolios, other than crypto, overnight gone!  Law overnight gone!  
I like the idea of crypto as sound money, it's the totalitarian implementation that scares the living shit out of me!  The future is more like, no structure, where every man woman and child is totally free, and crypto is their only means of exchange!

Back then I thought it was just a distraction, I did inquire as to the stock price of FaceBook.  It was running $3.97 at the time.  3yrs later, I created my fb account, and rechecked the stock price at $97.  I was mad because I missed out, had I been more open minded...  Now comes Bitcoin, yet another distraction???  No!  The 'S' curve of adoption!  Lets try it and give it time!
I think InterNet technologies are IN.  This sure is the era for it.  Bitcoin is as IT as fb.  So, I'm in too...  Maybe, just like fb,  Bitcoin will stay!  10yrs so far!!!  It's going to be one hell of an 'S' curve!

Thank you for your reply, it was a nice read.  Let me get this right, you're saying Fiat could just fade out?  This is a possibility!  I guess you could pay interest on a BTC loan in Fiat, cause you sure can't pay it back in BTC.  max. 21million coins.  
The price of Btc is measured in Fiat right now, when it hits 1million, what do you think the volatility will be like?  I mean we are just around 10,000USD and even now we flux big time.  
How am I going to start a business in 2032 when Btc is 1,134,775.45 in the morning and by the time I get to the bank for a mortgage or loan, it will be at 1,287,633.88?  
I just see co-existance a hard thing right now.  I've been in the Bitcoin space for a while now.  I've watched it grow, develop, and be implemented without government interruption.  Wondering, where is this going, how's it going to unfold.  If the world currencies are such a precious commodity, why are we letting crypto walk all over it?

It is credit that made the debt 124 trillion worldwide.  Credit hold back evolution.  You're not going to by a new car if you can't afford to, or mortgage a home.  I think crypto was born and implemented to remove credit, release the choker on everyone, and restore a viable developing environment.  The current monetary system provides very well to only 3 or 4 billion people.  The other 3 to 4 don't even have a bank account.  Even then, of those 4 billion, most are poor pocket class societies and a few very rich.  The system worked fine, but for very few, who by the way, now understand that the monetary situation will only cause their ruin as well.  
I believe we will not see lending anymore, only trading!  The Americans will nuke their own NYC in an Iranian Hegelian Dialect, causing the fall of the Global Fiat Reserve Currency and wipe their debt clean, most other fiat systems will implode as well.  Global debt will be gone.  Yip! you won't have to pay your mortgage anymore or your car, but then you won't get a pension either...  Nor Kiwis unless you live in New Zealand.  With the world free of it's debt you won't see any laws, rules and regulations either.  They also hold back evolution!  Without law, you'll have a nightmare.  Nothing to keep you from knocking off your nagging X wife, but then if you should be the one to nag, there will also be nothing to keep from knocking you off.  The changing social structure we are about to live, will free the minds of those who understand, those who see it all coming, but condemn those who will want to continue to live by the law without Fiat, or couldn't see this coming.
I see a bright future indeed for evolution along side the creation of Bitcoin, or Blockchain, whatever you want to call it.  I also see a heavy price to pay for such a transition.  Some will find the old social structure hard to let go.  I expect nothing less than a sort of a Global Civil War.  
Crypto will push out the parasitical process of lending, eliminate thing such as planned obsolescence and technological paralasys, and push the few into a new era.  This will be the birth of type one civilization.  Meaning type 0 has to go!  If you want to see into the future, look past credit or lending my friend, cause that is what's coming!

Many are unbanked, needing to be served a financial system, that will provide the basic needs for standard life. Or break it down in % instead, 20% of the world population versus 80% of unbanked.

In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. 8 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying... bla bla bla!!
Lion is TV, Ox is radio, The face of a man is newspaper, and Eagle that has just taken flight... InterNet!  6 wings are your 6 corporations, media to be more precise!  As describe the eyes front and back.  Your eyes catch the eye the medium or media has set for you, or eye behind the camera to the eye on the tv itself... Enjoy a little Godly interpretation...

I see a plan in the making...
George Wolfgang Hegel, German philosopher showed the world a strategic philosophy for controlling the masses in politics.  Some of you may know this as the Problem, Reaction, Solution, approach or the Infamous Hegelian Dialect .  I think of this, as baby-steps towards achieving what one may want as a ‘what’s best solution’ for a mass population.  In other words, enabling banksters the ability to carry out their plan.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I don’t see all 8 billion on the same payment system as a bad idea, but just the way we’re going to get there might be a very long and painful road.  Prosperous financial achievement requires the removal of the frozen, parasitic fiat system and its governing laws.
The current global reserve is the USD, and as with all its previous global reserve units, it has reached its average lifespan.  If you think the World Trade Centre incident didn’t create tonnes of jobs around the world, think again!  Plenty, with new high paying jobs, returned to the bank for mortgages, in turn maintaining a slowly imploding system.  If the wheel doesn’t turn, the system collapse! 
As a global reserve unit, every other Fiat currency is measured up against it.  For in the end, what is your country’s unit of measurement worth, if not, $0.75USD or $1.25USD.  USD has become a pillar in the financial world, and as all pillars support, when it come down, everything comes down with it!  The road to the removal of Fiat, starts with the death of USD.  Other Fiats will follow!  It’s a war strategy, take out the head honcho and war is won, or over.  Didn’t WWII stop with the death of A. Hitler.  
The heart and soul of the USD resides in New York City!  Big World business have, offices, centres, computer servers, worldly stock markets, and so much more.  If you were to hit that pillar with a lethal blow, that would be the place to start.  They’re also 6 million people there!  Why do I mention 6 million people here and now.  They are all registered with the state, humans who have been individualized by a legal process of contract.  A contract that says, more or less, the death of its citizens maybe required through war is acceptable in order to better the state.  Also known as collateral damage.
The 3000 more or less people who died in the World Trade Centre incident might have been collateral damage to an ‘about to bust financial crisis’.  For now, let’s just say their death was not in vain, for we still collect our pensions, buy Kiwi fruit and bananas from around the world through the current monetary system, that, thanks to them, is still afloat.  So, collateral damage achieves results when it comes down to Hegelian Dialects, and now we’ve bought some time for the implementation of a new financial solution, Bitcoin.
The dropping of a nuclear device on such a city would literally kill the Fiat World, USD and all others alike.  By the same token it would kill 6 million people.  This is not a pretty picture!  However, these people are to banksters and governments, children of the state.  And to better that state, or in this case, to better the whole world, they can be sacrificed by death.  Just some more collateral damage!
Once fiat is gone, Bitcoin or crypto becomes King, and the volatility goes away!  Markets for 8 billion, more or less 6 million can now thrive!  Now, how do we drop a nuke on NYC and get away with it?  Hegel to the rescue!  Banksters do it, and point their fingers to terrorists, a classic.  Have you ever noticed the growing anti-sentiment war between Islamic and Christian fundamentalism.  Not to say one party is better than the other, but just a tool in achieving financial prosperity.  America needs its bad guys, and they’re making sure they have them.  I’m not just some sinister guy, but I do see the inner working of a philosophy at work here.  One that Hitler used to bring Germany out of ruins and to an almost dominant world power.  Bref;  I’m scared this may not end well!!!  I just need to vent my thoughts.

They're those who think your fu*ked up, those who think your a little special.  Then they're those who see with eyes of a different kind.  Truth of the matter is future history books will talk about Bitcoin.  Revelations 13, 16.  The whole chapter talks about how the old monetary system dies, and yet live again.  Hense: a different, but still a monetary system.  
Rev 13, 16 :  Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, with the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
Marked on his right hand (Smartphone), Forehead (Your PIN).  Wisdom: Number of the beast, 6 three time 6,  bah just a mathematical computation.  Isn't it what Bitcoin is (cryptography)
You should be impressed, Bitcoin is a great big chapter in human history (10yrs now), so big it even made THE history book!

As long as Fiat exist, BTC will never be stable enough to build businesses upon.  Its volatility fluctuation will kill it usury as a currency, and inhibit investements.

My reason for the price hike!  'Kill the FOMO and Bull Run'
Allow me to explain!
10,000 is know as a psychological marker!  "10k, That's it I'm out!", is a thought that many 'may' of had!  Those... not whales, but regular people with 200+ BTC, may of had an intention to disembark here!  Trick is to get people to hodl even more or again!  
So let's look at what happened if we had been a semi serious investor or reseller, almost at our 10k mark!
This happens just before the week end... very strategic, time is of the essence too...  It goes over 10k. first sensation is woooohoooooo!!!  This, of coarse, is strictly emotional.  By the time, 'we think', I didn't say do!  Think of going online, depositing our coins, maybe an hour or so later...  It has gone up!  Well, hang on a sec, let's see what gives, as expected the climb continues.  But we are not going to spend the week-end watching this.  So we turn it off and either go to bed or go do whatever the weekend has setup, which is not work.  Thus the distraction to following closely is much easier broken.  The excitement does make us check our phones once in a while, the excitement thus continues, but also fades.  The emotional push to sell is losing momentum.  11k many hours later, lets us relax and get on with the kids, the week end, the weather, etc.  Without work, the focus is just not there, regular life is calling.  Come next day 11.2k and whamo, someone cuts loss, back down to 10.2-10.4, where it wobbles and keeps us in doubt about if we should sell or not...  Because this is where the thought crosses our minds, 'I might get more, if I wait' or 'It'll go back up'.  After all the going trend is MOON BABY!  The week ens is all but over, that it has stabilized at the 10.6k level, which is not down below 10k, maintaining the doubt until the urge or drive or the emotional status dies to nothing.  
Next thing you know where hodling again, and making even more per bitcoin.  Meanwhile, no lambos, no big homes, no rich and famous life styles.  Just the same old guy as we where before we got in at $400.
This kills bull runs, which is not a bad idea.  Promotes adoption by hodl.  Very good idea, when trying to instate a new form of money!  Transfer the wealth, and kill the old monetary system.  If you don't have bitcoin, get some as the death of USD is now imminent!

The time for now is global inclusion... Let BTC spread develop and become more and more popular.  In time, it will become a form of payment side by side to Fiat.  Website will show prices in FIAT and BTC.  Then, we pull the plug on FIAT.  1 Hegelian Dialect, 1 Terrorist attack on NYC, 1 Nuke 2 dirty bombs.  All debts wiped out of every country in the world.  Your mortgage gone!  Your car loan, gone!  Student loan, gone!  Old age pensions...gone.  Welfare, gone!  Remember, Money is debt and debt is money!  No money no debt!  Governments crumble, websites remove Fiat prices on web pages, and you get a dirty look when trying to buy coffee with fiat...
My imagination of everyone taking crypto is in a world without fiat, and that is not a pretty picture!  It will have a $$$ value before Fiat goes,  I say a low 250,000$.
By low, I mean not bouncing around.  Institutional money will rise the price to 350,000$, but then that bubble will pop back down to 75,000$  This is the low I'm talking about.  Then, you will pay what you like for thing at the price you like in crypto only.

Finally someone else who sees it like I do.  This is going to hurt millions of people, and possibly push millions more over the edge(suicides, or just knocking each other off for a slice of bread).  There is nothing to get excited about, this change will demand that some of us learn to survive as a species without currency.  Such a radical change is coming... oufffsss...

Brett is just another Bitcoin Analyst speaking his terms, folks...  Let him and others like him do their stuff!!!  No matter, if you promote or disclaim the use or value of BTC, it is irrelevant.   Screw that shit, lets look at the facts!  Is there, yes or no, a transfer of wealth going into Bitcoin?  Are people buying Bitcoin?  Regardless the fact that it goes up, down or sideways! 
If yes, then Please note that there is a transfer of wealth occurring, and that this is now a 'FACT' about Bitcoin.
Lets stick to facts for a moment, speculation is fun and 'it sucks...'  If there is, in fact a transfer of wealth occurring, what is going to happen to the current monetary unit from which Bitcoin is being invested in?  What is to say, is going to happen of USD, CAD, AUD EUR, GBP, and all other units of account in the world?  
I manage computer systems, once I transfer a database over to a new front end application, do you want to know what I do with the old application it use to run on?  Yeah!, I pull the plug on it, on a predetermined CutOver date!
Brett is a small visionary MarketWatcher, he sees short term.  The ones who sees the current system changing over, is the one who's going to be ready for the new venture.  
To say will you make a million dollars with Bitcoin, NO!!!  But you will have some finance after cutover date, where people like Brett here, will have nothing.  Beside, after cutover date bitcoin won't have a worth in USD or any other old currency to measure upon!

If that had been the case JPMorgan would of came out with a coin, a central blockchain, and US government would of killed the idea for anyone who want to make a crypto-currency.  You maybe thinking of it as, 'replacing' the old monetary system 'with' the new one..! Bitcoin or another crypto.  I'm talking about 'creating' a new monetary system 'by' destroying the old one!  A little harder to envision, but still possible!

You do have a legitimate question that is becoming more and more obvious.  It's nice to have BTC and Hodl, but what about using it for a change!  We see big businesses like Starbucks, KFC, and so many others becoming 'Bitcoin Ready'.  Yet, if I try to get a Starbucks coffee at the airport, they have no idea what bitcoin is!  And why is the famous KFC Bitcoin Bucket (Canadian test market that lasted 4 days only) not on the table anymore?  The answer to these question is indeed 'volatility'.  
This is the part where one has to 'grasp' to the concept of 'NO MORE FIAT', 'no unit of measurement'.  Like those we have now called, USD, CAD, EUR, JPY, and all other world named Fiat currencies.  
3 Rules of Change
1) Create the tech, do not hinder its development!
2) Apply new tech along side current service, and withhold its use! 
3) Switch tech on predefined cut-over date!
Say an Airline upgrades their reservation system.  They implement the new system in, they transfer the database from the old network to the new network, in bitcoin's case this is money value.  We run it, test it thoroughly, while running along side the old one, until all the network is ready for the cut-over date.  On the cut-over date, we switch systems and voila!  In the snap of a finger the change is implemented and transparent.  The old system is 'gone'!  It's the 'gone' with the old money in this crypto case, that scares the living shit out of me!  
You can be sure of 1 thing my friend, you will remember the cut-over day for Bitcoin, for the rest of your life!  As for your coffee at Starbuck, that will be 525 Satoshis please!
Oh! and by the way, no matter how stable you might think BTC will get, in time or as it grows.  Remember it will always be volatile as long as it has a unit of comparison tagged to it!

You need to understand remittances.  Remittances are 'paid for' vouchers, usually associated with a liability.  For a consumption of some sort.  You can, reinvest in the company, say it's your government hydro, buy paying the said bill or remittance, or you can offset it.   We won't be using BTC to pay for 'remittances', a process issued by governments control, but use BTC "instead of remittances".  Thus no more need for a Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), under a government control.  Hense, no more government and the need to pax taxes.  
It's a tough subject to explain, but if you Google it some, you'll understand that with the arrival of Bitcoin,  Fiat systems are going out the window.  The current fiat system is a debt base system that can no longer be supported.  It has to go!  So we swipe the slate clean, buy removing FIAT, and installing BTC.  What comes with swiping the slate clean is, No Governments, No Debt, No Taxation, but by the same token, No Welfare, No pensions, and everything else you pay taxes for.  No municipal tax, so when winter comes, you pay the snowblower to clean your street.  Not a sort of local government with a CRF.  It should be interesting, when Fiat goes out the window.  Probably shit will hit the fan, and if you have a hard time imagining the process of 'taking out USD as a global reserve', I can share with you many ways, or point out the obvious Hegelian Dialects in occurrence since the 1990, but that's another topic!
Just be ready, and have some crypto for The DAY!

War, if uncontrolled through currency, will destroy currency itself.  Thus it is currency that supports war.  Bitcoin will be very valuable in the next war. (WWIII)  As it will be the underlying cause of it.  I believe we will be looking towards a different type of war though, this time around!  I'm thinking Civil War in every country, at a Global Level, as the Fiat world crashes to Bitcoin or crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:00:09
Most unfortunate a lot of this is true!  It may or may not unfold as such, but the end result will be somewhat the same.  We, the people on r/bitcoin have BTC, and in the face of crisis and global civil war, will have to share!

Actually, The current Fiat monetary system should of crashed a long time ago.  Someone had the smart idea to create terrorism and war!  In turn creating tonnes of new jobs. (airport security to say the least)  Bank do create money out of thin air, forever heightening debt.  It's that or a crash which would be nothing like the 30ies...
Luckily BITCOIN comes around, a 'godsend', a 'savvier' or just a solution to wiping out Fiat and its parasitic cancerous structure.  By the same token, bringing billions of new users into a age old game of money lending that is now on computers instead of printing presses!
This video share light on what the truth of the monetary system.  They do want to share this knowledge upfront as it has a utility!  To get us into the next phase of banking dominance.  Banks own roughly 2 billion people!  New users would help restore monetarism, no matter what name of it be. wether it's called BTC, USD. etc..  By switching over to BTC, we achieve this.  They refinance 2 billion people, by wiping the slate clean and bringing onboard 6 billion new users.  One last remaining problem in the end is, 'how do we kill the Fiat structure'.  This will only work if the current monetary systems goes, else the volatility will kill the cat!

no no, you don't get it... a cup of coffee at $1.25 will technically disappear!  That $1.25 will not be valued anymore.  Then your cup of coffee will cost you 125sats.  Remember, we fraction BTC to 8 decimal points not 3,6, or 9, which is the common place for millions, thousands and hundred of thousands.  See satoshies as pennies! ;-) not dollars!  And if we need we can program fractions, but i doubt we'll need to!

It creates tons of garbage and only for those who have not money, but access to money.  But, there is a 4Billion people market waiting to be had, those who don't have banking!  The government doesn't want to disallow BTC, it just doesn't want it in association to the current monetary system in any way! This way when we kill the debt it doesn't effect the new world currency unit.  it's time for a change, bitcoin will not be disallowed.  Those who do not adapt will be left behind.

Yes, Western Union (WU) make these remittances, you go deposit some money, a remittance is made up at WU, sent to another country, is recognized by another WU outlet, and then give your funds to whoever.  Bitcoin will kill that or replace WU remittances indeed.  We don't use BTC to pay or redeem a remittance, we eliminate the remittance.  Hense Bitcoin becomes the remittance sort of say!  This is taking out the middleman!  Government are nothing else then middlemen.  They exist because of a historical Fiat system and its evolution, but the system has reached an end (to big a debt) and the only way to get rid of this debt, is to wipe it clean.  No debt, No Consolidated Revenu Fund, No Gov., No taxation.  Bitcoin will eliminate the need for a lot of shit.  Countries have borders and border patrols.  They make sure you don't bring in to many assets into a country.  With borderless money, who needs border patrols, and without borders, do you have a country, if not for its delimitations defined by Gov. of that country...
I kid you not BTC will change alot of things.  Hope your ready!

Notice the 'YET' at 01:18.  Which means in time FIAT will have to go!  And how do we get ride of FIAT, eliminate a monetary system in motion?  How do you wipe the debt at a global level remove a forms of paper money.  You make USD, the global reserve unit crash!!!  One NUKE on NYC and voila!  How easy is that!  It's not like it isn't in the works.  The Hegelian Dialect has been running for years now!  If you're a NewYorker and own Bitcoin... After mass adoption, get the hell out of Dodge!
Banker are fucked, they have all the gold, and their Fiat system is collapsing.  There is no more wealth to be made off the 2 Billion banked people, but there is much to be made off the unbanked.

The people that we so call beneficiaries of the current system, are definitely not going to hand it over.  However, they will gladly convert it over, only if there is a gain to be made!  For sayeth the Lord, "No man does something for nothing".  Banksterism!!
The gain is...  A country's wealth at the price of Fiat, for the world's wealth in Bitcoin.  2billion useless users, all indebted, for 6billion new users, and the useless 2billion renewed.  This implementation has to work, strategy, preparation and planning is key.  Bitcoin must grow, but not too fast! Once ready, Fiat must be dissolved.
Else the full potential of Bitcoin is hindered by volatility, and the dirty doing of Fiat remain.  They will both coexist, say those who haven't converted to crypto at all!
There must be a cutover date in the plan, dude!  Fiat can easily be brought down, just remove the pillar, USD.  The one everyone is measured upon!  Then it'll be satoshi's unit of measurement!

Sure if the need is there than I'm more than happy Ford can answer to it... Man, hate to have spent 10BTC on a truck I didn't really need to watch it lose value year after year, while my 10BTC are going up X fold.

OK so here's my take...
Flood the floor is probably a term used in pumping stock into a company making the value of each share go down.  The Y axis is the actual time line from the beginning of BTC.  It has been at 1200$ and has ever since slowly come down, reversing the timeline would mean a sharp increase in BTC because it has been seen before.  But then, without another riddle of the same sort, the protocol used here is unverifiable.  Cute!

Like I know Millions of people hold to their privacy, and FB doesn't give rats ass about it.  So when it comes to finance and Libra, many people don't want to go there. 
The Asian App 'WeChat' by Tencent in China, has pretty much brought a boom in Finances, due to its easy flow of monetary value.  Maybe that's what the Americas and Europe is missing, easy flow of money!
We need an App like WeChat, where we will have to sacrifice our privacy to induce monetary flow and maintain an economic trend upwards.
Yeah! No one is going to like it, either it be called Messenger Libra, or something else.  Look at any ShenZhen, China video on how they live out their financial world and come to the terms.  Our debt base financial structure, along with laws rules and regulations is holding us back from development in many sectors.  
It might be a good thing when purchasing day to day stuff, but when you want that level of privacy, good old fashion cash, provided it is still worth something.  I see our next financial revolution in the same way, with the coming of BTC and Alts.  We are preparing the way for such a payment system, but at a global level.
Lots of people will want to hang on to their privacy, but it will probably crash as fast as the current debt base economic system.

There has to be a orderly cutover, a planned transition.  Bitcoin is in this phase, we can see this by the amount of people and businesses that are bitcoin ready and yet, Hodl or can't muster the effort to train employees to take BTC as form of payment.  
Sure, we can all see that Fiat is doomed, this is not the point.  The system should of collapsed, the snow flake should of set off the avalanche a long time ago, if it where not for the incident of the WTC.  Someone, in an orderly fashion has kept the Fiat system afloat.  
What i'm saying is, if the crypto world if not allowed to evolve due to volatility in Fiat price, and Fiat is still well on its feet, then Fiat will have to be brought down.  No matter.  We kill debt, derivatives, and fraud one shot and bring on billions of unbanked into a new monetary system.
Right now Bitcoin, the whole crypto space is growing, as long as it has room to grow, fine...  As soon as we start talking, 'its too volatile to do business with', or 'we demand to spend our bitcoin, instead of Hodl', then you know Fiat termination will soon have to be dealt with.
I'm seeing all the signs of a controlled implementation of Bitcoin, and a controlled removal of Fiat.  There must therefor be a cutover date or an incident like the WTC, but worst!

To be honest with you, I'm having doubts about this whole picture...  I can understand a protest, fine...  
Monetary value in the form of Gold, Silver, Fiat or Decentralized BTC is still a form of Monetary value.  Promotion of change by protest is good, but the term "BUY Bitcoin" well written in English, in a very french country has me worried on HOW we educate, or WHO is doing the education...  This brings me to my next question, as to WHY.  Why there, why now?
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:57:33
If bitcoin goes mainstream, one might assume that Fiat will eventually collapse.  For how long will it take before you are asked, "don't you have any crypto?", for that cup of coffee at the diner.  When Fiat starts to feel the rejection, we'll be asking ourselves how much is gold worth?  Answer might be 0.00034588sats/once and not $3544.76USD/once.  I think gold will drop a little bit in value as people move off gold to BTC, but the new value of gold will be measured in Bitcoin, not Fiat.

Without a salary, without money, without richness and poor.  let every man contribute freely to a social structure under ruins, in an attempt to bring back life.  There was plenty before the monetary system hyper-inflated, there should be still plenty there!  Viva Venezuela, without Bolivars and Bitcoins.

Sorry, it's hard to see... I just don't see the need for USD or any other Currency, with the arrival of a Global Currency Unit (the Satoshi).  What better way to foreclose on a debt, than by collapsing its value.  Sure, Banks won't charge you for mortgage anymore, but then you're not going to be getting a pension either.  With the fall of Fiat will also come the fall of Law, but that's ok.  We are so over regulated we can't get anything done anymore anyways...  I guess it might look like a slow adoption!  After all any tree has to grow for it to take a place, but only when we cut the older trees around it, can we see it.
I'm just scared that the coming of BTC will induce the Death of the current monetary system(which is debt base).  Wipe the slate clean, no debt, but then no pension, Law, etc.  This might be hard on the human species altogether!  
The vision is more long term... It's just that long term goes faster and faster.  I forget how many years it took for everyone to get a common house phone, but the Main Stream Adoption of anything is much faster these days!

On the contraire my friend... I'll pay gladly for what I want and what I use, services or goods...  It's the what I don't want or use, that I think is unfair to pay.  Our forefathers worked very hard to build dams in this province, in hope one day to supply enough energy to their children and grandchildren for free.  Yet we pay for hydro more than our forefathers paid for it back at the time.  Was it not by their labour that one days someone somewhere should get free hydro?  Yes, the users should pay for maintenance of the system, not get extorted the hard earned money by taxation to supply some useless Gov. official bitching on how things should be done, when the real solution to a problem is via technology not politics.
As for wanting everything.... AHHH NOOO...  You can have the Lambo.  I have a roof over my head, cloths to wear when cold, food to eat... way to much food too...  Abundance kills, and yet i'm taxed to death to pay for my fat politician's Lambo or overgrown house, where his contribution to a society is a law, not a solution.  In other words the man gloats, and where one gloats, the other pays unfairly for his gloating.  It wouldn't be so bad if we had to pay monetarily for this guy!  But wait, his stupid laws keep others from evolving in the very technological field that proposes solutions to social problems.  Smell the humus my friend, the current system is the problem, the fall of Fiat and Law or Gov. has to go...  Else we're stuck like this forever.  Technological paralysis and planned obsolescence will rape the earth of resources and dome this species unless something happens.

Your comment send me the chills!  You can not be anymore right!  We are getting closer to MSAdoption.  Think for a moment what MSAdoption means, and everything that has to come with it!!!  The more usury for bitcoin, the less the need for Fiat, reversibly, by the death of Fiat we can bring BTC to an ultimate rise to power!  One global currency unit, not in the form of paper notes.

The USD has no choice but to default, else forever increase its debt.  With the average American in debt to the noise, this print money forever is not possible.  A USD collapse is imminent.  It's not so bad, no more need to pay the mortgage, the house is yours, no more car payments, but then no more pension plan, medical plan, no more Gov., no more police...  There the people will have a true taste of real Freedom.  Bitcoin will prevail as a global currency, but this transition will take a few more years...
They will continue to print money as long as they have to, but the implosion is scheduled.  The Hegelian Dialect is in the works, if you live in NYC, I suggest move ASAP.

I call the USD worthless because, when France tried to return the IOU note to America in exchange for gold to enhance their Euro, it was refused.  If an IOU note (from whichever country) can not be redeemed, it is then worthless.  Miserable, because poverty is designed by wealth, the extended use of Fiat has created a few very rich and left many poor.  Yes, King and peasants.  Are there more kings than peasants?  The usury of any form of currency is the source of misery, depending where you stand, king or peasant.  I think the arrival of Crypto will reset the stage, but like it took many moons to bring Fiat to its own demise, in many moon crypto will know the same faith.  To totally rid poverty, we must rid usury altogether!
The USD note is the world currency, I agree, and has done a hell of a job in making peasants live better than kings, but that is only for some of us.  After all 20% of the worlds population lives on 80% of the worlds resources.  Crypto will spread resources more evenly.  Fiat has done its job, and we now have the need to move for the better of All.  A solution brought on by the kings because their Fiat system does not provide anymore.  We do not have a choice.
Yet what does this mean, this transition from Fiat to Crypto that you very well describe is a short vision, but they are very true.  Kings will share their lawn mowers and cars.  Let see the larger picture of this change, someone who is BTC wealthy, flies form his 3rd world country to a 1st world country.  On his phone enough crypto to buy a whopping load of goods to export back home.  Yes, good for the US economy.  By the same token the inverse situation is also possible, thus bad for the US economy.  This is fine and all, but what is the sense of a Border Patrol Agent now?  What happens to Gross Import Income, and the shared Export numbers.
My bigger vision is, we will share our lawn mowers (not a bad thing), so that 3rd world can now share a lawn mower and/or a car.(a thing they don't have right now)  Or if you prefer a countries wealth will be shared with another countries poverty.  
When Fiat fades to Crypto, the new value or purchasing power, will know no borders.  (AndreasA, "borderless")  It is then safe to say that borders will just 'go' with the implementation of Crypto.  Government govern over their bordered territory, this is where borders come from, pushing out borders means pushing out governments, or reduce the need for them.  After all we can't expect every country's government in the world to govern over one world.  
Hell, I love Crypto, but I don't limit myself to the benefits it will bring on, I also look at its drawbacks.  I dread a day that Grandpa Laggard might walk into a shop to buy a cup of coffee with Fiat and be told, "No crypto, get the F$% out of here, you bum."  I know a passenger who went to Cuba and left his credit cards(CC) at home (fear of theft), on the flight back, he could only purchase food(a basic essential) with CC only.  They refuse to sell him anything and so he hungered the whole flight.  This is sad...
My concern is for those who won't, for whatever reason, adapt to this change.  It's not like we haven't been fear instated with change.  For those who will be forced to adapt, and what it will mean to be "Borderless"?
Yes Crypto is good, and it's benefits and potentials are immense.  In the long run it will equalize world wealth, but at a price. This is not just going to turn over easy like eggs for breakfast.  Border Patrol Agents what is going to happen to their jobs.  Government officials, what happens to them.  We are talking of millions of people affected, this is no joke, and definitely not a side effect to ignore.

Carefully read the part about how amazon.com got off the ground.  How is it any different from Bitcoin?
Stock price goes way up, drops real fast, use the money to re-invest, run with deficit as long as you stay in a budget. 
And after a few years....  Would you look at that...
It took years to get this far for Amazon.  It will take bitcoin years as well.  Bubble pops, re-structure, incoming of institutional investments.  Then, rapid growth, faster than and better than Fiat, cash, dollars.
I think bitcoin fits at the part where, the bubble is almost finished popping (+- 3000USD)  Re-structure is Lightning Networks, Institutional money is the upcoming ETF.  As for rapid growth, you do the math.

Time out and routing are two different things.  Time Out is for closing the LN channel, whereas sending 1mBtc to whoever happens off-chain.  Say Alice want to send 1mBtc to Carol, but Alice has no LN Channel open with Carol.  Right, but then Carol's friend, 'Bob', has a channel open with Her and one with Alice.  When Alice scans Carols Public Address she passes on the amount of 1mBtc and, say for the hell of it, a ruby red gem, or some code pertinent to the source and destination of the payment.  Once Alice presses send the transaction goes over to Bob, it asks Bob if he has the ruby red gem, you only get the 1 mBtc if you have the ruby red gem!!! Bob says no, and he sends the transaction down to Carol, this is called a hop!  Looks at Carol and says, I have a transaction of 1 mBtc, do you have the ruby red gem, or the code only known between Alice and Carol.  Carol says, Yip I do!  Bob then trades the 1 mBtc with Carol for that ruby red gem, and then in turn, goes over to Alice and says, I got the ruby red gems, give me my 1 mBtc.  
As for the TimeOut!  say you and I have a channel open.  We each have 100mBTC in there.  I sell you my barbecue, for 30mbtc, you sell me your lawn mower for 25mbtc, garden hose, patio set, picnic table, etc.  Once we are all done, hell you own 150mbtc in the channel...  So you need the 150mbtc to open a channel with your favorite coffee shop, you close our LN Channel, but I'm in a coma at the hospital from a tragic car accident and I can't confirm that closure.  After you asked for closure, if I can't respond for some reason or another, after a certain amount of time, it will automatically close to the last amounts registered in the channel... you 150 and me 50mbtc.
Hope this helps you into clarifying the questions you may have.
it a rough cut, but close to what is actually going on in LN.  Oh and there could be more than 1 hop in a LN transaction.

For sure...  Bitcoin is to not be associated in any way with laws, rules, or regulations.  When the American's wipe out their 71 Trillion dollar debt, it will do so by collapsing the USD (See Hegelian Dialect and Nuke over NYC).  As the monetary system collapses, so will Governments.  The only form of money left standing will be Bitcoin, as it is not bonded to such laws, rules or regulations proscribed by Governments.  This is the birth of a One World Currency Unit.

I always thought Bitcoin had a reverse effect!  The last thing I would waste my Bitcoin on, is a Lambo...  OK say, this lambo is at 30BTCs  and by mid 2020, BTC goes up to 330,000$, technically you could get that same Lambo at 1BTC.  Saving 29BTC  each.  29*330000=9.7million $$$.  I say let the owner have it, his toy, his freak purchase, his problem!

If money is debt and debt is money, then printing more money is useless.  For no one can afford a debt anymore, no matter the interest rate.  No more debts taken on, no more money.  
Inevitably, a system collapse is in the works, we have come to the end of a cycle.
Once the bolt is screwed to the base of the stud and can not be tighten anymore, there is only one action that can be applied.  To unscrew.  If there is no way to get ride of the level of debt, then we'll just have to offset it to '0'.  Clean slate, it can be done...  How you ask?  Get ride of money!!!  Remember debt is money, and money is debt!

IMHO, you have to see further than meets the eye, here!  This is a win scenario for Bitcoin.  Let me explain!  Bitcoin is a method of say, "Banking the unbanked",  You don't want to promote the already rich, well banked, corporate thief, by giving him ease of access to BTC.  He'll only get richer, greedier, and more heartless.  I think the poorer a country's people, the harder accessing bitcoin should be, at least for the big guys.  The little guys will find a underground way of getting BTC and it will all balance out.
Bitcoin is also about equalizing wealth between the rich and the poor.  Bitcoin is the Robin Hood of world currency!

Only the trxs registered off-chain via the use of the ruby red gem get inscribed on the data sheet of the open channel.  When the channel is closed the inscription is balanced out to both parties...  If any information as to the reminiscence of Bob's delay gets saved to the blockchain, i don't know!  Bob and Carol can't trade as Carol does not have the gem anymore, nothing to the effect is inscribed on the channel's data sheet between Bob and Carol, so when they close their channel, no such trx exists.  Once Carol passes the gem to Dave that's it... Bob is out of luck  Open channels are like keeping a ledger of trx, within the ledger of the blockchain
I saw earlier in r/bitcoin a link to Andreas A. explanation of micro-channels using smart contract.  It was all in there...  Google it, you might find an explanation to your question there!  I see what your saying, but Bob and Carol's channel does not get an inscription to a trx that they never committed to or occurred.  When everyone closes the channels, the balances will reflect the passage of the gem.

My thoughts! Sure!  Bitcoin stays, as a matter of fact it replaces Fiat, Paper Money, Metal Coins, Gold, altogether!
As for why!  It's pretty obvious, for starters, when a new monetary system comes about and menaces the previous system (fiat) out, it is in the nature for self preservation to kick it out ASAP.  We should have seen US Gov. kick hard on making Bitcoin globally illegal.  It won't even make it illegal in it's own country! (I say US because USD is the world reserve right now) I'm just saying, if the current monetary system is showing no self-preservation, then maybe someone is promoting a movement to something new.  This would be just the foundation as to why Bitcoin is going to live.
They're plenty of other signs Bitcoin will come of age!  Slow and aggressive promotion of Bitcoin, by this I mean, an occasional spike in price, to promote development such as Lightning, etc., all the while dropping it just as fast as to let the 'buyers/hodler' get in on a piece of the action.  One would not want to be caught dead without BTC when the current fiat system gets shut down.  Yes, shutdown...  Don't get me wrong, when we instate a new monetary system, eventually the old one has to go, but the old one has a self-preservation attribute built in, thus it will have to be killed.
Other signs are pretty obvious when you look at it, we just need time to observe it as it happens.  Hell, if you're a good Christian Man, you can even see this in the chapters of the Apocalypse in the new testament.
Lastly Bitcoin is over 10yrs old, if it was destined to death at one point or another in its evolution, it would of died by now!  Bitcoin can and will change, adapt, itself into its new day of age, but you can't put the Genie back in the bottle after it is open!  Yes, there will come a time, when you put $5.00USD on the counter to pay for coffee, and we will tell you, "WTF, have you no crypto", the bill will be $3.75USD and they will bring you back no change!

Congrats my friend this was more than an excellent read.  Bitcoin is so much more than a worthless miserable US dollar printed out of thin air.  For those who would like to take into account the price, notice that BTC never fell below the rise it came up from.  As it goes up it would be useless to turn it into Fiat, cause Fiat is devaluating faster and faster.  Hell, then use bitcoin as currency, but catch 22, would you buy a lambo today with bitcoin.  Cause it could be the most expensive card of your life.  For now. lets all relax and let innovation and change do its thing. HODL!!!  It may come down to 3000, but never under 1200.

At the time the FEDs used Gov. to control the money supply.  I'm just saying, today the Gov. is so indeed corrupted by FEDs.  With the arrival of BTC, the FEDs don't see the need for the Gov., on the contraire, we can wipe Global Gov. out by crashing USD, as it is the pillar of measurement to all other currencies and countries.  This will erase the debt the banking system created (which can never be undone) and everyone will trades on the blockchain.  Gov. and FEDs agree!  Meanwhile, the US prints money as much as they want to grab as much global resources as possible.  When they're ready to pull the chain, you'll probably see NYC go up in smokes with a nuke.  Using a Hegelian Dialect to this effect is in the process right now.  This is why the war against Arab Nations and North Korea are ongoing right now.  Remember, the USA will need its enemies when the time comes.

If Bitcoin was to reveal one thing, it is that the Govs. are the terrorists!  Remember, Al Qaida, ISIS, are American made and named societies, created years ago and implemented to become the tools of a Hegelian Dialect.  America needs its enemies to accomplish its deeds!
They're far greater crimes committed and exploited with the USD.  Why don't you tell us about them?  Where is that video, I was watching the other day, about how Bitcoin was traceable.  How her and her team busted and CIA official, for a bitcoin extortion fraud.  Isn't that CIA official a terrorist as well.
Please define 'Terrorist', because I find it as a word that is an empty distinction.  Created by the said legal authority to eliminate any one or group that does not concur with the current corrupt establishment of Gov, and Banksters.
Illicit finance, Heaven forbid you should ever want to buy the services of a hooker!  This is a sad day for Bitcoin, Gov control is the reduction in freedoms for everyone at the price or excuse of security.   Try your abilities at a true free society instead,  imagine and prepare as if you lived in a lawless country.  True, without law you could steal, but would you?  You'd need to think twice. because the same freedoms apply to others.  Steal from my table and I cut your hand.

I have a Pi3 with wifi&amp;BT, external HD is a WD Caviar 500gig, bandwith is 150gig @ 30gig/speed.  Should not be an issue, but here is the readout you asked for :
 23:27:26 up 19 min,  1 user,  load average: 2.34, 2.07, 1.51
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT

To boot, I get an ufw fail to load at boot time, you know when all those (  OK  ) go by real fast, however if I do a UFW STATUS as root, it shows active.  Is this an issue, here is what the : systemctl status ufw.service says :
Feb 05 18:35:58 ThunderZ ufw-init[113]: ip6tables-restore v1.6.0: no command specified

By blocks, I was referring to the the content in directory blocks on the HD.  Dir: /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet/testnet3/blocks.  it's up to block 16 now.  I was just expecting to see my testcoins in the "unconfirmed_balance" until the blockchain was up to date, maybe I have to wait for the block it was mined in to arrive! the files look like this : blk00016.dat
My pi3 can connect with both wired-0.22 and wireless-0.6, when I asked for the coins I was connected 0.6-wirelessly  In my port forwarding setup, I put ip-0.22 to 18333 is this why they don't show up? even as unconfirmed?
Sorry about the mess in the cut/paste infos... hope this is not to rough for ya, and I really much appreciate the help, thx a million again, you are one patient dude!

Yip, bullish for BTC!  America however has found a solution to their debt problem, it is BTC.  Transfer of wealth from the few rich to the many, who are at this time getting their first coins.  Then they erase the debt by collapsing their USD.  The very rich go flat broke, and the poor sap who got in with a few coins, is now richer than the FIAT millionaires where!  Where 20% of the world population owns 80% of the world's resources... Soon, that 20% will be broke and the world will find a new global currency with a new redistributed wealth attribute.

In the trx between Alice and Carol, there's code that is exchange along with the promise to send 1mBtc.  Let's call this code 'The release code'.  When Alice presses Send her trx goes out on to her off-chain channel, where the routing begins.  She has 2 channels open, one with Bob and one with Dave.  The routing protocol determines the least expensive route to Carol.  Bob charges 1 satoshi for hopping through his route while Dave may charge 5 satoshies.  When the protocol has determined the best route, all the hops taken are aware of a 1mBtc transfer to occur.  At this point , Dave has been segregated from routing, he's just to expensive!  But for the sake of your understanding we'll say Bob suddenly loses all his LN channels, thus Alice is only opened with Dave now to get to Carol.  The routing protocol determines that the best route is through Dave, However, Bob did receive from Alice before he went down on his channels!  But he's up and running again, just rebooted his LN node, or whatever reason.  Now, both routes get to Carol at the same time, one through Bob and One through Dave.  Carol is holding Alice's release code.  The code goes down the least expensive route, either priced by satoshies in fees for the hop, and/or the route with the least hops as possible.  In this case the protocol determines the route will be through Bob at 1 satoshi.  Then, Carol's release the code provided by Alice to Bob in exchange for the 1mBtc.  Who in turn releases the code to Alice for 1mBtc.  This code does not get released twice by Carol, if it get used to update the ledger between Carol and Bob, it does not become available to update the ledger between Carol and Dave.  Now, Bob has Carol's release code and is short on 1mBtc.  Dave can't get the release code.... sniff...  Bob routes the release code to Alice... Alice goes, hang on Bobby boy, I sent that code to down 2 channels!!!  Dave has no release code and only the ledger between Alice and Bob get updated to the amount of 1mBtc.
The release code ensure only the chosen route, determined by the routing protocol, that is the route with either least expensive in satoshi fees, and/or the least number of hops, will be used for the trx.  Else i'm not understanding your question!
This happens on the blockchain, with an open trx, not yet closed, for which we will modify an internal ledger, until it is closed.

F$%?* Cool, finally some real good entertainment back on r/bitcoin.  Thanks for the good read, really enjoyed.  Truth, is bitcoin is the 2nd last step to the end of type "0" civilization.  The next one, is the elimination of the world reserve currency, alias the USD.  For this, the US will nuke NYC, in a Hegelian Dialect with North Corea and the Middle East.  This will lead to the rise of BTC, and to a massive population reduction process through global civil war, and the induced hate between the Catholics and Muslims, will contribute fairly to this demise.
Bitcoin will rise to ATH as never seen before, but its life will be short lived as the coming of a meteorite impacts the Orient.  Bitcoin is a currency, an electronic currency. A Toure de Force, but it is as well, the last form of currency the human species will ever know.

When I install 'oracle-java8-jdk' and JQ for the first time.  It goes good, works well, and when I do a 'java -version', i do get the build 1.8.0_65...'.  At this point I'm rebooting to make an .IMG file with the ongoing install, so if shit happens, I don't have to install from scratch.
After a reboot, I log as pi, do a 'sudo java -version' and it replies 'sudo: java: command not found'.  I cd to the /usr/bin/, but no such /java directory exists, however there are many symbolic links in the /usr/bin directory, for which one is :  'java -&gt; /etc/alternatives/java', it has 'java' written in light blue and the '-&gt;  /etc/alternatives/java' in regular white, while other java related links seam to be in red.  
I re-imaged my MicroSD card reflect installation just after bitcoin core was installed and working, so I have nothing on eclair installed yet.  Right now, I would just like to boot my Pi3 and get a proper response to  $ sudo java -version from the pi user.

I see your question now, sorry didn't quite pick it up the first time around!  When Bob 'sleeps on the switch sort to say' with Alice's trx, that trx does get rerouted via Dave.  Carol has the ruby red gem and passes it to Dave, who in turn passes it back to Alice.  The payment takes that route.  When Bob wakes up about this, he goes over to Carol and asks for the ruby red gem, which she has traded for a mBtc with Dave a long time ago.  No ruby red gem, no payment...  When the trx gets to destination and there is no code to allow payments anymore, no payment is made.  without the ruby red gem, Bob can't claim Alice and create double spending.  Keep in mind the routing finds it way to Carol, and if Carol has no ruby red code, she is not getting paid.  If she does have the code, she 'trades it' for the mBtc, the code is then passes on and on through all the hops necessary until it goes back to Alice and stops there.
Since Bob will never get a ruby red gem, his trx never goes through...  Hope this helps!

Yes Sir you said it!  "A Currency Without Government".  This is more or less like.... say, doing commerce like we do with FIAT but without the government entity in the background.  Now without government... where is your old age pension?  I agree, it is something necessary and imperative, but it will come at a price!  I for one would be glad to see that 'loser politician' actually work for a living for a change, but one has to see a lawless society coming as well!  Some can't see it coming, others reject the coming altogether.  It's still going to happen.
So is Bitcoin necessary and imperative?  You damn right it is!   Is it without governments, laws, rules, and regulations, you damn right it is, and everything that comes with that as well!  Is it in it's beginning, hell ya, but to say is it something great???  For now lets just call it 'different'.
BTC is coming!  To take out government, one must take out Fiat currency, think of a society in transition, where there is no fiat money(worthless), no government.  Those who adapted those who didn't, and the repercussions it will have on you as a human being in the social structure of wherever it is you live.  Your pretty right all along, it just the word 'great' that throws me off.  You still got my upvote! Enjoy!

You can choose the amount of Sat/byte in the sliderbar on the send page!  Before setting a fee check the average fee in the mempool : 
If your sending from an accumulated wallet of many transactions, say, btc you got from a faucet a while back!  then it is possible that your transaction is high satoshi wise.
Best drop the fee in the scale on Mycelium or Import the key large number of keys of your account to bitcoin core and resend them all to on single key

The Boom Boom is how we will eliminate Fiat and Government at the same time, one quick blow!  This will make crypto and a One World Currency unit prevail.  Eliminating borders, etc.  Without Gov. there will be lawlessness indeed, I call it Global Civil War.  It is not just a question of hiding, it's a question of how civil are you in a time like that.  They won't need nukes to kill us off, they prefer we kill each other off ourselves.
We all praise the day BTC is worth a million bucks, and when it gets near!  No more bucks to turn them into!  We will have the means to buy boats and planes in crypto, if we can keep the neighbors gun out of our faces long enough.  Wow, what fun time this change will bring on!
I agree to some of these comments, WW3 will be a currency war! it will be also a global civil war\(you and your neighbor\), a religious war\(Muslims,Christians\).  As for blowing up the planet, no, but this will require a few nukes \(NYC\).   Like Mikkio Kaku would say, good by type 0 civilization, hello type 1.
How do we pay for the Grand Finale of type 0, we buy BTC and hodl...  I'm not saying it is wrong, nor right, it just has to happen.  Technological Paralysis and Planned Obsolescence is destroying Earthly resources\(another war\) in a monetary system that has reached the end of its functionality.

How is it the Euro is guaranteed, and bitcoin not!!  Isn't there a distributed ledger that guarantees ownership!!  Illegal activities are not the only users of bitcoin, the common enthusiast is as well.  I see Dentists, Lawyer, Grocery Stores, Shops, On\-line stores, Venezuela, etc, and they don't look or feel anymore criminal than I do.  Sure the speculation is volatile, you can win big, and you can lose fast, but then we did put in what we can afford to lose, no!!!  Sure we can get fucked by an ICO, but do your homework, this is not bitcoin it's an ICO.  I used my Fiat to invest in BTC, and not use my BTC to invest in anything else, as for computer hacks, there is the Ledger, Trezor, and other tools than just a bank vault with nothing inside.  
BUT....  If you need to slow down the adoption rate of Bitcoin in France, this is one way of going about it.  Besides, since when do banks actually give a shit about what you do with your money.  My Question is why take the time to put a video like this together?  Who is to gain from this short clip?  What exactly is she trying to say?

I foresee one viable option...  Money is Debt and Debt is Money...  The current fiat system has to go.  No more paper value!  All bank accounts to zero.  No more Mortgage, Loans or other forms of debts... Nothing to payback,  but then what's your 5 bucks gonna get ya???  For the only way to eliminate the self imploding debt, is to kill the monetary system.  A group of cryptographers named Satoshi Nakamoto, created a emergency exit, BITCOIN.  "Let us be rid of the debt, and by the same token, instate a one world currency unit.  Then we shall control not only the economy of one country, but the world."  The USD is the current world reserve, it can be knocked off, and will be.  This is how the Elites step out of the US platform and grab control of the world.  I think we are headed for some really rough waters... Shit is gonna hit the FAN...  Hopefully, cryptocurrency will be better implemented by then...
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:56:16
I would have to say, the biggest reason one should convert to the new Crypto-Currency is because, The implosion of fiat is imminent.  Banks have capitalized on the people to an extent that the common person can't get into a dept anymore.  To expensive to afford is the going trend!
The USD dollar is the Pillar of most world economies, for what is your Pound worth, just as many other fiat currencies, it is worth so much USD.  When France worked with the USA to overthrow Kadafi, it was paid in USD fiat.  It then tried to return that fiat to USA in exchange for Gold, so as to help with the Euro value.
The French where told NO WAY!, which make the USD a worthless piece of paper, to them anyway!
This is the first sign of collapse, once the Pillar goes, everyone follows.  The Americans knew this, and saw this coming, so out comes the savior, crypto, else we would be killing each other for a slice.  
What was missing was time, so came the IMF who printed 800billion USD, which in turn will make 800 trillion under rules of fractional banking, and now the only thing missing was the Jobs.  Jobs came from war, and terrorism, just look at airport security around the world!!!
they are maintaining capitalism on artificial life support.  We know the technology of the blockchain will make governments fault, banks crumble, and many old institutions fall, but it is what we need to fall on when capitalism does implode.  You may want to have some crypto at that point, because if they keep capitalism alive right now, it'll be very easy to turn it all off when they judge the time worthy!
This is commonly know as a controlled descent!
Hope you enjoyed the read!

Have you ever noticed there is no press or publicity for BTC at all, no stock market quote, nothing else but a couple of reddits.  At the speed of expatiation bitcoin is going through, you thought you'd see that S curve by now, yet still no press.  When Tylenol and United Airlines had their bad publicity moments, did they not make themselves a niche in the market.  Yet, we here nothing of bitcoin even if it's a bad thing.  When it takes 5 years for BTC to go back over $1000USD and 5mo to hit 1800USD almost double, still no press.  Surpasses gold OZ, still nothing.
Now, tell me our media is not filtered by bigger heads! If BTC gets not a word in this story, this is invalid, they tell you what they want you to hear and not hear.  Imagine all the truth you have been missing out on!  Media has been censored for a long time now!  This is sad!

Hum... that dollar is dead already... Still in use, but was a note supposed to be backed by gold.  France tried to return USD for gold to maintain the Euro, but the US said no way... The Fiat note is officially worthless, or dead.  USA is going bankrupt, this is why they have created BitCoin, LiteCoin and FeatherCoin in the first place.  The US dollar is the pillar of all currencies right now, for what is any currency worth if not mesured in USD. if it fails, everyone else falls.  So, they made BTC for USA, LTC for the Orient, and FTC for Europe.  Once these cryptos into place, ciao bye USD, and to make that happen, well... Get ready for a Hegelian Dialect that will blow your mind... very sad...

Innovation and technology can't be suppressed, Bitcoin can't be removed.  India will have to deal with it, this makes the 'banned it' issue highly impossible.  Can you regulate a Open Network, Decentralized System?  Such an attempt can be achieved, as long as, the average Indian wants to pay with BTC for government services, also highly unlikely!  What's left?  To observe, let evolve or let grow!  This is not a choice given to the Indian people, this is the new form of PUBLICITY for BTC.  This is giving the poor nations of the world, a chance at adopting BTC at a good price, leaving the richer countries adopt at a much higher price later in the time frame.   This, in turn, shares the wealth at a global level.  My advice as a Canadian to the Indian people, not government, is adopt BTC and take your share of the wealth the world has to offer via this new technology.  This is your wake up call after the rupee incident earlier.  It's coming, it was made for you 'NOW'.

Since i didn't know of any good apple BTC wallet app back then.  But hey! they didn't seem to mind, it was a give away, but people have now heard of BTC.  When the BTC price goes up they see their $0.52 go up to $0.74.  In the future, they will know what BTC is, and if BTC should make a big jump up someday, they're going to say,  Hey, let me in on it!

The fun thing is today Millionaires don't look at bitcoin, they don't need to, they're millionaires.  When capitalism implodes and fiat becomes worthless, most millionaires won't have Bitcoins, and thus be the poorest people all of a sudden.  Today's poor folks heard of BTC, and gave into it with the little they had.  When capitalism fails, they will be the new millionaires.  The first shall be last, and the last shall be first.  For those who still think that the Fiat currency system will be around forever!  Stop looking at bitcoin and what is happening to it, but study fiat and look at what is happening to it instead.  
IMO, it's a question of time before we stop giving a USD or any other country's value to BTC.  We will be working for Satoshies, buying with Sats, etc., all in Sats!

Well, I think all this "Who is SN" chatter is pretty useless information.  However your post is the closest to the truth as to this new colossal event in BTC.
Your right, the question is why!
Why would Mr Wright make such a claim?  Obviously whether he is or not is pretty irrelevant!  One must try to understand how this story would in fact affect the Crypto-World.  
How many Bitcoins does he have, how many will he sell!!!  And maybe this is just the reason why he comes out now, to be able to pump a phenomenal amount of bitcoins back into the network.
What would happen to BTC prices if 54mil. in BTC was pumped back into circulation?  Would the price drop, would it keep the price from going up, in a particular event, such as the halving or say a country's bankruptcy? 
Personally, I think if SN comes out now, then there is indeed a good reason for that, for it is never about what you do, but why you do it!  I see a whopping load of bitcoins going back into circulation from a hidden account(SN).  This can possibly reduce the price of BTC, keep it from going ballistic or help maintain a level price somewhere reasonable so adoption can still occur!
 
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:27:36
Because if BTC price goes to high to fast, we lose adoption!!  Must be done very slow, it is already growing to fast.
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:25:02
I agree, at the current rate of growth BTC would attain such heights.  However, there is LTC and FTC that was developed at the same time BTC started.  Each wallet being 4x the size of the other 21, 84, 336mil coins.  These wallets ack like a buffer to one another via the exchanges, and then the price of BTC can be controlled to allow a slow and sure adoption around the world.  Crypto will be the new form of money, but it will not rise that fast, or that high. Keep bitcoining!

OK i'll be merciful.  The treZor device, signs off any transactions with exterior device private keys, 'say a Mycelium wallet full of public keys but no privates', the treZor holds the private keys.  If you should lose or misplace the treZor device, then the 24word backup of the can be added as a regular account, which would then also contain private keys for you to sign off transaction with.
On the other hand, to be less merciful.  Man, if you can't handle the crossroads of responsibility and security, then leave it with the banksters. ;-)

ok check this out... This guy comes along 2000yrs ago, right!!! He says this....
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a MARK in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the MARK, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
See where it says no man can buy or sell… see see!
It is obvious we all have the power to buy and sell, all of us around the world.  I have a purchasing power; you have a purchasing power, because we have fiat currency or money.  Some more than others, but then it does go on to say Rich and Poor.  I don’t know of a country around the world that doesn’t have money.
	At present 3 on 7 billion people have banking readily available.  I remove fiat currency, add crypto, and 7 billion people now have banking and a purchasing power.  If you should wish to hold on to that fiat, and not use crypto… fine! But one day someone might tell you, “No crypto, no coffee”, and then all your fiat purchasing power is gone, because no one wants your fiat anymore!
It not about what's good or bad, it's about the ability to adapt to change...

The Halving is coming!  It's not so much the Chinese are buying BTC it's more like they're being sold BTC to.  Crypto-currency, or the blockchain, is a USA invented technology from Chicago by a group of cryptographer, despite the Satoshi Nakamoto (Japanese) pseudonym.  This technology is sold to China at the price of the US dept.  This is why the Chinese are mining so hard.  
We are made to believe that SN is some Australian guy, hence, not so much that he's an Aussie, but more like he can't point to America.  Nevertheless he has made a big bunch of new coins magically appear in our minds.  Coins that are moving over to one of Trump's most beloved country.  America wants that dept down!  When the halving occurs the price of BTC will rise and the US dept towards China will fall.  
The Elites where losing it, and now they have found a way to maintain it.  Capitalism, or the Usury of Money is about to change and for this to occur, the format also must change.  Fiat has to move over!  This is why you have people like Andreas Antonopoulos urging world governments not to regulate, hinder, or reject BTC. 
Sure BTC will be the blockchain of "money", and probably Etherium will be the blockchain of "contracts" and some othercoin the blockchain of something else!  
Crypto is here to stay, we have no choice, it was this or the US economy was going to implode sending many countries into bankruptcy, which would of ended in probably what I call a global civil war.  
And this is why China is being sold and mining so intensely, to cut the American dept!
Happy halving everyone, it will bring the price of BTC up!
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:50:02
Yes, $500 is a small amount in perspective, however if BTC should hit $250,000USD.  Tell me, then would your X amount of mBtc deserve a HW.  If BTC goes up, the demand for a HW might go up as well.  Changing price, availability, etc.  If your question arises, is it not because, you see this as the right thing to do.  Then by all means, do get a HW, while the goings good!

Yes, right now a Satoshi Nakamoto account holds many coins.  We are in the process of implementation and development.  They will be released as bitcoin slowly spreads and grows.  When coins are widespread, then and only then, expect the crash of USD.  For now, we need USD, and other world money to make BTC grow, else you would have nothing to change into Bitcoin!
I understand your vision, step out of the current state of BTC's implementation and move forward a few years.  The higher the price of Bitcoin the more coins need to be into circulation.  That Satoshi account will have to drop, else Bitcoin would skyrocket to over 1Billion$ a coin, where BTC would fail due to lack of interest in purchasing at this price.  
What worries me is HOW the Global Elites will make the USD come down...  I fear a nuke on NYC in a close future, by the means of a Hegelian Dialect.  This will be proven, when you will see that no retaliation will occur to such an executed plan.  For it is ok for one country to nuke itself, but wrong for one to nuke another.

BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO... clap, clap, clap.  Yes, we operate under the NSA, in a joint venture with the FEDs and USG.  We did see the collapse of Fiat coming.  Actually, we are trying to keep it going for now.  AKA, the World Trade Centers.  We print as we need, but we are all caught up in laws, rules and regulations, that paralyzes the current economic system.  
The folks from Bitcoin are a group of us, though Joe actually wrote the white paper!  So, what is the future plan?... Evidently, we can't pay the debt!!!  So, the idea was to keep Fiat afloat until crypto got off the ground, or as you so put it, "moon baby!"  Then make the USD crash with the help of a Nuke over NYC making the WTCs a prelude to wiping the slate clean.  Two birds one stone...  
No more debt as world economies implode, and the birth of a Unified One World Currency Unit...  The Satoshi.  The fall of borders, will give birth to billions of un-banked people who will now have access to a global market.  
A diabolic plan??? No...  just a necessity to compensate for the shit paper money has placed us in!

Who do you think is paying this BTC 32% increase...  You see they take the money from the Alts and pump BTC through the exchanges.  Then when BTC get out of proportion with Alts, they pump 5000 new coins into circulation.  This brings the price back down!  Slowly folks return to Alts and they go up again!  Rinse, repeat, and adoption slowly expands.

In the normal evolution of a product or service that has come to light, there is a S curve of adoption.  I think you can Google 'S curve of Adoption' and find something as to HOW things evolve or grow into existence.  Understanding where we stand in this curve is crucial.  When running a 1Bil+ Exchange, you'll agree that the time to exit the business model is important, else you lose it all.
When an Exchange declare hard times, either by association to Evil thing such as Drug Money, money Laundering, Banks...eugh, and gets 850mil seized or Hacked.  Most of the time, it is taking the profits it has made and letting its customers pull out its funds.  The average user either gets his AltCoins out, as to not lose at the exchange or sells everything to BTC at a loss, then withdraws.  Those who wait lose everything, such as those at MtGox.
In the 'S Curve of Adoption', the arrival of Institutional Money for the purchase of BTC is almost at hand.  The market is ripe, sort of say!  This will pump the price of BTC up significantly, putting the survival of any exchange in danger.  Best say, the bigger the Exchange the larger the danger, or the loss.
Exchanges see this, so do we!  I'm saying the closure of big exchanges are a precursor to a spike, not its cause!  I have 10mBtc on Bittrex.  My thoughts are, I lost 5mBtc in bad trades, should I sell and pull out now, or wait for the bad news bear to announce his thing.
Closing Exchanges are a Bullish sign to price hikes.  They announce a jump in price as per the S Curve of Evolution or Adoption, and are not the cause of the jump.  Hope it's a little more clear for you.  Thanks for reading me out.  Buy BTC, have a good ride up!  I'm thinking btwn 300 and 400gs, then back down below 100.  Institutional Money has the power for such a hike right now, but after that... Who knows!

India has the population to change the direction of the BTC boat and the needs of the masses can easily cater to this move.  Its just that America is not done making its money with BTC yet, that the politics keep you under a fear driven control.
They know the population of India can make a significant change, this is why they will close up the account of anyone.  Relax my friend, whether you like it or not, you will all Bitcoin, because your bank is going to close up anyways!

It's not like this is so important and all, Blockchain technologies have no need for (lawmakers)Gov. anyways! Just my opinion.

Remember, BTC is on a controlled ascension.  If we let it run unchecked it would either crash and burn to the hands of a few who can't publicize it properly or the price would skyrocket to the extent that, the masses would see it as a commodity out of reach.  Then again it would crash and burn!  Without the occasional price spike and DROP, the development of software and interest wouldn't happen.  There is for SURE someone somewhere who pumps and dumps Bitcoin when Bitcoin needs to be.  Else, BTC wouldn't grow!
You're right no one knows for sure if Satoshi has control or not over 1.1M coins.  What we do know for sure is, 'without control the ascension of Bitcoin would fail.'  So, for sure someone somewhere is dumping or pumping coins at the desired rate!

DELAY TACTICS, would implement that an authority somewhere is trying to flow the evolution of bitcoin in a certain direction!  Finally, someone else that sees this!  Maybe this crippling situation for BTC is a necessity in the bigger picture of its evolution.  This SegWit situation, would again implement that an authority is guiding BTC.  So lets think, instead of bitching or judging, lets look at the bigger picture as to why the consensus of this matter needs to be pushed back as long and far as possible.
Let us share your logistical, analytical thoughts as to the 'why' of this pain stacking issue.  What does BTC have to gain by slowing down its evolution?  Please don't post any petty emotional, irrational comments! They are none productive and useless.

And there it is!!! AT LAST.... For those who thought Satoshi Nakamoto was a Japanese guy somewhere...  Well, you had it all backwards.  In the true Japanese culture such a person would be named Nakamoto Satoshi San.  Thus, the mere fact that the White Paper is named using the typical American convention, first name first and last name last, proves without doubt that the authentic Satoshi was an American cryptographer.  Possibly Joe!
Real Bitcoiners are a new and adapted species of humans, we adjust well to change, so if we ever go to Japan, we will be sure to convert to the local customs, but we will not forget the true makers of Bitcoin!

Debt Base USA... Oh it has a plan alright!!  It's called 'Foreclosure'.  The need to move off a debt base monetary system to a more flourishing, globally, limited supply, Blockchain, is already in the works.  We are seeing this conversion today.
Negative interest rates won't fix a debt base system...  It'll help hold it, until time comes to convert over to Blockchain.  Only thing is we can't do it overnight.
Instate BTC, let evolve BTC, once well implemented, Crash USD, and voila.  By the same token, bank the unbanked, create new markets.  Literally steal from the rich and give to the poor.  A redistribution of wealth!!

The man will never be poor, for he has already lived rich... 84yrs old is it...  He lived rich.  He still is not going to bring it with him to the grave.  I'm just saying, when USD collapses, ether it be stocks, bonds or Airline, whatever business.  The value of it all will come down with it.  Not just these 2 will be broke, but the rest of us as well.  When the US forecloses on their debt, do you think you will still have a government pension waiting for you at 65 ?    No!
Those holding crypto might have a better chance at adapting to the new financial situation of the world.  At 84 years old, after living rich all my life...  I wouldn't give a shit about bitcoin either!

Again!  Yet again!  They arrest the business entrepreneur, even if he deals in illicit materials.  Not ethical, but a real trade, just like those who buy milk for $3.50 at the store.  The real none ethical, corrupt, thief and bad person in this video, is the one for who we created laws for.  Yes, the "Federal Undercover Agent".  So where does corruption run at its best, you guessed it, at the government level!!!
Those who oppose good business entrepreneurship, yes the soup of agencies united to take down silk Road, along with corrupted agents operating under the excuse of legitimacy or legality.  They are all the bad actors to me!  Including this prosecutor...  
I don't buy guns or drugs, don't want some or need some.  For those who do!  hey, whatever floats your boat!  If you take down someone doing legitimate business, no matter how unethical.

Not an easy situation, I know what you mean!  Same here, I guess until there is a world wide acceptance of Bitcoin payments, It would seem we don't have a choice.
BTC is like a boat on a peer.  right now, it's not ready to set sail.  One day though, it will!  If you want to be a passenger, it is best to put one foot on the boat and another on firm ground.  If the ship should leave you're one step onboard, and if it should sink, then you only get one foot wet.

Not perfect but probably better.  One would have to think that every action he does has an equal reaction from his environment.  Then think twice, an fear that there is no law to protect him in his bad doing, or right doing.  I wouldn't persecute anyone for their right doing, nor their wrong doing, but some of us are quick to pull the trigger on those who don't do right.  Imagine if you had to think twice on everything you do, in case it would offend someone and get your head blown off.  You then just might be making the world a better place!

They passed a law in Canada, you can now smoke Marijuana, but not in public places, such as events, concerts, outdoor festivals.  Before the law passed, the people would hide to toke their joints.  Will they not toke at events... NO!  they will continue to hide just as before, but have to pay the fine, if they should get caught!  All the law did, was bring on the fines...  There is no gain in freedoms here, no winning against a system.  Just a money grab for those who govern over others.

If a service company or retailer was asked by all bitcoin users if his business accepted BTC as a FOP, he'd eventually notice the demand.   Can you imagine, if you had a breakfast restaurant and was asked, bill after bill, do you accept Bitcoin? 
As for mainstream adoption, that S curve, well not just quite yet.  You best get people to adhere to a wallet like Mycelium or Breadwallet, and give them 1mBtc after a proper backup.  Show then a BTM in your neighborhood, and how to get $10 worth.  Adoption is slow but happening for sure, proof is when I joined this reddit there was only 74000 subscribers.

Bitcoin was about putting the power back into the hands of the people!  To rid of the Banksters and all their evil deeds!  If for one second you have bitcoin on an exchange and think you own them.  Forget it!!  Exchanges use your bitcoin value, just like banks lend your dollars out.  Coinbase is probably selling your bitcoins to Bakkt, who will in turn sell them out to millions of others, making the price inflate, which may not be a bad idea!  But then try to get your hands on your money!  Sorry, we where hacked, and it's gone!
Time for a run on the Bank...  I agree with everything this guy says...  Time to show yourself responsible for your money, your bitcoins and yourself.  Get a private key and take power!  it's not like you haven't been warned!
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:08:06
Get BTC before the Backsters force BTC down your throat, this way you're sure to get a better deal.  As for others, let them be!  One day, they will get a call from their financial institutions to be told their 2,000.00 has been converted to 200000satoshies or 2mBtc.  Ooofff... What a deal!  Then they will have to catch up because commerce will have adapted.  - "One coffee please!"  - "that'll be 200satoshies!"  and as they try to give their paper money away to pay the tab.  - "What the Hell, don't you have any crypto, get out of here!!!"
There is a reason as to why some don't change... A thing you don't have an issue with from what I can see.  So by all means change!  Let every man woman and child be judged by his/her own deed.  Let it go buddy, you don't have to change anyone!  I feel your pain!

The way I figure it, giving the amount of cryptos available, only a few will prosper when fiat is all gone.  The dominant crypto may not be BTC, but the Core Developers, who made coins possible at the time, created 3 wallets at the time.  BTC LTC FTC...  What goes into crypto stays into crypto... I would exchange, yes, but only in favor of making more of any of these three coins.  As for HOW it will be useful later!  Fiat currency will be gone in the future!

The current economic system is a debt base.  In the 50's, mommy stayed at home to take care of the kids while daddy worked.  In the 80's they both worked to make it happen.  Today they both barely make ends meet.  Banks have made getting money easy but paying the debt is tough at time.
It's at a point where we prefer to not have the shit, than to compound its debt to an already going one.  The current economic system of Fiat money and printing is not fixing this anymore and was never meant to.  Our current money system has to go!
Bitcoin shows up, a system by where money is replaced and by the same token, the inability to inflate it makes its value go up.  This rise in value make some want to invest into BTC.  Now, we have money pumped back into circulation, where innovation and new things happen with it.
All this is a normal process of evolution, where needs and demands for something now meets a solution and/or answer.  We still have a ways to go before we complete the change from this debt base functionality, but we'll get there!
As for price!  When investors buy a restricted commodity, its price goes up!  The same will happen with Bitcoin.  So we can't tell what it will be on the 23 July 2020, but chances are it will be higher than the current price.  "Chances" is not a sure shot, but it's about reading the signs right now.
If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, most of the time it is a duck.  If you look at the east after a long night, and you see a light on the horizon.  You don't need to be divine to say, "Look, day comes."  
Liars and Idiots are those who prefer to 'judge' or 'write off' anything anyone says about price than to actually try to understand 'IF' there is any truth to such a declaration.  We are at a point where larger investments are about to happen in BTC.
Time travellers don't come here!  They fear this day in age!  Because after institutional money has made its dent, it will be time to eliminate the debt.  The US will eliminate its debt by making USD crash.  This will require a nuke over NYC, and a few Dirty bombs over the Western Coast.  Fear not world, no retaliation will happen.  
This is where people will understand what a Hegelian Dialect is.  It worked for the World Trade Centres, I don't see why it can't erase debt.  So, I pick none of the above.  Enjoy the changing times mate! ;-)

We all do buy!  As a matter of fact, most of us buy and hodl...  Bitcoin that are out of circulation and all hodlled up in peoples wallet creates a scarcity, and the price goes up.  By the same token, hodled coins don't pump any money into BTC.  So, once in a while, we need a whale to come on by and drop 5000 bitcoins, this makes the price drop, and put new bitcoins into circulation and brings money into BTC.  It was time for that Satoshi account to dump a few coins into circulation.  Relax we brought BTC from a few $s to a few more $$$$.  We'll bring it to $$$,$$$ in due time! ;-)

Sure, Say you own an exchange.  Net worth 2 Bitcoins.  One in actual BTC and the other in various cryptos.  Subscribers drop $$$ to your exchange and they start to trade.  After a while you own mega $$$ from purchases and fees, then it happens...  Institutional money begins to flow into BTC, the price jumps from 5000 to 275000.  Woo hoo, i'm selling baby! My new lambo!!  You will quickly run out of funds.  Hell, your not any worst than any other, so you start selling the exchange's BTC.  Users want to sell their ALts for BTC, and with your $$$$ all gone your BTC stash is taking a blow.  Eventually you cant keep up, and foreclosure is soon to follow.  Go Ahead look at the history of closing exchanges...  MtGox, e-BTC, Cryptsy, QuadrigaCX, etc.. Just to name a few...  I guess it would of been easier for you to see, if you had been in from the start.  An exchange associated to a bank, like this one,  Bitfinex and HSBC.  They know when to hold'em and when to fold'em.  This is fold'em time... means next spike is close by!

Well for those who haven't noticed by now!  Bitcoin is about turning Fiat into Digital.  Banks do Fiat only, and thus are instructed from the top, not to build a banking structure that can reverse the process.
It's all good, until you show the banking institutions, you are looking for the reverse venue.  Bank will provide if you put Fiat into BTC, be with cash deposits, BTMs, Wire transfers, Credit Card, Bank Cards, checks, etc...  But the other way around, not gonna happen!  Your a fraud, thief, terrorist, bad boy of all types, as soon as you want to change BTC back to Fiat.
Yes, the banks control BTC and if BTC has the illusion of free market to a certain extent.  Know that this form of control is done, by controlling the exchanges.  Need more proof BTC is controlled, go ahead, try to use their services to turn BTC back into Fiat!!!
If you need to change BTC to Fiat, use a street teller, or BTM

My fellow Canadian, to be honest with you, the full usury of the blockchain will probably dissolve our Canadian government.  This transition period between this ancient way of life and the new(fiat and now crypto), is why we even ask ourselves this question in the first place.  Andreas Antonopoulos came to Canada and met with the Canadian comity for Crypto-currency and was asked to leave Bitcoin alone.  No regulation, no laws, as to not inhibit it's development.  By all means if you make a gain in fiat you are taxed, if you make a gain in crypto, on the other hand, you are not taxed.  This is what we call promoting crypto at the government level.  If you should feel the need to spend your newly gained crypto, then buy in crypto!  We have come a long way from the first Alpaca Soxs Merchant.  Buying goods is not an additional income and has no need for tax declaration.
I buy stuff using crypto on-line, and then replace my crypto.  The currency obviously rises and I make the gains still.
To answer your question, about taxes!  No, unless you turn Bitcoins back to fiat, you need not declare anything to a soon dissolved government.

Hey, if you had the power to push the price of BTC down without using a penny, but just by mere influence.  You probably would, so you could get some at a much better price.  In turn selling them at a much higher price later! 
Sounds right to me...  It's ok to reveal these financial secrets now, as in a distant future, this technique will not be used anymore and will be no longer needed.  Crypto will make sure of that!!!  But for transition, and as long as BTC is paralleled to USD, we will see things like this and more!  Love a good roller coaster ride!  Most exciting times!

Bitcoin is in its infancy still, custodial accounts will demand much of your time and energy, play hard to get, and ask you for a sacrifice practically.  I suggest, in this time of development of the new tech, that you get just a phone wallet.  Go to a BTM and get a few $$$ worth.

I bought most at 11%, that is for $50, I got $44.50 in BTC on my Mycelium on Android device.  It took 2 days to break even at $50.  Point is whatever the price, this BTC will rise to power as a replacement for the very crippled capitalist system now on life support.  Buy some don't sweat it, get a little every week, no matter what the price.  Don't put your life savings into it, you still live in a monetary system, but do get ahead of this conversion situation coming about!

Please enjoy Mr Congressman's speech.  It holds truth, Bitcoin can and will disempower USD.  Like I said again and again.  The USA need foreclose on their debt, the current monetary system, worldwide, is totally halted.  The only way is to kill the current world reserve currency!

Please Remember the IMPORTANCE that bitcoin does not grow TO fast.  Institutional money is at hand, and the Ponds used to sow a doubt and weaken the adoption curve have to have big names.  Mr Stiglitz, Mr Buffet, Mr Munger, are now being called on to bad mouth Bitcoin.  This will slow adoption!  Also seen as a very bullish sign for Bitcoin Price...  WooHooo!

Gentlemen...  I can see in your debates, you both agree on the same thing!   It be socialism, fascism, capitalism, it is the current usury of money that is self imploding.  
A 'Shadow economy' is being created, this is what bitcoin is all about.
To a certain extent, i believe this shadow economic situation will allow the human culture to continue in its current path of evolution, despite the heavy beating the transition will deliver.  Even then, the end result of this new way of doing things will eventually fail, as change will always be a part of human evolution.
Technological advancements will eventually provide abundance to the point where any form of usury, it be bitcoins, money, barter, trade will not be sustainable.  The true need is to redefine the social structure with the element of 'change' as the dominant evolutionary factor and not by the means we change or exchange!
Gentlemen, it was good to read you, and a pleasure to see, that i am not the only one who sees the current system's end coming.  I foresee the end of usury all together, along with a great population reduction.  As we learn from our failure, the next social structure will know better then to let such a destructive system ever come about again.  
Meanwhile, we live in the shadows of economics.  Adoption is a must for ones survival, so yes by all means, get your crypto, because this genie is not going back into the bottle!  Evolution can only move forwards.

When a global disruptive technology like BTC enters the spotlight, it is fair to say, that the powerful nations of the world should look to enhance or kill it.  Only 1 Nation controls money, or the printing presses.  Have you heard Trump speak a word of Bitcoin?  10 years and still not a word!  Well, that's a green light to me!
I think US gov. actually want you to use bitcoin, not make it illegal, but make sure the transition to BTC goes slow.  Price stays low, years go by, technology develops, etc, etc..  Next thing you know, it's in use!
The ascension of bitcoin is through propaganda mainly.  You'll notice how, some days we here of news related to drugs, money laundering, etc., and how BTC is used for criminal activities and bad things...  Then the next day, you here of the new BTC ETF that a Investment firm has come out with.  
The only thing I have ever noticed over the years of bitcoin is 1 repetitive pattern.  Each time an Exchanges closes up, a Bitcoin Price jump occurs.  QuadrigaCX Canada, and now Bitfinex.  I'm thinking, this is normal.  If you had an exchange and bitcoin got pumped with institutional money, and its price went through the roof, you would go bankrupt on trying to pay everyone out.
Bitcoin is happening now!  Propaganda will keep the uneducated in check and its price low for adoption.  Would you by BTC, if it was at $643,866.  Eventually, those who didn't go crypto, will be called by their banks an told, "Your 1.2mil retirement fund has been traded to 1.234Btc., thank you!"  
As for, Can the gov. stop you legally, hell ya!  There is laws against trying to replace a country's money.  Will they stop you, hell NO... The people trying to change it is themselves.  The gov. is going up against its own rule.  There not going to slap you for it, but technically, you are the government.  So this is a sensitive issue!  Most fortunate for them, the majority of the US people have no idea how money mechanics work, so they don't care.
If bitcoin was shutdown by someone, say the US or a world effort to make it illegal.  Lots of money would be lost...  Worst, this would literally kill the move towards a paperless money society.  Something that is somewhat in full promotion right now!
All the signs are there, get BTC before we shove it down your throat(figure of speach).  This way you will have gotten it at a decent price.

I always thought BCASH was about KYC... Allow me to explain.  BTC is anonymous, and in the earlier years of Bitcoin lots of people got plenty.  Who are these people, no one know, just keys, no names.  If you joined an exchange and traded your BCash to actual BTC, then by the means of KYC of the exchange, key addresses where associated to a profile.  Thus those who gave their private information for the BCASH equivalent, now have their BTCs linked.  It becomes possible to know who has what, while they might still think they are anonymous.  
EX: I trade my 50 BCASH coins to BTC.  I get on an exchange who wants info on the trader, me!  I take my BTC off the exchange, success...  Now my 50 BTC that where not traceable by the system of addresses on the BTC blockchain can be verified to an Individual from the BCASH blockchain by those same keys.  In essence you dirtied your BTC sort to say!  It seems to be pretty important to know who has what in crypto, judging by the severity of KYC laws, rules, and regulations.  What better way to get folks to associate their highly private keys to their names, then by their own greed.  
Truly remarkable!  The Jihan Wu saga is just a distraction buy very real as well.  While much of the hype was on Wu, no one was talking about the loss of anonymity through BCASH.

Yes;  One day we will be dealing in Satoshies.  When I started we where dealing in Bitcoins, now days I deal in MilliBitcoins.

The dollar 'USD' is the global exchange currency.  Many countries exchange btwn each other in USD.  The Americans are in debt so deep, that the idea of printing more money is not going to bring the quantitative easing anyways.  So, it's really a question of when, then if!!!  Bitcoin was introduced as a new world currency unit, that's moved much faster and easier, with less fees.
One day my young newbie, you will not be comparing satoshies to Dollars or Euros or any other currency.  A cup of coffee will be 150sats, your parking meter 920sats, etc.
Imagine what the world will feel when USD does collapse???  WOW... i'm thinking global civil war!  Make Venezuela look like a piece of cake!

Bitcoin is like a cruise ship at dock.  One sets a foot onboard while the other stays on firm ground.  This way, if the ship should sail, your in!  And, if it should sink, you don't drown in freezing cold waters, but only get one foot wet.  
By all means get some Bitcoin, as it grows, live life to the max with your regular Fiat.  Somehow, I'm pretty sure it'll be waiting for you!  
Just don't break your Fiat comfort zone.  Then relax, especially if you don't live in a third world country where Financial Institutions are ready to lend you what they call money today!

Yeah!  people who don't understand don't care.  There's nothing like a good run on the Bank, i mean an exchange, to keep those in perspective.  You probably can't get your funds off coinbase anyways, cause they are sold to investment firms like Fidelity, etc..  Who will in turn resell them at a profit.  We make money with other peoples money! Right!  Just let it happen!
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:04:57
For one, I don't care if an ETF comes to life or not.  If exchanges like Coinbase, Bittrex, QuadrigaCX are willing to sell peoples BTCs on the pretext that they HODL, fine by me.  This will bring the flow of institutional money, and increase the price of BTC.  Yes, Bitcoin will be worth much more in USD or whatever currency you measure it against.  If no ETF comes about, that's ok too.  Bitcoin will continue its adoption as financial situation around the world become unstable more and more.
One way or another. Bitcoin is the genie and it's out of the bottle, never to be put back in.  One day, at the whatever going road of evolution bitcoin will follow(ETF or not), we will cease to measure BTC against USD or any other kind of Fiat currency.  The outcome will be the same!

In any kind of monetary system, there are slaves and Masters.  You are so right, we have found a way to reduce useless Masters, really!  I think once all the coins are wide spread and actually used like currency, there won't be that many Masters, for every time a bitcoin transaction occurs and is split into a smaller satoshi denomination, a Master losses more of his power over the slave.
Your private keys, your bitcoins.  Where you are in control.  That is for sure, thus more power to you, less to those over you.  The less power a Master has over a slave the less Master he is.  The true benefit in this banking, is the unbanked.  Making a new market for a divers population that won't splurge in useless toys, but rationalize and cater to their needs.  Yes, Once fiat is taken out of the picture BTC will then become a currency 'very wisely' used, not thrown out like some useless toilette paper that one can print to infinity.  Nevertheless, these next few years should prove to be interesting.

Like I said it's a 'precursor' to a spike in price, the exchange does not want to loose everything $$$.  Since most exchanges are run by banks, they close up shop before a hike in price.  
The S curve will be responsible for the price hike all by itself, and no run on the exchange will change that.  The prudence of the exchange by pulling out of the business model, is just a sign of things to come.  
Institutional money is almost among bitcoin's adoption curve.  This massing flow into Bitcoin will make the price move so high, that exchanges prefer to pull out now.  Try to see it as a run on the exchange that is instated by the exchange and not its users.  Sow a doubt, via a bad news, and let the users panic sell.  It's ok, user who understand this, will withdraw.
The S curve is a sure shot, mass adoption is coming, i'm sure you can agree to this!  A closing exchange or not won't change adoption what so ever.  The 'Hegelian Dialect type' run on the exchange is a sign that it is for soon.  This is why I say "Bullish".  History of exchanges have done this already, however hard to link, when watching this pattern, we note.  Eventually, we can read the signs and say...  "WoooHooo, price hike on the way!"  This next hike may not be for just now, i'm thinking a few more major exchanges still have to "sort of close" still.  
Anyways, Only the S-curve will jack the price of Bitcoin.  It is no different to a Facebook or Google technology.  Timing markets is what investments is all about.  They ran an exchange, made a buck, now it's time to go, before they lose it all.  The only way to lose it all is to stay in business, when you started you exchange at 5000$ a coin and then you didn't see the S-curve coming and 'shit' now they are at 500,000 a coin.  You don't have the funds for users then!
Hope it's clearer... Enjoy!
