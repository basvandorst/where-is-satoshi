Well it's not just a case of using a HD wallet, if you don't have the wallet backed up that you imported the offline key into then you can still loose funds.
Once you import a key or sweep a key you must make sure to backup that new wallet since the change or sweep will use a key in that wallet and nothing will be left on the paper wallet.

Either use the main bitcoin core client and place the .dat file in the correct spot (~/.bitcoin/wallets) on linux, or open up an online wallet that supports importing (blockchain.info probably does), find the relevant page in settings and drag and drop your wallet file in. 
For safety its best to create a seed based wallet (such as electrum) and send your newly restored coins from the .dat file to the addresses of the new seed wallet. 
A seed wallet requires no backups besides you keeping hold of the 12 word seed on paper in your house somewhere.

Currently there is one bitcoin. If it splits there will be two, which will have all the same transactions up until the split but not after. If you have direct access to the private keys holding your funds you will be able to create transactions and decide which network to broadcast them to. If your funds are in an exchange then they decide which chain(s) to follow. 
Your funds are safe either way.
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:16:06
I also agree that on chain scaling provides piece of mind through its simplicity however the network just can't handle giant blocks yet.

@_date: 2017-07-31 01:20:35
The address function is one way. You put in your private key and the public key comes out but no one in the world can tell you what the private key is for a given public key.
If you happened to generate the same address as someone else you have just won the universal lottery and can spend those funds. It will never happen though.

Electrum is all about the seed.
If you generate a wallet offline, keep the seed safe, transfer the MPK to an online comp, delete the .electrum/wallet/default_wallet file off the tails usb and then restore from seed again on the offline comp checking that your addresses all match.
Once you are reasonably certain that those words can regenerate your exact wallet (ie you havent written them down wrong) then any funds sent to the online watch only MPK wallet will be spendable from the seed. 
If what I wrote doesn't make much sense to you then watch a few videos on how to do offline wallets with electrum. Go onto youtube and type cold storage with electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:44:26
After. You want to move the original bitcoins AFTER the new one is created, to a safe new seed.
This frees up the old seed to be imported into the cash client which will only have bitcoins on the cash chain because you previously moved the proper bitcoins.
If you move them before the cash fork is created then they will be in that moved location when the fork comes by.

They will be on both chains (since the chains are copies of each other) but when you pull the coins out of cold storage you will be able to spend them on the btc chain and the bcc chain if you like. Once they are both at different addresses on different chains it becomes less confusing to move them around.
If in cold storage you can transact on both chains *if you so desire*, if coins are in Kraken they decide.

He makes a very good point that until things are actually priced in bitcoins and stable at that, we will still always measure the value of the item by dollars hence making bitcoin more of a barter asset at the moment than a currency.
It is likely the best barter asset the world has ever seen mind you and is only deemed to not be a currency up until it's finished its price discovery phase and is stable.

Ignoring tx fees, with 12.5 btc generated on average every 10 minutes and assuming that the network is using ~90% of its earnings (11.25 btc) to generate those 12.5 then at 10k per coin that would be $112,500 per 10 minutes or $16.2 mln per day in costs which is $5.7 bln per year
