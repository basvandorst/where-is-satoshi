Timing a market is a fools errand. That said, I personally believe that when a shitload of people get in at X price, you  will see a drop as we hit 2X and they all think "damn, I just doubled my money, better get out now." So it's not about the actual numbers, it's about what the price is when the masses jump aboard. Which may be happening now.

And there are 24,000,000 half Bitcoins in circulation, and 48,000,000 quarter Bitcoins in circulation, etc, etc. They are divisible. The 21,000,000 Bitcoins argument is flawed. it's like arguing against paper currency because there are too few $100 bills in circulation.

Maybe China really wants to make Bitcoin a runaway success to reduce their reliance on the US Dollar? What if the Chinese govt put their supercomputing power into mining? What if the Chinese govt put millions of PCs to work as miners? Could China become the world's largest mining pool? What then for Bitcoin?

This is called taking profit out. This happens every day on Wall street. I believe China is already back up to 5700 now, 5 minutes later as people see an opportunity to buy back in.
