I post these things to show how pointless altcoins (like Litecoin, Shitcoin, etc.) are. This way maybe the media will stop saying "Bitcoin has now a competitor!". It has hundreds of competitors, and none at the same time.

@_date: 2014-01-03 02:28:36
Litecoin is waaaay weaker than Bitcoin, because it is a lot cheaper to perform an attack. But Litecoin bagholders will tell you it's better because it prevents the creation of ASICs and the centralization of hashing power. It doesn't, because scrypt is supposed to use a lot of memory, but they chose not to do that because they wanted to be able to run mining software on any PC. You can't have both. Besides, Satoshi predicted all this, so I will trust him.

It means that scrypt is not much better than sha256 in this respect. Especially since "they used it poorly", according to the creator of scrypt.
So again Litecoin is proven to be just a copycoin with no real improvements over Bitcoin.

Why on Earth would a government want to create its own Bitcoin clone (I assume that's what you mean by crypto) for local use? Bitcoin only makes sense at a global scale and with an insane amount of hashing power. And the point of having hashing power is to be able to decentralize the transaction validations to prevent double spend.

Bitcoin is disruptive, Litecoin/Megacoin/Junkcoin are just copycoins. Then there are other coins that at least add something new like Namecoin or Zerocoin, but I wouldn't call them disruptive. And finally there is Dogecoin, which at least is funny.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:44:59
It's just annoying to see people who actually believe copycoins have a future. I have even seen people who think they were onto something when they invested in Doge. They weren't joking, and they weren't talking like a dog.
Besides, we have already been accused of not tolerating other coins by Litecoiners, but they turned out to be the worst. They even created a post to make plan to attack the altcoins subforum in bitcointalk, because they didn't like seeing other coins there, they wanted everything to be about Litecoin.
Such hypocrisy, wow. xD

Actually it is very profitable, just not for nerds with gaming GPUs. Satoshi picked the hashing algorithm thinking about maximizing profit for miners, so that the network would become as strong as possible.

A paper backup is a seed that lets you recover your wallet (which might contain lots of private keys). You need a deterministic wallet for this to work: Electrum or Armory. A paper wallet is just a private key printed in a paper, which may or may not be encrypted with BIP38.

Welcome to the birth of an unregulated deflationary currency. Once you have waited 1 year you'll be up +1000%. As time goes by it will be more stable, less risky, and less rewarding.

My parents created me... Therefore they can destroy me? I doubt it.
If they had the mining power to disrupt the Bitcoin network (they don't. You know, those machines are not idle. They are already being used for more serious issues like you know... War?), we could change the algorithm to something else, or add proof of stake.
Besides this is pointless, because you can disrupt the Bitcoin network, but you can't kill an idea or a technology. You can't uninvent Bitcoin.

This is what you are saying:
- private key = paper backup / paper wallet
- seed = ???
This is how we have always called them:
- private key = paper wallet. You can use it right away, send money to it or import it and spend it, etc.
- seed = a paper backup of your entire deterministic wallet (you could also have a digital backup). You don't use it as a wallet, you just use it as a backup.

You forgot the part where Bitcoin is deflationary by design. Have you even read the white paper? You should also read the firsts posts from Satoshi and Haley Finn, where they speculate what the price of Bitcoin could end up being if it takes over the world.
The only things similar to Bitcoin in that respect have been precious metals. But precious metals have a lot of problems due to their physical nature. A currency with all the good parts of precious metals, and none of the bad parts is very interersting.
Thanks to Bitcoin, everyone will now be able to save the value they earned through hard work, as opposed to spending on things they don't really need, and indirectly fund wars and the contamination of the planet to support this unsustainable economic model.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:56:37

Everything about OP's post is wrong. He thinks stuff in China is more expensive,  he doesn't understand mining, he doesn't understand that a ban might actually have the opposite effect, etc. This is what Bitcoin was designed for: shitty governments. Short term it's understandable that the price goes down, because any bad news can have an effect in the weak hands, and not a lot of Bitcoiners actually understand what they are doing.
