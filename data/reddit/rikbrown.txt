Dumb question but what happens if the Ledger breaks? Or the screen showing my private key fails? I assume it's best practice to back up the private key/seed it shows you on a piece of paper/etc and hide that somewhere too?

In the UK I can send a bank to bank transfer nominally within seconds (essentially guaranteed if the recipient is the same bank), at worst within a couple of hours.  Stop circlejerking.

As long as it's difficult for me to buy BTC in my local currency without significant mark up over the USD price at the main exchanges I'm held back from truly using it for regular txns.

Ah yes, because the only use of existing fiat money in Thailand was child prostitutes, of course.

I bought a couple of BTC at ~$1k around that ATH at the end of 2013.  By mid-2014 it had dropped and I was like, "fuck it - buying a rug on overstock and using my BTC".  Spent most of them on a shitty rug. 
Luckily, turns out the rug WAS shitty, so I returned it, and they refunded me back in BTC.  I can now afford a much less shitty rug.  Just kidding though, I'm HODLing!

You do realise he's just saying the penalties in the football game seemed a little bit coin-flippish, as in they could go either way, right? Lol.
