What? Do you know what "remesas"( remittances) are? And their weight in Mexico's GDP? Take a look at those numbers.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:03:25
Hahaha! Alright dude, there is plenty of bitcoins you can buy, why do you take it personal?! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:57:24
You mean it will, cause right now is clearly not
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:00:57
We are all different. I'm still glad things look better (for now)
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:37:12
Then he is calling it a fraud just because he doesn't like it? The "reasons" he gave to call it a fraud are the reasons why we need bitcoin to exist.
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:20:21
And my $5k? :(
