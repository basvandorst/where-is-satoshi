Most likely scenario is for the next 50-100 years, fiat and crypto will co-exist. There's billions of people on this planet that still don't have internet, a smartphone, or a computer.

If you only have $2,920 in your bank account, a small percentage of 2% inflation isn't anything to you. 
The whole point of a 2% inflation rate is to incentivise the super wealthy to spend their money on investments. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:42:27
Not only that, but it incentivises the super wealthy to spend their money. 2% of $5,000 isn't anything. 2% of $5,000,000,000 is a lot.

The seed phrase is techinically the only thing you need to use bitcoin. The TREZOR is only there to help you transact securely. No bitcoin are actually stored on the TREZOR. Your seed phrase is, but it's inaccessible. 
All bitcoin are stored on the public blockchain. To access them, you need the private keys generated by your seed phrase.

The same attack vectors exist whether it's your private key for your bitcoin, or your bank account info displayed on your screen. If you have a virus, like a keylogger, or screen recorder, you're at risk. Chances are that you probably don't, but to be safe, people generate those private keys on a non-networked computer, or on a hardware wallet, like ledger or trezor.

Now you're just trolling. I've already explained that inflation doesn't cause wealth inequality, nor does it fix it. 
Wealth inequality is caused by many things, some political. It's not going to be easy to fix, and there are no simple solutions. 
Primarily, it's caused by a massive flaw in international law. Namely, that it is very easy to hide wealth overseas. Ever heard of the Panama Papers? Swiss bank accounts??? It's also caused by a flaw in our tax code. There are a lot of loopholes in the tax code. 
And... maybe that bribing politicians is perfectly legal...

Don't take advice from people on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:04:30
We print money at a calculated rate so that inflation is about 2% on purpose in order to incentivise the super rich to spend to stimulate the economy. That's a design element, not a flaw. 
That money might go to the banks, but it's literally worth less, so they effectively have the same value of money in their vaults. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:25:30

@_date: 2019-04-08 14:15:00
Wow, you quoted yourself.
It also seems that you don't actually understand how inflation works. You think that printing money leads to that money having the same value. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:14:49
Did you just ignore everything I wrote? No one's taking anyone's money... that's not how inflation works... 
The value of *everyone's* dollar goes down equally, in order to stimulate the economy. It incentivises people (especially the super rich) to spend their money, circulating money faster through the economy, and putting it into businesses (like stocks). 
As for trying to balance out wealth, that's a different issue that needs a different solution. Inflation is just to keep money moving through the economy, not balance it out. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 06:48:40
First of all, most Americans don't even have $5,000 in their bank. 
2% of $5,000 is $100, which means your money would be worth $4,900 after 1 year. That is not a lot of money at that wealth level. 
Secondly, inflation doesn't "go to the bankers". It goes nowhere. Your money simply has less worth. 
At high amounts, like $1,000,000 to $100,000,000, that 2% is $20,000 and $2,000,000, respectively. If I had that amount of money, I wouldn't let it sit in a savings account, losing value over time. I'd invest it. This stimulates the economy. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:53:47
Google is your friend.
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:04:49
Inflation isn't meant to fix the distribution of wealth, it is there to stimulate the economy, especially during recessions.

It will most certainly be faster. These sats will be at an altitude of 550 km. Speed of light to 550 km is 1.8 milliseconds, or 3.6 milliseconds latency. Add in a few milliseconds for processing time, and transmission through wire to your house from a ground station, you're looking realistically at 30-50 milliseconds. That's like 10 times less that what you're getting now.

Oil prices are supposed to be dropping in the near future.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:00:05
I had someone ask me when the price was about $17k. I told them that it is probably not a good investment at the time, and that we'll see a significant drop for the next year or two. He still went in at $18k and sold when it tanked to $6k. lel. They won't listen. Just pretend like you don't know. Bitcoin adoption needs to happen organically.

It likely doesn't matter to this guy. He's just going to get the standard deduction anyways...

That's why we use encryption.

You smile and nod.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:20:53
**Wrong math.**
These sattelites are going to be at 550 km, not 4000 km. Besides, transmitting photons through fiber wires cuts the speed of light by half. By transmitting signal to a sattelite, and relaying those packets to another sattelite before transmitting them to a local ground station, you can cut down transmission time significantly.


Yes, sattelites will relay packets to one another.

Still faster than undersea fiber cables. Australia gets 300 ping at best.

Gonna give you some real advice here, man. As soon as people start shilling btc in this sub, on TV, in the news, and it's at a relative all time high, it's probably time to sell part of your position. 
It'll crash, buy more on the dip, wait for about a few months for it to go back up. And you'll thank me.

As if they didn't sell off in Dec 2017, and bought more as it crashed.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:45:01
If you know it's going to drop 85%, why not sell like 90%? That makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:27:48
There will be ~1 million ground stations with phased ray antennas that communicate with the sattelites that you'll be wired to. It's download and upload.

I have much more faith in Elon than I do with just about any other business owner. He's shown time and time again that he does have morals, and that he has goals to improve humanity. If people don't see it that way, then that's up to them. There's a lot of propaganda out there.  I'm not saying I worship the guy or anything, he obviously has his faults like anyone else. I'm just saying that he's much different than any other corporate business owner.

Photons travelling through fiber cables slow down by half the speed of light. 
Current sattelite internet is based off GEO sats, which are at 35,786 km altitude, which is *very* far away. 
Starlink will hover at 550 km in low Earth Orbit, cutting latency by a factor of 10.
(35,786,000 m) / (299,792,458 m/s) = 119 milliseconds * 2 = **238 ping** from ground to sattelite
(550,000 m) / (299,792,458 m/s) = 1.8 milliseconds * 2 = **3.8 ping** ground to sattelite. 
Guess you didn't do your homework.

You have to learn that that was a hypothetical question.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:41:40
That depends on number of users per bandwidth. There's bandwidth specs.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:08:39
Oh yea, I'm sure you can overpower your fucking wafflechip raspberry pi to 50 MW to transmit over 500 miles.

No, it isn't. WiFi is a set defined band of frequencies. It's based off of IEEE 802.11 standards.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:39:57
Also, they can just look at the block explorer and see that your funds came suspiciously from one source, with another transaction of a large amount to a cold storage.

Yes, he was calculating for 4000 km altitude sattelites. Starlink will be at 550 km. It seems like he recently edited the comment.
