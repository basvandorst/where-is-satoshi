Any web browser and modern versions of outlook will not allow anything to run without your permission. I mean, it's not XP era anymore. As for Google searches... I mean they're ordered primarily by popularity. A virus ridden site will not be a top result. Plus, as stated earlier, adblock is pretty solid. As for the driver analogy, what can I say: the risk is not really there. You may think it is, but I've been antivirus free for years now and not a single issue yet. And really, if you do get a serious virus, you're just gonna have to wipe your drive and reinstall your OS anyway to be sure right? So why waste your money. Plus, a virus won't, ya know, kill you.
Honestly,  antiviruses are generally stupid because the people who actually do need them don't even update and renew them. They just hit the red X and ignore it. And even more so, it takes time for an antivirus company to get a hold of a new virus. And then, they have to figure out how to best remove it, then release an update, then all the subscribers have to download that update. Shit by then it's been 2 weeks. The damage is already done. It all seems like a fear based monetization to me, like lifelock or something.
Conclusion, try actually not having an antivirus. You might find you're system to be running better without it and still not having any viruses.

What can I say, it's a good antivirus. Still wouldn't leave it running all the time. Takes up resources. I think you're a bit bent out of shape here. If you wanna use and condone them, fine. All I'm saying is that in my experience, they're a waste of money.

So you're saying they don't even work, anyway. I rest my case. Guess you'd just have to rely on smart browsing whether or not you have it, right?

I have not had an antivirus for years. It's really pointless. Smart browsing will win every time.

MSE is shit and I hate that Reddit raves it so much. I don't even know why anyone ever thought it was good in the first place. I can't name a single time I've ever heard anybody, not a single person, say it detected one virus. It doesn't even remove Lenovo's spyware properly. The only reason it still gets mentioned is because people keep mentioning it. Please do your research. You'll find that it's about as effective as no antivirus at all.

Yes, I used ESET back where I used to work. It's fucking incredible. Nothing got past it. Thanks for the reminder.
