Finally a voice of reason. Speculative trading is the primary usecase of bitcoin. 
Hodlers? What price will you capitulate?
Or are you 100% convinced in in your religion? And willing to be bag hodlers in the end.

But do decentralized exchanges work????

Exchanges are required to flag bad addresses to some arbitrary depth.

I’m not sure you can call them a thief if you send someone money on accident.

Ok bus people... pile in. Now is a great time to buy your first crypto. Because you saw an ad on a bus. 
Not sure if retail bus people have the money for speculation when most of them barely can make ends meet.

Coinbase hosted and sucked up to a retired Goldman banker from the 2008 crisis. Brian A. said we can learn a lot from you... 
Where is the outrage from the crypto community?
Oh wait it’s because everyone is making bank from trading at coinbase.
That is very telling where the sentiment is, greed, who is principled and who is out to just get rich. 
S.N. Is rolling in his grave.

Call up CNBC. They love stories like this.
Or just tell people you take bitcoin on your website.
It is obvious to the world from your comment and question that you are only accepting bitcoin because you think it is some competive advantage where you can get attention and thus more bussiness.
You don’t understand bitcoin. 
No one wants to buy stuff in bitcoin, at least not small ticket items, like under maybe the price of a car. 
It’s too volatile. It triggers a tax event. 
Are you going to price goods in dollars or bitcoin? 
You could lose all your profit margin.
My advice would be .... just don’t.
Any perceived value from this announcement will be squashed as soon as you see no one using it to pay for products and or you catching a failing knife when the price moves against you before you can exchange the bitcoin for dollars.
This is assuming you are running a businesss with bills to pay and such where you know you can’t just not sell the bitcoin. 
Or maybe you have a third part service that collects converts for you and insured losses? Maybe that exists????

How does this not kill bitcoin’s grade on privacy??? Why do people think they are safe from government with bitcoin?

By not knowing who he was he can be seen more God like. And religion is powerful!

Trying to mine on a pc is like trying to win the lottery.
Everyone is playing the same game, but mining co’s have way more computational power to crank out guesses faster than you, so you are significantly diasvantaged. 
You might be interested in reading about mining pools.
Mining is way more centralized than you think.
If you want bitcoin without paying for it...
Remember that you can always exchange your labor for bitcoin. Or
you can buy some fraction of a bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is an arbitrary unit that has no real world grounding except in the fiat dollars it is priced in. You can buy one one millionth of a bitcoin if you wanted.

I get where you are coming from. Reversing transactions is a nice feature of a bank. Or if someone steals my card info and uses it half way around the world they put it back no questions asked. 
More control equates to more responsibility.

The btc drop gold campaign has been heating up. They must feel increasingly threatened by gold so they bash it continuously to make themselves feel better. Many dont realize or have forgotten bitcoin was supposed to incorporate all of gold,s properties. 
Also, just because the price has gone up more in a certain time period does not change fundamentals, principles. 
That argument doesn’t mean anything to someone who holds gold and understands why.

This is part of the fungibility problem with bitcoin. Not every unit of bitcoin is the same as an other unit of bitcoin.

Bitcoin and my butthole. What does it all mean?
