So what you're saying is that even if my browser was actively compromised and I was in my blockchain wallet, there is no way that an attacker could steal my coins because he was never sent the encrypted data? How can you be sure that, being as how the browser has been compromised, the attacker isn't sent a copy of the decrypted data (or even still encrypted, wouldn't matter as the password is compromised)?

You don't have to be mugged. People have lost coins even using 2fa. An attack can exploit the active session in your browser. 
The idea I have is that if I was ever compromised in such a way that the attacker could exploit my own active session, it looks like they could bleed my blockchain account dry with a few clicks. With Gox, even if my active session is compromised, my security settings can't be changed and my funds can't be transferred unless the person had continued physical access to my phone.

So, again going back to the case of the browser being actively compromised, what's to stop someone from sending the wallet data (encrypted or unecrypted) to another location and using the known password to decrypt it?

That doesn't make sense to me. Are you saying that I can't access my blockchain wallet from my friend's machine that has never seen the wallet.dat?
If you mean the organization behind Blockchain.info doesn't have direct access to the information within the wallet.dat, I could understand that. But if someone could exploit my browser *while I was in session*, I mean the way it looks now is you put in an amount, an address, and hit send. No email confirm, no Authenticator necessary. It just makes me uneasy.
