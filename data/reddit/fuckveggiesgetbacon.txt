The price did not shift much at all during the transfer but had it dropped we’d still be ahead.

I’m curious to know if it’s in the works.  Gotta figure getting added to the coin base app will cause a frenzy.  
Any thing have anything more to add?

Basically think of it like this...
There’s a row of pawn shops in a plaza.  They all buy and sell the same things, in this case bitcoin.  But they all buy and sell for different rates.
Walk in to one shop, buy a bit coin for 15k and walk out.  Walk in next door and they buy the coin for 16k.  Repeat.
People do it in retail all the time, it’s called retail arbitrage.  I️ have a friend who drives around hitting all the big box store clearance racks checking prices &amp; sales rank on Amazon.  Basically if he can find these items within a certain margin below amazon cost and they are above a certain sales rank (he wants quick moving items), he buys everything available.  You take this same method and apply it to bitcoin.  
My understanding is in the stock market, sophisticated software has algorithms to prevent the possibility of large arbitrage from occurring.  
Someone must be making a fortune.  This seems like a no brainer?  Obviously you’re subject to the market tanking, but you’re in the same position hodling, but missing gains.  I️ suppose you could miss a rally, but say you just used a “side fund” for your arbitrage and just add your gains to your “hodl stash”?  I️ can only see the exchanges limiting your transaction volume as a possible limiting factor.
Someone tell me I’m an idiot and missing something?
I’m gonna do it again today and prove myself right.
In the meantime fuck wallstreet, RALLY!!!
