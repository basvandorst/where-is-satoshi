I started offering bitcoin as an option to purchase my software about 2 months ago. I also sell worldwide and offer a discount for bitcoin. No one has taken up the offer yet so I would think twice about insisting on bc.

This article is a bit over the top. The headline isn't correct as there are no 'new' laws regarding bitcoin. The tax office is merely confirming that under existing laws bitcoin cannot be considered money and as it doesn't fall under the limited list of exemptions, it is subject to GST ( basically VAT ) when purchased.
Although I haven't bought any BTC since the ruling, apparently it is still possible to purchase without paying GST by going through an exchange rather than say, CoinJar, who were a buyer and seller of bitcoins.
There is also an exemption for small scale businesses ( up to $75,000 turnover ) so LocalBitcoins is probably still OK.
Still sucks though.

I for one welcome these attacks. Bitcoin needs to be able to survive anything thrown at it to prove its worth, otherwise it's pretty useless as a world currency. This is just the beginning. I say bring it on.

I've been to 30 or 40 countries and they all took credit cards. And the people who travel, i.e. end up in airports, tend not to be like most of the world either.

Who carries cash/USD/cashier check/amex traveler check/gold bar when they travel? I haven't used travellers checks for 20 years or more. Most people use credit/debit cards - even in out of the way places. The buy/sell spread at bit coin atms is much worse than any credit card charge/exchange fee.

Actually it is 60 years without penalty and 55+ with some penalty.
After 60 it's tax free withdrawals and if you're smart you can pay max 15% tax on substantial incomes up to age 65 merely by putting money in your super fund and withdrawing it again (tax free).

There is an old saying " Never let a good deed go unpunished". I would strongly advise the OP not to help the guy beyond the absolute basics. If the price goes up his friend will likely credit his good fortune on his own cleverness but if it goes down or he gets hacked, the OP will get blamed. It's just human nature. If his friend is really interested in buying BTC then he really needs to figure it out himself

My guess is that many websites like this have a monthly recurring credit card charge. They also tend to make it difficult to cancel, insist on 1 months notice etc. so they make so more money even when you quit. Bitcoin wouldn't let them do this.

For what it's worth, I sell software that I've developed through my own website. I have offered a discount for bitcoin for over a year now and have had zero takers.

Me too. Great book. How any bitcoiner could disagree with the above quote I don't know - and the book is full of stuff like that.

What I'd like to know is how many people actually end up having to go the chargeback route rather than just asking the merchant for a refund. I've owned credit cards for 40 years and never had to do a chargeback. I *have* asked for refunds occasionally because the goods were unsuitable and never had a problem. It seems like a big deal is made of the ability to chargeback but is it really that useful?

The thing is, the cashier will learn how to use the card reader by mid morning because they'll have to use it  dozens of times per day. That is probably not the case with bitcoin. Why else would the tablet need recharging? Because it gets used once a week/month/year. By the time a real bitcoin customer comes in they will probably have forgotten any training they had on how to use it as well.

I agree. Pushing bitcoin acceptance onto businesses that aren't ready for it is NOT helping. In fact I'd say it hurts more than helps. Growth really needs to be organic at the moment, where the business owner is sympathetic to the bitcoin 'idea' and is willing to go the extra to help it gain traction. Later on, mainstream businesses will read about it in a trade magazine and then maybe get involved.

I really wish people would stop pestering businesses to accept bitcoin. The vast majority of them are not remotely ready for it and the experience ( slight hassle and few customers ) will likely put most of them off, leading to a very public perception that bitcoin is not successful. The only businesses that should be accepting it for quite a while yet is where the owner is committed to the bitcoin idea long term and is prepared for the inevitable bumpy ride while it gets established.

For someone who is 'the financial voice for Baby Boomers and their offspring' she is pretty lackadaisical with her figures. She claims there are 171 million tons of gold in the world. The real figure is more like 1000 times less than this or 171 thousand tons.

Don't do it. Pestering people, even your father, to implement something that in most cases will not help their business (yet) will only damage your relationship with that person. If bitcoin is successful he'll find out about it soon enough.

This could never work and anything based on something like this would be way more similar to regular currencies than bitcoin. Bitcoin is designed to be trustless. In your proposed system, who gets to decide what is in the basket of goods used to determine the value of the currency? What happens after 50 years when half the items in your basket are no longer worth anything or even produced?
More importantly, even assuming you can mathematically generate a basket of goods, where does the info for this basket come from and how does it get into the system - any 'outside' info is a point of weakness and liable to be hacked or manipulated.
The whole idea of bitcoin is that it is self referential. 1 Bitcoin is always worth just that and even miners get paid in bitcoin. This is also why trying to separate the blockchain from bitcoin displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how it all works.

I seriously doubt if keeping your assets in bitcoin would make any difference. Far better to create a trust with you as the named beneficiary. You could then keep your assets in the trust and be immune from this sort of thing. Best to do it before you get hitched and be quite open about it ( if not the reason - just say it is protection from being sued.)
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:11:07
Yep. So create a trust - before you meet anyone. Prenups have often been shown to be completely useless and almost guaranteed to make the other party wonder what’s up. A trust on the other hand is usually bullet proof and can be framed as protection against creditors and such - nothing to do with the marriage. It’s also a great way of passing wealth down the generations and keeping it within the family. They don’t have to be expensive ( $200 ) but do require a small amount of paper work every year. Tax implications also vary a lot so you need to do your homework.

Depends TOTALLY where you live. In some jurisdictions you don't even have to be married to have your assets divided up after a split. In Australia 2 years living together = legally married.

Yeah, I killed a massive one the other week. Easily had a 1cm body.

Prenups can be useless. Create a trust with you as named beneficiary.
