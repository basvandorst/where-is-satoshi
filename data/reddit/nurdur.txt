What next? At $15k USD per BTC, what car do you buy with 1 BTC? At $25k? Let's see your picks! I'd love to see a whole chart, right up to Roadster/Lambo levels...

So, transaction fees are such a huge problem that they were willing to support 2X, but they haven't even begun work on implementing Segwit. They did know it was *Segwit* 2X, right? And that it would have already launched... Was it the plan all along to 'opt out' of the Segwit part of Segwit 2X?

Seriously, where's the QR code? I would have donated.

Love it!
Please consider a "Don't Gox me, bro!" version.

Transaction malleability strangled my puppy.

Thanks, never heard of My Drunk Kitchen before. Just watched three and loved every one. +1 new subscriber.

I would love to see what comes out of putting these two together in a room. World Peace? The end of the world as we know it?
I'd love it if Joe brought Andreas on. Would be one hell of a JRE episode.

Andreas should bring a few paper wallets and actually show how they work. Personally, I listen to the audio-only podcasts, but Joe has TONS of live viewers...
Maybe hold up a 10 mBTC private key to the camera as a sort of impromptu live contest...

Bye bye Apple. It's been fun but you are not the Apple I fell in love with in my youth.

Bought 4 shirts, including I Accept Bitcoin.
I'll admit I bought my little bit of bitcoin to hold onto, but somehow I keep finding cool stuff to buy with it.
It's not a problem though, Coinbase always seems to have more bitcoin for sale. Every time I spend some BTC, I buy back a little more than I spent.

Shep totally cracked me up at the end there... The last 5 seconds were beautiful!

I love the image at the top of this article. 10 million times better than another pile of gold coins with B's on them! Well done.

Awww. I feel all warm and fuzzy now.

With most of these "Bitcoin is doomed" posts, look at a picture of the author before reading on! This one helpfully presents such an image right at the top of the post.
If the article or opinion is that of an elderly person, at least consider the possibility that the author doesn't really understand bitcoin. Also consider that the author is likely heavily invested in other monetary systems and/or commodities, and so has reasons to be afraid of bitcoin's success. 
Here we have another example of someone who clearly wants bitcoin to fail, doesn't understand it very well, but does understand it enough to see it as a threat. 
Next time, look at the picture first and then guess what that person will have to say...

Impressive coverage. I'm truly impressed- not used to seeing much Bitcoin coverage worth watching on TV...
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:27:18
Yeah, I too got a laugh at what this out-of-touch dipshit had to say...
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:42:20
Great article. I really appreciate the time taken by the author to examine many of the potential implications of the development of distributed consensus technologies. We've heard a lot of these ideas mentioned in various places over the past few years, but here they are gathered into a thorough, well-written article that I can refer people to when they ask me why I'm so enthusiastic about bitcoin.

Great site, btw. Just placed my first order.

Coinbase will let you buy $15 of BTC just fine, but with a $1.49 fee.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:50:40
Great post. Spot on!

Check [meetup.com]( for a local bitcoin meetup. It'd be a good way to meet people, learn more, and get involved in the local crypto scene. You'll probably also find someone willing to sell you small amounts of BTC for cash.
Standard disclaimer: Before you buy, spend some time learning about how you'll secure your Bitcoin.
