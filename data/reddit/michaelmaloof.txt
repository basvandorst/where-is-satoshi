I saw they increased fees by 24%, I didn’t realize it dropped 35%. That sucks :/ I take back my comment haha. 
Edit: I’d still ride it out haha

As a currency, Bitcoin is seeing unprecedented gains in value so it’s really unwise to spend bitcoin with a market so volatile. Let it settle in and then spend :)

Why are posts like this getting upvotes?

I’m in Rio de Janeiro right now. I lived in Brazil for a year once and visit every so often.
I have 100 dollars in my wallet. They won’t accept it at the pizzeria, since they only accept Reals. If I tried to buy a house using US dollars here, I couldn’t. If I tried to transfer money from the US to Brazil without fees I couldn’t do it. If I owe taxes to the Brazilian government I can’t pay in US dollars. Brazil rarely accepts AMEX, my other credit cards rail me for spending internationally, and the nearest place to convert my dollars to Reals is 40 minutes away.

I buy other currencies with US dollars, for example Pounds, Euros, Reals. Also you can buy bitcoins with different currencies, including currencies worth more than the US dollar. I think you’re really confused on how currencies in general and bitcoin work. 
Id recommend doing some research before coming into a ten year old subreddit that has 500k subscribers and trying to troll them with your cliche user name, 90 days of Reddit experience, and very primal knowledge of cryptocurrencies.

Haha I don’t mean to belittle the amount you have. I’m just tired of seeing everyone ask the same question. It’s hard for me to care about your money when you yourself didn’t do the five seconds of searching it would have taken to see everyone asked this question today. It’s not personal. I hope your 50 skyrockets to a million :) best of luck!

I just don’t go screaming on the internet every time there is new tech that I don’t like or understand . Use my time to improve myself instead, which usually leads to a better financial situation. You seem like a smart and well read guy. I’d recommend doing the same. Best of luck with your battle against a currency you don’t even own :)

I’m by no means an expert. But I’m going to go out on a limb and say I’ve made more investing in bitcoin in a year than you have the last 10 ;)

Massive lol. It’s like a 6% drop after a massive 44% gain. This is normal. Learn how to invest before blowing money on stuff :) 
Some advice, if you’re new to investing don’t bother investing in something and checking it’s day to day price. Check in once a month but you need a longer term mentality. Best of luck :)

That’s my point. The dollar only really works as you’re describing inside of the US. Bitcoin will be globally accepted and already has a ton of value for people in countries outside of the US trying to purchase things outside of their country.  To say a currency with that advantage, and many more, is worth 0 dollars is idiotic. I’m not doubting bitcoin may be overvalued, but to say it has 0 value is being a troll.

This question has been asked a million times on Reddit and everywhere else. Literally google or research for five seconds before asking people what to do with your .00000001 bitcoin (I just hammered a bunch of 0s lol)

You can buy US dollars with a bitcoin. 15,000 of them. Pretty nifty

You realize most of us hedged our bets right? I read comments all the time about guys selling to make back their initial investment. Hell, half the post I see in here are people who bought the coin at like 100 dollars and have made 100x their initial investment and cashed out a good portion long ago. You’re not helping anyone coming in here and calling us clowns. Call us rich, call us lucky, call us overly optimistic, call us haters of the current financial industry/system. But last time I checked, no clown doubled their portfolio in 3 days, cashed out, and bought a house and car with bitcoin still left to spare and invest. This is cool. People made some money. Let them enjoy it.

You didn’t come off as cocky. The OP is trying to say bitcoin, which is an accepted form of payment in may locations and stores, is worth 0 dollars. Is it a bit overvalued right now since a lot of people are buying it as a “stock” more than a currency they plan on spending, sure. But to say a bitcoin is worth 0 dollars when it’s been in the market, and highly used, for 10 years is absurd. You sounded fine :)

Haha I deserve that. I just wanted to get a feel from the community before requesting it to a mod. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:20:59
I’m guessing you aren’t spending over 10k in those countries. If you were, you’d know the pain. Come talk to me when you’re ready to have an open mind ;)
