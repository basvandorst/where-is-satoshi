Discretionary spending would be held back for a time, but non-discretionary spending.. well that wouldnt change.
The example below of computing is a good one, people buy computers but they know they'll be cheaper next month.. why?
A deflationary economy is bad for borrowers, such as large governments and corporations that rely on borrowed money to leverage large profits, its a good thing for the remaining 95% of society because it provides and incentive to save, a chance for effective retirement and a chance at an increasing standard of living over time.
Deflation is grossly overhyped, it's impact on the 1% is way worse than the 99%.

Because Australian and British governments are smarter than the American ones, they charge tax on the purchase, netting a larger haul, but then can't tax the winnings (already been taxes at purchase)

Bitcoin cannot achieve satoshi's goals if it is too volatile, much better that it settles in to a steady gentle deflationary slope. My mined bitcoin are long gone and I hope to return when I can safely put my paycheck in to bitcoin and not have its value swing 20% each way before the next one arrives.
And for the HODL crowd, youre part of the problem, not the solution.. its supposed to be a currency, the more its traded, the more successful it becomes

Bitcoin was designed to work best when it's stable, its heading that way, but until the speculators are moving out and the transactional users move in, it'll never achieve what its creator hoped it would

My block was mined at about $1 a coin, Sold my last when it hit $1000, tinge of regret, but I'm out of bitcoin until its stable and prices of goods aren't pegged to the dollar.
when that happens, bitcoin will have achieved its creators objectives.

The concept of the block chain needs miners, nothing says those miners need to be external third parties.  The concept of the blockchain is interesting to businesses because its decentralized and to a large degree self maintaining.
A company could use the blockchain for encrypted messaging, resilient data distribution or any one of a dozen other reasons that are nothing to do with currency.
none of this needs or relies on the bitcoin currency in any way.

No, because it isnt.
Thats like asking if Dogecoin needs bitcoin to function.

The liquidity trap only applies to that part of the population that is able to earn enough to have significant savings and only applies to items that are deferrable.
The US employee's purchasing power has declined significantly in the last 60 years and a large percentage of their budget is now non-discretionary, therefore the liquidity trap does not occur
For that percentage of the population that CAN defer payments and benefit from deflation, government policy can be put in place to encourage spending in the current year by introducing deferred taxes.
In other words, deflation is not necessarily a bad thing.. and is far better than hyper-inflation which has caused at least one global conflict and the collapse of many more nations than deflation ever could.

World war II was a direct result of the burdensome war debt payments from WW1 and the rapid inflation that it caused.

All a VP means in a bank is that you are an "authorised officer" able to communicate with outside entities on behalf of the bank.. Everyone and his mother is a VP.. infact senior technical staff are often SVPs.. its not until you get to Managing Director that you have any real clout in a bank

"The harsh reparation payments imposed on Germany led the mark to depreciate against foreign currencies. Also, the new democratic socialist leaders had promised the people all types of bounties--increased wages, reduced hours, an expanded educational system, and new social benefits. But all this meant a vastly increased demand on a limited production capacity."
"President Woodrow Wilson's lenient Fourteen Points, the treaty caused resentment and a deep mistrust of their new government, the Weimar Republic. The need to pay war reparations, coupled with the instability of the government, contributed to massive hyperinflation which crippled the German economy. This situation was made worse by the onset of the Great Depression."
"Up to 1923, the Nazi Party was small and noisy. Its importance was mainly in the Munich area of Bavaria. Money, or lack of it, was always a problem. The 1923 hyperinflation crisis proved to be an opportunity too good to miss for the now party leader - Hitler."
Need I go on.. google has many hundreds more

Your last paragraph is a bit disingenuous.  Credit unions are covered by something practically identical to FDIC, the NCUA.
