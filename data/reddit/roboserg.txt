please die
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:31:23
I wait till they fall more, being a stupid troll is sad
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:45:06
calling names, shows your IQ and education. Stupid kid.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:50:55
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:21:58
too much ad hominem = low IQ, no education = retarded. Get lost
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:47:30
Are you a racist factory worker without education? That would explain a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:51:06
Price always fell after the pump - [pic]( It happens for any stock / crypto / whatever
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:45:15
It always pulls back, always. People take profits from highs, [always]( [Daily chart](
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:42:44
yep, was buying for the long term till the next ATH, then sell.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:22:20
revolt? Of the 0.00000001% of the population who uses it? lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:22:49
well if you are a day trader it makes sense. If you plan to hold for month - I dont get it. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:47:47
I can only speak for myself. I dont think buying at all time high is a good idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:14:12
HODLers? The ones who didnt sell at 20k and now sitting with 4x less value? lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:42:22
True, but if billions of people will start using BTC, it will rise
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:12:34
Compare how many people have access to the internet and a cell phone. If blockchain will become mainstream paypal will look tiny in comparison.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:55:41
Beware! This website is known to ruin your mood!
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:02:27
If you look at weekly candles, it always drops. Any trader will you tell that

beggars 2.0
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:23:21
there is a thing called "limit buy order" hope it helps
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:39:43
So you want Intel or Nvidia to invest billions of $ to research only for China to copy it for free? You must be good at logic.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:31:21
Your every reply is an ad hominem attack trying to insult me. Guess who is ridiculous? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:55:45
If you believe in BTC you buy when it crashes, like [here]( If you want perfect timing you become a trader. If you want hardcore, you do daily trading etc. Its not for me though, so I wait for a good dip, like the 2000 dip that I slept over like a fool.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:21:02
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:25:50
And plenty of other people sell at highs.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:55:32
Sorry then, but lately there is a huge anti science push from morons coupled with moon lading deniers etc. Huge amount of people biting into it
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:34:32
Buying almost at all high time is not very wise. Its started to crash today. Just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:59:40
it was a baby dip, bull trap. The real dip is coming
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:23:21
there is a thing called "limit buy order" hope it helps
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:13:00
bitstamp or GDAX
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:55:18
why would anyone buy at ATH ? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:53:32
Hmm, isnt it risky doing leverage if the price tanks like 50% ? I thought more of buying normally and get BTC to your trading wallet and HOLD if you make a mistake
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:14:43
Why in the world would you sell? It will rise more
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:31:25
trading is not luck
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:42:40
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:38:18
Troll. How is playing games has anything to do with Bitcoin and your argument? Are you saying all people playing games are idiots? I think you have to grow up and educate yourself. You cant even defend your point about bitcoin. So guess who the idiot is?
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:20:31
Its only 300$ pullback, I am waiting for a massive crash. All coins are inflated agian.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:36:10
Technical analysis works in every market.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:34:18
sells at the bottom (where I was buying), says its "luck based". He probably bought BTC at ATH @ 4950
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:38:26
Wait, what cancers are contagious?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:30:54
Ok, here is my situation. I bought some BTC at 3700, 3500 and today at 3000. Now its 3500. I cant get my head around it, should I sell the amount of BTC I bought at 3000? Because in the long run I will wait for 4000+ mark some month down the line to sell the rest. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:28:31
You must have very low IQ. You keep using ad hominem attacks. You didnt even bother to google what that means. Again, low IQ and low education. I would be ashamed to be so stupid like you are.
I have B.Eng. in computer engineering and M.Sc. in robotics. So what have games anything to do with bitcoin again?
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:13:21
When? I dont have my crystal ball to tell you the future. We have a 400$ dip right now...
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:40:36
I think it will pull back, just look at this weekly [graph](
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:14:43
Why in the world would you sell? It will rise more
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:14:49
[Here]( is your dip
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:14:10
And I thought it was going to crash to 1500-1600 and next day it went to the moon and I missed it :( All I wanted in life is to have 1 BTC :P
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:38:42
Bitcoin may cost 0$ in 10 years. No one knows...
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:53:01
You should have sold at least 50%-70% at 20k since it was clear we are not going higher.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:55:25
1. I didn't promise anything
2. I didn't say the dip would be today, or tomorrow or any specific date at all
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:27:51
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:59:25
In Germany you can cash out after a year for any foreign currency and would not need to tax it. And cryptos count as foreign currency here
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:57:54
of course you can buy things with BTC. Many stores accept it
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:51:46
Bitcoin is anonymous but transparent. Do more research
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:21:20


It is anonymous, but transparent. Do more research on what "transparent means". 


nice argument, what are you, 13 years old a baby boomer accident without education?


its not dead, its on pause, your brain is dead though
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:55:18
why would anyone buy at ATH ? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:36:03
I will not waste my time proving something to you. Go ahead and buy at all time high. It will be very smart move
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:40:12
Price always pulls back after sudden exponential increases
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:32:02
Bash? I think you imagine things
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:40:00
So whats wrong with billions?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:17:43
I never said you should panic sell. Why do you put words into my mouth that I never said?
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:48:26
25% fees, that be cool to watch
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:41:45
not sure if joke or ...
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:06:30
who said bitcoin will never go to 0$ ? Can you see the future?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:59:39
and you didnt take a screenshot to share?
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:47:25
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:47:54
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:03:44
Its literally me. But we had a pullback recently, with BTC costing 1900 USD before 1. Aug. It will drop again.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:20:21
As you know it already rose like +700$. I called it, because the price was too low, as always people overreacted, panic sold, and the market was oversold. [RSI index confirms oversold market.]( 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:17:43
I never said you should panic sell. Why do you put words into my mouth that I never said?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:06:30

@_date: 2017-09-02 17:17:19
altcoins always follow BTC
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:58:32


Wrong. Bitcoin or any crypto can go to 0$. You never know what will happen. There might be bitcoin2000 that kills all other crypto. Or all countries ban crypto etc.
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:39:25
my statement about bitcoin being anonymous but *TRANSPARENT* is still correct. I am yet to see a point where its not the case.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:31:01
You are a fucking trolling retard. Please KYS and stop replying with garbage and toxic comments. Ban this troll already
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:42:44
yep, was buying for the long term till the next ATH, then sell.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:45:06
scam? You are a moron
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:43:42
there are lots of telegram channels
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:46:10
It could have been 0 today, so all good.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:59:27
Do you know the total population of Earth?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:17:30
calling LTC, ETH and other top alts a shitcoin is beyond ignorant and stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:25:39
fake moon landing? Call the doctors, we have another one!
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:44:18
Why pay them fees? Use their GDAX exchange with 0% fees
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:46:15
trading is always better then HODL if you do it right
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:18:14
Oh, a fascists then
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:45:05
so what? We make money during it. Bubbles are good for technology
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:58:23
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:31:36
need 1920*1080 wallpaper NOW!
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:36:00
Well why not run a SQL database then ? Blockchain is slower.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:24:29
Of course you are the prick. You stated a wrong information and said "Do more research". I hate such ignorant kids.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:15:16
do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:54:50
good startups have a working prototype.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:32:16
Germany treats crypto as foreign currency, so we are ok here.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:23:02
Exactly my thoughts. Nothing grows long exponentially. People would want to the the 2x profits and exit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:57:39
you would have sold at 2x, 5x max
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:43:42
there are lots of telegram channels
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:15:16
do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:35:30
less risky then hodl 
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:33:44
Technical analysis + fundamental analysis, still risky, but has lower chance of failure compared to hodling. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:35:03
It is always the same. Dumb people buying at all time highs, price drops, they come here to cry
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:58:01
because you can sell for paypal. Dont get scammed 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:30:56
True, but TA still works because other  people are using it. You know nothing John Snow. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:43:52
you are an idiot and you know that. BTC is 5300 now. 
YOU DONT LOOSE MONEY IF YOU DONT **SELL**
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:06:33
interesting, its you are who is a troll. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:22:50
Did you read your own article? It says:


That's EXACTLY what I said, its anonymous but transparent. If you dont understand the meaning of "transparent" use google and don't spread misinformation.


Whats wrong with playing it? Are you dumb?
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:19:35
^ this. 0% fees if limit buy on GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:46:39
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:13:00
bitstamp or GDAX
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:13:08
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:02:19
what is?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:08
Woke up. Saw 3000 from 3500 yesterday. Amazed. Bought for 200$. Went to eat to the university. Come back. Price is 3400. Such wow.
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:11:09
if you post a news on reddit you could might as well post a link to it, since you already have the link. Otherwise whats the point on posting here?
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:11:22
Not for digital assets. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:45:17
nice argument.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:51:32
You need a bank account for paypal. For blockchain you dont. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:23:10
it is anonymous but **TRANSPARENT** I think you dont understand what transparent means. Its not a game of semantics, its your failure to understand the meaning of the word. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:44:31
what? Go to any exchange and watch thousands of buys
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:29:46
Funny, that its YOU who are behaving like a manchild, using ad hominem attacks and cant support their own position. What psychiatric condition is it again?
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:58:30
What a childish troll. You are the manchild, who is using ad hominem attacks. You cant defend your position, you are a troll or a stupid person.
And what does my YT channel has anything to do with Bitcoin? My YT channel has ~ 400k views per month, its fine, thanks. And I am not from Russia. Like it has anything to do with bitcoin.
And again, if you dont understand the meaning of "transparent" in regards to bitcoin - please go to school, since your education level is lacking.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:08
Woke up. Saw 3000 from 3500 yesterday. Amazed. Bought for 200$. Went to eat to the university. Come back. Price is 3400. Such wow.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:43:55


Apple, Google etc have more money then many governments in the world.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:50:11
Many things are rare, doesnt mean they cost anything. Example - shit of my cat is pretty rare, as other cars shit is different.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:41:24
You cant make a wrong call, if you dont sell and just HODL. In other words you trade as usual, but when you make a mistake you HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:27:51
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:09:55
When people dont use arguments = obvious troll
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:38:33
please grow up. Lets talk in 10 years. You are clearly a trolling kiddo
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:36:00
it still doesnt explain the sudden surge of 500+ USD
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:45:34
in Zimbabwe it was over 60000 trillions for years lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:38:08
basic support and resistance + big whole round numbers work. Every other mumbo jumbo might not (Fibbo, Elliot waves etc)
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:40:07
Right now 3583 seems like a [resistance level.]( If it will get broken BTC might retest 3k again. I would buy @ 3k again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:30:54
Ok, here is my situation. I bought some BTC at 3700, 3500 and today at 3000. Now its 3500. I cant get my head around it, should I sell the amount of BTC I bought at 3000? Because in the long run I will wait for 4000+ mark some month down the line to sell the rest. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:59:03
oh, a kid troll. I am out of here.
