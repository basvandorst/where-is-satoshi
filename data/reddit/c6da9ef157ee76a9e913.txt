Because it's that time of the year again to scrub all the old accounts and start a new year with new subreddits. Given the rise of crypto I decided to make 'this' account the crypto one (among other things).
Back in 2014 it was all Doge and BTC and they both coexisted without any contention between them. I swing back into seeing what Crypto has done in the last 4 years and people legitimately argue over this stuff.
And it's not just BTC/BCH but people get into contentious heated arguments over one random coin over another.
I mean. I get it I was a twenty something once. I participated in way more Mac (OS 8-9) vs Windows (95-XP) arguments than I'm proud of. But looking back it really didn't matter as much as I think it did. In 10, 15, 20 years the crypto market is going to do what it is going to do on technical merits. Reddit slap fights over the "true" Bitcoin will probably not be a part of that.
But you do you.


And for some people those Chinese knock-offs work just fine. I have one on the way from Aliexpress to bench test right now.

But how did they come to be in possession of bitcoin.com and 
It's theseus's ship all over again.

Non-zero is not zero. And non-zero makes it up in volume.


    1 Japanese Yen equals 0.0092 US Dollar
It just means stuff has more digits in the price. And for newbies it's easier to grok paying 2,000 for something rather than 0.0005

Knew? It's amazing that after 4 years the subreddit is more or less exactly as it was. If I was building a blockchain tool or technology I'd definitely do it on top of Doge.

What about Dogecoin needs updated? It's been stable and in use for 2 solid years. How many other coins can say that?
A crypto currency with $725M market cap has not needed a security update or feature update in 2 years. It's 42nd for Marketcap and 4th in Supply. All on software released 2 years ago. There hasn't been a hard fork. Bickering over a hard fork. Segwit, lightning, or anything else. It's "just worked".

I've had my money with them since 2014 and never had any problems either.
What it sounds like is people are realizing what banking regulations do. I couldn't imagine the delays and headaches if I walked around to my banks trying to deposit and withdraw $40k.

There's no reason you can't do everything in crypto. You just have to mine it yourself and find companies that accept crypto.
However any time you start talking about moving around 40,000 USD the government starts to pay attention. It has nothing to do with 'crypto' and everything to do with "terrorism", money laundering, war on drugs, etc. 
It's why people that have that sort of disposable income pay someone else to deal with it. The Winklevoss twins weren't sending money orders themselves to buy crypto. And they certainly weren't posting to Reddit when that money order didn't come through.

I'll bet it outlasts most. That's what they said 4 years ago.

Like I said. Ford vs Chevy.


Which is self correcting.
The arguments and discussion read exactly like the Mac vs PC, Windows vs Linux fanboy discussions of ole. [Which is fine if you have the time for that.](

Where did I tell anyone they were wrong or should roll over and die? I could not care less about the mutual co-existence of multiple coins. 


Bitcoin's blockchain hard forked multiple times. A few of them claim to be the 'real' Bitcoin. Beyond that I have too much other stuff on my plate to get emotional over.

Echoing the sentiments above. Who cares? This argument is the iOS vs Android, Mac vs PC, Ford vs Chevy argument of crypto currencies.
BCH/Bitcoin Cash/bcash/what ever doesn't upset you got me "free" money in the fork.
Edit: Got it, no room for discussion. Subscribing elsewhere.

And how did they do that?

1. I am a developer.
2. Why does something that is stable need developers?
Not being updated like Node.js is a benefit in my mind. Some of my tools haven't had updates in years because they don't need any screen, irssi and nano sat 'neglected' for a while because they didn't need any.
Doge's core is older than most currencies. And if there was a massive security hole it has the market cap to warrant capitalizing on it.

"We demand no regulation or oversight!"
"They stole all my money without regulation!"
