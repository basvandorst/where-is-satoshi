Perhaps the most obvious difference between Gold and Bitcoin is this: Gold is a tangible physical Precious Metal, whereas Bitcoin is digital. Tangible Gold is widely regarded as a sound long-term investment and a hedge against market volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:55:12
First, get yourself a [Bitcoin Wallet]( Next, you will need a place to store your new bitcoins. In the bitcoin world, they're called a 'wallet' but it might be best to think of them as a kind of bank account. Depending on the security levels you want, different wallets will provide different levels of security.
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:22:16
no but you can buy a funeral lol :) 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:43:13
It was used in the same context man. It's used for the same purpose, "am i too late to transfer my coins or should i move them anways?"
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:18:37
fingers crossed 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:32:10
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:44:24
but dude.. youtubee :(
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:54:19
I think he did a good job. If I had a YouTube account with 1.2 million subscribers, I'd definitely use it to talk about something new. Agreed, he can improve in some of the areas but, he's probably new to this as well. Overall I think it's pretty neat.

what are they feeding yooouu

Well I feel very much like an idiot rn.

Dude, we can wait for SegWit and Game of Thrones at the same time. Either way, we don't know what's coming for us!
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:44:47
really? Let's see how their economy responds to that.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:00:45
Why not for food? But, okay computers are cool too.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:45:51
Right. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:17:39
I would definitely opt for a cold storage wallet for permanent storage of tokens in a secure offline environment. But, for everyday use, I'd go for an online wallet, like breadwallet since it's very user-friendly and I can just install it on my phone and keep track of the balance as and when I please. Also, about Android wallets, I don't really know how the "Two-factor-Authentication" mechanism works, so can't help you there. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:37:03
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:51:49
Where were you fam? Steams been accepting bitcoins since 2016.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:46:57
Are you looking for hardware wallets or software? 
The best hardware wallets are Trezor, Ledger Nano S and KeepKey. They're an awesome option for storing your coins in a secure, offline environment, especially for the long run. Also, I think they're kinda cool cause they're so tiny.
Now, for software wallets, you've got a variety, from desktop to software to online or mobile-based applications. In my opinion, Armory, Breadwallet, Mycelium are all great options since they offer maximum storage and security. 
Feel free to correct or back me up guys.
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:10:53
Think I broke the upvote button on this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:55:42
You don't have to sell them, why do you want to though?
You can just transfer them to a wallet, a paper wallet perhaps and you're good to go. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:38:43
Get off the phone and make me why dontchya!
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:19:56
Paper wallet. You can let them remain there till everything settles down a bit. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:06:40
Coinbase and Blockchain are free
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:26:17
I think many people would automatically turn towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if that ever did happen.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:07:23
Cool, also I love spaghetti :)
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:07:07
ok good for you
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:47:40
Truue, that's one way to look at it. Thnx 
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:24:01
Careful what you wish for there. You don't know what might be in store for us after August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:41:23
I never thought of that actually. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:14:50
Guess we got nothing to fret over
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:14:35
But I'm still going to have my microwavable popcorn at the ready, just in case something does happen.

I would totally do anything to be in your place. Food is the one thing I'd spent my bitcoins on without a doubt then buy some more later on. Isn't that what us Bitcoin users do? Collect, spend, repeat!
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:49:11
Ohh righhttt.. Thanks man, that was helpful 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:02:41

Chriss Pratt is so cute. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:24:24
Nothing lasts forever. We're always susceptible to change and Bitcoin has changed a lot over the years, I think this only proves that we should be prepared for whatever change lies ahead of us. If you're hinting on Aug 1st, then I'm as curious and excited as the next person. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:37:33
does it matter if I start now or after Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:46:15
If I answer your question will you get me food? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:31:55
No, its not that. Was just worried about my coins getting stuck or smth
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:25:37
I guess we all have something to learn from your experience.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:43:49
I'll just ask Daenery's dragons to help me out :)
