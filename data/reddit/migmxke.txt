This shoutbox used to be **helpful** in the 1st and 2nd day this puzzle was published. But now it has turned into a  $hith0l3 of  delusional ignorant n00bs  who:
* Have the audacity to **beg** for Btc in their address, like if they somehow achieved anything
* Do not  offer any decent ideas
* Spam/troll af
* Ask silly questions about how to get this btc if they already "found" the ordered words. Despite that 100% of them are **delusional and did not find anything** , it would **still** be total n00b-ness, if one cannot even restore a winning wallet. LMAO. 
* Claim that the puzzle was solved, despite the fact that op in his comments explicitly wrote that changed addresses and emptied the initial address
* Therefore, they don't even check op's comment's and clues. That's another sign of them being lazy to even research basic things. It makes me wanna stop reading this comment box.
I wish there was a filter between helpful and unhelpful posts. Here one has to dig into an ocean of dirt in order to find good comments.

dude what color? It's all white inside the circle. Color is no parameter. OP said half are out, so I guess, it's all white words only. Also, there are 5 inclinations in total.  The font of ALL the clue words  are the smallest font words, except transaction (non-bip) and try. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:54:53
The passphrase is probably removed now, so it doesn't matter. But the nearby word 'lost" (non-bip) was included in some clue. Also, passphrases don't have bip limitations, so it could 'lost' or some other non-bip word like "transaction'

The main problem is we don't have verification that this image really 100% contains the seed  to unlock the 1 BTC in  3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8  . It might as well be a hoax of some whale playing with moving 1 BTC in a new wallet, just to waste the time of us little fish, by showing us the **Most Used words in the Satoshi Whitepaper**. cryptogreetings just created his account today, so **I doubt his credibility**.  The question is can you generate your own a 24 word seed at will, impromptu? E.g. If I want to hide 1 BTC in the specific seed word "transaction (repeat 24 times) would not that yield and invalid Checksum? Because the last word is the checksum. I tested about 100 word lists, and found some with valid checksums, but still the wordlist was wrong since it's 0 BTC inside apparently.

@_date: 2018-05-22 04:14:43
I don't confuse it, because it's the same. Always **Private key=seed**.  Each **unique seed, ALWAYS provides a unique respective private key**. But the various public addresses or any passphrases don't matter. Because for a unique **private key**, you can have  **as many public addresses and as many passphrases as you wish**
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:33:50
why 4 letter-words? too arbitrary
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:22:42
I don't believe the  [2] [7] [5] theory. The Brackets are just for random references. I stand strong with my guess of 257=Sha256+1=2^(8)+1 = marking the X , because this hints that there are 24 words and the X was the clue for the +1 passphrase. He also had **+1 as a clue**. It's too obvious for me. What's more: the **visible part**  of 257  (="25") was there nearby X, so I had an epiphany that this was the 25th word=passphrase. If I ever constructed  such a puzzle, I would put it that way. I mean, **there has to be a hint that we're looking for 24 words**, so that was my logical shot. 257 makes perfect sense for my theory of **2^(8)+1** which not only reveals that we're looking for 24 words (and NOT 12 or 18), but 257 was also in accordance with the clue **"+1"** and also in accordance with my theory of **visible part of 257 (just the "25")  = 25th word = "+1 word" = passphrase**
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:24:57
You can **only manually create 23 words**. 24th is the checksum: 
* For 24 words the checksum is 8 bits, = 1/ 256, so there are 8 valid checksums for 2048 bip words. Can be bruteforced easily. Each 256-block from 1 to 2048 has 1 valid word-checksum. So, he could only **cherry pick 11 pairs**. The 12th has to be valid. But he may also chose the most intriguing and grammatically fitting checksum out of those 8 valid checksum words.
* Then, for 12 words, the 12th word (=checksum) is 4 bits  therefore 1/16 which yields to 128 valid checksum words, so every 16-block from 1 to 2048 contains a unique valid checksum word. Here, he could only **cherry pick 5 pairs**
 
* I can't even go for 18 words, but the idea is the same. 18 words = 6 bits checksum = 32 valid checksum words, and cherry picking 8 pairs
* 15 and 21 seed words (valid in bip) are not an option, since he mentioned "pairs, it's either 12/18/24.  I know, 18 seems strange but some hot wallets like Coinomi use 18. But most hot wallets use 12 and **all** hardware wallets use 24. (keepkey, ledger, trezor etc.)

Yes. And 8 bits=24 words,   6 bits=18 words, and 4 bits=12 words. But someone had to decypher it, and I did it.

@_date: 2018-05-22 03:13:01
When he transferred between his public addresses, I think he just **removed his original passphrase**, therefore we have **1 less step** to solve. (like he **literally** said). That extra (final boss) step would originally be to find the passphrase (=25th word). I estimate that **both addresses** (his old and new) are **still derived from his same private key** (24 word seed). A passphrase was probably included **only in the old address**. The original puzzle had probably **25 words (24 bip words+ 1 passphrase)** and now it probably has just the original **24 bip words (23 cherry picked and 1 checksum word**), but with **no passphrase**. But still seems hard af. I'm sure he understood that the mnemonic seed was hard enough to solve, let alone finding any extra lost passphrase. 
 
In my opinion, the small **X** inside the rectangle, marked near the number **25** (of 257) giving clue for the (now removed) **passphrase=25th word**. And the nearest word in X is "**lost**" (it's not a bip word, but it was included in 1 of his [clues:]( "**Lost transaction costs among users**". 
So, if I ever got so close near the solution with all my guessed 24-word seed correct , I would just put 'lost' as a passphrase or manually brute-forcing something like that. (Lost, lost257, Lost257, lost25, Lost25, 25lost, 25Lost, l.o.s.t., l-o-s-t, l_o_s_t, LOST, LostX,  etc.) because the **passphrase is case sensitive** (both in ledger and trezor). But even so, I think the passphrase would be easy for me to **crack** in Python (or even manually), compared to the rest seed.
But maybe that 257 number is  also meant to mean **256+1**.  It's clear to me, that **257=2^(8)+1 = 8 bits +1** = **24 words + 1 extra** ("the passphrase") so I bet the seed has **8x3=24 words (the bip mnemonic seed is always a multiple of 3 words=1 bit**. (according to the BIP specifications in Github)
 
 I mean, there **had to be somewhere a hint that we were looking for 24 words and NOT 12 or 18**, so my 257 theory makes sense. At least now, with my theory, I'm almost sure  that we're looking for 24 words, and we can steer the suggestions and the whole research towards **24-word seed** and **NOT 12/18 word** seeds. 
 I also searched ("ctrl+F") the Satoshi whitepaper for the number "257" but it can't be found anywhere. It's **impossible** that "257" appeared in this **word cloud** out of nowhere. So it was just probably **set up** in that specific X spot as a part of the puzzle.   Too bad the passphrase is  probably removed now, that's why I write what I would otherwise keep it for myself, if I ever got so close to the end. My work on the passphrase doesn't matter now, because his passphrase was probably removed. 
  
At least, I just wanted to let you guys know,  that **to me now, it's almost sure that the seed words are 24, and neither 12 nor 18**. So, you can now steer your own research only towards the **24-word seed** and ditch the simplistic 12 word combinations. Anyway, I just put a few logical scenarios. And with a passphrase or not, this puzzle is still somewhat brutal, unless more hints are given. Good luck.

Ok finally I believe you. It's verified, you got the 1 BTC to spare for us puzzle-solvers. Actually, it was my mistake because a YT guy denied your signature verification. But he did it with Electrum which is not very compatible with Segwit signatures starting from 3 (like yours). But brainwallet.github.io is correct and I verified your signature for your specific message "This is real." , here:   
And since you wrote the **final clue** is this **really final** ? Or will you give more hints if this puzzle goes **unsolved for 1 month or so**? The only clue I found **totally absurd** is the 00212121 because there is not  a single 21 in the Satoshi paper. These numbers smell ternary (base 3) to me, but even so, in  this sequence converts to 637 in base 10, and its "binary to ascii" output still yields something nonsensical. Maybe they are some color or vector coordinates, but these numbers seem totally unrelated to the seed words, but OK I get it that you want this riddle to be hard as possible. You may lose gifting a few little  cryptomoney here, but you gain lots of marketing and attention, so it's it's a cunning trick you pulled with that **word cloud**. Honestly, I hope someone solves it already so I can move on to other puzzles.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:28:24
Yeah, **but for what**? : 
* **12 or 24 bip  words? And which**? 
* **Small ones or Big ones**? (in font)
* **A.White or B. Yellow or C. Overlapping ones**? ("both white and yellow")
 
And even if you got the 24 correct words; **their order** still a pain in  **when assuming randomly stuff like** : 
*  **Order of appearance in whitepaper** 
* **Alphabetical order** 
* **Distance from X** 
* **Distance for Circle's center and other Geometrical BS**
That's too arbitrary, and we got no real decent clues about the order

I have the Python script to find 24th word checksum for 23-word mnemonic mentioned here  
But the script does not seem to work for my Idle compiler. Can you bruteforce it with  .py script? But that's the easy part. I could also manually check the first 256 words in iancoleman, is easy but but time consuming. So, were basically seeking 23 words, most probably. I don't think OP would choose only 11 words for 12 word seed. 23/24 makes more sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:43:00
Just make a bot to copy-paste each permutation in  . But the problem is that roughly every 256 trials you get 1 valid checksum, but this does not mean it's correct private key for this puzzle. For 256K trials you get about 1K valid seeds, but it's a pain in the  to manually test them all in Electrum, Exodus, Ledger, Trezor, Enjin, Jaxx or Mycelium or any wallet that allows restoration of known seeds

Cool story bro, even if you know the 23 words already, then to permute 23 words you need to bruteforce 23! = 2 x 10^22 combos . That's the same like the [distance]( from Earth to Andromeda galaxy in meters. We need more clues

I'm done with this puzzle. I refuse to give it further attention unless Cryptogreetings proves that he is the 1 BTC owner. 
His **signature is wrong** for the message: " This is real. "


But even if he is the owner: 
* This pic might as well be  a **marketing hoax**, because "apparently" he sells the canvas of this pic for "only" 230$ in his website. So, he probably does NOT want this to be solved. 
* He may also own the 1 BTC but these word here are the most frequent words in the Satoshi whitepaper, may as well have **nothing to do with his Seed or the Key**, and we're all **scammed** to pay attention to his site, and he has a different key/seed which he won't publish. 
* But even in a good scenario where we find the 24 random correct words of his seed, we need almost 24!=6x 10^23 combinations to brute force   such a thing in the correct seed order.
 
I'm done. Don't give him further **marketing money nor attention**.

Say u know all 12 pairs = 12! (factorial) = 479 million possible combos to arrange them in order, **times**  another 12 bits (=2^(12) =4K) for the correct word order inside each pair  : E.g. 1 bit for the 1st pair : (code, easily) or (easily, code) and so on. Total: 
* 12! x 2^12 = 2 trillion combos. 
So, I don't think you can win, in a lifetime,  if you just only know the pairs

any idea for 00212121 ?
Its prime factors don't show any special pattern :
