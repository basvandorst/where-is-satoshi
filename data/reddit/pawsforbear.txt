Bitcoin vets acting like they've been through dozens of crashes and corrections.... I feel like there's been 1 correction that sustained for years and I don't believe we've seen a crash yet.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:14:52
Ooof thank God.  Imagine if you hadn't.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:01:05
Come on.  You could say the same about miners in BTC.  they are controlling the landscape of BTC and its not consumer friendly-- its exclusively miner friendly.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:59:56
Why does it have to be Eth vs Bitcoin?  Its senseless.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:59:14
If you are not being facetious, I would be interested to buy. But why aren't you selling some?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:39:56
PErhaps a bit too dramatic, but BTC as we know it is ending.  There will be a new normal and some version of BTC will be coming from it following SegWit.  At the very least there will be a big change.  I dont think the current price increases in BTC or Eth is sustainable.
I have skin in both coins, more in BTC, but just being realistic here.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:19:16
My point is eth and BTC aren't that different from each other so going after each other is counterproductive.
We can focus our energies on improving each currency instead of tearing them down.

I'm assuming your portfolio is not your retirement nest egg worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Look, I'm just trying to explain why there's no buy in from people who ready money magazine or Forbes.. I wouldn't recommend bitcoin to my mother who is gearing for retirement is all I'm going to say. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:52:29
Markets are pretty fickle.  BTC just dropped $500, for what?  It's already pretty volatile.  Also, if two BTC blockchains DO come from this, people will have to make a decision where they want to invest.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:01:32
But campbx states dwolla requires a 30 day old account in campbx before you can transfer your funds with dwolla. Is this true? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:03:07
Couldn't you say the same to the folks who can't seem to admit that BTC could be facing dire straits?
I find it particularly funny that some BTC owners are quick to call eth a bubble when they were quick to snap back at people claiming BTC is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:08:06
You're right. People are mad that they transacted with the rest of the bitcoin world and couldn't get to their funds fast enough. See: any bubble pop ever. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:06:19
If a spike in interest can raise it from 20 to 140, and news like instawallet drop it down 20,then the market for bitcoin is very volatile. That graph is akin to an exponential function. This doesn't sell well to people who have followed stocks for years, I. E. Their audience

Reduce YOUR quality of life, pick up another job and start saving, ya asshole. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:57:55
Seriously, be careful. Last time I traded technological, non physical goods over ebay it didn't work out well at all.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:33:44
Reasonable. But for this instance do you feel like the huge spike in bitcoin transactions and new MG accounts is a substantial circumstance that is difficult to account for? If majority of transactions are made from the site, and it gets even more attention, the writing is on the wall. 
Reasonable investors would use other sites because the risk of a site overflow at a time of panic should be accounted for. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:54:42
You're missing the point. the .com bubble wasnt about the "Internet" you smug asshole.

My tax return is my income the government has kept from me for over a year. That is not play money. That is due wages to my name that has been doing jack shit for me. And I do claim dependents. If I owe the government money at the end of the year, that's a bigger plus than having 2k plus come back to me.

Because jewelry prices isn't based on spot value?

You don't think Facebook sells our data? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:12:52
Why would you consider a tax return play money? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:16:28
I'm not down voting you but these scenarios DO Change the value of a bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:15:14
That's exactly the point. This is a generation that didn't grow up with technology, but just indoctrinated in to it. In addition to that, bitcoin is much too volatile to be a part of a 'portfolio' of any sort.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:29:45
I try to shoot for a tax refund of +/- 500. It goes in the bank or whatever when I get it back. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:41:16
Do you know what a bubble is? Regardless of what causes it to pop, it's still a bubble. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:19:34
Bitcoin is a commodity based on technology. It is not a TV. It is not a stock. It can crash or deflate in value like any commodity can. 
Your comparisons are very misinformed. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:53:20
What are you talking about, 0 and 65% market share. Did you pill this out of your ass? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:35:28
Why is mtgox the bad guy here? Bitcoin owners panicked, everyone rushed to sell, and the site crashed. That is completely expected for a site that handles '80% of bitcoin transactions'. 
You were even warned by a previous post about the possibility of being unable to sell high when they was a panic during a crash and yet it's still mtgox fault. 
This is not the fault of mtgox. This is the failing of everyone who did not have an exit strategy and expected to be able to sell on a dime. 
Boo on everyone pushing blame on mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:20:48
I guess I'm confused when you say "I'm going to dump my play money (tax return) in bitcoin". 
I'm not saying it's a bad investment, I just think calling a tax refund play money a bit wonky. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:00:31
The sad part is that people tried to draw parallels from bitcoin to the .com bubble and everyone laughed it off and said it wasnt a bubble.
I hope people who were laughing didn't buy high.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:12:21
Mtgox was 80% of bitcoin transactions. Anyone who believed they could trade at their will at time of panic is a fool. Plain and simple. 
On top of that, bitcoin got a ton of attention once it started going up. That attention is what drove up the price in the first place. So you can't have your cake and eat it too. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:57:30
So are you selling you BTC or riding through? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:57:34
Have you used any of these? None of the bitcoin purchasing methods are the least bit enticing. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:20:42
If we're calling a refund discretionary income, I get it. I've seen people calling a refund 'free money' and figured it was being referred to as such 
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:35:04
Seems like you're making a killing. Congratulations

If a bank gets robbed, my dollar is still valued the same. Dumb analogy 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:10:59
Are you saying an opinion cannot be stated? 90% of people were saying bitcoin was not a bubble and this rise would go on forever. Of course it was wrong. But you'd be as stupid as the person saying it to believe it. Who cares? The speculators are no good to bitcoin anyways 
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:19:34
It was 140 in the early afternoon and spiked down to 110. Regardless of what is making these spikes, those are huge changes in a short amount of time. It's hard for any investor to buy in to fluctuations like that. 
Most of bitcoin audience seems to be young people who understand the technology yet do not know much of trading or investments. That's just a hunch but I don't think it's far off base. 
These traders dont need warm fuzzies they need a growth without spikes like what we are seeing. 
I'm not saying bitcoin is a bad investment but you'd be a bit nutty to throw 1% or more of your stock portfolio when it can drop more than 20% in value in literally hours.

Who is expecting a sincere analysis on the Colbert Report? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:59:07
But how is this mtgox fault. This is the exact behavior that led to an overload of their servers due to the sell requests and the sell requests led to the crash. This is nobodies fault but those who sold or transacted on MG. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:19:07
What places use dwolla? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:37:53
Their customers chose MG. Who on earth would do what you are saying. 
"sorry guys we can't take any more orders because we are afraid in the event of a crash, one we can't determine when it will happen, we may not be able to device everyone". 
That's ludicrous and you know it. You're clearly biased because you couldn't get out the door with the panic. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:55
Well this was 9 years ago, and I meant paypal, not ebay, but essentially I traded an online key (World of Warcraft Beta), the user said he never received it and the email was 'lost'. Paypal essentially told me there was nothing they could do because technical keys were not a good they supported since it had no physicality. THEN the pricks filed me as a scammer. Ridiculous. I'm sure things have changed since 2004, however.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:37:41
How so? Not arguing that the bitcoin is, by nature, easily counterfeited, but I dont see how it's cap is a guard against counterfeits. Now, if it comes out that there are more than 21 bitcoins out there, the legitimacy of the bitcoin would falter and it would hinder it's support; but I don't get how this would stop counterfeiting.
Besides, I do not believe that the dollar bill is counterfeit-able because it's limitless in it's production. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:07:41
Maybe I'm not getting the full picture here. The price hit a dip, and that started full panic mode did it not? What am I missing here. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:04:42
So when are you going to sell? I hope this was a lesson.
