Unfortunately it's for this reason that ETH will (likely) be more successful in the near-term. Lots of applications that don't really need to put usability in the forefront. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:46:50
Yet another reason the spirit of the currency won't be realized. "Calculate you own transaction fees" lol...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:47
My fee is twice yours and it isn't moving... What are our options?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:45
can't breathe on the way up, can't breathe on the way down... figure out your risk tolerance brah

end of 2018, mang

So many alts out there, christ.

Well, they update the physical bills with better material (fire-resistant, counterfeit proof, etc.) but it is still USD/CAD/AUD/Euro or whatever. Bitcoin will need to be able to implement something similar (maybe the lightning update is like this?).  I believe the only thing that needs to maintain its integrity is the underlying crypto - the hashing.

Update: I got 1 confirmation, so things looking up!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:21:57
I think they're legitimate questions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:23
Lame.  
Here it says I should be between 8-480 minutes (so up to 8 hours):
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:59:23
You gonna show em a hash instead? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:43
When lots of people want something that only a few people have (or is scarce in natural supply) the price goes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:07:09
i) SegWit is the worst name for this and has shitty branding power, ii) why isn't it being automatically incorporated into current wallets?

We need stability at some point though. There will always be "something better" - that's how tech works. We can't just keep replacing currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:36
What if I'm lower than the competitive rate? I think I sent at ~850 sat/b. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:48
Why would transactions ever reduce if this is to be "adopted" and replace fiat as people say? If BTC is used for everyday things, the number of transactions will skyrocket.

It's what Hodor wishes he could have done
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:54:47
Wtf is up your butt man
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:02:59
Edit: Found my stuff! Woohooo
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:39:57
No, it doesn't. Just passphrase! hah. :(
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:34:38
What about for the Armory wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:59:01
Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:28:22
People - no, wait, *stupid* people - were basically printing money a month ago. Investing in altcoin symbols that had *zero* product behind them. If you sat back and just watched, it was clear this crash/correction was very imminent.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:23:56
The fundamentals are there, just be prepared for for one hell of a fucking rollercoaster.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:43:58
I don't think crypto needs to replace fiat to be useful. You're also speaking in annoying obscure generalities. The video points out some tangible use-cases, which I agree with.  
Edit: Also, nice edit. I am disappoint! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:47:38
Is there any way to determine size on Armory? I can't see that detail anywhere. Also, are there any options if it isn't big enough?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:33:49
The use cases for crypto are strong. There is a need for the technology. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:45:31
In the time you typed that out, you could have answered it again. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:46:16
Thanks! Much appreciated.
