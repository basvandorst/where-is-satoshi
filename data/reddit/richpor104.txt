Instead of offering $5 of bitcoin. Offer 0.005 bitcoin, or whatever amount of bitcoin you deem appropriate. That’s how this is actually supposed to work, I think...

There is no way to learn how to trade gold fairly in the open market during a crisis. A gram being worth $55 dollars is not feasible for people to actually be using it at money. Bitcoin is easily adopted with just a little bit of teaching on privacy and functionality. The transferability and cryptographic proof is top notch and better than anything else, especially gold.

The equivalent of $160,000 ? Sorry, but I totally disagree with you doing that. If you’re selling something for bitcoin, decide how many bitcoin you want, not how many dollars you want. With  per bitcoin, say I want 40 bitcoin for my house. 
If you think bitcoin is worth $10,000 a coin ask for 16 bitcoin. If you think it’s worth $1,000 a coin, ask for 160 bitcoin. 
My point is, if you want to promote that the purchasing power of bitcoin is strong enough to buy a home. List the home for a price(in bitcoin) that you believe is fair for you as the seller and not what the unfair market determined for the you and buyer a long time ago. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:53:11
Yes! You’re right. I do have a fear that it will continue to go down if it goes down to there. I am confident it can rebound though, as it has before time and time again. I’ll be too happy to go fiat all in at 1,050. It is not worth worries to consider the value of a purchase to be less, when you’re knowing you bought it to be worth more, intrinsically or holistically.
How much of your bitcoin have you traded for time/work/goods/services? I just might be able to sell you some time ;)
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:49:42
Risky? In what sense? Having less value at or after the moment of the transaction? That is up to you as a participant of the transaction, buying or selling. 
I would argue it’s extremely more risky(or downright irresponsible) for anyone to finance a $160,000 home with a 30 year mortgage after putting 20% ($32,000, who can actually afford that responsibly anyway?) on a down payment, on a 4.5% interest rate, to end up paying over $335,480.59
Therefore, immediately after signing to “own” your house, the buyer is looking at a deficit of over 100% of what they agreed the price of they were buying was. 
Sure someone could agree to pay you $160,000 in paper money dollar bills. Enjoy counting and confirming that.
I know it sucks, someone sold two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin, your home has got to be worth two pizzas, right? We are to where you can just request bitcoin and not worry about the price fluctuations FYI

When I got into bitcoin last year just under 7K, I honestly did not think I would ever be able to buy sub 4K bitcoin. I am very thankful for the multiple purchases I have been able to make at this price. It’s not “free money” just yet. I still worry there is a chance the price can drop closer and closer to 1,050. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 20:37:51
Conversely. During the entirety of the approval process the price could go up 10-15% (it’s unlikely a move of that size happens in a few hours or less these days, still very possible) what if the buyer backs out at because he could now go get a home “worth” $25,000 more?

Can you shed any light as to how you live only on bitcoin? Like housing and food, do you have any life, home, auto, boat, phone insurance that you are paying for using bitcoin, what about gasoline and parts for the motorcycle? 
I am unfamiliar with react native at this time but I am certain I have valuable skills to share.

I have spread the word many places. My mom lives many states away and was visiting me this week. I have set up a few wallets with people. This was just a really special experience and I thought it was worth a share. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:43:29
Thanks for sharing all of this, it is a great positive reinforcement of what I know is possible with bitcoin. It’s clear it is very far from where we believe it will be though. I hope many people see and upvote that post.
Did you and your landlord agree to a monthly bitcoin price(0.12345678) or is it adjusted to market value? What about the previous landlord?
I wish the best for you and your family.

What a cool idea if it is
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:58:48
If it’s to risky to own 40 bitcoin that become worth 12,000(or whatever lesser amount since that is the risk) at the time in a distant unlikely future that you decide to sell them back for the dollars you meant you actually wanted for your house. 
And what if the price quadrupled vs the dollar? Would you give the buyer of the home a substantial portion if not all of there purchase price back?

December 14 2018 I purchased bitcoin at $3,193.51

At the turn of the 22nd century, the bitcoin supply will still not have reached 21 million. If the dollar money supply continues to grow, you better believe bitcoins “market capitalization” will be many many trillions of dollars.

Okay, from now on I’m using my BitPay visa at stores for necessary items, and as I do I’m going to prepare for a re-purchase of bitcoin for every 0.01 BTC I spend in real item purchases.

Hope the intipbot or any user who is a peer can send Satoshis here. If you do. Send a  in the notes and I’ll be sure it’s never used until the price of one bitcoin is valued over one million dollars

Could be considered that I suppose. But if you think any of those are “frisbees”, you lack understanding. And why isn’t it an advertisement for bitcoin? Honestly that’s more what I was going for.
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:44:11
Yes, it is a trademarked brand and commonly an incorrect label for the flying discs of various types and brands as they are not “frisbies” (the spelling on the original tossed disc shaped pan, probably removing royalties to the original family or creator/s) frisbees as trademarked and patented by Wham-O in any way.
Using “frisbee” to describe any flying disc is silly regardless of the commonplace in doing so, if I throw a coin like a United States penny, dime, nickel, quarter(a disc flying) and we call it a frisbee, people may not accept it as money any more and start accepting bitcoin as the real money in the world cause it can’t be called a frisbee as it is not a coin/disc that can fly.

@_date: 2019-05-11 14:35:28
I heard satoshi lite on pomp’s podcast talking about meeting(random) people and trading locally for bitcoin. Adoption since then is clearly the ease of the on-ramp that exchanges and decentralized exchanges provide. Business adoption seems way off, in my one year with bitcoin I am very underwhelmed at the amount of business’ willing to accept bitcoin as payment, let alone have it be the standard asking price for their goods/services.
