currencies shouldn't have bubbles though

Right but the merchant is receiving whatever currency that gold is transferred into. You aren't paying the merchant gold, therefore that isn't the currency used. What seems to be happening here is you are still selling the gold to the company when you make the transaction and getting whatever currency in return and using that to pay the bill.

Zimbabwean Dollars aren't a good currency either because they were backed by a government with a terrible economy and a whole host of problems. ZWD is a bad currency, bitcoin is currently a bad currency, USD is a great currency.

Lol? this is just inflation... Inflation of around 2-3% a year is completely healthy and good for the economy.

When's the last time USD has fallen 20% in a day?

Right but commodities actually have uses and fundamentals that drive the price volatility. So why should it be treated as a commodity if it has no other characteristics of one?

If it's not a currency then what is it? Gold would be perhaps the closest comparison, but gold doesn't see near the volatility bitcoin does, and has much more predictable (not saying it is predictable) price patterns. Gold often correlates inversely to the market as a whole, because people use it as a store of value.

People do speculate on currencies. Check out Forex trading, but bitcoin isn't a viable currency at the moment due to relatively limited acceptance and extremely high transaction fees.

But that debit card doesn't have 3 ounces of gold on it. It is a debit card with 4,000 USD on it. All you did was buy USD with gold, which (along with other currencies) is about all you can buy with gold. Wheras with government backed currencies you can buy nearly anything you want, and in the case of USD almost anywhere you want.

If you don't understand how any financial instrument works you shouldn't invest in it period.

You're talking about options. Futures are completely different. While the option holder does not need to exercise their contract, a futures holder is required to do so.
Future: obligation to buy or sell at a fixed price at a fixed point in time
Option: right, but not obligation, to buy or sell at a fixed price at a fixed point in time (assuming the option is European, if they're American the option can be exercised at any point until expiration).
