It kinda doesnt tho. The article just says that they are using cheap electricity to mine bitcoins to sell for USD profit. It doesnt reflect bitcoins utility at all, only that it can be sold for USD. This could be literally any coin which can be sold at an exchange.

Edit: Sorry my bad, I thought you were the person I was replying to. Got very confused.

Bitcoin generally:  i don't believe in bitcoin long term but I sure as hell isn't going to miss out on a party like this.
This sub: To see the reactions to every single price swing. The number of posts completely ignorant to *really bad events* is a hilarious break from work.
