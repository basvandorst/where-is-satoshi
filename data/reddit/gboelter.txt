And how can it be, that a financial asset will loose 30% within 3 days, what do you think?
It's very simple, many people know, that BTC will go down near august 1. so they will sell there BTC's on time and later they will buy it back for a much lower price. And this are not a few miners only, this are the big investors mainly.
Sit down and relax, I'm sure in a few weeks.BTC will go up again to it's old state or even better ...

Not the answer your are waiting for but it's the truth!

Install CoPay wallet for example on your cellphone. Follow there instruction after the first start und do a backup. There copay will show you 12 words. Write this words down by hand, don't print it and no screenshot. Store these words to a very save place. Don't use it on a windows computer as long you are not 500% sure, this computer is clean. 
When you are done click 'Receive'. You will see your new Bitcoin Adress. Send your Bitcoins to this adress.
