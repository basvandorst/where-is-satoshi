That 15 BTC is lost for all ages, while any bank can just (*poof*) create new dollars for the ones "lost" that actually inflate (i.e. depreciate the value of) the dollars. BTC remains stable, $ doesn't.

Before the €, the Italian government used the Lira's rapid inflation to finance ~~public works~~ corruption while debasing "public" debt. Italy's geographical advantage of practically *being* the Mediterranean, its' many old Roman ruins, endless beaches, etc. along with the comparatively low (debased) prices, insured a constant flow of tourists from regions with more stable currencies with which the Italians got to supplement their income, and which ironically ensured a stable tax base for more inflation.
That is why many Italians want to return. The government to continue with its' corruption while appearing benevolent, the people to reap the "benefits" of socialism supplemented by the benefits of capitalism.

Any paper (analog) book you read is anonymous, and suspicious. You could be reading terrorist training manuals, and we'd like to know, so get an e-book reader ASAP!

AFAIK that poison is undetectable. They'd have to find the pinprick where the icicle entered the body, good luck doing that with all the IV-catheter pricks she got at the hospital.
