You think that's bad, I was on 4chan's /g/ board in 2009 when people were handing out 3000-5000 BTC like candy. I found the client annoying to install so I didn't bother getting a wallet address to recieve coins to.
But at the same time, once it would've been worth $100, I would've sold it/bought weed with it anyway and considered it a lucky break.
As for my future dalliances in crypto I've been screwed every single time - had 0.5 BTC and about 20K doge in cryptsy - gone. Had about 40K doge in dogetipbot - gone. Had about 0.2 BTC in Alphabay market about 3 days before it got raided - gone. I bought 0.1 ETH for €100 in the dip after the January crypto-crash, it's worth less than half of that last I checked (€43 now).
Moral of the story is, hindsight is 20/20 and for every winner with crypto, there's a loser. Or maybe the moral of the story is, whenever I make a move on cryptocurrency, go the opposite direction.

So I should've just predicted the exit scams and shutdowns and "not had my currency there". Gotcha.

If they're less knowledgable than you about a subject and you can spare the money, keep your own counsel. There's a term I can't recall for the opposite of "wisdom of crowds" where it basically says getting a lot of uninformed advice is worse than asking one person who has knowledge of a subject.

I've been following the markets since basically the start, but the idea of the genius who can predict trends is BS. It's gambling, always was. An experienced gambler may play the odds better but he's still a gambler.

Yeah, you used it as a value exchange for goods instead of a speculative way to get rich. 
I wonder sometimes though, how rich those drug dealers on the darknet got when BTC's price skyrocketed.
