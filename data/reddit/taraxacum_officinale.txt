I did. Great for gathering news. I was really shocked at how, when hundreds of people turned to reddit for help and information during 'Enjoy Sotchi' episode, the response to new posters was so unpleasant when there was nothing about it on the main page but that was one poor incident in a generally great place and I now understand reddit then I had after previous fleeting glances.

Sorry, as you may have guessed I am just a layman bitcoin enthusiast who doesn't know a great deal about reddit. I have now used the search and found threads full of people being called fucking morons and advised to use the search. If anyone has the time could they point me to a thread which explains (again in relativ-laymens terms) what might be going on. If you think i'm a fucking moron thats fine but you don't need to take time out to post it.

Yes, many people have received them. If you look at the addresses you have received them from they will probably include the words 'Enjoy' and 'Sotchi'. It's effectively spam.
