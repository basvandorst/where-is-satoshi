You have very clearly not read the article I just linked to, and have decided to respond in ignorance anyways. &amp;

They have a clear message. [Here is an article talking all about the message of the Occupy movement.]( The idea that there is not point is a media-generated myth. The Occupy movement has officially released statements numerous times precisely outlining what they are calling for.

$200k is a pittance to a software project of this scale. [Here is a great rundown of where]( all the cash went, and [financial statement \(PDF\)](
**TLDR**; They only got $178k, of which $114k went to paying salaries, which means that each developer got around $28k/year salary - which is next to NOTHING for software development. Then add another $28k of Kickstarter fulfillment expenses, and you have a **net loss of $238**.
