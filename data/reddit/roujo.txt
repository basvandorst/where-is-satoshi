The slowness of transactions is a MtGox problem? The fact that Bitcoin is not insured against loss (like bank accounts are) is a MtGox problem?
I don't think you've read the initial topic correctly. MtGox had its problems, but that's not most of what's discussed here.

I understand that every client is also a server, and that any such service - P2P or not - must have a server. I was commenting on your analogy of reddit servers being like BitCoins: IMO they are not alike. Reddit uses a webserver, a centralized access to some ressource - in this case a website. BitCoin uses a distributed network, every node having the information and sharing it to others. Sure, they are "servers" too in that sense, but I think most of them probably aren't sitting in a datacenter like a webserver would: they live on the users' desktops and laptops.
@_date: 2011-05-16 23:08:22
Isn't Bitcoin decentralized? As I understand it, it's built as a peer-to-peer network, so there aren't any official servers, right?

Cash also has no consumer chargeback protection, and if you lose your wallet, it's gone.
However, structures were built around it that made it possible to add those features. I'm pretty sure that if Bitcoin takes off, there will be an opportunity for companies and individuals to fill that gap. =)
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:32:41
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I don't know if MtGox differenciates sells and buys, though - someone buying BTC is always also someone else selling BTC. =P

He's providing a service by selling those Bitcoins, which takes some of his time. While people dedicated to the cause might do it for free, providing your service at a margin over cost price doesn't strike me as unusual - that's how it generally works.

@_date: 2013-04-05 16:30:22
That wasn't necessarily a buy, it was just a transaction from one address to another. It might be a buy, or someone switching wallets, or even a donation to some website or other.
Also, you might want to refresh that page - you can now hear different sounds depending on the transaction size. That bubble would have made a pretty deep sound, although the sound does cap at around 1000 BTC. =P

"That extra crap" is the UI.
* onCreate() is called when you get to that Activity (screen, really) in the app.
* onCreateOptionsMenu(), well, creates the options menu.
If you want to blame something for being terse, that'd be Android, not Java. (Not that I agree, in any case.)
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:01:40
Not all transactions *have* a price. If it comes from MtGox, the price will be shown. If it's just from the blockchain, there's no way to know what the transaction was for (might be candy, might be hats, might be a bitcointip) so showing the price is pretty much impossible.

Yeah, but just adding more trading units doesn't make them worth more. I wouldn't be any richer if I counted my money in cents instead of dollars - I'd have a bigger number of cents, sure, but I wouldn't be able to buy any more stuff that I did before.

@_date: 2013-04-08 16:37:06
True. However, if the Internet was outlawed (for some reason) in the early 90s, we wouldn't have the same Internet at all. Way less people would have gotten in, you couldn't have ISPs, you'd have to rely on small, makeshift operations to connect to the network... It would still work, but it wouldn't be anywhere near the size it is today.
That's my point: it wouldn't kill Bitcoin, but it wouldn't be able to become as widespread as it's aiming to right now. Being a wonderful but misunderstood piece of technology doesn't change that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:19:28
Pretty much.
Anyone who used Bitcoin mainly because it cuts the government out of the loop won't care - they'd use it either way.. For people like me, who used Bitcoin mainly because it's an awesome piece of technology, it's more complicated... The two groups have some overlap, of course. Still, there will be people who will drop it if it becomes outlawed, and I do hope I won't have to explain to my friends and family that "Yes, I use Bitcoin but no, I'm not a child pornographer". =/

Your case is different because you don't have the gold anymore at the measurement point.
While we don't know how much DPR has converted back into cash, I think it's reasonable to believe that someone that invested into Bitcoin and that distrustful of the government would keep most of that in BTC, in which case using the current market value of BTC is justified. Of course, AFAIK we don't actually know how much BTC is left in his wallet, so the figure might be off.

They wouldn't be able to keep their contract with their supplier, Ingram, if they did. You're right in saying they might stick around, what I meant was that their *current incarnation* would have to go.
We're starting to see widespread adoption, which is wonderful. However, high-profile companies aren't going to stick around if Bitcoin transactions are illegal, and without them the general public will go back to "What's the use of these coins if you can't buy anything with them?" status.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:55:33
I think the last time something like that happened was when Deepbit went over 50% for a brief moment in 2011, and what happened then was that miners moved over to other pools to balance it out. I think the same will happen here, if we get to that point. =)
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:07:23
They can offer Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; Fiat transfers. If they make it easy, they could leverage their reputation and become a good way to do such transfers. I think there's a lot of people who would really like to get into Bitcoin, but can't be bothered to jump through the hoops necessary to get there. We don't all live in the US and have access to bitfloor/coinbase. =P
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:12:37
Open(-source) platforms are the only platforms you can *know* are secure. Just because it's a closed(-source) platform, doesn't mean it's insecure. Someone could code a perfectly secure platform and release it closed-source - it just means that you have to trust him that it'll live up to his description.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:46:13
We'll see. Perhaps the rise in price will be seen as a rise in demand, hence in popularity, which will bring more merchants in. Perhaps it will crash.
I do agree that just hoarding Bitcoins isn't helping the economy, but you can hardly blame people for doing it in the current state of affairs. 100% ROI in a week is *insane*. =P
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:23:40
They do if you require TFA on Security Center access. At least, I've got that option.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:08:50
It might really be different, and I also think it *is* different. Still, not investing more than you can afford to lose is still good advice. Just because the situation is different this time isn't proof that the price won't crash again. It's reassuring, and it points in the right direction, but it's not proof.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:17:32
Oh. Shit. Erm. Well, there is a bit of randomness built in the sounds, so that every small transaction doesn't sound the same. If there wasn't, all you'd hear most of the time is the same high-pitched noise - it gets annoying. =P
So yeah, just putting in the right transactions wouldn't really work the way it's coded right now.
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:50:50
I don't know, I haven't been involved in the site's development for a while. You'd have to ask Max, AKA @_date: 2013-04-08 13:10:20
Not really. Outlawing it would mean that no law-abiding merchant would accept Bitcoin as payment. While you're right in saying that it wouldn't kill Bitcoin outright, things like bitcoinin and bitcoinstore would have to go. It's already difficult to explain to my friends what I can buy with Bitcoin. It being illegal would only make it worse. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:07:45
You mean the site that's shown here? It seems to be hosted by CloudFlare, which offers a well-known DDOS protection service. Seems solid enough - I'd be surprised if they got through.

As said in [a reply to the parent comment](






It's not like Satoshi said "Oh, and by the way, if you want to send messages to your friends, you can use Bitcoin to do it". It's just that in the blockchain, you can find public keys. Those keys are encrypted data, and as such cannot be distinguished from random data. Because of that, "ATTACKATDAWN" is potentially a valid key. An extremely unlikely one, true, but you can't just rule it out because it looks like legible data. If you *could* rule it out, that would either mean that different clients would disagree on which transactions are legal (a fork) or that there would be a single, "official" list of invalid transactions (centralisation). Neither of those fit the idea of Bitcoin.
I do hope there's another way of solving this that I haven't seen nor though of, though. =/
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:23:21

I do agree with your point about open platforms being awful for security. I was addressing his point about open platforms being the only ones that can be secure, which I think is false.


I didn't say it was secure, either. I just meant that given enough skill and time, it would be possible to see if a certain piece open-source software was secure. With closed-source software, it is harder by a couple of orders of magnitude - you'd have to analyze machine code to do it, so it's pretty much impractical.
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:14:18
Yeah, initially the small transactions were deeper than the highest ones. However, I think that having a big, deep sound for large transactions fits better. When I think of small things, I usually think of small, rapid notes. Deep chimes are more stern to me and make me think of a giant of sorts. =)
In any case, adding a switch to the code would be pretty easy. We might end up eventually having to add a control panel to save screen estate if we add a lot of options. =P
As for the volume, big transactions really *are* louder, just... not by much. In any case, I'm not the guy in control of the site, is. It was his code that started it all, I just added pitch scaling. You can ask him if he would add that option if it was made possible. =)

Doing the right thing might seem like a losing proposition right now, but in the long run you'll feel better about it than if you kept the money. Real life karma isn't just the universe making you win a million dollars to reward you - there isn't much proof that it works that way. Real life karma is feeling good about your actions, and being able to tell them to your children one day as a lesson in honesty.

I'd say that (most) business's primary goal *is* making money, and competing on the market for desirability by customers is just a very good way of getting money. If shutting out competition has a better ROI, that's what they'll do - except for some companies that put ethics above profits.
To put it otherwise, if competing on the market for desirability by customers didn't yield any money, the company would close. Therefore, it cannot be a business's primary goal.
