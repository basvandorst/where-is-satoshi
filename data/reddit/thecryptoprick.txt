Just another small note, if you absolutely must use PayPal for transaction that you could possibly get screwed. Have them send it friends and family with a note saying that they authorize this transaction. Because friends and family transactions as far as I know cannot be disputed. But in the case of unauthorized transaction that may be able to be disputed.

I'm sorry but OP were you born yesterday? You must be an idiot, serves you right. Is this your first time using PayPal.

Wow ok, so I take back being hash. Yeah they are the freaking worst. Even eBay is going to stop using them in a couple of years when this new company comes online, very interested to see how this new company's policies work.

PayPal is the worst possible company in the world to use to do financial transactions. Even with eBay, do you not know this? I've had my PayPal account for over 10 years and even when selling things on eBay my my account is is constantly being limited and going through verification, I barely can withdraw my money from eBay purchases because of this crap. Just because something worked in the past does not mean it's the best route to go. Sorry to sound harsh but anybody that uses PayPal should know this.

Could not say it better.

The only thing PayPal is good for is buying things, because of their buyer protection. Unfortunately as a seller you're pretty much screwed because the buyer could say anything and they would side with the buyer. I have countless stories dealing with PayPal and their messed up policies. Unfortunately you had to learn the hard way, hopefully you did not lose too much.

It wasn't the Ian Coleman site that I am very familiar with. The site was some obscure crap house. I am sorry, but anyone that private messages anyone, telling them to enter their seed on some website, IMO is a scammer.

Wow, look what a scammer sent me. Do you think I am an idiot.
Please never ever enter your seed on a website.

I understand the concern. The keys were generated offline; I do have some level of trust for Samourai being open source (yes, MIM is possible). I also use a passphrase.
This is not my permanent cold wallet.

Sound advice, I plan to do this.
