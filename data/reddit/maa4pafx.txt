Keep drinking that koolaid if you want to lose your money.

Blockchain.info uses a mix of PBKFD2 (10 rounds) and PBKDF2 (5000 rounds) for it's wallet encryption. You can do hundreds of thousands of attempts a second against this even on a normal PC. It is, for all intents and purposes, child's play.

This boils down to the same nonsense that Blockchain.info pushes about "zero" trust in the service. Yes, they can't get your encrypted key.. unless they brute force the password, or change the javascript source to send back the unencrypted key. It's trust-less, as long as you trust them not to do either of those things. It's security theater and nothing more.

Anybody can attack them?

People don't believe, or rather, they don't see the complete lack of privacy and security as a particular issue. There's enough red flags about that operation's lack of any professionalism (asking people to email their passwords to them) that people should be staying well clear.

I can't look into what key stretching it uses because I don't have an identified account, if someone else wants to look at the JavaScript they use they would be able to tell you for sure how it works. 
The WarpWallet challenge is not profitable. For it to be economically viable to attack the prize would need to be several hundred BTC rather than just 20, or the price of Bitcoin would need to be substantially higher. One of the two.

Yes, I'm not saying they use the same system but it's the same fallacy that storing an encrypted copy of a key for you using JavaScript is "trustless". Someone with access to Coinbase.com's servers can obtain their key, and just brute force the stored encrypted vault keys until they find some with easy passwords. The security model either breaks down to "we promise we won't do that" or "we won't get hacked", and neither is particularly comforting on any level.

I don't know what KDF they use, but I doubt it's much better.

    Benchmarking: blockchain-opencl, blockchain My Wallet [PBKDF2-SHA1 OpenCL AES]... DONE
    Raw:	1144K c/s real, 2089K c/s virtual
Sorry, that should have been 2 million attempts a second. 


It's a human chosen key, so alarmingly small.

Nothing other than proof of work is viable for a consensus mechanism. Every other proposed solution relies on internal risk and reward (proof of stake), and therefor either relies on obfuscation or centralization to keep the network together. You're not going to build an app with a block chain and gain any measurable advantage in 99% of applications, it's an incredibly cumbersome task which can be achieved in better ways for most systems. In the case of a little used system it could even be a source of severe vulnerability.

The concept of a brainwallet is still broken no matter what you do with it.

There's actually been more than one case where they have lost money due to this. It happened when they multithreaded their RNG and didn't realise this meant the threads would have the same initial state.

You've missed the point somewhat. Someone cracking brainwallets can crack every single one of them at the same time, each attempt they get a chance at any number of those millions of addresses. There's almost much higher expected outcomes, people have lost hundreds of BTC to brainwallets in the past, versus just 10 for warpwallet.

For what, how big the key space for a users password is? I obviously can't measure that, but for the vast majority of people it's going to be under 80, maybe even 64 bits.
