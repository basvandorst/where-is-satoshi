Could not have said it better myself. +1 for you good sir :)

Wow, finally someone with brains !!!!!! +1 for you good sir. Glad to see someone caught that.
EVERYONE &lt;-- the magic key word that almost every other dipstick on this thread missed. Up vote this guy for having a working brain. More than i can say for the rest of the posts on this thread.

May i just add now that the wall of text is long enough for this post to get lost in it, this community is the easiest community in the world to troll. It is no wonder that every troll from here to Harlem has flocked to the bitcoin community. took me 30 seconds to get all your panties up in a twist.
Thanks for the morning laughs, got to go to work now.

Amen to that, entirely too many assholes in the cryptosphere these days. The entry barrier is no longer access to coins, or ability to mine. It is being able to deal with all the children and pricks that think they know it all and that their ideology are law.
+1 to you smart sir !!!!

I have never heard someone talk for so long and yet say nothing at all in my entire life. Does this guy think anyone, even non-bitcoiners take him seriously? I bet this was on a fox network wasnt it?
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:20:35
Depends on what you call "worked" i have been using it for about 3 days and found one address that contained dust (1 satoshi) not even enough for me to send it to myself, so if by worked you mean someone was able to steal bitcoin the answer from me at least is no. If you mean was able to find an address that contained bitcoin, then yes.

$289 and still falling. I'm buying not selling. Not much to lose when buying.

Good catch, Sadly, cannot edit links on reddit. :(
@_date: 2014-08-25 22:22:10
Re-tweeted, now nobody else re-tweet so i can win the miners. 
I'll even give you a sad story about my dad needing surgery, or that i am a Chinese student in need of funds, or that i need 100K for a new house. all you have to do is just not re-tweet so i can win the miners.

Would you be interested in sharing that software? I would like to try it that way as well and compare

I can promise you will be waiting a lot longer than it takes for a bubble to come out of that chest for the next bitcoin bubble.
Bitcoin was more a "look what crypto currency can do" kind of thing. The real, sustainable, adopted currency i can assure you has not been created yet. There are a TON of cryptos that have a ton of great features. Some outright blow my mind, but none fully fill the bill yet.
Go ahead and argue now, I am well aware the truth hurts for most of you who bought in so insanely high without doing homework, and the only defense you have against the pain is spitting out random blather like you are a crypto genius who knows all. But the guys with brains are well aware that what we are seeing right now in the market is the new standard for bitcoin and its volatility, $275 -$400 Is bitcoins value, the humps were just well done marketing jobs and everyone rushing in because they didnt want to miss out on that magic $10,000 a coin day. 
Sheeple are funny that way. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:06:46
Finally a logical question.
Bitcoins true value is based on a few factors. 1: the amount in supply, 2: the amount of demand for it, 3: and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the amount of money it took to extract the current supply of bitcoin from the blockchain by mining (cost of buying miners, electricity, plus a small percentage marked as an acceptable realistic profit margin)
You are correct that in the LONG run for as long as BTC can sustain its value will go up. It will be incrementally and not $10,000. Even with all 21 million mined assuming that 10-12% of them are lost for good due to lost passwords etc. and considering the average increase in energy costs annually if it keeps up at its current 10 year trend. the MAX 1 bitcoin could EVER be worth is $2,180-$2,445. That is not a random number, it is the byproduct of 5 classes of 50-70 students each (ivy league economics majors) running the numbers in a blind study (did not know anything more than the numbers, no idea it was tied to bitcoin) Over 90% of them reached the same conclusion. 
Lastly, "adoption" as everyone wants to call it, has NOTHING to do with the price or value right now as less than 0.5% of companies that accept bitcoin have adopted it. 
99.5% of companies like overstock, newegg, tiger direct, dell, etc. use bitcoin as a marketing tool. None of the big players are holding any bitcoin, not even their profits from bitcoin sales. They have not adopted it, they are simply using a third party to make it easier for you to part with your money. 99.5% of companies never see a single bitcoin, and admittedly will tell you they have no interest in obtaining any bitcoin. 
To make it clear, I AM an economics expert, a professor of economics @ one of the top 10 institutions in the world. I MYSELF DO HAVE BITCOIN, not as an investment, not because i have any disillusion of it making me rich although a good marketing ploy could spike the price again (highly unlikely as the major players have already done it and made more than they can spend in a lifetime) but, i own it because it is easy to use and makes sending money to family across the US, and friends overseas easier than tying my shoes. 
Bitcoin has changed the way money is transferred for a small percentage of the world, it has laid the framework for a new kind of money to replace the worlds current financial infrastructure, but it is not the total package or the full solution. While all of you run around chasing the "i'm going to get rich" train. One of you, or maybe a small group of you are already seeing bitcoin for what it really is, what it really lacks, and know its real limits, and are using that knowledge to already start building the first real "crypto currency" as right now Bitcoin and every other coin out there are nothing more than cryptography based digital commodities, Not money, not currency, maybe ground breaking and on the fore front of technology, but not ever going to replace or even come close to having a market share with money.
In short, Bitcoin is not currency, nor is any other crypto at current. Bitcoin is your debit card you get from your bank, without your bank. Like that small 3.75 inch piece of plastic, it holds some money for you for when you want to spend it. When you swipe that plastic card at a retail location, it transferes 1's and 0's to another parties institution meaning they now own the money. Bitcoin has actually complicated that process as it ads a 3rd step. you scan a QR code, transfer the value and now the retailer has to have a party convert that bitcoin to cash or fiat so they can actually do something with it.
Lets not all be a flock of sheeple controlled my mass marketing and advertising that get led into believing that any current crypto currency is anything more than what it really is. Spend a few minutes and burn a little energy letting a few neurons fire and have a thought of your own not influenced by all the marketing and advertising that has been pumped in there when it comes to what current cryptos really are. You will quickly realize that all i have done is put the obvious into text, those who argue are not capable of their own thought process and are the future cast of "Idiocracy the reality show" much like the movie.

Got this set up last night, Was amazingly fast, Did a 5gb output file in about an hour and a half. Good job guys!
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:22:08
I find it almost amusing how many people in this community smoke crack frequently enough to even dream up this shit. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:50:17
Circulation. i could write a short novel about it but publishing it would only prelude more of the hype, pump, fud, trolling, and idiocy of those who are clueless. It has seriously made me begin to question when they started handing out PHd's at the bottom of cracker jack boxes. I had to put in 12 years in school at the cost over 1.1 million dollars for mine. But it seems that all the cracker jacks have it all figured out and are more than happy to share their rocket science opinions about it which defy most every published law of economics known to the human race. 
Think of all the bitcoin i could have bought for the cost of my education and just went and bought a $1.99 box of cracker jacks to get my PHd. 
Boy do i feel like an idiot. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:30:37
No, its fact, and your not wrong. but the exchanges can only do that for so long. It has already been done and stopped. Now the continuing price drop is panic selling, i.e. morons saying "hey i will sell you my bitcoin for $300 a coin because i have no brains" But then turning around and crying about that they only got $300 a coin for it. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:04:44
You seem to be missing the point, This is about people crying about the price of BTC not about introducing it to new people or the free market.
I have no arguments as to anything you have said. I am just answering the question that all the cry babies keep balling about.

From what i understand is the not released yet part or the future of the project is a little more complicated. OCL vanitygen for sure generates them faster, but they can only be written to a file so fast. It appears they are data basing them into a large catalog like a giant wallet client.
Makes sense to me at least, bitcoin is always moving, although there are a few million addresses with bitcoin, as it continues to grow, there are several times more addresses that have been used or could be used in the future.

Done 
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:59:09
He is. It is amazing the amount of crap you read on this sub-reddit. everyone trying to influence price in some fashion, and yet 95% of them don't even know why it is really falling right now. 
This price drop has about as much to do with weak hands, miners, politics or commercial mining facilities as the cost of a blowie in NYC does.

Because people were in a race to get their hands on some meaning the sellers could keep raising their prices.

Not about the t-shirts though. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:21:53
Despair? are you kidding? i cashed out in november of last year and have not owned bitcoin until last week again when the masses of idots decided they would sell it for $300 a coin, i am thrilled. I was just stating the obvious to the cry babies so they could stop with the water works. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:54:26
So many paragraph long replies all to get to a very simple point.
BITCOIN GETS STOLEN DUE TO PEOPLE BEING CARELESS WITH SECURITY OF THEIR FUNDS !
Its that easy, Thank you, tips appreciated. LOL
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:55:35
Posts like this are why bitcoin has such a hard time being taken seriously by new comers.
