I don't think MAS intends to regulate virtual currency intermediaries like money changing/remittance service. Money changing and remittance services have to furnish a $100,00 security deposit and perform due dilligence checks for transactions above $5,000 (money changers).
These "new" regulations (as mentioned in their latest guidance) seem much more similar to SVF guidelines and clauses in the Payment Systems Act, which local VC exchanges already have to comply with. **Its good to see the government paying more attention to Bitcoins**, I just hope they won't make things too difficult for us and other businesses dealing with VC on a day 2 day basis.
Hope this helps!

i posted an explanation above. essentially, the gov is trying to regulate the businesses dealing with bitcoins, not the the "coins".

you purchase it with cash and go on to their site to redeem $X worth of bitcoin at the spot price. the key is confusing i know. and not too sure how it complies with AML/KYC. ID upon purchase or redemption?

yes, it is difficult to keep up with the level of tenacity and enthusiasm. which is why i log on to to make myself feel good again. i personally do not own many btc (bought @ $5XX), but i have invested quite a bit around bitcoin. 
  FB/youtube are both public companies(or part of one) with a goal to satisfy end users like us, at the same time squeezing out $$ for investors. dont be too negative about them. i feel that it is still a great platform for connecting. 
  although these tech giants are making tons of money, they contribute back to the society in some ways. life is never perfect, and the same applies for companies.   
  what do u think bitcoin will be without these ups and downs?

cant disagree with you but u seem rather critical in most of your comments. do u think zuck and his team started fb to make billions to drive supercars and buy islands?
