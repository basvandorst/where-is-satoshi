Thank you for your opinion.
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:30:57
You are correct, I am just saying that that is what I interpret as Bitcoin seizure.
Take the private keys, send them to another public key address that is freshly generated, etc..
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:14:48
The rules of the blockchain cannot be changed without a significant amount of clients updating as well.
Also, I would also argue this is the BEST part of it.
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:11:28
Uh, it has more to do with the few grand of computer equipment...
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:08:11
Which has *always* been the case.
In other words, 'downloading a virus on the internet will give you a virus' is not as exciting a headline...
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:14:22
Sounds like they took his wallet files from offline storage devices.
That's called theft.
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:09:41
They are not wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:30:34
Good luck with that.
Two high risk ventures.. put them together? Ungodly high risk.
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:08:17
The person who wrote this headline (and the editor who approved it) knew exactly what they were implying. The explicit and implicit difference between tax evasion, and tax avoidance, for instance..
The 'journalist' fucks in charge do this just to annoy people and get people talking. To get more views.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:24:21
So.. bad actors would focus on changing the head block. Or perhaps the extreme past.
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:59:28
What the fuck? Their funding is yanked, their webhosts are pulled..
This is a dirty, dirty campaign going on...
@_date: 2012-02-19 21:04:15
Essentially, without laundering, the Bitcoin addresses that receive that money are toxic.
@_date: 2012-03-02 04:26:49
Yeah.. for real. Don't ascribe to malice what you can to stupidity. But don't concern yourself with the differences.
@_date: 2012-06-25 03:48:36
It should be left up. You've given more attention to this risk for bitcoin-selling-noobs. Legitimate concern and awareness is the best defense.
@_date: 2012-08-19 22:39:48
That is. Let's hope it's not hacked within the first year. Srsly. It seems like every day another bitcoin market is hacked.. :\
@_date: 2012-02-14 06:26:44
It's amazing at how meta it's getting. Previously, currency was a promise to redeem something for a piece of paper. Then it was tied something with value + physical. Then the +physical was removed. Then credit. Then inflation. Even the 'bad guys' do the same thing!
@_date: 2012-02-19 21:02:03
Yeah.. if Symantec was able to actually have Bitcoin and sent it to a random Bitcoin address.. EVERYONE would be watching exactly where all that money goes to.
@_date: 2012-09-10 07:09:20
People can still shitlist that address. Then all poisoned transactions can be traced back to the source, all transactions can be made void from ones that go here. So there's that.
@_date: 2012-02-19 21:05:14
You could, if it is traced back to you, worth it to prosecute, and Bitcoin is treated like money in the eyes of the law.
@_date: 2012-09-11 00:04:09
@_date: 2012-02-21 04:48:30
If I am reading that right.. it takes a month and some change to successfully solve a block. Is that right?
@_date: 2012-02-12 17:40:00
I mean, is the 'transaction fee' increase to be that significant to make it worth it still? I mean, by that time severe deflation would kick in and the fees would be really.. small.. right?
@_date: 2012-08-19 23:01:52
Do you really have MasterCard as a backer of this type of credit/debit card?
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:16:29
Oh hell yes.. hopefully that app gets some third part API support and a nice, sexy open source architecture. It could really take off.
@_date: 2012-02-21 04:49:46
Yeah.. you're asking for donations for someone else to buy you hardware for you to make money? Come on. 
@_date: 2012-02-19 21:03:02
The assumption, of course, is that the site that you are using to do this doesn't secretly record all those arrestable details of your initial transaction.
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:54:05
Now the big question: Is it open source? 
@_date: 2012-02-19 20:22:42
It's weird.. the thing that is destroying Bitcoin isn't a backlash against a new currency, but incompetency.
@_date: 2012-02-19 20:44:06
Can you comment about his interpretation please nawariata?
@_date: 2012-03-02 04:39:23
That is bad phrasing. 
We shouldn't go about it that way. :P
"Oh man, if suckers can blow 1.5 billion on this guys shitty money.. WE'LL SHOW YOU SHITTY MONEY"
@_date: 2012-02-14 06:27:52
Oh. That's so obvious I feel dumb for asking. :P
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:51:00
It's more about cataloging vulnerabilities. No backdoor is needed if the manufacturer does it, just document it.
Unfortunately, it's anyone who wants to exploit it.
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:46:11
Just think ahead one *or two* steps...
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:41:11
I believe you hit the nail on the head.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:41:15


Right. And opportunists will be there to record and catalog them.
Sometimes another person's misstep is your advantage. They simply make note of it. For.. later... purposes. If necessary.
But yes, incompetence works to others' advantage.
Both our points can be valid concurrently.
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:56:55
Who are you and why should we trust you with a metric shitton of money, Bitcoin or otherwise?
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:09:18
Then give people a reason to spend money. Sell something worthwhile.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:51:38
Yeah.. that little stunt they tried to pull earlier really shook investor confidence. People are very, very pissed.. they're definitely looking for alternative means of storing value now.
Who knows, maybe Bitcoin will take off even further?
It's not like they can stop people from using the cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:19:35
That is very, very disingenuous. The implication of the post is that 'omg bitcoin is so much better than gold' is really dangerous.
Bitcoin's price has been in relative flux, has a smaller market, and has a shorter time to prove itself. All of those things make for uncertainty in value.
I hate it every time people compare Bitcoin to gold. Yes, it's a commodity like any other and therefore we can place value in it (just like cow commodity trading and forex markets), but that means absolutely nothing in terms of stability because of all the other HUGE factors involved.
People shouldn't be considering Bitcoin OR gold.. invest in a diverse portfolio instead.
@_date: 2013-01-30 17:28:13
My question is: what happened to all of those bitcoin wallets that the first bitcoins generated were sent to? The first transactions in the bitcoin chain meant some that there were some really big wallets out there.. Lots and lots and lots of bitcoin just sort of in private wallets. Rich if they decide to cash out..
Now as bitcoin are harder to generate..  
I am just wondering about this stuff.
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:03:29
It's as almost as if any currency can be used to buy things people want.
@_date: 2013-08-31 07:50:29
Ding ding ding! We have a winner.
That is the only solid way to prove this. And easy to verify. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 07:55:52
If a huge influx of bad actors come into play.. and enough of them.. they can engage in double-spend and all sorts of other behavior.. basically taking over the swarm that dictates what the next block in the block chain will be.
Bad juju for anyone else. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:24:57
Watch him put a Bitcoin miner on every idle facebook client. Oh dear god. The riches.
@_date: 2013-08-31 07:50:59
Bitcoin hashes are harder to forge.
@_date: 2013-08-06 00:50:47
And good luck actually getting any USD back!
