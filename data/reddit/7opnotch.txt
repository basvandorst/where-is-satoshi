Thanks for the heads-up. Nothing has changed with my client. I haven't installed or uninstalled nad haven't had any prior issues.
Now I am having difficulty connecting a server (It's selected as automatically find a server) However, I am "synchronizing"

Thank you Rosie --- it appears refreshing electrum and not "restarting it" was the resolution. I just found it odd that the individual transaction my history page for coinbase showed over 600k+ confirmed transactions.

&amp; Can confirm there is roughly .03 in his wallet --- plenty to send. (&amp; he doesnt have any other unconfirmed transactions or pending transactions outside of just sending me the .0004)

Ahhh ok --- so there is nothing that can be done to "push" this transaction for .0004 through but you are recommending in the future to look from single inputs because it requires a much smaller fee?

whats the best way to go about trying to retrieve the wallet.dat file from the harddrives? I have 2 from around 2010-2011 one that i had Bitcoin Core on, it was my first wallet. I dont believe I have anything on there but I would like to check --- i believe the drives however have failed/are failing. One is a Receritifed WD Cavier IDE Hard Drive 120 GB. The other a WD Cavaier IDE 80 GB Hard Drive

I just had my friend try to do a .0028 fee for the transaction....he receives this error still: 
"electrum cannot bump fee: could not find suitable outputs"
He has the most up to date version of electrum.

I do not have anything in my wallet to spend ---- I am somewhat confused when you say we should hand-pick larger inputs for the transactions.
I typically just copy an address from my address list that I haven't used before and send that to him --- in which he copies and pastes into the send box on Electrum.  
The problem is I'm trying to send the .012 to coinbase (and I can't use this money until 3 confirmations) but this confirmation is being held up by the unconfirmed parent of .0004 (the transaction my friend is sending me)   I "spent" the .0004 (its included in my outgoing transaction to coinbase for .012) so I'm not sure if that is causing a problem. But this .0004 has been unconfirmed for days now --- and still hasnt fallen off.

Believe it was .03xxxxxx btc in the wallet.

Thank you so much!!! I really appreciate the time you took to explain things to me.
Here is my concern: I had an incoming transaction from a friend for .0004   --- he used .0004 for the fee as well. Here is the ID:
It appears this is the "unconfirmed" parent... because .0004 of the .012 I sent to coinbase is part of this transaction.
He has tried to increase the fee multiple times on electrum (also used RBF) but he has received several errors in effort when trying to rebroadcast the transaction:
1)electrum cannot bump fee: could not find suitable outputs
2) the transaction was rejected by network rules. (66: insufficient fee)
when i had to try to increase the fee to .001 he said he received this error:
bad-txns-vout empty
What can I have him do ---- so this .0004 transaction goes through ASAP... and how do you bypass the errors he is receiving when he re-broadcasts the TX 
Thanks again

This is not correct... I was over at his house earlier trying to help him with this transaction. He has plenty to cover an increased fee
Thats why I am confused.....
