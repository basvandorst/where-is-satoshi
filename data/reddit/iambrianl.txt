Outside of those exchanges, you can use gate.io and etherdelta as well.

No. You still have to use gdax or gemini as an on ramp. Usually I purchase ether then send it to one of those exchanges to purchase alts. Ether because it transfers between wallets faster and cheaper than bitcoin, and because there are often many ether trading pairs available. Otherwise you would need to trade into bitcoin before buying alts.

This OP just spammed the shit out of so many subreddits with this piece of shit article, so I'll post my response to it in everyone of them.
 I truly hate bullshit articles from no name bullshit websites that post clickbait garbage as "news", and I blame the OPs that go around posting this crap all over reddit. I wouldn't be surprised if the OP was the author of these shit articles, or is compensated by the no name sites for posted the garbage. 
This article isn't even correct. The findings were not from the IRS, they were from a Credit Karma study based on 250,000 people that have not just filed their returns already, but did so using credit karma (who the fuck uses credit karma for taxes? No one. Less than 3% of the US population). First, 250,000 is a pretty tiny sample size. Second, there is no indication as to whether those 250,000 filers were even invested in cryptocurrency. Third, the other survey cited had a sample size of only 2,000, which is an absurdly small sample size to extrapolate from. Fourth, when you take into account the small percentage of Americans invested in crypto, and the fact that the demographics for people who invest in crypto do not overlap with the demographics for people likely to file their taxes early, this article and the "findings" become utterly flawed.

Yeah, it was frustrating at first, particularly when I wanted to get into alts. You can still use Bittrex, Kucoin, and Binance.

The site is such garbage and the articles are bullshit. Everything that is mentioned occurred months ago or is based on information that was noted for being flawed. Yet it cites to it as being a cause for price declines today. Why the authors take the time to write these articles and why people post links to them on reddit is beyond obvious. Please DOWNVOTE stupidity like this.
