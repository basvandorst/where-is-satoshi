Good! I have been going around with a BIP38 key in my hand for 6 months now . 
finally an app does the trick ! Thanks mycelium, and thank you mister for pushing for it.
EDIT: when will this feature pushed to production?

actually moderate inflation is good for the economy 
@_date: 2014-12-25 12:39:23
What is the workflow in the first case?  
Open the app, "send" .... then approaching the tag to my nexus 5 triggers the default app (New tag collected) to read "bitcoin:xxxxxx", not mycelium

Hi there.  While I understand what you say about multisig I'm not sure what you are saying about bip38.  Where is the unencrypted private key?  If you generate a new encrypted key the unencrypted is never displayed here.

Since you are here, I take the chance .
You know, what would be really useful for people with the implant?  Storing the private key in the tag is cool, but after the newspaper covered the story of BTC under my skin, well, there is nothing much.
What is useful, imho, for mycelium users is add an option for replacing the pin code with the NFC. 
My hand is the 2FA, not the store of value.

Hi, I would like to add [MADE makerspace]( to the list , barcelona first makerspace and extremely crypto friendly . Here is why the BTC community should help us : 
* We host bitcoin workshops (  )
* the official bitcoin meetup (  )
* we produce and sell cold storage on wooden cards  (  )
* we hold our reserve in bitcoins 
* we accept membership payments and donations in btc and ltc 
* we have a home-made sign at the entrance "BITCOIN ACCEPTED HERE" with the QR (  ) 
* we convinced the fabcafe upstair (first in europe) to accept btc... (  )
* we got 'El Mundo' and other spanish newspaper talking about BTC (only offline sorry) 
* in the [coworking upstairs]( we work closely with some of the smartest bitcoin startups around ( pelle from kipochi is here, and also bitcoin mining (stealth) companies  ) 
* We  had 220 members in one year(freaky geeks) and counting. 
* We are moving to a larger space right in the middle of barcelona with huge exposure (ground floor, glass doors, next to la rambla)
* In June we will host the makerfair here which will gave a lot of to any BTC-related project . If we get funded we will build something BIIIIIGGG BIGGG BIGGGG ;)  ( )
And we struggle to pay the monthly rent . With some funds we will organize BTC hackatlon, more workshops, build ATMS, BTC signs, stickers, campaigns, hack around webplatforms and ... you name it. 
Please consider adding us to the list of hackerspaces that need assistance;)

Don't want to loose them? get them engraved on wood, no need to be techie, use  and 
Install download Kivy (required for the UI), clone and run from github :
    git clone git
Disconnect from the internet and make sure you are using a clean machine (better a Live DVD) and execute the tool
    cd bippy
    kivy bippy.py
The program will prepare URLs you can copy-paste in the browser to place the order with your keys. Enjoy.

What is a good example of a bitcoin-friendly state in Europe?
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:05:42
Totally makes sense making BIP32/BIP44 cold storage cards. This is not my first occupation now so I did not have chances to improve on it much. As long as I am concerned people can type anything they want in the private key field, there is no BIP38 check. I did some wallet with electrum seeds encrypted, thanks to Sam from bippy.org allowing a variation of BIP38 encryption of it.
I did not progress much on visual cryptography. I also posted a bounty in the makerspace where I work without much success. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:32:24
where? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:58:26
No you don't have to trust your friends, only mathematics. You MUST encrypt your private key with a passphrase.
 That will add an additional layer of security, like two factors authentication.
To retrieve your coins you must combine something that you have ( the wooden wallet) with something that you know (your encryption password ) .
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:24:07

Thank you! 
For sure the intermediate passphrase is a very very good option, indeed bit2factor is the tool I recommend in the howto  . 
However I don't want to rely on computer-generated randomness and bit2factor doesn't support physical randomness input yet. I'm doing a fork with additions and also support for altcoins which are important to me to provide a unique and simple shop interface. Soon I'll only accept intermediate passphrases

@_date: 2014-03-01 12:04:07
Hello! 
a month ago I asked on r/litecoin if anybody would be interested in me playing with the lasecutter to produce wallets...
After so much trial and error, I'm proud of the results: the details are amazing and the QR scans perfectly.
Two days ago I handed the first Woodwallet to Jon Matonis ,president of Bitcoin foundation. 
Today I'm releasing it here with a 20% discount if you use *"earlybird"* as coupon code . Honestly, this subreddit scares me a bit and thats why I would love to have your feedback!
As for now we'll accept only limited amounts while streamlining the process.  
PS: before you ask: *No, you don't have to send your private key!* We accept only BIP38 encrypted keys ;) You can read the tutorials I and the FAQs... that might be useful even if you are not interested in getting a woodwallet!
Here I am, ask me anything.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:31:32
they can do much worse than that actually!
@_date: 2014-08-26 08:30:03

You send BTC, the other party receives an SMS and withdraw cash at hundreds ATMs, and the fee is minimal

Not even a paid web application is available.
I cannot make him compute the amount all the time, it has to be as easy as making an invoice : coffe, croassaint, tack, pay! This *is* a technical limitation.

MK did not find the problem... the other way around.

There are several of these plugins, including coinbase, bitpay, coinpayments...
What a sensationalistic headline for nothing
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:16:26
yeah, not really :
ATM withdrawal	2% (min. $3, max. $15)
I had pretty bed experience with OKpay, fees, waiting for documentation approved, EUR/USD horrible rates...
EDIT : "If the Card remains inactive for 180 consecutive days, there is a monthly dormancy fee"  ... WTF, I should delete my account now.

Hi mind-blender, I have SSL and I'm using a signed cert ;)
The browser is forced to use https as soon as you press checkout. I guess you didn't get a woallet, yet? ;)  
Thank you for the feedback!

Don't worry I also lost coin on Gox . 
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:33:24
Thanks. I sent you a PM with the case ID.
Its a bit disappointing, however,  to see support noticing a post on reddit before a support ticket with "URGENT"  in the title. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:54:12
I have a different opinion on the matter. I've been with them since 2012, when I was following Brian's activity as a solo founder in YC. Back then he would manually welcome every new user with 0.05 BTC. . Coinbase always provided excellent service to the community and myself as a merchant, mobile bitcoin wallet user, bitcoin trader and bitcoin holder (vault).
This is why I am surprised to see this happening now :/
FYI: as for now, no one replied to my ticket (nor did to my PM) and I still "can't see" part of my balance.  
EDIT: John M notified he is working on it. :)

There is a webservice somehwere, where you send an amount of bitcoin, then you can split in N part (10,100,1000) and print each wallet in a nice format.
I used it to do giveaways during workshops and meetups.
No I don't remember the name

Hey there, here founder of now defunct woodwallets.io ... 
Great to see some followup

a voting system now would be handy

Don't forget the tabacco's industry propaganda ("What is that, an e-cig?") 
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:19:38
Do you have any evidence of what you are saying? 
How do you plan surviving with no income?  Not everybody has accumulated enough wealth to live 25 years with no revenue. And more than half of europeans are unable to save at the end of the month. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:36:57
Have you even noticed this is relevant for bitcoiners? 
   there is an entire section called Use Bitcoins, which nobody here is reading, because its getting downvoted.
This is childish

what does it mean "the miner keeps" ?
When exactly?  When she mines a new block?  When it processes the tx?  What does she see in the client? an incoming TX?   
please be more specific
@_date: 2015-07-23 07:04:28
disruptive new design. and the icon of a credit card to represent TXs? epic

I think you are confusing state-funded pensions vs. private funded pension plans, where you'll get back your own money* regardless of other people's investments. 
*of course there is no such thing as your own money, but still

Didn't had time to keep up as I wanted.

the word pool itself often implies "several people"...So when you say that this will benefit everybody BUT 5 players, you are wrong.
Pool mining IS already somehow distributing hashpower

There is something I don't understand about lightlist : how do you get the money back if the campaign fails?
With lighthouse multisig desktopclient, your funds never leave your wallet until campaign hit target

 normally uses encryption to protect your information. When Chrome tried to connect to  this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. Either an attacker is trying to pretend to be  or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
