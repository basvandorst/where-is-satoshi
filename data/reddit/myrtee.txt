Actually it will be *more* restrictive, in the sense that, foreign currency is taxable just for possessing it (correct me if I'm wrong, Internet). Whereas for now, it is only taxable if you realize a gain on it. In other words, no matter if you make a gain or not you'll be taxed if it's considered foreign currency.

You are right in what you say about bitcoin : It is meant to ease transactions by having no middle-man/institution.
As you say, bitcoin is and should be exchanged for goods and services. It is precisely because of this that the bitcoin has the value of what it is exchanged for.
Therefore, it automatically generates a self-value (which is determined by the trust and validity other merchants recognize in the currency).
Thus, thinking of a BTC into an amount of $ is more than normal, as I said before, for the bitcoin to be exchanged it has to have a value to know what it can be exchanged for, so the person that receives it can exchange it again for something else.
What I'm saying is : **it's not possible to NOT determine a value for a bitcoin, because otherwise it cannot be used as a means of exchange.**
And all item with value = possible profit by exchanging better. (Even if you reject or dislike this idea, it will always be)
Regarding your second part, this has to do with people dealing with bitcoin as a secure currency and not having sufficient knowledge on what they are doing and who they are exactly trusting.
It is a trust issue. Although maybe highly unlikely, it could happen with your bank institution as well.
In any case, I do agree that the bitcoin was meant to ease transactions and is just becoming a huge mess because of people dealing in an irresponsible manner with it whilst knowing there is a limited amount of bitcoins there will be in circulation...
Any comments appreciated.

The major threats I can think of :
1. **Bitcoin is not mainstream.** Bitcoin is hard to use, hard to understand, and can be intimidating to the everyday Joe. It's going to be difficult and it's going to take a long time to make it understandable and useable by the vast majority of people. The risk exists that it may never happen. Therefore, it may not be accepted as a valid means of exchange in the future, if it still struggles with rendering it accessible.
2. **Bitcoin is a direct threat towards governments and banking institutions.** Because it does promote black market transactions, money laundering, fiscal evasion and such, governments won't be as likely to accept it, and if they do, they will monitor it with a very sensitive eye. As to banking institutions it's self-explanatory : Bitcoin is popular because there is no middle-man. Banks exists because they make money being the middle man. Bitcoin is a threat to their utility and their existence.
3. **You can lose your Bitcoins very easily**. Whether it might be a lost private key, that you got hacked or that your dog ate your paper wallet, the fact that you can very easily lose your bitcoins is real. Banking institutions do that for other people, but you have to protect it on your own, from the world.
4. **You must be ready to accept bitcoin as a currency as valid as the $**. If you can't keep your bitcoins, or think of it as : "Ah it's worth X dollars now!" then you are not investing in the idea, you are speculating on its exchanged value in the hopes of making more money. A very common question people ask me about bitcoin is : "But where can I exchange bitcoins for money?"
Truth is, Bitcoin *is* money, and if it can be exchanged for everything in the world, replacing what your dollars can do, then it succeeded. But this problem refers to number 1, making it available to all; then problem 2, making it accepted by all.
5. **Bitcoin is experimental**. I hear this a lot of times misinterpreted, bitcoin is a revolution and might not survive. It may just be a first template for a new, improved crpyto-currency (or property, as you wish), because the code is open-source and anyone can use it. Therefore, the risk that having a new, improved coin appear on the market is very real.
6. **Overall, Bitcoin is very risky, maybe too risky**. Too many shady areas are present in the bitcoin. We don't know who the creator is really (therefore we can't really contact this person for explanations on it), no regulations and regulating institution, non-politic, absolutely new and thus unpredictable. And last but not least : Bitcoin is vulnerable to attacks (I'm talking about being able to make a pool that has 51% of the overall computer power for the blockchain. If that pool is dishonest, it can break the bitcoin easily).
edit : Some quotes I got from [this site]( that I found particularly interesting, might be relevant to you:
This refers to problem 


This refers to problem  &amp; the fact that Bitcoin has a limited (finite) volume (21m)

Several questions :
1. What is "Hashing", or the activity to "Hash" prior to mining?
2. How exactly are bitcoins created through mining? (If someone can give a dumbed down version of this, it would be perfect. Imagine explaining it to your father or brother)
3. On another topic, what exactly is the purpose of the Chinese ban on BTC? Why do they do that, what are their motives? (Is it *really* market manipulation? That answer seems too easy to me).
Any help appreciated!

I do agree with you (that the circumstances are the same in a purely cash transaction), and I did discuss that matter with my friends. Nonetheless we came to the conclusion that, in a cash transaction, you always know the identity of the other person/party. Also, it is easier for the government to make some research on that person/party (for example to check if past scams were done), rendering any repercussion easier to make.
In other words : **The fact that you are anonymous enhances repercussion evasion, and thus, can enhance by the same, ease and willingness to scam and such**
I agree however that law enforcement can be made present due to the new status of the US gov towards bitcoin. But this doesn't change the fact that parties can, and remain anonymous on will. Therefore, to secure transactions, parties will want to have informations on the identity of the other trader, thus rendering the anonymous status of the bitcoin *kinda* useless.
Concerning multisig, I heard about it and have to inform myself on it! Anyway, big thanks for the heads up.

Growth could not necessarily indicate that btc is being widely adopted (or not), it could also indicate that other currencies are inflating and worth less than before. The deflationnary nature of btc means its intrisinc price shouldn't vary because of inflation, but it also would he highly unlikely to be stable specifically because of the inflationnary nature of fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:56:38
I agree most with 250k, because the average transactions per day amount to approx 200k (seen on blockchain.info).
Of course a same user can have several transactions per day, because you must send bitcoins to someone meaning there are always 2 people involved in a transaction meaning there is at least 100k people using bitcoins if we exclude people sending btc to themselves (transferring). That's my best guess.
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:23:33




Additionally please bear in mind:
**The major threat to bitcoin depends on the acceptance of the US government towards it.** If the USA emits a ban similar to the Chinese ban, bitcoin will surely slowly die. (Imagine outrageously taxing merchants who use bitcoins, closing all BTC trading plateforms, making it ultimately so difficult to use it would be impossible).
This threat was very real because Bitcoin goes against some governmental principles (it does facilitate to some degree black market transaction, I'm thinking of TOR and silk road, anonymity, fiscal evasion, money laundering and such). On top of that, Banking systems (which are very powerful) are also threatened by the BTC, and the government also uses banks to make some money.
**Remember** the government is the most powerful system in each respective country, as it controls all subsequent public institutions, it controls banks, it controls the currency (via the National Bank), the armed forces, the jurisdiction and law system, and much more.
**In short, taxing the bitcoin is a form of recognition and acceptation of the bitcoin by the government.** If the US government can make money off the bitcoin, it won't ban it, erasing the largest fear put on the bitcoin to this day.
So in the end, the tax might not be such a bad thing, please think farther and reconsider.
Any comments appreciated!

The first step to accepting a government's authority is to recognize it is there. (anarchism enabled).
If you truly, dearly want to fight against this tax regulation, simply do not pay it. You will be doing what is called tax evasion, but I just call it not accepting arbitrary harmful imposition. If you keep your anonymity tight on the net (including surfing, email, electronic wallets, exchange platforms, forums, etc.) nothing could possibly make you discoverable.
All anarchist thoughts aside, if you want to fight the system in its rules, what are you/people proposing?

I see, extremely interesting explanation! Thank you. I'm not familiar with noise ratios but your explanation is very clear, I understood it very easily. Of course concerning the intrinsic value, bitcoin or any other form of currency is worth what you are ready to exchange it for.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by being "an intrinsic value bug". What do you mean by that?
Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone atm.
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:51:43
Yes of course, I meant that inflation is one of the factors that could influence the price of bitcoin but in the end it might not be a solid indicator of "real growth".
Another point I am thinking of is, how can we measure bitcoin's worth (or real growth) precisely if the volatility of bitcoin persists?
Now bitcoin is given a fiat value because it is hard to assess what it is really worth. How could that change in the future? If in 6 years the value hasn't changed, there is definitely something not going right with either adoption, frequency of use, real utility or even government restriction.

The rumor of Chinese ban which cut off access to main exchange platforms in China (no trading is possible but withdrawal is).
People (mostly in China) subsequently sold/tried selling to prevent any possible and further loss (which would be a good idea IF the bitcoin is going to definitely crash to an unrecoverable point, and IF the Chinese ban remains and is not just a rumor but a long-lasting new regulation).
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:21:29
If you're absolutely new, try r/bitcoinbeginners and bitcoin.org,
it should give you a basic explanation of where to start!
Just a little heads up to start with Bitcoin :
1. You need a bitcoin wallet (we could translate that into a bitcoin bank account), you can check some up on bitcoin.org (Electrum is an easy one to start with, and is fairly secure)
2. You need to inform yourself on security issues, there are wonderful threads on r/bitcoinbeginners
3. You can buy bitcoins on the internet, some of the most common websites are :
   - Coinbase.com (pay by bank wire transfer for Bitcoins)
   - Bitstamp.net (same as Coinbase)
   - Localbitcoins (pay by bank, cash, meet in person etc. Although I personally think this website can be frightening because it looks a little more dodgy to use than the previous ones).
There are more of them but in priority you MUST inform yourself on how to protect your money first. There are several methods to do so, from very insecure to very paranoid-secure.
Once you are familiar with securing your coins via several methods, then throw yourself in. It can be confusing at first but is in reality very easy. I'm going to write a guide shortly (hopefully) since I can't seem to find all the info in one place and I also had a hard time starting with bitcoin myself (I started two weeks ago!)
Good luck it's great when you know how to use it!

Question for you guys:
FYI I was talking about the bitcoin concept to some friends, and the discussion came up to this point, where I wasn't able to answer.
1. (IMO, of what I understand of bitcoin) Bitcoin provides a certain degree of anonymity. But this anonymity can constitute a threat in the sense that, there can be no repercussions on a party if we don't even know who and where this party is.
Example : I pay someone for a service. That person never provides the service. What can I do, what legal action, or enforcing action, or repercussion will there be against the thief?
Is it a reality that I can get so easily scammed and not be able to prosecute the thief, as opposed to actual currencies? (where most information is knowable, and a re-imbursment + repercussion are possible to a certain degree).
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:55:36

Thank you for your answer!
This raises another question, if you don't mind me asking.
How would an escrow be useful, if let's say, I accomplish a service (or sell/send a good), but the other party claims to have never received it?
Would I have to prove delivery to the escrow services for them to unfreeze the coins? (Subsequently, what if proof of delivery is impossible?) I know I might sound a little bit extreme and punctilious, but if you can bring any light to these, I would be much grateful.
@_date: 2014-03-31 09:25:01
I'm not an expert, but here's my best answer:
You have several options, of which the most commonly used are:
1. Bitcoin exchanges (buy from a website). You have several sites like Bitstamp.net (international), or Coinbase that offer to buy bitcoin directly from them. You can then trade them as you wish (sell/buy $/btc), or send them to another address.
2. Buy from a person. Websites like localbitcoins.com is a platform that will connect users who want to sell/buy bitcoins to other users who wish to do the same. You may find people in Iceland willing to sell you some bitcoins (either by cash or by bank wire payment).
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:47:35


The reason why China pumped it... I have no idea, they don't follow a rational approach to bitcoin, neither to send it up nor to bring it down.
My best explanation is that today was pay day for the Chinese people. This is what could have possibly caused a very high demand in such a small timeframe.
Other than that, I frankly don't know.

Thank you, I understand Hashing better now and I get how it works. But this just made another question pop-up in my head (if you don't mind of course).
Who exactly is the someone/something that rewards the "miner" for finding the hash closest to 0?
Is it the whole pool, is a transaction fee automatically debited from the original block? (I know this may sound stupid to ask, thank you nonetheless)

@_date: 2015-10-30 08:45:19
I kind of disagree. True, The Economist is not actual journalism but they are, like any other magazine, biased with their own political and economical views.
The Economist is on the liberal political and economical spectrum. Anything that's anti-governmental (or at least hinders gvt control) and for the free market (think Adam Smith) is very interesting to them. Why? Because their readers think alike, they are economically and politically liberal. Their target market is also highly educated and mostly american.
Bitcoin is a topic that is interesting for them, to convince readers about their views and their ideas, not necessarily to report what is actually going on. But like every previous topic they have written on, this is not actual journalism because they are voluntarily hiding information that goes against their views. So please be a bit cautious about what you are reading.
What you are saying is, for me, putting The Economist maybe in a too good light than they really are.

Absolutely, thanks for the tip. I wanted to take a few examples with some current economic problems we have (like the automatic exchange of information, freezing assets in China, the liquidity trap Yen has fallen in and such). So not only in Switzerland but in the world. I'm still thinking about what examples could be the best to raise though, I want to try to make the students question themselves after the presentation!
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:53:42
I see. I have not really thought of it as a store of value, definitely a very strong point there. For the blockchain I will of course talk about it and I am thinking of presenting it along those lines (to answer to your first point):
When the price crashes, miners that can't cover their fees will basically go out of business (either definitely or indefinitely). This will make the mining difficulty decrease and will therefore invite other smaller miners to maybe start mining. Of course if there is no hashing power because the rewards are too low then the security will be compromised. However, as long as there are a sufficient number of miners out there and people believing in the idea, then the protocol will survive. Regardless, thank you for your input, appreciate it
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:18:15
