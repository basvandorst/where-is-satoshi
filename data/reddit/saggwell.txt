Great news, will you be paying out bitcoin for used vinyl? I got a few LP's I might let go if you do.

tell me about it, I wouldn't trust my £/Bitcoins to thouse guys they look like young tories, and the one in the middle is giving me the creeps.

Then we build more electronics, then the banks say, hey we kept all our records in an underground CME proof bunkers, your all still in debt suckers!

If the government did create it's own one, could the bitcoin network do a 51% attack and take it over while it was still relatively small?

I have no idea but I hope so at least for a while, then people are more likely to spend their bitcoin on the stuff I have on bitmit, no one likes spending coin when it's surging up.

If you intend to trade on mt.gox then I guess it would come in handy but I would do that when you've gained a better understanding of bitcoin, I haven't gotten into trading yet might do that when I get more bitcoin to play with and when I can be bothered to go though the verification process. I use Blockchain.info's android app but I only keep a small amount on there since I freaked out when they went down and imported most of my keys into Multibit.

Nice idea, Dubstep Dispute gets my coin! But do i need to register? it seems to want me to.

Your right we are being a little harsh on Amir, I agree with his points and believe his sincere it's just that I don't think his cut out for the job of representing bitcoin on TV. I'm sure he does lots of other good work in the bitcoin sphere.

Yes at [mpex](

You can also get spore prints for nearly free from  and other spore rings but you will have to make the cakes and syringes your self, probably easier to get a kit from this guy but if you want a challenge try growing from a print.

You mean me right? It being my first post I see why you'd think that.

Why don't you just get 1 BTC and some satoshi's to start until you get used to it. blockchain.info make the process easy for the beginner, then make some paper wallets for your savings. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:22:54
Sure it's by no means easy and you will probably spend quite a bit getting all the things you need to do it. Good to see an an option to buy with bitcoins, you should let the people at the [shroomery]( know about this.

BitcoinSpinner looks good, don't think I'd trust it if I found out about it on that site. Here's the bitcoin [wiki]( link.

Torgirls take bitcoin! I'm surprised I’ve not seen it mentioned here yet, probably because it's a scam, and no I haven't!
@_date: 2013-03-14 23:17:51
That’s what I've been doing, r/bitcoin has come in very handy for getting my head round things. I came to an amount each month/week that if I lost I could still pay the rent, and I've sold a few things on bitmit.

You would think Amir would have taken on board some of the points that people have been making on here by now, he is a redditor. I agree that most of his points are valid but the way he comes across makes me cringe, maybe we should ask [Guy Goma]( to take his place.
