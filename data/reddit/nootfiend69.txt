I still don't understand what definitions you are using as standard ones are pretty clear cut.  communism is a theoretical end-point of a worker-controlled world where states no longer serve a purpose and as such cease to exist.  capitalism is the current society where a handful of rich shareholders own society's tools and resources and make their living off the labor of the workers, who do not own the tools they use or the fruits they produce.  this system is enforced by the capitalist states which the workers also have no say in. These two systems are clearly not possible to be existing simultaneously.

liberalism and communism are antithetical to each other.  liberalism exists within a capitalist framework whereas communism is anticapitalist.

I'm curious what definitions you are using because they are not the standard definitions if you think they can coexist.

welfare programs aren't communism, if you were suggesting that.
communism and capitalism are contradictory and cannot coexist.

yeah, i mostly agree. i don't know much about blockchain as a technology but practically speaking, it is an awful currency.  i'm just hoping it swings upwards once more so that by the time i move into the long term capital gains bracket, i can get out with just a little more
