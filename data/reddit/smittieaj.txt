Well, I'll admit that I'm no PHD in economics, and I'm sure that I'm a fool in many ways.  However, I can't help but feel like our current system is screwing us all over.  Entire nations, companies, and every day people all around the world are dropping like flies due to systemic debt.  Basically, it seems like everyone is just property of the central bankers, and the banking system.  
Perhaps there are trade-offs to the actual widespread use of BTC, but right now they are theoretical, and they scare me much less than the system that we currently have hoisted upon us.    
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:23:03
I'm not worried, at all.  Yes, the transaction queue has been pretty clogged lately, and fees are up, but the lightning network is nearly finished, and some are already running nodes on mainnet.  The future for Bitcoin is BULLISH!

That's why you encrypt your wallet, and you don't tell anyone about your seed!  Once you pass (may you rest in peace), they'll still have no idea how to get the Bitcoins out of your cold dead hands.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:37:16
I entered this market broke, so I suppose I can leave it that way too.  Hell, I'll probably die broke!  I'm having a great time right now, though!  I have slightly more than the almost nothing that I started with!  And I do believe that BTC is 1000% less scammy than fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:05:46
Who pays you shills?  I'm honestly curious...   How much could I make by typing this sort of bull?  Will they pay me in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:51
The same thing that people who can't afford a down payment on a house do today, rent, make a tent, get a roommate, or beg a family member for shelter.
EDIT:  The point isn't that loans or credit are bad in themselves.  What is bad is being able to print or 'fractional reserve' money for free, and then loan it to others at great cost to them, for a private profit.  If you make a loan for profit, it should cost you something.  At least bitcoins are limited in supply, and have a real cost associated with their creation.  What we have now, is a racket.  They can loan you money that doesn't exist, and then even though it never existed, the 'borrower' still has to pay it back anyway, and with interest.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:40:59
I will concede that bartering is primitive.  However, there is no need for fractional reserve, inflation, quantitative easing, bailouts, or the federal reserve.  We could still have a fiat, I suppose.  If it were less scammy, perhaps I would trust it as much as I trust BTC.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:03:05
Most use stocks, I suppose.  They crash too.  They also price in fiat, which doesn't help.

After reading your comment, the sad conclusion that I've come to is that your ad hominem attack isn't even close to convincing me that my thoughts and arguments are wrong, or that you are capable of assessing my intelligence, or anyone else's for that matter.  I feel bad for you, because when you beg to suck my dick for some bitcoin in the future, you will be disappointed to discover that I am not gay.  Good luck with your banker papers, though!

I think that we're approaching a time when nearly 100% of humans will accept Bitcoin.  It's certainly not impossible, and if that's the case, then I assure you, I'm not worried about whether or not I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:23:44
I don't know...  I've been buying for a little while.  I avoided buying at the most recent high, because the week leading up to it was insane.  From my perspective, it's appreciating nicely, and this doesn't bother me much.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:56:56
More for me to buy, I suppose.  Let them dump!
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:55:40
Money hoarding?  Like people saving money?  Hmmm...  If we could be so lucky!  Wouldn't it be great if nearly everyone wasn't in debt up to their eyeballs, but instead, had some money socked away for hard times?
And wouldn't taking that saved money out of general circulation for some time just raise the value of everyone else's money?
Also, how could there be a bank run if there was no such thing as a fractional reserve?  They literally could not run out of money, if they didn't operate by loaning other people's money, and at a fractional reserve, I might add.  
I'd take my chances, thanks.

I do purchase (some) goods in Bitcoin.  However, I will admit that it is not as widely accepted as it could be, or perhaps will be in the future.  
In regards to the price, on a long enough timeline, the dollar consistently drops, and bitcoin seems to rise (with periodic bumps, like we see today) more than it falls.  So, while this blip is painful today, it is temporary, and it would be short-sighted to sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:53:13

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:36:33
Yup.  They literally make it up...   But then, they loan it to you at interest, so it's worse than worthless!  It's like, negative worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:08
If I need fiat, I will pay via a Bitcoin debit card, like you can get from Bitpay or Shift Financial/Coinbase.  I can also stop at an ATM, for situations that require paper.  
On the day-to-day, I'm trying to live as frugally as possible so that I can buy myself more of that sweet BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:49:19
Strangely, it's working out very well.  You'd think that it would be more upsetting, but BTC just keeps appreciating, and then it's hard to care.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:48:18
It's simple. I HODL, and I look forward to the future.  Because I have a long-term perspective, this dip doesn't bother me.  When it dips, I just buy more.  Thanks for the cheap coins, people!
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:55:07

It's slowly gaining momentum.  I've seen houses bought and sold for bitcoin.  I see websites where I can spend it on goods and services.  My local pizza joint just started accepting bitcoin.  I see ATMs popping up.  I'm just going to HODL on.  I think I'd be a fool to sell today!

Believe me, I've thought about this a lot.  I trust Bitcoin more than any currency that I know of, at the moment.  I don't want my hard work to be stolen from me through inflation, quantitative easing, and banking schemes.  I'd like to be able to have something left to live on when I am old.  I might want to leave something here for my family, or the next generation, and not just a few bankers.

So, suppose that China decides that it doesn't want to hold dollars anymore, and does not wish to purchase US bonds.  Suppose that the middle east decides that they've had the shits with the US and our wars, and they decide to use gold, or the YUAN, or something...  There are things that could trigger chain reactions that would change the value of a dollar.  I don't like thinking about it, since I like all of my American friends, but it's not beyond imagining.  Even if we want them to, things don't remain the same forever.

@_date: 2018-01-16 23:09:29
You are correct.  So long as you hold on long enough, and save in BTC or gold, you are right.  The interest on dollars would be almost meaningless.  
Edit:  Thought about it a little more, and with the way compounding interest compounds on itself, and the varying rates of change for the respective currencies, it's a dangerous game... but, it still might be meaningless.  However, if you only hold fiat, it would be much more dangerous for you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:44

@_date: 2018-01-17 02:36:23
Hey there, ph0tone.  You actually have the OP.  I'm not upset by this price correction, nor would I be upset if it were twice as large.  I'm holding my BTC.  I really, truly, don't like banks, and I don't trust them.  I'm not going to start loving their paper any time soon.  I'm HODL-ing.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:51:09
Sure, but at least no one is forced to use it.  People use Bitcoin and other currencies on their own free will, without any jails or guns involved.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:18
I'm seldomly personally forced to use a dollar, but at the nation-state level, it gets a little dicey for you if you decide to use anything else when you purchase oil.  There's a strange correlation between leaders who have decided to leave the dollar, and leaders who have been executed.  Weird, right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:33

Bitcoin will undoubtedly see competition.  In fact, it already has.  It keeps improving, and never seems to encounter any game-changing bugs in production.  I'd be an idiot not to trust Bitcoin right now; just look at what has been accomplished in a few short years!
As for fiat, sure you can exchange any currency, asset, or commodity...   But, you don't HAVE to convert Bitcoin to spend it.  There are some places, like my local pizza shop, or overstock.com, or microsoft, etc, etc..., where you can spend it for goods directly.  I bought some beers with Bitcoin from my neighbor.  I just saw that we'll soon be able to buy tickets to see the MAVs!  I see this trend increasing, especially with the lightning network coming on-line.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:59:14

@_date: 2018-01-17 04:11:13
I'm very excited to see the lightning network coming along.  In the meantime, I've paid much less by selecting low fees when sending transactions, and being patient.  For places that don't accept bitcoin, you can get a debit card that converts BTC to fiat at purchase, enabling you to store your value in bitcoin, and still deal with USD, or Euros, or whatever else you might need.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:09:17
Riiight...  the risk of losing the imaginary dollars that you, as a bankster, created out of thin air.  Not very risky, if I may say so...

Well, it's not a fiat, if it's not by a decree by some authority, I suppose.  And it does resemble an asset, and a currency, and an e-mail, for that matter...  Bitcoin is weird, and different.  I like Bitcoin.  I want to own more of them.

I suppose that this scheme would be possible.  However, this would require you to re-educate or silence a bunch of trezor-toting, independence-loving, freedom fans to walk into a bank and trust them with all of their wealth, while at the same time they know that cryptography renders this unnecessary, and obsolete.  What's in it for the person making the deposit?  They get to risk all of their wealth, so that they can be lazy with their private key?

You may or may not be an operative... honestly, the fact that YOU used THAT word makes me wonder, now.  Most people don't use the word 'operative', and even less penis shame someone in a currency forum.
I've seen far too many pro-fiat posts on the Bitcoin subreddit today to not wonder what the hell is going on.  
Either way, I can have my opinions, and I'm not upset if you think that they are shitty.  I'm happy to wait 3 or 5 years and see who was right.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:15:18
I suppose that we could say the same for the dollar.  If/when the dollar (or whichever currency is used in your area) collapses, or appreciates against other currencies, the cost of certain goods will go up and down.  Consider gas prices.  When I started driving I could buy gas at $0.95 per gallon.  Since then, I've paid over $5.00 at times.  And I'm not even that old yet.  
BTC does fluctuate wildly against other currencies right now, but I think that it will eventually stabilize with more adoption, market participation, and arbitrage.  And, so far, BTC has treated me very nicely.

I suppose it depends on which investors you are talking about.  Technical people will understand that the price has nothing to do with the technology, and might be eyeing up the upcoming releases of lightning, and other features.  They are promising.  Hell, I would buy that story!  And, Wall Street loves volatility and buying the bottom.  Retail investors who bought at 20k USD.... not so much.

I know, right?!??  They were straight up dumping to $14k after the recent surge a few days back, so I had to get in there and take their coins from them, as they were too stupid to HODL.  Don't worry, they're out now, and we can resume mooning!  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:28

Bitcoin IS the money.  
If you want fiat, which is printed for free and then loaned to the public via fractional reserve at interest, then you exchange some of your Bitcoin with someone else on an exchange through a process of bidding and asking , or via an OTC transaction.  Buyer be warned, the value of fiat drops daily, and the entire system is prone to collapse via hyperinflation.
The easiest way to get bitcoin, or sell bitcoin for fiat, is at an [exchange](

"Go long on my position!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:22:05
I don't know, honestly.  I am hopeful.  In the meantime, by holding some of my stored value in bitcoin, I can escape the fiat banking system if required.  Inflation rates, quantitative easing, and other monetary policies shouldn't have an effect on my bitcoin as it does to the fiat money supply.  If my country ever goes the way of Zimbabwe or Venezuela, I shouldn't be completely destitute.  I might just be able to buy a plane ticket, and fly somewhere with food.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:13:42
This is mostly true, at the moment, however developers are currently working on technology to enable near-free, instantaneous transactions which will enable bitcoin to work as a currency, and not just a tool for speculation.  In the meantime, the bandwidth of bitcoin is still fine for large purchases, eg:  lambos, houses, islands

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:28:18
I suppose it depends on how much the fees will cost to transfer all of your BTC back and forth vs. the value of the B2X and the speed with which you need to sell it.  I think it will probably be fine to wait for Trezor to make their wallet update and then perform the steps that they outline to ensure replay protection before moving to transact with BTC or selling B2X, but everyone would probably have their own opinion on that.

I don't know what % of the 16 million people are millionaires, and how much of their money they would be willing to part with in order to obtain one bitcoin, but it is still a good question.  Perhaps, on a global scale, there are enough billionaires to push the price that high, but I won't worry about 1M+ prices until we're into 6 figures.

It seems like you are still thinking in fiat value.  What if some of us just prefer to have bitcoins.  It doesn't matter what the value of a bitcoin is in fiat if we don't want banks, inflation, QE, business hours, ATM fees, service fees, bail-ins, etc...  Some of us just want sound money that is usable, and does not progressively lose value over time, and also does not involve banksters.  We are happily throwing away our paper for bits of crypto.  We don't care how much paper money we are throwing away, because we don't want paper money.

I don't think that this will happen because, while they may be defiant, miners will ultimately look after their own best interests.  If the NYA chain is only worth 15% of the current chain, they would stand to loose money by mining it, and hurt their own interests.  They still need to pay for electricity and make a profit.  Why wouldn't they want 100% of the value that is possible for their processing cycles?

I agree with your assessment.  The adoption rate of cryptocurrency is accelerating, and they appear to be struggling to keep up.  When we consider their volume, spread, and fees, we can conclude that they're not likely having money troubles.  So, they won't likely be shuttering any time soon, but will probably be hiring instead.
