Do these people realize that a Bitcoin economy rather enforces government austerity as it is impossible for them to print more money?
And it's exactly the way it should be. With the government staying out of people's life and not spending money that's not theirs.

Actually it's not misleading at all as the log scale measures percentage and "effort" it takes to go from one level to the next.
When Bitcoin was at 1 dollar, moving to 2 dollars (a 100% increase) was a very big deal and it was certainly not something that happened overnight. 
Now, moving from 998 to 999 (a 1 dollar increase which is about 0.1%) means nothing and happens all the time. Instead, moving from 1000 to 2000 is again another 100% and is treated with the same importance on the graph as the 1 &gt; 2 dollar move.

The coins are essentially an IOU for a postcard. Everyone can create and exchange these IOUs and anyone can demand the original issuer to make good on their promise and send them a postcard. 
Other than that, it uses the colored coin system which is a tecnology on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain that marks certain coins as being a token for something else (in this case an IOU) and allows you to exchange them. 
Is yor address a coinprism address?

I forgot to mention something which you might find interesting. 
You can always issue your own coins. For example, if you issue your own postcard coins I would accept them and send you a postcard for them. 
So, you don't need to wait to have enough you can just create your own under the condition that you honor your word and send a postcard back when I or someone else asks to trade your coins.

Indeed, but those were businesses that were previously accepting real bitcoin and they're now accepting something else, thus shrinking the size of the real bitcoin economy and the real bitcoin's value. 
Here's an analogy: 
Imagine coinbase would use litcoin instead of their own fractional coin. That means that everyone with a coinbase wallet would automatically accept litecoin as well. 
If coinbase becomes very popular and most of the merchants start using it, it also means that in many cases litecoin will be used instead of bitcoin, hurting the bitcoin economy and value. 
In reality, they are not using a different cryptocurrency, but a token of their own that represents a promise of a future bitcoin. It still competes with bitcoin and people start accepting it because it is the default method of payment at a popular wallet service.
Only if the reserve ratio is 100% there will be no effect because every bitcoin is substituted by a token of the same amount, meaning that they are equivalent and the tokens affect the market the same way a real bitcoin would.

Well, currently there's Coinbase which seems to be pretty popular and is, by definition, a middleman. The only difference with the described scenario, is that supposedly they hold full reserves. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:40:15
In such a scenario, Bitcoin will still be affected. Maybe not its quantity, but certainly its value and thus the value of your savings. 
Even if Bitcoin can be audited this doesn't prevent a situation in which FRB becomes common and acceptable, even permissible by the government's law. Then, the insignificant minority of libertarians or people who are aware of the situation will have no power to make any change. 
Keep in mind that if Bitcoin takes off and centralized wallets become common, I'm pretty confident that current banks will end up offering wallet services as well. 
They know the game and they also know how to lobby for certain regulation making sure that Bitcoin FRB ends up being legal. 
And then, there's nothing you and I can do to stop people from using these services just like they already use banks today and are completely fine with it. 
Even if you don't keep your bitcoins in a centralized wallet, if enough people keep their money in a centralized wallet which operates under a Fractional Reserve system, then the global Bitcoin price and value will be affected.

I'm going to go against the popular opinion and say "no" or at least "probably not". 
Unless the protocol changes the broadcasted transaction will be valid for both forks. 
It only takes one node to pick up your transaction and broadcast it to the side of the fork you didn't want and you'll have spent the money on there too.
Of course, due to the fork there will be differences in the blockchain and in some balances, but unless something changes, your transactions will be valid on both of them.

You wouldn't believe how many countries use $ as their currency symbol. And it works. 
For example in argentina where $ stands for the Argentine Peso (ARS) unless specified otherwise. 
So it does work pretty well and I don't think it should be a concern. 
Furthermore, in Spain before the euro came we didn't even had a sign at all. We just used the three letters "pts" to mean "Peseta", similar to the way we use BTC to mean "bitcoin".

@_date: 2014-03-16 09:58:03
What I find interesting and a bit frightening is that this permanent but bounded currency expansion also acts in form of a cushion that can be inflated or deflated depending on the amount of credit offered by the centralized wallets / banks. This gives them effective control of the money supply and the economy. 
If they stop offering credit, the paid debts destroy a part of the bank coins faster than they can be created, thus shrinking the money supply. This causes deflation and consequently repaying your debt becomes more and more difficult. 
In such a situation, when the circulation of money is slowed down, the natural reaction is to be risk adverse: companies save instead of invest, there are lay offs, salaries are cut, people buy less and banks are increasingly worried offering even less credit and further fueling the deflation spiral which ends up causing a recession. 
If you control the "extra cushion" you can effectively control the economy or even if it's not intentional, severely affect it. 
Now, in such a situation deflation has catastrophical consequences precisely because people won't be able to pay off all the debt money that has been created in the first place. It requires the system to continue running constantly at the same speed to prevent a terrible outcome.

Good question! 
Now we're only dealing with postcards, even so their reputation is on the line! Colored coins can be issued by anyone and are bound to the promise of the issuer. 
If someone doesn't care about their reputation or being called out then there's nothing preventing them from issuing worthless tokens. This means that reputation will have a big impact in the acceptance of colored coins of businesses and merchants. 
In our situation, since postcards are expected to be constantly sent and received, finding out if someone is issuing unbacked coins is only a matter of time. Those with a higher reputation will prevail. 
The most interesting part, if you ask me, is what will happen once the community has clearly outlined a set of reputable issuers: will their coins be worth more? 
As an issuer, you must always accept your own coins but you can decide if you trust other user's coins or not. For example, you could refuse any coins issued by users with less than 500 comment karma on reddit. 
In the end, it's a very similar situation to other exchange subreddit, such as for example "where it's perfectly possible to post an offer for something you don't own. The difference, however, is that you don't have to resort to simple trade of "Have card / Want card", you can collect the coins first and then spent them on any other card you like.

Because if someone hacks your computer and steals your bitcoins from coinbase then you won't be able to recover them.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin can be easily debased with fractional reserve banking. 
Keep in mind that most of today's fiat money supply does not come from the printing machines but from the fictional fiat that banks create in form of credit. 
The moment centralized wallets become the norm, the easier it is for a fractional reserve banking to take place and I wouldn't doubt that when the moment comes, there will be many people interested in this possibility. 
Right now I see that we're exchanging decentralization for convenience, reassuring ourselves that if someone wants to change the rules (ie. introduce fractional reserve banking, for example) we'll all revolt and avoid this service. 
Unfortunately the average joe doesn't even know about FRB, nor is he protesting against the current debasement of their fiat money. They just don't know or don't care and I don't think it will be any different once Bitcoin becomes mainstream and coins are more evenly distributed amongst the population. 
Again, people will just choose not to do anything for "convenience" and "safety". And those who do decide to keep their own bitcoins won't have an impact big enough to bring about any change. 
Now, that is scenario in which Bitcoin becomes popular and centralized wallets become normal. And I don't see why this isn't likely to happen.

Because people never used goxcoins to pay for goods and services. 
People do however use coinbasecoins to pay for goods and services. Of course, Coinbase does not (yet) work under a fractional reserve system which means that 1 coinbasecoin = 1 bitcoin.
If it were not like this, though, then there would be a direct effect on the Bitcoin economy.

The wonderful thing about this is that if you append a password, even if that password is a single letter or a single byte, malware will never know that it's a bitcoin address, because as you know a single bit causes a hash to change drastically and they are non-reversible.

I still think he is right. Being backed by something means that there is someone who guarantees that you will always be able to exchange your bitcoins for that something. 
Right now, there is no guarantee of that, no matter how much effort it takes to produce bitcoins.

Yup! that's exactly how it works. 
But you must also understand that the number is incredibly huge. Our minds can even begin to understand how big the number is that you just wrote and that it would take the most powerful computer of the world trillions and trillions of years to try out all addresses. The earth would be engulfed by the sun before this happened. 
Also, the same length of that number also protects it from accidental collisions. The chances that I randomly generate a number that belongs to another address are some small that It would be more probable that I win the lottery 11 times consecutevely.

I like this answer. 
It would be just like doing transactions offline... as soon as the transactions are published they are going to be re-confirmed by the main branch. 
Although it's a tad riskier because someone who could travel outside and inside the cut off area would be able to double spend. 
Other than that, I think people would stop using bitcoin if there was no way to keep the syncronization with the rest of the network up.

I would have suggested you to use a lightweight client that doesn't need to download the blockchain. 
But oh well.. since the post is almost 17 hours old I guess it isn't worth it anymore exporting the key and importing it in another client. 
Once it is synchronized, though, and you want to switch clients just send your bitcoins from one wallet to another. 
If you ever need help exporting your keys just let me know and I'll tell you how to do it.

Op here! 
I'm using electrum and "My wallet" from blockchain.info now and both work extremely well. 
Web clients are not really more secure, but they can be more resistant to loss, because you don't need to backup your wallet files. 
Check out the Electrum client which has got ALL the security features needed and doesn't need to syncronize. 
1- It allows you to encrypt for wallet so that only the person with the password might access it. 
2- It allows you to recover it at any time, even if you delete your wallet files thanks to a seed that is used to generate the keys.

What I'm really worried about is the **"Second Life Syndrome"**. 
A few years ago everyone jumped on the Second Life Bandwagon and even my local administration created a small virtual office in the game. The hype lasted about a year and then slowly started fading until just the core users remained. 
This worries me because it means that adoption growth is not an indicator of long term sustainability. 
**Now, I'm not saying that Bitcoin and Second Life are the same.** They are not. I'm would just like to talk about how we're going to avoid / overcome the "second life syndrome" problem. Are we prepared to acknowledge and fight this possibilty?

I'm not very familiar with the official Bitcoin-qt client as I really could not download the whole blockchain due to limitations with my harddrive. 
With bitcoin-qt your private keys are stored in a file called wallet.dat and as far as I know they are not encrypted by default. If there's one thing I would always do with my Bitcoin wallet is to encrypt it. 
Since I don't know if Bitcoin-qt supports encryption I would recommend you the "Armory Client". Armory is a Bitcoin client that pairs up with the official Bitcoin-qt wallet and works together with it. It is, to date, the most advanced Bitcoin wallet there is and includes absolutely every option and functionality you would need. 
Also, all backups you store should be encrypted as well. Encryption is not complicated at all... when a client supports it, you just have to type in a pass phrase every time you open your wallet and this ensures that even if your computer is compromised your bitcoins are not lost because the attacker cannot get to your keys. 
With Bitcoin you have only one single job: Keep your keys safe. 
If you don't plan on spending that Bitcoins and just want to keep them for some time, you could also use a paper wallet or an offline wallet. 
Visit  and take a look at what a Bitcoin address looks like. 
The concept of a paper wallet is simple: Write down or print out the private key shown bottom right. Then you send your bitcoins to the address on the upper left. As long as you keep that key, you'll have access to your coins. 
Clients such as Armory, Blockchain.info (via GUI) and even bitcoin-qt (via command line), will let you easily import that key and all your bitcoins will appear in your wallet. 
That is a great way to keep them safe, beacuse you don't need to keep the key on a computer but in your home, somewhere you trust. 
As for the coinbase question, I'm not sure but I'm pretty confident that you'll get 10 BTC.

You must double spend it. 
Find a software that lets you create manual transactions and create a new one to an address you own and this time with a high fee so that it gets verified very quickly.
Brainwallet lets you do this, but I've never done this before and you must be very careful. 
**Edit:** Basically you must recreate the same transaction but with a different output. It's very important that the inputs are exactly the same. 
**Edit2:** Armory also lets you create raw transactions. Finally maybe try Electrum which doesn't do raw transaction but could let you double spend it.

While your operation was safe, it can be even safer if you want maximum security: 
1- Use a Live CD. If your computer was already infected by a trojan it could have sent a copy of the key after your login. 
For maximum security you should generate the key on a linux live CD (temporary installation-free operating system) or use a computer that has never ever been connected to the internet. 
2- You trusted bitaddress.org's random generation method. The website's code could have been flawed either accidentally or intentionally in order to generate some specific adress which others already own and have the private keys to. 
Next time use a different random number generator or just use dice if you want to feel extra geeky. HEX dice for bonus points. Afterwards you can safely input your 64 character HEX number to Bitadress' "Wallet details" page and get the corresponding public address calculated. 
This is now extreme paranoia but I thought it would be interesting to point out. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 12:58:55
Sorry again for sending out such fragmented information. I just installed Bitcoin-qt to see how it works and it seems that you can see your addresses in the "receive coins" tab. 
Do the following: 
Go to blockchain.info and copy-paste those directions into the search bar and see if the addition of their balance matches with the balance reported by bitcoin-qt. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:16:26
Yes. 
The bitcoins can only be stolen if someone knows your private key. If the key only exists on paper then they can only be stolen by obtaining that paper. 
But be careful: How did you generate the paper wallet? Did you generate it on a computer connected to the internet that could be infected and already have a copy of the private key?
I suggest you try it out with a small amount. It's really easy. 
When you want to spend your funds you just need to import the private key to any Bitcoin application (such as Blockchain). 
Once you import the key, the paper wallet is spent and is no longer 100% secure, as the private key has now "touched" a computer. 
When you do this you should spend whatever amount you wish and then send the remaining BTC to a new paper wallet.

This site is generally trusted in the bitcoin community. You can check its source code and if you want to be 100% secure, save a copy an run it offline.
Since it's all maths, the website works perfectly when loaded from an offline computer. 
If you're even more paranoid, then downolad a linux live CD or USB. A live cd or USB is an operating system that loads from a CD or USB, as the name suggests and leaves no trace once the computer is rebooted. It's like having a completely different computer for the time you're using it and nothing you've got on your HDD is loaded. 
Load the live CD / USB, then execute an offline version of the website and print the paper wallet. (But this may be overkill). 
**Edit:** That website uses javascript to generate the keys. This means that it's your own browser who does the calculation and the website never ever gets to see them. That is also why it works offline.
It's the same method Blockchain.info wallet uses. 
**Edit2:** With this option you generate a perfectly valid and standard bitcoin address. You do not depend on external services (which would be the case in coinapult). The keys and addresses generated are completely standard and accepted by any bitcoin client.

A paper wallet! That way they need no software, no nothing. Bonus: They're something physical!
1- Go to  and print out some paper wallets.
2- Send coins to the public address, write down the value on the paper wallet and give it to your sister. 
These paper wallets contain the adress' private key. She can keep the paper wallet as long as she wants or if she wants to spend the coins she just needs to register a blockchain.info wallet or use any other bitcoin wallet program and import the private key. 
Just tell her to treat it like money and make sure no one else steals or copies the private key. 
EDIT: If you do graphic design you could potentially design your own paper wallet / bitcoin note.
Also, make sure you tell her about the recent bitcoin price increase and how you believe that they could be very valuable someday and that it makes them special. 
**Safety:** Just make sure that when printing or designing the paper wallet no one gets the private key.

You don't need to create a new address for each transaction or for each incomming or outgoing payment. You can keep using each address over and over and over, so there is no problem with that. 
Some programs though, think it is best that the user automatically generates a new address after each use for "enhanced privacy"... so they do it by default. Others don't. 
I generally prefer they don't because I like to re-use my addresses.

A hard fork should always be announced in advance, because a hard fork does not only affect miners but also regular bitcoin users and especially merchants. 
Basically, if a hard fork occurs and you're running an old version, then you're not running on the real Bitcoin network.
Imagine a merchant receiving "parallel-bitcoins" (not real bitcoins) just because he hasn't updated his wallet program yet. This could lead to serious trouble,
In order to perform a hard-fork we must warn users in advance: "Hey everybody... we're going to make the switch on D-day. Older versions will not be supported and won't display an accurate bitcoin balance. Please update as soon as possible."

Not, it's not less secure than a 128 bit random number if you follow the method described in the link. 
What you're actually doing is translating the numbers into words without reducing any randomness, thus without reducing the password strength. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:59:41
Here's how Bitcoin works: 
1. You have your Bitcoin address where you can deposit / receive Bitcoins. 
2. You have a private key which is a sort of password that allows you to access your Bitcoins and spend them. 
Usually when people gift bitcoins to each other they do the following: They create a nice piece of paper (with decoration and what not) and write down these two things on the paper. The address and they key so that the giftee can access the Bitcoins. 
The only problem you face right now is the possibility that her parents take the key and spend the bitcoins before she grows old. 
One thing you could do, however, is write the key and the address down on a piece of paper and put this in an envelope sealed with Wax. Retrieving the bitcoins would mean it's necessary to break the seal. 
PS. You will also need to do the following things: 
1. Buy 2 Bitcoins
2. Create an address + key pair for your niece. 
3. Send the 2 Bitcoins to the address you created and write both the address and the secret key down on a piece of paper and seal it in an envelope. 
You can use this website to create an address + key pair: 
Most people use the Paper Wallet function.
**One last advice:** Be careful when writing down the private key and make sure you don't keep copies on the computer. Remember that whoever gets a copy of it will be able to access your niece's bitcoins.

Your example is also considering a deflation rate of over 150% in only two years. That means that the currency value more than doubles in only that short amount of time.

Yes! The recommended transaction fee is 0.0005 x 1000 bytes or otherwise you risk it won't go through. 
When we talk about about recommended fee it is always for regular transactions that are less than 1 KB in size. 
If your transaction is larger than that (because it includes many inputs) your client should warn you and you should follow its instructions. 
This is done in order to prevent people spamming the blockchain with many huge transactions.

I would really advise you to use a Bitcoin Merchant Solution. These services are perfect because they make it extremely easy and convenient to accept bitcoins, albeit for a small fee. 
The most popular solution is Bitpay. I have tried it out and it es extremely easy to use and offers a shopping cart solution as well. 
 - 0.99% fee
Then there is also WalletBit who I have not tried but I've read positive things about them. I believe it works very similar to Bitpay. 
 - 0.89% fee
Bitmerch is a solution I have not tried but it seems to be very easy as well. Just create a product list and copy/past the HTML to your website.
 - 0.50% fee
Blockchain.info also offers a partially selfhosted and manual solution but with automatic javascript buttons that generate a new address for each customer.

**These instructions come with no warranty. Handle with care:**
**First of all you should make a backup of your wallet.** (Keep this backup safe).
Then I would suggest you to export all private keys and reimport them in a fresh installation of Bitcoin-qt or a different wallet. 
Optionally you might want to consider using blockchain.info's wallet which is a very easy to use bitcoin wallet and gives you control over all directions. 
It is very important that you don't disclose the private keys. They are the keys to your bitcoins.
* Follow these instructions for every bitcoin address in your "receive coins" section.
 
Once you've exported these keys you can import them at another client... either a new bitcoin installation or at blockchain.info's wallet. And then you should have access to all your bitcoins.
* To import the private keys to Bitcoin-qt follow these instructions: 
* To import the private keys to a blockchain.info wallet, just go to the import/export tab. 
Alternatively, if this is just too much hassle you could just re-import the backup you made in step 1 in a new fresh installation of bitcoin-qt. But if you do this, you risk broadcasting the transaction that got locked up somehow and actually sending the coins to the merchant who has already cancelled your order. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:38:59
I know I was being very paranoid, but I would not touch online wallets with a stick for this amount of money. 
If you're looking for convenience then just use Electrum with encryption on a regular malware free computer, or just use Mycelium's cold storage option which is already very secure and convenient: just scan and send. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:48:20
That is mainly because, currently, it takes some effort to earn or buy coins. They are something precious. 
Since it's often complicated to buy them, you have to pay fees and you don't get paid in Bitcoin, you treasure them more that you would if you could earn / buy them easier. 
If you'd have a stable influx of bitcoin, say every month, you'd be much more willing to spend them. They'd seem much more common to you than they are now. The same would applied if it was super easy to buy them in a matter of seconds. 
It currently is similar to spending gold or silver. You know that gold or silver price is relatively stable yet you still don't want to spend gold or silver coins because they are hard to get and precious to you. If you got paid in silver each month and it was something common to you, you'd also be much more willing to spend that silver.

You need to understand how bitcoin works. 
Each bitcoin address has got a public part and a private part. This private part is called the "key" and it is the fundamental part that gives you access to your coins. 
As long as you've got that key you can just import it to any bitcoin software and have immediate access to the coins. 
The safest way to store bitcoins is the following: 
- Create a new Bitcoin address and write down or print out the secret private key. 
As you can see, this key is now off your computer and off the internet so it can't be stolen or affected by hardware failures. 
Tools such as  allow you to generate Bitcoin addresses and see the secret key. Usually the secret key is kept hidden inside the computer software you use. 
The above website can be saved on your computer and used offline to generate a new "off the grid" address. 
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you keep the printed out / written down key very secure and don't show it to anybody. 
**Summarizing:** Generate an address and keep the key to that address off a computer and save it wherever you trust to be a safe place. Then send bitcoins to the generated address.

There is one BIG problem I have with this approach. 
I do not want to keep my coins at a third party. Maybe some coins, yes, but not my savings. 
The problem is that moving the coins into and out that supposed payment processor will be expensive. And what if I don't trust them or the government requieres them to follow some regulation?
**The government can't force all individuals to comply with their rules, but it can enforce regulation for those payment processors.**
So, as I see it, Offchain transaction should be totally option and I should always be able to use Bitcoin from person to person.

You are correct, this is how Bitcoin programs such as Bitcoin-qt work. Other programs such as Electrum and Blockchain.info will only generate a new address if you specifially request it: it depends on the software you're using.
There is one other thing you should keep in mind though: You can have as many addresses as you want. That allows you to make a distinction between a hot wallet and a cold wallet. 
A hot wallet is connected to the internet and is intended to be used for regular daily transactions. A Bitcoin program installed on my computer is a hot wallet because I can send and receive bitcoins with it at any moment. 
A cold wallet on the other side is a bitcoin address that is stored out of the Internet's reach. For example, on a piece of paper or in a computer that is never online. Cold wallets are considered to be more secure because they cannot be affected by malware. They are recommended to store and keep large amounts of bitcoins for long periods of time. 
People who hold many bitcoins usually use both types of wallets. They have their Bitcoin program installed on the computer which acts as a hot wallet and then they've got a Bitcoin Address whose private key can ONLY be found written on a document safely stored in their drawer. 
If I export and write down the private key of an address that my Bitcoin program uses, then I'm not creating a cold wallet because the key is still in my computer. I'm just backing up that key, nothing else. 
If I wanted to back up the keys that my Bitcoin program uses, I would definitely use the provided backup functionality and not export+print the keys every time I use an address. That'd be tedious. 
To create a cold wallet / paper wallet you must use an address whose private key does only and exclusively exist on an offline medium. 
For example: 
1- Visit 
2- Turn off your internet connection.
3- Generate a new address using that tool. 
4- Print it out and keep it somewhere safe.
5- Reboot your computer. 
Assuming you don't have malware on your computer and your printer has no internal harddrive, then you can be confident that the key you just generated does only exist on the paper you printed. 
This piece of paper now acts as a sort of savings account. You can send as many bitcoins as you want to that public address and keep them there for long periods of time. 
As you can see, it's impossible to steal these bitcoins because the private key only exists on the paper. I would have to break inside your house and find that paper in order to do it. 
At the same time I would still have my day to day wallet (hot wallet) on my computer in which I would hold a smaller amount in order to do my daily purchases.
Let's say that, after two years, I wanted to spend the funds that I have collected on my paper address. I would just need to import the printed key to my computer wallet and I could spend it immediately.

Yes, it is possible with a forked blockchain. This was not supposed to happen and is the reason people where telling merchants to wait until this issue resolved. 
The thing is that you can't fork the blockchain like that. It's something a HUGE part of the network must agree on. In this case, the bug in 0.7 automatically made that agreement for everybody that was using 0.7. (Because 0.7 would refuse to accept the other blockchain). 
It's not a real threat as it's not possible for a single party to create a valid "official" fork.

The value is automatically derived only by the coins that are in circulation. 
Supply and demand forces cause coins that are inactive or lost to be ignored. That is why suddenly putting a huge amount of coins in circulation as a big impact.

Sorry I answer so late, but I must say that it does depend on the bitcoin program you use. 
Some programs, such as the official Bitcoin-qt wallet automatically create new addresses and dispose of older ones. In such a case, a paper wallet would be quickly obsolete. 
You must use a program that keeps re-using the same addresses. Make sure to check the documentation available for your software, although it is pretty easy to check. Just look if every time you do a transaction the money is kept in the same address or if it changes. 
The reason some clients do this is to boost anonymity.
Also: Use the import/export and backup options provided by your bitcoin program. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:31:14

There are several ways you can do this. This website gives you an example of how easy it really is to accept Bitcoin. 
Using this website you would simply print out the generated key and give the public part to your minecraft users. You could even create an in-game QR code!
Once you wanted to collect your donations you would simply need to import the private and secret key to a Bitcoin program in order to be able to spend it. 
This is what we call a cold storage wallet, because the secret key is stored somewhere off the internet and off a computer until it's needed. 
Notice that there is no middle man here. You are directly managing the secret key to your donations. You are in control!
The other option would be to use an address already managed by a Bitcoin program. Currently the easiest and most convenient Bitcoin wallet program is  [[Demo account](
1- Register a new Mywallet account
2- The program generates a new public address for you
3- Make sure to download a backup and don't lose your password.
4- Start receiving and sending bitcoins inmediately. 
The advantage of this method is that you can spend the received Bitcoins inmediately. Again, there is no middle man here. You're directly in control of your bitcoins, just doing it using an online application instead of a downloaded application.
Blockchain.info is considered to be pretty secure because all operations are done in your browser. The website owners never see your keys because they are encrypted by your browser. They just store them so that you can easily access and decrypt them from anywhere in the world. 
**Remember that your Bitcoins are only as secure as your private key or your password.**
**About Bitpay:** 
Some people have recommended you using Bitpay. Bitpay is great for people who run an online shop and need shopping cart integration, new addresses generated automatically, etc.
Since this is not the case with donations I would advise you against it. They are indeed a middleman and will charge you a fee. Instead you should manage your own addresses (Be you own bank!) with the methods described above.

3- Then you sent 44 coins to this addres which i suppose is from your QT wallet. 
1Q4gwk4AYp7GgPeA1jGA5dLZPSjiG3Qdyq 
4- Then, what happened according to the blockchain is that you sent the coins back to your blockchain address instead of sending them directly to friedcat. Notice that both addresses are very similar. 
5- Then you panicked and were like "Where the fuck is my money" and you notice that it is back at blockchain. You thought you had sent it to Friedcat but accidentally sent it there.

Imagine there are two parallel universes and you can decide whether you make money in one universe or you make money in the other universe. You know that in the end, the least popular universe will be discarded... where do you make money?
If a single miner decides to keep working on the least popular chain... it's their risk. 
Also, a single miner can't enforce their own rules because regular users are nunning clients/programs that don't accept these rules. No one would accept that block because everybody's programs would reject it and forget about it.
The only possible thing that a miner with enough hashing power can do, is to keep solving blocks in which he makes makes bitcoins out of thin air by confirming his own double spent transactions. This is what we call the 51% attack, because in order to do this, a single party would need to have more computational power than anybody else together on the network (51% of the total). 
But this is extremely difficult and extremely costly to pull off, after all you need to mine better than the sum of all current existing miners!

Everything has pretty much been answered. Just a note on this: 
|  If you lost your wallet.dat file but still had your private key, you still have your bitcoins, yes?
Well, your wallet.dat file happens to contain the private keys to your addresses and losing it is no to be taken lightly. Especially because some programs such as Bitcoin-qt are constantly discarting old addresses and generating new ones. You'll be out of luck if you backed up an old private key and lost the wallet.dat file after the program switched addresses. 
In order to avoid this, the bitcoin-qt client saves hundreds of "future addresses" hidden in its wallet.dat. That way you can make a backup today and it will still be vaild tomorrow after the program switches addresses tomorrow because they have already been generated in advance. 
So, depending on which client you use it is much more recommended that you save the wallet file instead of just exporting a single private key. 
**Fun facts about bitcoin:**
Private keys are just a 256 bit random number. You can literally roll your own offline private keys with a dice. 
Bitcoin-qt stores them in a specific format called "Wallet import format" which starts with a 5, but in essence they are just a long random number. 
This number is 64 digits long in hexadecimal. 
1- Get two standard dice
2- Roll them and follow this table:
3- Do it until you've got a string of 64 hexadecimal numbers without spaces. 
4- Write that number in the Wallet details section of bitaddress.org and you'll get the corresponding public address to the private key that you have just generated manually. 
**Protip:** You can save a copy of the bitaddress.org website and you'll see that it works offline.

I might be wrong but what I meant is that I check the files inside the printer against some hash. 
That hash is calculated from an open source version of the software distributed on your website (or somewhere else) which technically everyone could verify. 
Example: 
1- I download the open source version of the printer firmware from your website, check it, compile it and write down its hash. 
2- I take compiled software from the printer, check its hash and see if it matches with the hash I trust. 
Maybe USB isn't the right connection, but there must be some way to access the printer system to check it in a reliable fashion.

Try using blockchain.info wallet or the electrum bitcoin client, which are both very reliable. Or, unless you want to spend those coins consider making a paper wallet. (Tell me if you want to know more about that).

Try this: 
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:33:03
That concern is justified. That is why backups are so important.
But you don't need to delete your coinbase account. Bitcoins can be sent from one address to another, which means that you can buy bitcoins at coinbase and then just send them to the "safe address" your printed out on hard paper. 
Remember that once printed your paper wallet / gift must have these two things: The public address and the private key. These are two separate strings of numbers and letters. The Public address begins with a number 1 and the private key should start with a number 5. 
By the way, I realized yesterday tha there's also this other website that is maybe much more convenient to create a paper wallet / gift and which also offers a step by step guide: 
You can create as may paper wallets as you like, so don't fear playing around with them and printing some to test what they look like. 
The one thing you must not forget is that Bitcoin works a bit like email. You send bitcoins from one address to another. This means that once you've got bitcoins in your coinbase account / address you must send them to the paper wallet's address... otherwise they will not be there :P
Also, maybe it's not obvious, but once the paper wallet is created you can use it a bit like a piggy bank. There's no limit at how many bitcoins you send to the wallet's addres or how many times. 
Even after you've gifted the wallet to your niece, you could still send bitcoins to her if you keep a copy of the address. You can safely keep a copy of the public address around, the only thing that you must make sure to delete and not disclose to anyone else is the private key which is like a password to access the funds. 
I hope that helped! 
PS: Make sure the paper wallet is stored far away from water or other elements that might harm it. If the key is lost or can't be read... that's it, the coins will be gone forever. Maybe you could print two copies of the same wallet, just as a form of backup. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:50:24
Just print out the private key on a piece of paper, cardboard, metal, wood, whatever. 
You can optionally encrypt it, assuming you will not forget the password. (Many sad bitcoiners have forgot their password. Maybe write down as well, just in case). 
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:24:09
In theory it's easy: 
Take the value of the Bitcoin economy and divide it by 11 million units. 
You see, there is a limited number of coins but an unlimited number of goods and services who want to take a piece of the coin pie. 
In the end the value of the Bitcoin economy (goods and services traded for bitcoins) determines how much the currency is worth. 
If the whole economy is worth 100$, then the maximum amount of goods and services you can buy with all bitcoins will be worth $100, meaning that the total value of all bitcoins is $100.

Except for the "Backup" part which I think is an important feauture for newcomers to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-04 07:53:55
It is basically telling you that your old backup is obsolete and you should create a new one after the encryption. 
After the encryption your wallet will contain two types of keys: 
1. They keys that hold your bitcoins and where previously unencrypted. 
2. The new keys that have only exsited in a secure and encrypted state. 
The first type of keys can't be flushed because they're actually holding funds. But once you start spending and creating transactions, your bitcoins will end up in the new secure addresses.
@_date: 2013-05-02 08:40:58

In preferences enable 2 Factor Authentification so that every time someone wants to login a confirmation code is sent to your email address or even better to your Google Authentification app on your phone.

QT client treats each address as 1 use only and after it's used it sends the remaining balance to a new address that is generally not displayed to the user.

No. That IS the private key. You only have to generate the public address which is generated from the private key. 
This can be done by importing the private key to a Bitcoin application or using bitaddress or similar offline ressources.
A Bitcoin private key is just a 256 bit Hexadecimal number.

The public address is like a money box. The private key is the key to that box. 
You send money to the public address and when you want to access that money, you import the private key to your favourite Bitcoin application.

Ah... that could explain it. Winrar passwords are not really secure and have been known to be crackable. 
My guess is that you have some sort of malware on your computer, probably a rootkit your AV can't detect (try a rootkit scanner and report back) and they've got a copy of your password. Either by stealing the rar file or simply by stealing it directly from your copy-past clipboard.

The problem right now is not so much the cost of mining equipment, than actually getting the equipment. 
There are so many people that want some, that the few companies that produce these machines can't keep up with the demand.
This means that you might preorder something now, and possibly don't get the equipment until some months have passed and it might be obsolete by then. 
If you can find a way of getting an ASIC mining machine with a decent hashing rate and can pay for it, I would do it. It's not too late if you actually get the machine in time. 
(Bitcoin mining won't stop until the year 2100+ and then you'll still earn transaction fee rewards as a miner). 
@_date: 2013-05-11 08:37:34
It also hurts people who are in debt and owe bitcoins because it makes repayment more difficult.
If you wanted to know why, supposedly, it is so bad to burn dollars this is the reason. Burning money decreases the money supply and the consequent deflation makes debt repayment more difficult. Since our current monetary system is almost exclusively based on debt and money that doesn't really exist outside the fractionary reserve banking system, a decrease in money supply would cause inevitable defaults and the collapse of the economy.
The moral of this story? Don't build an economy based on debt.

No, not each part gets a fee. Each kilobyte of the total transaction costs a fee. 
If you have many many small pennies the load on the network will be larger and you'll have to pay more. This is done in order to avoid people attacking and spamming the network with many small transactions. 
It's not the amount of parts that matters but the amount of kilobytes you send through the network.

What about a regular contact form? 
They write their username, the virtual product they desire and include the transaction ID. 
Imagine [this is your address]( On blockchain.info you and your clients can easily check each transaction and their ID. 
Ideally you would ask them to include a digital signature, but I'm afraid most people don't know how to sign a message using Bitcoin addresses. A signature would provide proof that the person sending you the message is 100% without doubt the person who made the payment. 
But even without signatures I doubt it's going to be a problem for a small server as yours. Just tell them to send the message right after sending the transaction and not to wait 3 days and you should be fine.

What browser do you use and what plugins do you have installed on there?
Since there was no external attempt to access the wallet, it seems that the software caught it from your browser when opening your wallet. They didn't spy on the passphrase but directly caught the private key when your browser unencrypted it.
**Do you or have you ever run any sort of mining software?**

**There is a big problem with reversibillity:** It is intended to be used when there is no agreement between two parties. 
If there was agreement between the two involved parties, then it's as easy as just sending the money back. 
This means that in a system with reversible transactions a central authority that decides if a claim to reverse a payment is valid or not, is necessary. But bitcoin is a decentralized currency: you can't be both decentralized and trustless and have reversible transactions at the same time. 
There is a solution to this: optional escrow. Those who want reversible transactions can just use an escrow service where such "high authority" exists and can reverse a payment. Those who don't want it, are free to stick to the core system. A solution that suits everybody.

2. See if you've got a copy of that wallet file somewhere. Once you know what it looks like it should be easier to determine whether you have it or it is lost. I don't use that program so I can't tell you what the format is. 
In the official satoshi client the wallet file is usually called: wallet.dat
I'll see if I can find out which format it is. 
**EDIT:** If it is the Schildbach's Bitcoin wallet app, then the important file is saved as a .wallet file. 
If you're on windows, make sure that you can see file extensions and see if you've got a file on your SD card or where that ends in .wallet. 
Also, see if these folders ring a bell or you have the somehow.

The bitcoins have been sent to a hidden "change" address inside bitcoin-qt. They are still under your possession, but not inside the public address you have given us. 
Bitcoin-qt does this to increase privacy with every outgoing transaction. Anayways, make sure to export a backup of your wallet :)

Yep. This is a very recommended practice if you hold large amount of bitcoins. 
Create a few offline addresses and fund them. That way your coins are 100% malware safe. 
But make sure that it is legible when you print it, that you don't lose it, that your spouse thinks it's trash or anything similar :P

In blockchain.info you go to Import/Export and in the official client you do this:

I'd suggest the "Mycellium" app which, unlike coinbase, is a standalone wallet, which means that only you know the private key.
Anyways, once a customer enters you click on "Receive bitcoins". It will show a QR code and the customer just has to scan it with his mobile phone. Done.
(And whatever Bitcoin software you use, don't forget to make a backup or export the private keys which is the "password" to your bitcoins. I have mine written down on paper so that it doesn't matter if my phone breaks or is lost.)

That's how it works... but the bug would cause the 0.7 client NEVER to accept the 0.8 blockchain. 
On the other hand, 0.8 would accept the 0.7 blockchain if it becomes longer than its own. 
So there were two options: 
- Either we require miners to shift back to 0.7 in order to make it longer and get back to having one single blockchain. (Which is what happened). 
- Or we must tell everybody, users, merchants, all bitcoin users that the 0.7 client is no longer suported and they must upgrade ASAP to the new version. 
The last option would have been the natural path (and there's inherently nothing wrong with it)... but it could have created even more chaos, as many people still use the older client and the whole network would be forced to upgrade overnight.

There's a bot that keeps the Bitcoin wallet for all reddit users. That way, when user A types a certain comment to user B, the bot transfers X bitcoins from user A's wallet to user B's wallet. The Bot can do that because it controls the wallets for all users. 
Of course you can always withdraw or deposit bitcoins to your bot-managed wallet.

If your computer is stolen, they can't get to your bitcoins as long as you've chosen a strong password.

You can even go further and generate and address with dice. 
1. Get at least two dice. One will be Dice Horizontal and the other will be Dice Vertical. 
2. Roll both dice 64 times and write down the results according to this table. (* means: Roll again). 
If you have more dice then the process will be faster. I usually roll 8 dice at once, so I can generate 4 random numbers each roll. 
3- You end up with a 64 digit Hexadecimal number, which will be the private key to your new address. It should look something like this: 
Example private key: 


4- Import it to your bitcoin wallet, which will calculate the corresponding public address. (Most support this format).
Alternatively, for a paper wallet, to calculate the public address you can paste it on Bitaddress.org's "Wallet details" section or as a secret exponent on "Brainwallet.org". 
This way you don't need to trust these foreign address generators. You can just generate the keys yourself and use these applications only to calculate the corresponding public address. **Used best in combination with a live CD or live USB**.

Basically people would have to download a new Bitcoin program with the new code.

Mining solves the problem of Money distribution: How do people get your currency in the first place?
A solution that would not be very ethical is that a central authority, a single person or company creates all bitcoins and then starts handing them out. But how could we trust that person not to pocket the money or give it to just its friends?
Mining solves this by giving bitcoins only to people who take time, effort and ressources such as electricity in order to generate the bitcoins. 
So, every bitcoin created by mining is a bitcoin obtained by sacrificing something that has real life value: time + hardware + electricity.

Why don't you let them buy Bitcoins from a central secured computer?
Using bitcoins in an internet café computer is a really really bad idea in my opinion and I would never do it because the risks are just too high. 
But your customers don't need the café's computers in order to use bitcoins. They can use bitcoins from their smartphones!
What about this: 
You've got a central secure computer from which you sell the coins and instead of installing wallets on the other computers, you just send the bitcoins to your customer's own private and secure smartphone. 
The easiest application I can think of is Bitcoinspinner. It downloads and installs in seconds. 
Then your customers can browse web (using your internet café computers) and if they see something they like, they just scan the QR code on the computer screen with their smartphones and can send the money immediately. 
**EDIT:** I would also make sure that the amount of Bitcoins on the central computer is limited and gets refilled only when needed. Just an added security measure.

Well, I guess there's always a chance, especially if you've got a physical keylogger installed or you've got a printer that keeps copies of everything it prints. 
Also, if the RAM is deep frozen after generating the keys they can be recovered and maybe the Live CD itself is compromised to silenly mount the HDD, write down the data and send it to the attacker after boot. 
This is a bit farfetched, so you should be fine. Your biggest worry would be the printer, I think.

I would not recommend you using coinbase as a wallet because you end up depending on them and they have a reputation of being slow and messing up sometimes. 
Just use coinbase to buy the coins and then send them to your own wallet.
Good wallets are [electrum.org]( (offline, very secure) or  (Online)
By the way, Do you have access to the private key? In a real Bitcoin Wallet that you control you should always have access to the private key. 
If you can export the private key then you should be able to import it into a different application and just send the transaction from there. That's why I dislike Coinbase, because you don't have access to the keys of your coins. (Or am I mistaken?)

My favourite one is Electrum. Visually it is very simple, but it is also very powerful. 
I suggest you try it out with a small amount first. Send bitcoins to your paper wallet and then import it to electrum. 
But remember! Once you import the key, the paper wallet is spent and all the funds must be sent to a new one. They cannot remain there if you wan to keep it secure!
Basically: Do not re-use paper wallets. You can generate as many as you need.

@_date: 2013-01-27 15:58:16
As long as a transaction is not confirmed, you can technically spend those coins again and again, but only the first transaction to make it into a block gets confirmation. (This is the way Bitcoin avoids double spending). 
Regular clients don't allow you to do this, but you could technically create a second transaction that is identical to the first but include a comission this time. Then, once this second transaction gets confirmed the other one is automatically rejected by the network and will never be confirmed. 
So no, you won't lose your coins. 
But in most cases it's not worth doing this because you just have to wait a couple of hours.

Bitcoin works in a similar way as your email address. 
There is a public address... which allows people to send bitcoins to you and private key that is the key or password that allows you to spend them. 
Luckily, the bitcoinspinner app keeps the private key stored securely and does not show it to you. If you go to advanced settings, though, you can actually export the private key in order to make a backup. Don't show this to anybody!
So, when you installed Bitcoinspinner the program generated a new address for you. These addresses are generated using mathemathics, which means that they are completely decentralized and no one can control them. The ONLY way to access the bitcoins of a certain address is using the private key. 
The beauty about bitcoin addresses is that it doesn't matter where they were generated. As long as you've got the key you can access your bitcoins from anywhere in the world with any bitcoin application. (Just import the private key). 
Also... you can receive payments by just showing or printing a QR code of your address. Isn't that awesome?
Imagine a charity printing this QR code on their flyers and printed ads... people could donate some money on the spot with no hassle, from anywhere in the world. 
By the way, Bitcoinspinner is a bit limited, being that you can only use one address. The creator made it so to keep the app simple. Other applications allow you to manage as many addresses as you want. 
If you want to learn more about how the bitcoin network works, feel free to read this post I wrote a couple of days back:

Let's analyze what a transaction looks like. Each transaction is about 10 bytes + 180 bytes per input + 32 bytes per output. 
You pay a fee for every 1024 bytes of transaction size. 
This means that you can include 5 inputs in a transaction before having to pay the minimum fee more than once. 
This does work for tipping because the transaction fee is very very small. It used to be a fraction of a cent. So you could send 5 inputs for a fraction of a cent. 
Also, the fee is waived for inputs that have not been moved in a while, penalizing only transactions that move many many pennies around and strain the network.

Actually Bitcoin is brilliant for Urban geocaching as hiding keys is a simple as hiding a piece of paper.

There's still a chance that Bitcoin's value will raise and some day that $1.40 you mined will become $100. 
But of course... it's a gamble as this might never happen.

You don't delete bitcoins by converting them to another currency. As a matter of fact you can only convert Bitcoins into a different currency the way you converty any other currency: Exchanging them with a different user / entity. 
When you go to your bank and change your USD for EUR (Let's say you're planning a trip to Europe) you get the euros and the bank keeps your dollars. No currency is destroyed in the process. 
Obviously the bank will ask you a little bit more dollars than the equivalent value of the euros it will give you. That's how it makes profit. 
When converting your Bitcoins to USD you're actually exchanging them with the USD of other people. That's why the websites where this takes place are called "exchanges". 
Bitcoins are only destroyed if you lose the "key" / password to them.

All addresses that electrum generates can be recovered from your 12 word passphrase. Write it down!
Unless you have imported external keys, this is all you need to recover your wallet. 
Also, if you're using electrum with a password your wallet is already encrypted. Do the following: 
1- Find the electrum.dat file which is stored in the hidden folder .electrum (in linux, don't know about Mac but it should be something along the lines). 
2- That file contains your keys. Copy it to a secure pendrive and consider deleting the file on your computer (only after you have securely backed it up and written down the twelve words). 
After your computer returns you can restore your wallet either by opening electrum and introducing your 12 words or by copy-pasting the file where it was before. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 20:13:04
A full node is a client that cointains a full copy of the blockchain. 
Some light clients such as electrum connect to a server to read the blockchain. The blockchain is the list of mined blocks. 
Bitcoin is decentralized because it's people who have and distribute copies of the blockchain, not a centralized server. So the more people who run a client that keeps a copy of this list/ledger the better and the stronger Bitcoin will be.

Try out Electrum, which is a very easy to use and secure software wallet. It allows you to encrypt the wallet and determine which fee you want to pay. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 15:28:36
Yup. It's easier and more secure to have large nodes than large payment processors. 
The advantages of large nodes over payment processors: 
1- Easier to set up.
2- A node only relays a transaction, it doesn't require paying fees. 
3- I can choose the node. If one decide not to play by the rules, people can very very easily ignore it. 
4- We might find an effective way to prune the blockchain or keep up with it as techonolgy progresses. 
5- I don't need to trust my coins to a third party.

The problem is that it contains an output of less than 10 mbit. This usually pretty much requires a fee in order to confirm in a timely fashion. 
Are you using the iOS or the Android version?

I wish more people would know this. When I was new at this bitcoin thing I was pretty freaked out at the sudden crash from 19 to 15 we had one weekend and was about to sell. Luckily I needed 3 confirmations to sell, which took longer than usual and it saved me from selling at the deep bottom and making a loss. 
Lesson learned: Bitcoin is a rollercoster. Hold on and enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2013-02-22 08:58:29
There is a limited amount of bitcoins... imagine there's just 10. 
But at the same time there's 100 different people who want these bitcoins  because they are very useful as currency. They can't be forged, are anonymous, can be sent instantly over the internet...
So these 100 people decide they want a part of the bitcoins: 
- The first person goes: "I'll pay $1 for a Bitcoin!"
- Then the second person interrupts: "No... no no I'll pay $2!"
- And the third man exclaims: "Stop being silly! I'll buy for $5!"
And that is how the price goes up. Because there are few people selling bitcoins but many who want to buy them. 
The opposite can also be true, for example when someone has a huuuuuge load of hoarded bitcoins and decides to sell them all at once. This is called a dump. 
There will be a HUGE amount of bitcoins for sale for just the regular amount of buyers. This drives the price down. 
And, based on the laws of supply and demand the price of bitcoin changes. By the way, the same applies to the gold and silver market.
@_date: 2013-01-29 23:26:54
If you're going to keep the private key on a computer then use a Bitcoin wallet application which basically do the same, both protecting the key and allowing you to do transactions. 
The risk in both cases is that the password to your wallet or keepass is discovered through a keylogger.

And they're using mBTC as a standard value which is pegged to their WMX. 
Here's how it works if I understand it correctly.

You can withdraw your WMX to mBTC back again at any moment at the same rate.

You can buy a simcard at any Tchibo shop. (Look out for the Tchibo logo!)
For 20€ you got a Sim with a german phone number and 1 month unlimited internet (with a 500 MiB High speed internet limit). It is called the Internet package L. 
If you travel regularly to Germany keep the Sim (you've already paid for it) and then just activate the 1 month internet for 10€ each time you go. 
Also: Once purchased the sim card you need to activate it either at the shop (48 hours until its functional) or over the internet or a landline (1 hour activation). This might be the trickiest part if you don't speak german but I'm sure they'll help you at the shop. 
- According to Tschibo the Sim card only costs 2.95€ currently and comes with 5€ credit. 
- These are the Internet options: 
- This is a sale where you get the Sim card + 1 month free internet for 8€ (300 MiB high speed limit). You might want to take some info from the website and ask for this product at the shop: 
- Just buy the Sim card and some extra credit in order to buy the internet package if they don't do it automatically at the shop. I reckon this might all be a bit tricky if you don't speak german. Hopefully someone can help you out.
- This is the website you must fill out in order to register the 
Sim card. Registration is almost instant if done over the Internet (takes about 1 hour at max. You'll receive an SMS message once it's complete): 
- And there is a Tschibo very close to Kreuzberg!
**Double edit:**
Now that I think about it... you don't need an internet package to use Bitcoin which doesn't require much bandwidth. 
In that case just buy the sim card for 2.95€, which already comes with free 5€ credit. Register the Sim and you're ready to go. At 24ct per MiB it should be enough to do any amount of Bitcoin transactions during your stay.

@_date: 2013-02-15 20:16:58
Of course it is not a stupid questions! There are no stupid questions!
Your concern is indeed justified. What you should do in order to have a secure paper wallet is to generate a new key in an offline computer that will not be saved on that computer and then send the coins to its address. 
In order to do this, many people use "Live Linux" cds or USBs. These are operative systems that load from a CD or USB and will completely disappear, leaving no trace, once the computer is rebooted. 
People often generate a key on these live systems, print it out and then reboot the computer. 
But yeah, the idea of the paper wallet is that you don't store the key in the computer but only on a physical medium. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:45:51
The difference is automation. Bitpay makes it easy to accept bitcoins without needing to know how to implement a shopping cart extension for Bitcoin on your website. 
You usually want the process to be as automated as possible. If you use Bitpay the client can make a purchase, send you the money and you'll be notified what items have been purchased. 
Without automation the client might send the money but you need to instruct your website to notify you somehow when and which items have been bought.

Blockchain just displays the balances of the keys you import. You had the same key in two different wallets which means you authorized two programs to manage the same funds. 
QT created the transaction and sent the funds to a new address. (You own this new address, it's just hidden by QT for security).

First of all you must be aware that you don't need an online account. You can use any bitcoin client or program to import your key. 
Good bitcoin clients are Electrum for PC and Mycelium for Android. 
Furthermore, you can try a paper wallet without actually funding it. Create a new one, don't send money to it, and try to import it. It'll work. The only difference will be that the balance will remain 0. 
After a paper wallet has been imported it is not considered cold storage / paper wallet anymore. The most important part of all this is that the "key" or "code" you import is the key that gives you acces to your bitcoins. Do not disclose it to unwanted people or handle it carelessly.

Developers could just calculate a new minimum fee based on network health and DOS risk, announce the new fee an have users and miners switching in a couple of days. 
This would not be a "rogue" fee, but a fee oficially supported by the Bitcoin-qt developers. 
This could happen overnight or right now... there's no need to wait to hit 100. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 08:59:36

@_date: 2013-03-18 11:50:10
You would be running on an "alternate" Bitcoin network. The network would become more and more insecure as there are less and less users (strength in numbers). (Since it is being abandoned for the newer version). 
Also, if miners switch all at once, then there will be no blocks mined in a looooong time and it'll just stop. 
Nothing will happen to your Bitcoins though. Just update and all will be back to normal.

Important: Don't publish your private key. 
Searching for the private key on blockchain is like telling the blockchain servers: "HELLO! This is the code to my money! Steal it!"
Private keys do not appear on the block chain and must remain secret only to you. Never publish them on the internet. The only moment you want a private key to have contact with a computer is when you want to import it to your bitcoin wallet program.

You're in an undercover mission and you meet with your contact at a solitary café in a small town of eastern europe. 
There is no electricity and smartphones are not an option as they would attract too much attention and you could get searched and arrested by the military forces of the oppresive regime. 
You take out two small pieces of paper and a pencil out of your pocket and start scribbling down random numbers. You fold the paper and hand it to your contact who nods, stands up and disappears forever.
Once you're out of the dangerous zone, you take your copy of the number, import the private key to calculate the public address and send 1000 BTC to it.
Or just:

It is indeed cheap compared to other systems. But the main reason I wrote this post is because I had the feeling that people didn't know they had a real influence and were just waiting for a developer (with all due respect) or a miner to dictate the next fee. 
Also, it is important to be aware that Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used across the globe. While 4 cents might no be much for an US citizen, it could increase to a significant amount for someone making several purchases in a third world country: For them this might be the difference between using Bitcoin or not.

How have you got a wallet.dat file in the first place without knowing what program it came from?
@_date: 2013-03-25 12:14:13
There are currently miners and pools who accept 0 fee transactions. Your transaction would certainly be confirmed although it could take a bit longer. 
In the end it depends on whether you need a confirmation fast or not. If you're making a purchase, you might want to consider using the current standard, while using a lower fee (the one you believe is right) when sending money to a friend, yourself or just somewhere you don't care if it takes a bit longer. 
Ideally you'd want to use 0.0001 everywhere, but it's clearly understandable that in some situations it might be necessary to make an exception.

No one knows what the value is going to be. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:46:25
Not necessarily. If you spend only a partial amount using, let's say, the Bitcoin-qt program then this partial amount will go to the merchant but the rest will be kept by Bitcoin-qt. The rest will not be inside the paper wallet anymore. 
Afterwards you should just create a second transaction sending the remainder back to a new paper wallet. 
You should not re-use paper wallets, basically because once the private key has "touched" a computer with internet it is not considered secure anymore. 
Since paper is cheap, just print several extra empty wallets and once you have to spend one, you send the remainder to a new wallet.

I'm not familiar with the bitcoin-qt client so I can't help you there.
What I think the problem might be: 
You succesfully created the transaction but it wasn't broadcast properly. Maybe because some nodes rejected it  or because there has been a problem with your outgoing internet connection. 
But don't worry. Bitcoins can't disappear. It might take a time for them to confirm but they can't actually disappear into nowhere. They must always be somewhere. 
Let me ask you another question: 
When it happened with your mobile client... where you connected to the same internet/wifi/router connection?

You can use a different Bitcoin program that syncs instantly by connecting to a server to read the blockchain instead of downloading it to your computer. 
Such programs are: 
- Electrum
- Multibit
- Or the online wallet at Blockchain.info
My favourite is electrum, as its security and recovery options are by far the best out of the three.

Gold and Silver, both have HUGE disadvantages over Bitcoin. 
The fact that they are something physical means that they will need to be stored at a bank and that these banks can start giving out unlimited "bank credit" thanks to the fractional reserve system which people will accept as real money. 
With Bitcoin this is drastically different, because people are not forced to accept a Bank's "promise of future payment" and can always demand real Bitcoins.

Paper wallets are not really meant to be transferred because the previous owner could still have the private key. 
In order to verify them you could scan the address and check it at 
For added security, you should "sweep" the bitcoins. This means that you import the key and inmediately send the bitcoins to an address that only you control. 
But still... only accept paper wallets or private keys from people you trust or sweep them inmediately to an address only you control. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:23:42
I think what's happening here is that you used a very very old client and it's reasonable to think that the transaction did not get broadcasted to the newer bitcoin network. 
First of all make a backup of the wallet.dat file. 
Afterwards update your bitcoin-qt client or import the wallet.dat file into multibit (I think multibit allows importing). 
Anyways, once you've don that you should have access to the bitcoins and be able to send them to the new address. 
PS. Whatever you do at this step, don't delete any address yet. Don't delete any address or file until you're confident that you've got the BTC in Multibit.

Bitcoins are stored inside a Bitcoin address. An address is made up of two parts: 
1- The public address which everybody may know
2- The private key which only you must know, because it gives you access to the coins. 
You can see this easily here: 
What a Bitcoin wallet usually does is storing all private keys inside a single file and then usually encrypts it so that only the owner with the password can access those keys. 
Blockchain does exactly the same. Your browser encrypts that file so that only you, who knows the password can access the keys. 
The only difference is that instead of keeping the file on your computer, blockchain stores it for you. But, since they don't have your password even they can't access it. 
**Remember the important part:**
- Bitcoin addresses have a "Public Address" and "Private key". 
- A Bitcoin wallet is a piece of software designed to handle, mange and store those keys. 
- As long as you have the private keys, you have access to your bitcoins. 
You can backup your bitcoins in various ways: 
1- You backup the file that contains all your private keys.
 
2- If you only have a few addresses, you could just print out the private keys that correspond to those addresses. 
**About Bitcoin security:**
The only way someone can ever steal your Bitcoins is by having access to your private keys. 
For example, if they know your password they could decrypt the file that holds them and get access to them. 
Bitcoin security is about one thing only and the only job you have: Keep the private keys safe.

The 0.8 software alwasy chooses the longer blockchain. 
The 0.7 is programmed to do the same, but due to the bug it couldn't. 
So, as soon as people started mining on the 0.7 version and it became longer, 0.8 automatically gave in and switched to the other blockchain. 
Notice that the opposite wouldn't have been possible as it was impossible for 0.7 to accept the new blockchain despite its length (due to the bug). That is why we told people to mine on 0.7 and not on 0.8.

Many online shops decide to use a Bitcoin merchat processor because it allows them to integrate with a shopping carte, no need of technical knowledge and instantly convert their bitcoin purchases to USD or any other currency and be deposited in their bank account. 
Such companies are: 
- Bitpay
- Walletbit
- Coinbase 
Inside your store you can use the same method if you have a Tablet or a Smartphone. 
Alternatively, it is possible to accept bitcoins manually. 
1- Have a Bitcoin Wallet (your own wallet, not a Bitcoin processor)
2- Generate some addresses and print them out with QR code. 
3- Each time a customer wants to pay, he scans one of those QR codes and the money will directly go to your wallet. 
This works great for small shops since there is no automation needed. Just add the total amount of the purchase and show the customer the QR code. 
If you have a computer nearby you can check instantly that the payment went through. 
Remember this: For large purchases it is recommended that you wait for at least one confirmation.

Yes indeed, miners are the ones with the final choice, but remember that they will always favour higher prices while users will always favour lower prices. 
In this sense, it is possible for users to collectively apply pressure to mining pools in order for them to react. 
If users started enforcing a reasonable fee on their clients, it would only be a matter of time until a pool gave in and started accepting that fee.
Right now, no mining pool will lower the fee out of the blue unless there is a reason for them too. A large userbase demanding a lower fee is a reason. 
It's ultimatively an act of balance: Miners will not accept too low fees and users will not accept too high fees.

Convenient solutions are being worked on. At the moment I would recommend doing the following. 
1. Keep some BTC in a Paper wallet. 
2. When you want to spend BTC use Mycellium's cold storage option. 
With this option you scan the private key (step 1) and then scan the destination address (step 2).
The key is only used to sign the transaction and then immediately wiped from memory, which means it's not stored on the device and not affected by malware.

The price is affected by market forces such as demand and supply, which only deal with coins that are in circulation.

Let's imagine I sell you a pizza for 10 BTC. 
Next day a competitor (new bitcoin adopter) arrives and in order to compete decides to sell his pizza at 9.5 BTC instead. 
The next day Bitcoin is adopted by another merchant, this time one who sells Alpaca socks and wants you to spend your coins on his socks instead of pizzas. He offers you a deal of 10 BTC per pair of high quality alpaca socks. 
People see this offer and think: Well, I'd rather buy a pair of alpaca socks than a pizza. A pair of alpaca socks has much more value. Of course this causes the Pizza makers to lower their prices: Now you can buy pizza for 8 BTC. 
This story goes on and on, and Bitcoin grows in value the more merchants adopt it. You must keep in mind that every merchant who does transactions with Bitcoin is a merchant who "demands Bitcoin". The people (consumers) who want to buy stuff with bitcoins are people who "offer bitcoin". 
If the amount of merchants grows, so does the demand curve and the price of Bitcoin goes up. It's inevitable. 
Speculators just try to predict this growth and buy lots of bitcoins before the price goes up. Ironically by doing this they cause the price to go up as well, but not the actual wealth in the system. If there's a lot of speculators and no merchant support (real wealth) they'll realize that they've all bought and bought but the price increase was caused by them and not by a real sustainable appreciation in value. That is what we call a bubble and once they realize this they might panic and the bubble might pop.

Every Bitcoin address has a secret key. This key is usually stored inside the Bitcoin program of your choice and is what allows you, and only you, to spend your bitcoins. 
Basicially, in order to spend the coins from some address you need to know the secret key. 
If this key is written down on a piece of paper instead of being stored in a Bitcoin program, then this is what we call a Paper Wallet. 
**The following is the most secure way to create a paper wallet:**
1- Download a Linux live CD such as [ubuntu]( or [lubuntu]( which is lightwheight.
A live CD is an operating system that runs from a CD opposed to your hard disk. It is a temporary operating system that does not need to be installed, as it will run straight from the CD and everything will be reset and back to normal as soon as you shut the computer down and eject the CD.
*Why is this good?*
This guarantees that you'll be running a completely new operating system that has never been connected to the internet and is malware free. This is recommended por maximum security. 
2- Still on your regular operating system, go to  This is an address generator website that works offline. You need to download the website.. 
In chrome go to the wrench and then choose: "Save website as". In other browsers you might need to go to "File" instead. 
3- Copy the downloaded website to a (preferably recently formated) USB drive. 
4- Unplug any LAN / Internet cable and reboot your computer with the live CD inside.
5- Now the Live CD should boot and in a few minutes you should be facing a brand new operating system that has never been connected to the internet. 
6- Open the website you saved on your USB. You don't want internet for this as the website can be run offline and will work offline. (That's because it does all necessary calculations in your browser). 
7- Generate a paper wallet. This is, an address and it's secret key, also called: private key. The "Paper wallet" section in Bitaddress provides you with fancy graphics although I prefer the "Single wallet" menu. 
8- Print out this key pair or write it down very very carefully.
9- Close the website. Reboot the computer, eject the CD and load your normal operating system. You're done!
This may seem like a lot of hassle but the concept is the following: The secret key is now only available on the piece of paper. 
No malware, virus, hacker or whatever can affect it as it lives off the computer.
*Funding your paper wallet*
1- Just send coins to the public address that starts with 1. 
2- After this moment, treat the piece of paper as actual money as it is your only copy of the key and you don't want to lose it. You've effectively created a "bitcoin bill".
Also, don't show the secret key to anybody and consider printing out two or copies of the same address just to have a backup. Keep them safe!
*Spending the coins of that wallet*
In order to spend the coins you just need to import the secret key to a bitcoin program. If you're using Blockchain.info's wallet, for example, just got to Import / Export and there you'll find a place to write down the private key. 
After clicking the import button, the balance will be displayed and you'll be able to spend the funds inmediately. 
Other programs might have different import procedures. 
**And that's it!**
Any questions? Cheers!
**PS: Try it now!**
1- Go to  and generate a new paper wallet. 
2- Send a very small amount of coins to that wallet. 
3- Try to copy / paste the private key and import it to blockchain or your bitcoin program of choice. 
You'll see that it is very easy. The Live CD steps are only required to keep security at a maximum.

It has value because it's used. It is used because it has value. 
Market forces such as supply and demand will then determine its value. 
Let's say that with Bitcoin it all started when a guy offered to deliver two pizzas for 10.000 BTC. This is then the first person to give the currency some type of value. 
At the moment 5.000 bitcoin is valued at 1 Pizza. 
Now let's say someone else jumps into the game and wants to compete against the first pizza deliverer and offers to deliver a pizza for 4.500 instead. The value of Bitcoin just went up. 
Before you needed 5.000 BTC to buy a Pizza, now it's only 4.500. 
Other people see this and notice that you can exchange BTC for Pizzas and think: "Bitcoin is not very valuable, but at least you can buy pizzas with it. I'll mine some or sell some Magic: The gathering cards to buy me some pizzas". 
The next person sees this and thinks: "Bitcoin is not very valuable, but at least you can buy Pizzas and Magic The Gathering cards with it. I'll sell some cheap trinkets to buy me some pizzas or Magic: The Gathering cards". 
Of course the next person sees this and thinks: "Well, Bitcoin is not very valuable but you can buy Pizzas, Magic cards and Trinkets with it... I'm interested in those, so I'll sell some Alpaca socks for Bitcoins". 
**And this goes on an on until it has grown into a full scale economy with a wide variety of products and services**
The interesting part is that people will start competing against each other, lowering their prices which in turn makes Bitcoin more valuable.
As you can see, Bitcoin is valuable because people accept it. People accept it... because it's valuable.
Also, there's one other important difference between bitcoin and other commodities: Bitcoin has been designed to fulfill certain attributes that good currency must have. For example: it's divisible. It would be very difficult to use Bitcoin if we couldn't split it up in smaller parts. 
1. Because people accept it.
2. Because it has been designed with certain attributes that make it ideal as currency. 
**PS:** It is EXACTLY like traditional / historical currency such as gold, gems or precious metals... or even better because some of these previous examples do not fulfill all attributes as well as Bitcoin does. It is very similar to modern paper / fiat currencies, with the difference being that Fiat money can be manipulated (created and destroyed) by the governement and because people didn't decide to start using it on their own, but it was enforced by the government.

But remember that now your bitcoins will be as safe as that piece of paper or the backup you keep... which can be extremely secure.

Bitcoin works with addresses and private keys which allow you to redeem the amount of bitcoins that was sent to an address. 
As many others have already pointed out you can visit a bitcoin generator such as  to see what a full Bitcoin address pair looks like. 
The idea is the following: 
You generate an address and print it out so that the private key is only available on a physical medium... such as a paper document. Then you send the bitcoins to the public address. 
What you've just created is a paper wallet, which is a very secure type of wallet because the only way to get to those bitcoins is to import the key printed on that paper. 
A paper wallet cannot be affected by malware, viruses, hardware failure or anything similar. If someone wanted to steal your bitcoins they would have to physically enter your house and find that piece of paper. 
Once you've created the paper wallet you can check the Balance by using websites such as  
You should know by now that all Bitcoin transactions are completely public but anonymous because no one knows what person lies behind what address. 
That is how it is possible to look up the balance of certain addresses. Example:
So basically, once you've sent the bitcoins to your paper wallet you could go to blockchain and lookup the balance of that address. You could keep sending bitcoins to that address as much as you wanted and keep saving them securely on that paper wallet. 
Finally if you ever want to spend those keys, you would just need to import the private key (which starts with a 5) into any Bitcoin application and the funds would be spendable immediately.
Remember! Bitcoin private keys usually start with a 5. 
You must protect this key as it is the only way you can redeem your bitcoins. Do not let it be seen by anybody and do not lose it!

Assuming your computer has no spyware or keylogger that would then send out the cached private key once reconnecting to the internet, it should be safe. 
If you still want to be 100% sure, download a Linux Live CD which is a brand new operating system that can be loaded from a CD and does not depend on the hard drive. 
1. You load the Live CD
2. Generate the keys
3. Reboot your computer to your normal Operating system. Nothing is saved and the keys are "lost" from the computer.

Yes, but this has nothing to do with what happened in the other post. 
Once you import the key it is obviously exposed to your computer and it ceases to be a pure paper wallet.
Some people split their bitcoins in 10 different paper wallets and import as many keys as they need in that moment. But you do good to send whatever amount is unspent to a new paper wallet. 
As you have already seen, generating large amounts of paper wallets is quite easy. Just print a dozen in advance and you'll have them ready for whenever you need them. 
**So, what happened in the other post?**
The guy imported the key and decided to reuse it. After importing it usnig the program Multibit, he sent 12 BTC to his blockchain address and then deleted all backups on his computer. 
Unaware to him, not only did he send 12 BTC to his address, he also sent the remaining amount to an address inside Multibit... by deleting the backup he lost the coins. 
In bitcoin, when you do a transaction you MUST spend the whole amount. If I've got 10 BTC and want to give my friend Alice 3 BTC the bitcoin transaction would look like this: 
Daniel taylor spends 10 BTC
---&gt; 3 BTC to Alice
---&gt; 7 BTC back to Daniel Taylor
*Here's the transaction that the guy who lost the bitcoins did:* 
Guy spends 102 BTC from address A
----&gt; 12 BTC to his Blockchain address
----&gt; 90 BTC back to his address B
The program Multibit, instead of sending the remainding amount back to his address A sent it to address B, because that's how many bitcoin programs work in order to increase anonymity... they avoid reusing addresses. 
The guy still controlled address B, which was created by multibit for him and was stored inside Multibit... but once he deleted the backups he lost the coins. 
**You should do the following when using a paper wallet**
You spend 10 BTC from paper wallet A
-----&gt; 3 BTC spent to merchant
-----&gt; 7 BTC back to your address A or B (depends on the program)
Then you spend  7 BTC to new paper wallet C. 
I hope it's not confusing. Depending on the program, the change will go back to the original address or a new one will be created. But whatever is the case, you should send your BTC back to a completely new paper wallet.

Breaking it down: 
- In order to break a password a hacking software makes millions of guesses per second. 
- Password security is based on the assumption that there are so many possible combinations that a computer cannot guess all these combinations in a reasonable amount of time. 
If you tried to crack my password and it was "27" it would take you much less than if it was "2345" because the latter has more possible combinations. 
* The more combinations, the more secure the password is. 
So... how can we create a very secure password with many thousands of combinations but that is also easy to remember: "word combinations". 
First of all you create a very large number. A number with so many combinations that it would take an average of millions of years to crack at very high speeds. In computer language you could say that such a password is at least 128 bits long. 
Let's assume the following password was 128 bits: 
(obviously this is much much much shorter. But it's just for example purposes). 
Next thing you do, you create a dictionary with x amount of words and try to translate each number or group of numbers into a word. 
For our example this will be the dictionary: 
0. Banana
1. Apple
2. Pear
3. Cherries
4. Orange
5. Peach
6. Tomato
7. Kiwi
8. Mango 
9. Starfruit
After the translation, our numeric 38556 password becomes: 
Cherries Mango Peach Peach Tomato
Notice that our password is not less random. It is equally random than before, which means that the same amount of combinations is still possible. The only thing we have done is translating numbers into words, but the "randomness" and possible combinations (strength) of the password has been left untouched. 
This is how you can create a very secure password that is easy to memorize. Obviously not with such a short number, but with a real number which is at least 128 bits long. Aftewards you need a dictionary long enought so that you can translate groups of numbers and not just single digits.
If you've used the Electrum Bitcoin client, this is how it creates the seed. 
**Note regarding the XKCD comic:** The theory is true, although given the size of the dictionary four words might not be enough for strong offline security. It might help against an online attack though. 
Here's how you calculate password strength, by the way: Possible number of words (dictionary size) elevated to the number of words you use in your password. That'll probably give you a huge number. 
If you then convert the decimal number to binary and count the number of 0's and 1's you will know the number of bits it has. 
**PS:** Brainwallets get hacked because they don't use random words. No randomness = very few possible combinations = easy to crack. 
If I use my favourite number as my password, then you don't even need to try all other combinations, just those numbers you suspect are my favourite. In the case of brainwallets, people who steal them don't even have to try all combinations, just popular words or sentences.
**PS2:** As the other comment states, you can use diceware to create a strong password. The more word you generate, the better. Try to use at least 7.

The standard fee for most bitcoin transactions is currently 10 US cents (0.1 mBTC). The amount doesn't matter. 
In certain cases, when there's a lot of BTC involved the transaction is considered high priority and no fee needs to be sent. 
So it's either 10 cents or nothing to send whatever amount of money you wish over bitcoin. 
PS. The fee is actually only so high because the bitcoin price rose very quickly these last few days. It used to be about 1-2 cents and will probably be lowered at the next release of the Bitcoin-qt program.

If you're using an old version of Mycelium you should have exported the private keys and written them down on a piece of paper. 
Here's the good news: In the new Mycelium version you don't need to worry about that anymore. In order to backup your keys it'll generate an encrypted PDF file with a password that is displayed on the screen only once. 
What you have to do then is Write down the password on a physical piece of paper and export the PDF file to your SD card, computer, email or publish it publicly on reddit: It doesn't matter, it's encrypted. 
That way you can backup your keys on the SD card and plug the SD card into a live computer and print out the PDF document. Then you write down the password on the printed document and you've got a secure Paper backup. 
Good luck recovering the coins!

First of all, Bitcoin-qt was the original client and is still the most popular one. 
It is a good thing that people use Bitcoin-qt because downloading the blockchain means helping out the network. 
Although for us folks who can't afford to have 10 GiB lost on our hard drives I'm glad that "lightweight" alternatives exist. 
Online Wallets are good but they are also risky is some cases because your coins sit on a foreign server which might get hacked. Having your coins on your own PC is much more secure. 
Electrum cons: If all electrum servers where to fall then you wouldn't be able to know your balance. That's all.
Also, be aware that you still need to protect your computer from trojans and keyloggers. But that's a common factor with both online and offline wallets. 
Also: Always backup! In case of electrum you can just write down the twelve words and you're set. They will allow you to restore your whole wallet. 
You may even get your coins... completely delete electrum form your computer and then just simply restore the wallet with your 12 words at any convenient point in the future.

Yes, FRB is still possible with Bitcoin. But there's a major difference: 
Bitcoin can be transferred digitally all over the world. No credit card, checks or bank wires are needed for this operation. 
This will lead people to accept only Bitcoin (instead of bank credit) and severely limit the scope of FRB. Furthermore, there is no real advantage in having my Bitcoins stored at a bank, except for a slight interest which comes in return for a risk. 
Unlike cash, Bitcoin can be saved securely in your own wallet and there is no need to keep the money elsewhere, specially considering that the lack of regulation will increase the risk of a bank default. 
Bottom line: 
You can deposit Bitcoins in a bank but it doesn't offer any real advantage, but a small return and at least an equivalent amount of risk. 
Since people can store large amounts of Bitcoins in their homes and merchants are not forced to accept bank credit, FRB will be severely limited and will affect only lenders and borrowers.

You can change that amount in your Bitcoin-qt settings or use a different client. 
There's nothing really extraordinary about this, but other clients will now be able to decide whether they relay your transaction or they don't. Also, miners will be able to decide whether they include such a small transaction in a block or not. 
It doesn't mean that it's impossible to send micro transactions, but you'll have to wait until your client connects to other peers and miners in the network that accept these, taking thus a longer time to confirm.
Change is not affected by this as far as I understand.

Do you use Bitpay or some sort of bitcoin processor for merchants or do you handle the bitcoins on your own?
@_date: 2013-01-23 10:17:21
Take a look at  Do it now. 
What you see is a website that generates Bitcoin addresses. A Bitcoin address has two parts: 
1- The public Address
This is the address where you will receive bitcoins. 
If I send bitcoins to your address, you get them. 
2- The Private key
This is a looooong key that allows you to access your bitcoins. 
With Bitcoin YOU control your money. The only thing you must do is keep your private key secure. 
Bitcoin wallets (either online or offline) are programs that store the keys for you and allow you to send Bitcoins. 
A cold storage or a paper wallet is just an address/key pair that has been generated offline. Since they're generated using maths you can generate on a computer that is offline and then write them down on a piece of paper (case sensitive!) or print them. 
You send the bitcoins to the address you generated and since you keep those paper-keys offline in a drawer, a locker or another safe place you don't have to worry about online / hacking /internet risks, etc.
The whole country could collapse and all banks could go broke but you wouldn't need to worry. As long as you have your keys you will be able to later import them to a bitcoin wallet and spend them. 
**Why do you need a bitcoin wallet to spend bitcoins?**
While you don't need to be online to receive bitcoins (you just need the address and the key) you will need a computer software in order to send them. 
When you send bitcoins you're doing a mathematical operation that can hardly be done by pencil and paper (although it is theoretically possible :P). 
Anyways, the output of that operation gets broadcasted to the bitcoin network and the payment becomes effective. 
**Security advice**
Let's say you buy $2000 worth of bitcoins. You could store them in 10 separate paper wallets so that each of these addresses/keys holds about $200.
If you want to spend $200 then you just import one of those keys. If you need less than $400, then you import two of those keys.. etc. etc
Actually, Bitcoin wallets are very secure. Even online wallets such as blockchain.info offer great security options and you should not worry too much about leaving bitcoins in there. 
Most Bitcoin wallets encrypt your wallet very strongly and online wallets will allow you to use two factor autentication. 
And as long as you keep your computer secure you'll have no problems. The paper wallet is just a really useful suggestion if you want to keep laaarge amounts of bitcoins. 
**Edit:** This a demo wallet on blockchain.info
Feel free to look and play around: 
**Edit2:** Another good security advice is to backup your wallet file. The wallet file holds your keys. 
If you've clicked on the demo account from above you'll see the option to back it up. 
By the way, blockchain.info does all the operations on your browser which means that they never get to see your password or keys. They hold the wallet file on their servers for you, but it is encrypted and they can't have access to it. (This is how good online wallets work). 
This also brings us to security advice number 3, which is kind of obvious: Don't trust services or people that have access to your private key. If I tell you: *"Use this address! I have the private key too, but don't worry I'm a good person and I won't use it..."* You can imagine why this is bad.

Supply and demand and basic market forces. 
There's a limited amount of bitcoins, but the amount of people who want bitcoin keeps increasing. 
The amount of people who want bitcoin increases because the currency starts becoming useful and more and more people want to use it.
It's not exactly the same, but think of it as an auction. In an auction there is only one single item and several people who want it. 
- I'll offer 10 cents!
- No! I'll offer 50!
- I'm in for 1$
This is how markets (stock and currency exchanges) operate in today's world. This is not something bitcoin exclusive. 
Here you can see the current market situation. The green line indicates the number of BUY offers (people who want to buy) and the red line indicates the number of SELL offers (people who want to sell). 
If there's a lot of buyers the green line will keep moving to the right as the price increases. The opposite applies as for selling. 
Summarizing: The Bitcoin price depends on the amount of people who want to buy and sell bitcoins.
The amount of people who want to buy and sell bitcoins depends on the usefulness of the currency. Also, the more popular and accepted, the more people want to use it.

Yes. That is totally correct. 
The private key is what gives you access to the Bitcoins. Whoever has it, can import it to a client and have INMEDIATE access to the funds. 
You can't send money to a private address. You must send it to a public address... don't worry about mis-scanning the QR code as the Bitcoin program will only allow you send bitcoins to valid addresses. 
Check out for tor questions. Basically someone needs to give you the Tor URL to visit a certain site.
Edit: You don't need Bitaddress for that. Any Bitcoin address generator that shows you the keys will do. Bitaddress is just very nice and practical. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:24:56
There are no coins. They are not even a number. 
The only thing that does exist is addresses: A public address and a private key that allows you to cryptographically prove that you own the address. 
What happens is that the Bitcoin network keeps track of how many coins every address is worth. It's just a value. 
And by the way, the only way to steal someone's bitcoins is to obtain the private key. If a thief obtains the private key, he can create a transaction telling the network: "Hey, I'm the legit owner! Send all the Bitcoins to this other address". 
Obviously the thief owns the other address. 
Now you might ask yourself: What is the private key made of? 
It's just a random number. But this number is so big that it is impossible to generate twice using a random generator. It is bigger than the amount of atoms in the whole universe. 
Now, when a Bitcoin program creates your bitcoin address for the first time, the first thing it does is generate this random number. This will be the master key to your bitcoins. Afterwards, using some mathematics it derives the Public address from this "master key". 
The interesting part about this public-private key pair, is that you can generate the public address if you know the private key, but it doesn't work in the opposite direction. That is the reason why it is safe to show others your public bitcoin address, they will not be able to calculate or derive the private key from it.

Visit  to see how he did it. 
He generated a key pair (public address + private key), then he sent bitcoins to the address and gave that to the waitress. 
If you do that, only who knows the key will ever be able to access the bitcoins. 
But that's not how it would be done in a physical world situation. Ideally the waittress would have her own address and he would pay her by just scanning the adress' QR code. 
But since she doesn't know about bitcoins and had no addresss.... the guy had to create one for her and fund it.

It's not likely to happen in a small server and if it happens you woud lose nothing as you don't sell physical goods. It would also be really easy to spot as there would be a dispute between two players. 
Bitcoin allows something called "Digital Signature" in order to prevent such situations. All bitcoin programs I know implement this feature.  
A digital signature allows the owner of an address to sign a message. For example, the owner of the address 1xxxxx who just sent you 2 BTC could sign a message that says: "I am "fluffypoofs" and I want a golden apple". 
You can then validate the signature and make sure he is who he claims to be.

If the entity controls +51% of the network it means that the entity will solve all blocks. 
This also means that, during that time, the entity can decide whose payment gets on the blockchain and whose not. During that time he can also allow certain transactions (presumably his own) be multiple times on the blockchain, which means that he can double spend his money. 
The moment he loses his 51% though, all changes are reversed and all transactions are let through again.

Bitcoin doesn't use banks. It is important that only you can control your bitcoins. 
Good Bitcoin applications include ["Electrum"]( and the online wallet [blockchain.info]( In both cases your bitcoins will only be accessible to you and no one else will be able to take them away. 
Please be aware that keeping a virus free computer is a must! You certainly don't want anyone with a trojan to steal your bitcoins. 
Only use those programs on safe computers you trust. 
If you want to hold large amounts of bitcoin and don't want to worry about computer security it is advised that you create a paper wallet.
1- Generate a bitcoin address pair. 
For example on  You can use this website offline if you don't trust it. You can also check the source code. 
2- Print it out and send bitcoins to the public address. 
Your wallet is now 100% offline! Make sure you don't lose the private key or show it to anybody else. 
Once you want to use your bitcoins you just need to import the key to any of the bitcoin wallets I linked before.

You could even recover the coins if you wanted as the original transaction would still have been recorded.

- Disconnect from the internet.
- Open Bitcoin-qt
- Export the private keys and copy them to a temporary text document.
- Make a backup of wallet.dat
- Detelete current version (including its data folder where wallet.dat is stored). That's what you've got the backup for. 
- Install a new version. 
- Reimport the private keys.
Before you delete your 0.7 installation, you could try importing your keys to a temporary wallet at blockchain.info to make sure that it displays the correct balance. (But remember to shut down the program before connecting to the internet). Also, delete your text document and blockchain wallet after all this is done so that your keys can only be found at one place. You definitely don't want to disclose them.
The keys are the codes that give you access to your coins. The wallet.dat file contains both these keys and last transactions. 
What you want to do is to expor the keys but not the transactions. When you reimport them to a new version, the program willl have no way to remember what transactions it was about to make or which hasn't been processed yet. 
After doing all this you should send all your current balance to a new address.

Inflation from 2009 to 2013 is 7.8%
This means, if I bought a Bitcoin with X dollars in 2009, I would now have to pay  X + 7.8% in 2013. 
The same goes for your savings. If you had $100 in your bank in 2009, you would still have $100 in your bank today, but they would be worth 7.8% less... you almost lost 10% just for owning USD. 
Bitcoin does not inflate. Although extremely unstable right now, it would prevent the loss of value of your savings if it were stable.

Yes, but I'd recommend you just export the private key from Bitcoin-qt and import it into Electrum. 
That way you'll be importing the address into electrum so you don't have to wait for the synchronization to finish. 
The problem you might be facing is exporting the key, because as I said, BitcoinQT is not for beginners. I currently don't know how it's done in Bitcoin-qt because I don't use that software. 
Furthermore, once you have imported the key into electrum, I recommend you send send all the money to an address generated by electrum. The addresses that are not imported but generated by electrum can all be recovered with its clever Backup 12-word system. 
Install electrum and try it out without balance. You'll see how it works and how easy it is.

I'd rather have it we colud adjust the fee anytime needed and not just wait for the developers or miners to lower it whenever they want. 
Fees are currently only necessary to fight spam and a DDOS attack. If this could be done a 0.5¢ fee, why can't we keep it that way. 
Blocks are not full at all and there is thus no need for a higher fee than the one required to keep spam at bay. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 09:51:12
Hello jorgeZZ, you don't speak spanish by any chance, do you? Because I do!
Anyways, the answer to your questions: 
1) Yes, mining serves the purpose of creating an obstacle in order to establish a regulated way in which new blocks are published. If anybody, at anytime, could publish a new block then the system would quickly fall appart... the blockchain would become bloated and you would need hundreds of confirmations to make sure  your transaction is safe. 
Also, without that "obstacle", there would be no controlled and predictable way to inject new bitcoins in the economy. 
With mining the difficulty can be adjusted and it is adjusted in such a way that, statistically, on average, one block is found  every 10 minutes. 
The sender includes a voluntary fee in order to get the transaction confirmed more quickly. Remember that it is the miner who gathers all pending transactions and tries to publish them in a new block. Now this block is limited in size and if the sum of all transactions is more than 250 KiB, he will need to prioritize. 
The fee is thus an incentive for the miner to include your transaction in a block. Otherwise he could just as well start mining empty blocks... blocks he gets the reward for but that include no gathered transactions. 
The miner himself decides which transactions he includes in the block and which not. It considered a good practice to include a standard 0.0005 BTC fee to get the transaction confirmed as quickly as possible.

Paper Wallet. It's the only option in your case. 
1- Generate a key pair on an offline computer. (make sure there are no copies left on the device). 
2- Write down the private key and keep it somewhere safe. 
This method also allows you to spend the funds immediately. You import the private key and then you can spend the bitcoins instantly.

Instead of letting a program handle your transactions you basically write and calculate the transaction manually. Then you send it to the network. 
If you did the math wrong, this could happen.

Bitcoin works as a digital ledger. A ledger is a book where you write down transactions such as: 






But instead of having a single book that can be manipulated or controlled by a central authority, this ledger is distributed accross the whole network, completely decentralized and protected by the most advanced forms of cryptograhpy and digital signatures, the same technology modern banks already use and trust on.
This means that bitcoins cannot be forged and cannot be controlled by a single party. When Bitcoin was created, a protocol (certain rules) was established which everybody must follow in order to be accepted by this distributed network. 
**Important advantages of Bitcoin:**
1- Completely decentralized. Only the owner of the coins has access to them and no one can freeze an account or control the network. NO ONE CAN CHEAT (emphasize this). The code is absolutely public and open and can be checked by anybody. 
2- They can be transferred instantly over the internet without restrictions. To stop a bitcoin transaction from happening you would have to shut down the internet. 
3- You can use bitcoins in an anonymous fashion as no one knows who's behind the addresses. 
4- Sending a Bitcoin transaction is as easy as sending an email and often requires little more than scanning a QR code.
5- You don't need to be online to accept bitcoins. Just publish your bitcoin address and the coins will be available to you at any time. 
Make sure you publish your own Bitcoin address / QR in the article so that people can tip you and see how easy it is to actually send money.

Yes, but take into account that as rewards are halved the Bitcoin price will likely go up do to further scarcity and decrease of inflation. 
If you add this to the fact that ASICs might be much cheaper and common and the electricity price keeps steady, then a 12.5 reward in 4 years or even a 6.25 BTC reward in 8 years might be even more valuable than today's 25 BTC.

You can always Export and Import the private keys of your bitcoin addresses. These keys is what gives you access to your bitcoins.
But, if you're going to use electrum I'd really recommend just sending them over to your Electrum address as a regular transaction. Why? Because electrum uses deterministic addresses, which means that if you use the addresses that Electrum gives provides, instead of importing them, you'll be able to recover your wallet with the 12 magic words in case you lose access to it. 
Next, go to your laptop, install electrum, and re-generate the same wallet you've got on your desktop PC by using the 12 words. 
You'll now have the same wallet on two different computers. Make sure you encrypt them with a password!
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:25:11
That's probably because you've been collecting your bitcoin in many tiny different fractions. From faucets maybe?
The case is that, transactions comming from these tiny fractions are larger and occupy a bigger place in the blockchain. You end up paying the standard fee multiplied by the extra transaction size. 
It's like having a lot of pennies and trying to buy something with them... it's a hassle and it takes time to count them. While it doesn't take time in the Bitcoin world, it takes up space (in Kilobytes). 
My suggestion?
If that's the case you should send all your coins to a single address you control. Yes, you will pay a large fee, but you'll be converting those pennies to a "larger coin" more convenient to the network. 
After that, you'll be able to send any amount with a single standard fee (which currently is 0.0005) or even 0 and still go through after some time. 
Also, make sure that the configuration in your Bitcoin-qt settings is correct.

It doesn't matter if they're the good guys and say they won't abuse their power. If BTC Guild reaches +50% hashing power, they'll virtually control the network, be able to create forks, double spend or paralize Bitcoin. 
My local banker also says he's a good guy and I shouldn't worry about him. But that's not the point because **Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, not "centralized with a good guy in charge".**
**For miners:** Theoretically it doesn't matter where you mine, you'll eventually get the same amount of Bitcoins. (It depends a bit on the payment method of the pool, but in the end all what matters is your hashing power).

Bitaddress, for example, is completely open source and you can check the code. 
Also, the addresses are generated in javascript which means that only your browser sees them... they're never sent to a server to begin with. 
But still, this is a very valid concern as you should NOT trust any address generator. 
Here's a trick: Bitaddress works offline!
You can save a copy of the whole website, turn off internet access and run it completely offline so that no data can be sent to a malicious server or something like that. 
Or you could use your own bitcoin program to generate addresses. Just generate an address and then export its private key.

Sometimes we don't notice it, but I'm certain that for every bitcoin scammer there is out there, there's at least 100 honest people who decide to do the right thing. And this gives me hope. 
Now I only wish more charities started accepting Bitcoin. It would be awesome to live in a world where charities could hand out flyers with printed QR codes and every person could share a donation in a matter of seconds. 
I don't know exactly why, but I'm feeling really happy and excited right now. 
Finally, as for Taxes, I'm not sure because I live in Europe, but one would think that you're not bound to pay anything as long as you keep the money in BTC form. This means that you'll only have to declare the bitcoins you are keeping after you turn them into US dollars and know their final value.

The comments below me have given a pretty good explanation. In the end the strength of the password depends on the amount of possible combinations the attacker has to try before stumbling upon the correct one. 
If the attacker has a computer that can try 10 combinations per second and we use a number from 0 to 100 as our password, it'll take the attacker just 10 seconds to try out all combinations and find our password. 
The amount of combinations is the key!
Electrum uses a random 128 bit number, which is actually such a big number that it would take millions of years before someone could try out all possible combinations with today's computing power. 
Afterwards we use a dictionary to translate those numbers into words. This doesn't make our password any less secure because it would still require the same amount of word combinations to be solved. 
I think you'll enjoy this thread I wrote earlier:

I might be wrong, but at this point I'm quite confident that the transaction wasn't actually broadcast. This means that the coins were only sent for your client, but the network has never seen them. 
Since the transaction does not exist for the network and has never been included in the blockchain it also means that technically you still own those coins.

A manual transaction looks like this. You email your client and tell him the following: 


Just like you use an email client to send emails, you use a bitcoin client to send bitcoins to people's addresses. It's that simple. 
It's now easy to see how automating it can be a bit tricky, as there must be some shopping cart integration and api response in order to detect payment, etc. etc.
You can do it yourself with some PHP / website / plugins magic or you can use external services such as Bitpay or Walletbit which are dead simple but charge a 1% fee.

Honestly, I work in the PR and reputation industry and should consider changing your design or even opening a shopify website with a better template. 
First things first: 
- Create at least an about us website with photographs of your physical shop, your address (which you already have) your full name and a photograph of yourself in the syle of "Our staff". 
- Create a twitter profile and try to update it, creating a community and showing interest for people's concerns. 
- If possible and if you know reddit / bitcoin users in lakewood, invite the to come over so we've got a neutral third party verifying the existence of your shop. 
There's many more things you can do to improve your reputation which is vital in the Bitcoin environment.

This only works if you're a miner and if your mining power (hashrate) is so big that it equals a 10% of the whole network, or 20%, 30%... (follow the table). 
If I'm not mistaken, the double spend will be detected as soon as miner different than yourself solves a block and the transaction eventually falls apart. Basically, If you have high enough mining power it is technically possible for a double spent transaction to get one, two or more confirmations before it falls apart and gets rejected.
Please not that having such a high mining power is very difficult, costly and attempting this has often a very low chance of succeeding. This is also the reason why 6 confirmations is considered the "safe" number of confirmations.

Each bitcoin address has a private key. It's like the master key to the address' funds. Knowing this key allows you full access to your coins from any Bitcoin program. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:20:05
Unfortunately dispute resolution requires someone to have higher power in order to be able to make a decision and reverse a payment. It's not objective and certainly not compatible with a decentralized system. 
What could happen however, is that those who require reversible payments make use of an escrow system, which would be just a layer on top of the bitcoin system.

I was referring to the standard transaction fee which is generally the one that will allow a transaction to be processed in a fast manner. 
With almost a 6-fold Bitcoin price increase it is also reasonable that the standard fee is lowered, especially considering that the blocks are not nearly full. 
Bitcoin users must be vocal about this issue and demand software developers and mining pools to lower that fee. One method to do this is to apply pressure and start sending out transactions with the new desired fees.

When you pair the wallet with other devices the devices get the password to decrypt the wallet file which it gets from the server. 
You should always do a backup of your blockchain.info wallet in case the server fall down or are unaccessible. Other than that the site is secure because the wallet is heavily encrypted and the funds can't be stolen unless someone steals your password. 
By the way, if you keep doing videocasts, never enter the configuration or advanced tabs of blockchaing while filming because those can contain sensitive data. For example, inside the advanced tab you can list your private keys. And the QR code that is used to pair two devices contains your password so that the device can decrypt the wallet.

Yes and no. 
Coinbase works, obviously. But be aware that it might be much easier to just simply display a QR code of your bitcoin address without having to use coinbase. 
Also, change the default amount from 1.0 BTC to something much lower to encourage actual donations.

If you're a new user I would definitely recommed Electrum. Not only does it offer encryption, but also a 12 word security phrase with which you can recover your whole wallet anywhere, anytime. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:39:11
Yes, that seems secure and easy to understand!
Maybe you don't need such a hard to remember password though: 
A list of 5 random words is about as strong as a 10 character password, but much easier to remember. 
Electrum wallet uses a 128 bit key (really secure) in form of 12 random words. 
So, while both are equally easy to bruteforce or to keylog, one is much easier to remember and use on a daily basis.

As far as I know, apple restricts open source applications which is not the case of the blockchain app.

Bitcoin security is all about "not losing or disclosing" your private key, because that is the only way you can lose or get your bitcoins stolen. 
There's many ways to do this: some people keep their key on an offline computer and others decide to print it out. But whatever way, you'll need a computer and a bitcoin application to send the money. 
You mentioned having an offline computer, which is probably the best way of saving your bitcoins and being able to send them at the same time. Here's what I would do: (requires an Android device). 
0. Make sure you backup your private key. Consider writing it down on a piece of paper so that it won't be affected by any computer crash. But keep that piece of paper very very safe! (and watch out with lowercase and uppercase letters). 
1. Download a copy of the website  or any other website that can generate a QR code. (Save Website As... on your browser).
2. Copy the HTML file on an USB stick and carry it to your offline computer. 
3. Once there, open it and go to the Wallet Details Tab. Copy or write down the private key. This will generate a QR code with the private key. 
4. On your android device, download an application called Mycelium, which is a Bitcoin wallet. 
5. Inside the application, when you click on the menu button you'll get an option called COLD STORAGE. 
This option allows you to read the QR code of the private key and immediately send bitcoins to whatever address you like without storing the private key on the device. The key is wiped from memory inmediately after the transaction takes place. 


a. Keep using Mycellium's cold storage function and do all transactions with this method.
 
The problem here is that I don't know the risks involved. I don't know if it's possible for some type of malware to read the memory in the short period of time the private key is read by Mycellium before being deleted. I don't even know if that's possible. Could anyone tell us how secure that would be?
I know that this feature is actually designed with security in mind and I estimate the risks to be very very low or even none at all, but I am not certain. I will ask the Mycellium developers in the Bitcointalk forums. 
b. Use the COLD STORAGE function just one single time and use it to send all the money to an electrum wallet. 
Why an electrum wallet? Because it is the most convenient for signing offline transactions. 
In case you want to follow this option, here's what you do: 
1. Install electrum on your offline computer. Create a new seed and write the seed down (don't disclose the seed as it is as valuable as your private key and will allow you to recover your wallet at any point in time). 
2. After you've created your wallet and got your seed, use the Mycellium's COLD STORAGE option once, and use it to send all the money to an address generated by Electrum.
**Now you've got all the Bitcoins in Electrum**
Why not just import the private key? Because, and as far as I know, you can't sign offline transactions by importing a single key. You will need the "Master Public key" and this one only uses addresses generated by electrum, not imported ones. 
3. Now go to the "Wallet" menu and click on "Master Public Key". Copy it and take on an USB stick or written down to your online computer. 
4. Install electrum on the online computer and create a new wallet. Select "Restore wallet" from Master Public key.
5. Finally, we can send out transactions. The wallet on your ONLINE computer should now display your balance.
6. Create a transaction in the SEND tab on your ONLINE computer. But it won't let you send the money directly, the send button will say something else (can't remember what). 
7. Anyways, by clicking the send button, you'll be able to create an offline transaction. Save this one on an USB stick and carry it over to the OFFLINE PC which does have your private key. 
8. On electrum on your OFFLINE PC go to Tools &gt; Load transaction and load the unsigned transaction from your USB stick. It should detect that it's an unsigned transaction and sign it. 
9. Afterwards save the signed transaction back on your USB stick and load it to your ONLINE electrum. Select the signed transaction and broadcast it. 
That's it :P
Now I would really like to know if there's any risk involved in using Mycellium's cold storage more than once, because it is certainly the most convenient way.

About point number three: Thank you! It's really encouraging to hear that. 
I will also try to correct my pronounciation on the words you have pointed out. I should warn you though that I became much more excited in videos two and three and there are parts harder to understand. I'll make sure to correct these mistakes in the following editions. 
I'm not after any viewcount so it's no problem for me to reupload these videos after having enough feedback and being able to improve them. It's important that I do this before recording further videos, though, so that I can avoid repeating mistakes.
About the last point. I'll see if I can change the wording to avoid false information. Fortunately I'll also offer a couple of videos on wallet security.

The private key of a Bitcoin Adressed is generated using a random 256 bit number. This may seem insecure but this number is so big that the likelihood of two keys being ever the same is practically equal to zero.
Actually, there are more possible bitcoin private keys than atoms in the observable universe. It is such a big number that even if you created the most efficient computer that can ever be built, it would take trillions and trillions of years just to count up to that number.

If you're going to use Bitcoin on Android I would suggest you to try out the "Mycelium" app. 
1. Mycelium stores the keys on your Android device. They are NOT in the cloud. 
2. Mycelium has a really good backup option which you should use. (Print out the PDF and write down the letters. You'll know what I mean when you do it). 
3. Mycelium connects to a server to read the blockchain, thus the balance of your bitcoin address. A so called "Thin" or "Light" wallet.
4. Completely open source and transparent.

Some extra advice. Be careful and inform yourself about each client you use, because some handle bitcoin addresses in a different manner and it's possible that they end up out of sync. 
In order to avoid this, you'll want to make sure that your client does NOT use change addresses. This means that you'll reuse your Bitcoin addresses instead of using and discarding, like some clients do. 
**EDIT:** It seems you can use change addresses in Electrum, as they are created deterministically and will be the same on all clients (provided you use the same seed (12 words)).

When two miners solve a valid block at the same time one will end up orphaned. 
First of all miner A and B solve their blocks at roughly the same time and are both equally valid.
As you should know by now, each subsequent block is based on the previous one. What happens now is that miners start solving a new block either based on valid block A or valid block B. 
If the next block found is based on block B, for example, then A gets orphaned (abandoned) and the chain continues growing using block B. 
This has no negative impact on the use of Bitcoin. It is just a way to make sure that there is only ONE single blockchain. And as a general rule if the blockchain splits then the longest branch is accepted and the shortest one is rejected.

Finally, everybody is hoping that the price stabilizes. It is indeed no good when there is massive amounts of deflation. What we're aiming for is price stability and if any deflation, then a slow one. 
Unfortunately Bitcoin's popularity depends on media cicles. Suddenly the media goes crazy with the bitcoin "boom" and everybody wants to hop in at the same time causing the price to grow rapidly in a short amount of time. Once the userbase is established and its growth stabilizes, the price will stabilize as well. 
I've been where you've been six months ago. I submitted this post: 
My opinion on Bitcoin has changed very much since then and I have become an established supporter. That is because I have tried it and it just works.

I recommend you do not rely on computer backups but instead keep your Bitcoins on something physical: Paper, metal or something that can't corrupt with the age like a Hard Drive or an USB stick. 
If you want to use a brainwallet use the following method to generate a secure password: 
Choose at least 12 words.
And last but not least, if you decide to use a brainwallet, I'd recommend writing down the words so that even if you forget them you'll be able to access your bitcoins. 
**Last note:** Remember that capitalization and punctuation in a Brainwallet is very important. Do NOT add punctuation or capital letters. Do not try to make it more complex, because 12 words is already VERY secure and it isn't worth the risk of forgetting what punctuation and capital letters you used.

In theory, yes: the more, the better. 
In practice, the electricity consumtion of the little guy will cause him to lose money... and the overheating of the hardware might shorten his computer's lifespan. 
Maybe, some day, there'll be a screen saver called mining that runs a very very slow mining algorithm but that has enough power, given the number of people that run it, to contribute to the bitcoin network. 
**EDIT:** Actually... now that I think about it, that wouldn't be a bad idea. I don't mind mining just to contribute to the network as long as my hardware doesn't suffer and I don't lose more money than I already do by running my computer. And the profits from mining could even be given to charities. 
Even if the average rate per user is just 1 Megahash, right now only 1000 people would be needed to actually make some money which would help the bitcoin community, it could accept 0 fee transactions and would benefit charity.

Bitcoins don't exist. There's this huge book (called the blockchain) that is distributed over the whole network. 
The book is made tamper proof thanks to cryptography and it is distributed over the whole network so that no one can delete it or take it down. 
Now this book says how much money each address has.
 
For example: 1BlackenedGem has 2.5 BTC.
Now when you want to send 0.5 Bitcoins to your friend 1WhitenedGem you simply create a transaction by making a declaration. 
"I, 1BlackenedGem give 0.5 Bitcoins to 1WhitenedGem"
This transaction is made tamperproof thanks to cryptography in something called "digital signature". It basically proves you and no other have authorized the transaction. 
This declaration, or transaction, is sent across the whoooole network until a miner picks it up and collects it. The objective of that "miner" is to add your declaration to the book. 
Once he solves a difficult mathematical puzzle, he is authorized by the network to add your transaction to the book. The book now reads: 
1BlackenedGem: 2.0 BTC
1WhitenedGem: 0.5 BTC
The transaction now gets one confirmation.
For doing this, the miner gets a reward of 25 BTC. The mathematical puzzle exists so that transactions are added n an ordered manner. No chaos. 
That means that miners have to compete with each other and the one who has most computer ressources and some luck gets to add pages to the book. 
Each page collects transactions that people have made, and each additional page adds an additional confirmation. 
If you want to learn more, try to look up "Digital signatures". 
Wallet security: For digital signatures to work there is something called a Key. This secret key is unique to you and allows you to digitally sign the transactions.
If it falls in wrong hands then they can sign something in your name. 
To secure your wallet you must make sure that your computer is not infected and no spyware or trojans can steal your key. 
Encryption does help because it requires a password to access the key, but if you have spyware they might as well spy your password. 
2 Factor auth adds a layer of security, meaning that not only do you need your password but also a random code your mobile phone generates. The attacker will need your mobile phone to read the code. 
There are many ways to keep your wallet secure. A simple one is to write down the keys on a piece of paper. No virus can access a physical piece of paper. 
If you do that, then you have created what we call a "paper wallet". 
A good starting point: 
- Don't use an online wallet. Use a downlodable program such as electrum, multibit or bitcoin-qt. 
- Use encryption. 
- Always keep your computer virus free (most important part). 
- For long term storage use a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-02-03 10:40:53
To isworthanupdate: 
Think of your Bitcoin address as your email address. You can send and receive bitcoins just like you can send and receive emails. 
In order to send emails you obviously need to have access to your address with your password. The same applies to Bitcoin. 
You need the private key in order to spend the funds of a public address. Nothing else is needed as the balance amount is held by the bitcoin network. 
Just create a new keypair, print it out and make sure you keep the private key in a safe place and send bitcoins to the public address.
The advantage of a paper wallet is it's security. Because it is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone in the world to steal your bitcoins or even freeze them without going physically into your house and finding the key you printed.

Not exactly. See, the best type of password is always a random password because it contains a much higher amount of entropy. 
A 128 bit password, for example is considered extremely secure but in essence it is nothing more than 128 0's and 1's. 
This same password if translated to hexadecimal would only take up 32 characters. But now instead of 0's and 1's we've got a range from 0 to F. 
Now the password only takes up a quarter of what it did before but still contains as much entropy. 
The same occurs with this method. We are essentially translating random numbers to words that can be easily memorized. This gives us the strength of a full random password yet the memorability of an everyday sentence (or as close as it gets). 
**Nothing carries more entropy than pure randomness**. While your padding method is very vaild it is not truly random and thus much more vulnerable to an attack if the the attacker knows, assumes or guesses that you use some sort of padding.

It's only a default setting for Bitcoin-qt that can be changed at any point, meaning that miners and users still fully decide whether they accept dust or they don't. 
Also it is a value that can be changed at any time.

I feel that a better model is comparing it to a Ledger. 
The blockchain is a Ledger Book and each block is a page of this Ledger. 
People in the Bitcoin network try to publish new pages of this unforgeable and uneditable ledger which cointain transaction. And by adding these new pages to the book, they verify a transaction. 
For doing that they get 25 BTC reward. But since it would be a chaos if everyone could add a new page every time, what people have to do is to solve a mathematical puzzle with their computers. Only the person who solves the puzzle first gets to add the new page so that this process is done in an orderly fashion.

Basically to prevent problems caused by deflation. 
Imagine one day Bitcoins are worth so much that each one is equivalent to 100.000 USD. As you can see we would still be able to trade in pennies and fractions of a penny thanks to Bitcoin's divisibility. 
Obviously as the Bitcoin price rises, the "spamming limit" also raises. 
And remember that you can still send small amounts if you include a 0.0005 fee.

* Bob creates a transaction by declaring: "I give Alice 10 BTC".
* Steve makes sure the declaration is valid and records it in a public ledger that is distributed over the whole network. 
* Alice check this ledger to get her balance.
* Bob can't cheat the system because everyone in the network can consult and check this ledger and would immediately refuse a transaction with double spent funds or funds he hasn't got in the first place.

Your best option is either  (cheap SEPA bank wire) or  where you buy them from another individual.
**BUT BE AWARE:** Bitcoin is currently very volatile. There is no gurantee that it might be worth $0 next week... or maybe $1000. No one knows. 
Only invest what you can afford to lose! Maybe start with a small amount as an experiment.

In that case you'll want to keep them off a computer and off the internet. 
Create a paper wallet. This means:

Awesome! I'll eventually buy a hex dice too. I've always fascinating and charming to generate fully working bitcoin adresses with an analog method. 
By the way, technically you could use some standalone (non-bitcoin related) ECDSA script together with some other elements to generate the public key and not depend on other programs. Unfortunately I don't know much about scripting in Bash, but it should be relatively simple.

1- It's not that easy for the buyer to win a dispute. 
2- Document each shipping you do so that you can show proof of shipment. That should settle it.
3- Establish a reputation with each sale. Always try to use the same escrow.
You just need to convince the escrow holder that you have shipped the item. Usually this is something relatively easy to do and it's not worth the hassle for scamer-buyers.

This website is designed for bitcoin donations, but you can use it as a paper wallet. 
1- Generate an address.
2- Print and keep the private key in a safe place. Don't lose it or show it to anybody.

Yes, exactly! Makes Bitcoin seem quite cheaper, doesn't it?
There's nothing stopping us from arbitrarily creating a MBTC (megabitcoin) which is worth 1000 bitcoins and then say: "Omg, 1 Million $ per MBTC! That's so expensive! Should I buy now or is it too late?". 
The name and the unit are both arbitrary. We use BTC as base unit because we started with that unit, but we could use any other unit or name if we wished. 
What you should watch out for, though, is market stability. Right now there's a lot of hype and it could end up falling a bit when then hype stops... but this doesn't have anything to with the value of bitcoin, whether it is $1, $100 or $10000. No one know what will really hapen...

Eventually Bitcoin will stabilize... either at a very low value or a very high one. Either way, it's still too early to tell and that day is probably not near. 
It can happen though that we meet periods of extended stability, in which the price keeps stable for a few months. Either way, definite stability is, I think, years away. 
**What you should do is, the following:**
Make a difference between Bitcoins you buy as a store of value / investment and Bitcoins you buy to spend. 
Generally, a good rule is to invest only what you can afford to lose. If you can afford to lose $200 each month and think that Bitcoin is a good investment, then buy $200 worth of bitcoin each month and keep them in cold storage. This will be your savings account.
Now, let's say you want to buy a new computer for $500 and think that Bitcoin is the way to go. Maybe because you're dealing with international shipping or just because you like Bitcoin. You then buy extra $500 worth of Bitcoin and spend them immediately or almost immediately on the computer. 
You must not keep those extra $500 Bitcoins for a long time, because Bitcoin is volatile and there's a risk. Since you've already maxed your monthly safe limit, keeping the coins would be unsafe. You cannot afford to lose $500 dollars so you spend them.

1- Create and account. 
2- Deposit some euros via SEPA bank wire. 
3- Turn them into bitcoins at the current market price and a 0.5% fee. This fee is little to nothing, specially if you keep in mind that the market exchange rate on bitstamp is quite lower than on MT.Gox. (Cheaper bitcoins!!!)
4- Send bitcoins to your address.

@_date: 2013-05-23 07:45:58
PROTIP: 
A private key is just a random number of 64 Hexadecimal digits.
If you want to give your friend a private key, for whatever reason, just make up your own random number. 
Choose 64 digits from 0 to F. Like this: 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
With these digits you create a random string that is 64 characters long and voilà, this is your private key. You can import it to any Bitcoin application. 
Be aware that humans are very bad at randomness and it is recommended that you use some random generator... if you don't trust software you can use dice :D
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:00:16
The dollar isn't that stable either. It just seems much more stable because it's got a lower value. 
For example, from april 25 to april 30 it jumped from $1.30 per Euro to $1.32 per Euro. 
If we think of the US Dollar as Bitcent this would be the same as going from $130 per Bitcoin to $132 per Bitcoin in 5 days. 
Yes, this is magnitudes more stable than Bitcoin is today but as it gets older and more mature I can it definitely see it fluctuating in ranges of two to three dollars.

Hello, 
I understand that most of you are not affected by this problem, but I wanted to shed light to the economical situation that many people in the world are suffering from. 
My boyfriend who is from Argentina is one of the millions of individuals affected by unfair laws and a broken banking system and I'm confident that the same problems are very common in other countries... *problems Bitcoin could be the solution to*. 
The Argentine Peso is quite a weak currency and has been suffering from harsh inflation. Until recently it was very common for those living in Argentina to buy US dollars in order to protect their money and everything they've been saving for years. Unfortunately, a few months ago the Argentine government forbade the purchase of US dollars in a weak attempt to strengthen the local currency. 
An arbitrary law has forced millions of citizens and honest shop owners to put their hard-earned savings at risk. Now, this wouldn't be all too bad if we had not such recent memory of ["the corralito"]( 
**The corralito**
In 1992 the argentine government introduced the so called convertibilidad which fixed the exchange rate 1:1 between the Peso and the US dollar. The results were disastrous as this would have a negative effect on exports and the local industry. 
In 2001, the situation had escalated and was unsustainable. The Argentine government then decided to freeze ALL bank accounts. All bank accounts in the whole country were frozen and people had to watch helplessly how their savings withered away and inflation rose incredibly. This left many poor, at the edge of misery and the effects can still be seen today. 
This is not the only problem Argentine citizens face today. A recent law imposed a 15% tax on all credit card purchases that are made outside the country... this also includes online purchases. 
Currently it is extremely expensive for a citizen to buy something online and import it to Argentina. Not only do they have to pay 50% tax on all imports, but also this extra 15% if they pay with credit card or paypal. 
I have myself first hand experience with the broken banking system of Argentina when I tried last year to send my boyfriend some money. It was almost impossible to send him euros over a bank wire as he was forced to justify everything, fullfil certain requirements, it would take time and there was still the risk that the money would be frozen and never arrive to him.
While Bitcoin might not be able to eliminate the 50% tax on imported products, it does solve everything else. 
**Bitcoin will help citizens in countries such as Argentina.** Their savings in Bitcoins will be protected from rampant inflation and no central authority, bank or government will have the power to freeze those funds. 
People will be able to send each other money no matter the distance or the country of origin and they certainly won't have to pay an arbitrary fee just for buying something from outside their country. 
I am sure that there are many other countries and millions of people that can benefit from Bitcoin by putting them in control of their hard-earned money. 
**PS.** If this comment wins, I will give the 5 BTC to my lovely boyfriend :)

Coinbase is trusted company and possibly an easy option to buy Bitcoin in the US. 
If you need any help just post a follow up on or send me a private message. Again, the only thing you need to worry about is that no copy of the key is left on the computer and that there is no virus / spyware software on your PC that could snatch it. 
Also, obviously don't print it out at a copyshop or use public printers / copiers. 
Finally, if you were to write it down with a pen instead of printing it, remember that it's case sensitive and in all cases use ink that will last the years. 
**Edit:** I think I should mention that in order to spend the money your niece will have to do the following: 
1. Install a Bitcoin application on her phone or computer (I recommend Electrum for PC and Mycellium for Android). 
2. Tell the program to import the private key and it will be added to her digital wallet.
That's it. Now you know how Bitcoin works. 
By the way, the best way to securely store Bitcoins for long periods of time is actually this method: just printing / writing down the key. That way it doesn't matter if your computer crashes and they can't be stolen by any malicious computer software. That's also why we call it a "Paper Wallet". 
Here's another software that can be used to create paper wallets:

Bitcoin addresses contain an automatic integrity check in order to avoid such problems or mistyped addresses. 
Usually when you type an invalid address a Bitcoin application notifies you immediately. It does depend on the application you use... in case of Mtgox the funds might return automatically or you need to contact support. 
In any case, I'm pretty sure that your funds are not lost but Mtgox has them. 
Although I must say that it is reckless for them not to do the integrity check before actually withdrawing from the user's account.

Escrow could require two keys to release: the website's and the money's owner's. 
That way even if the website gets hacked, the thief cannot withdraw the funds. The website however can make the keys public so that every owner can sign a valid transaction to recover their money. 
Finally, for the website to make money, it would only sign withdrawal requests in which the transaction includes a % fee.

The main idea of a paper wallet is that the private key exists no where else... only on the paper, not even the computer. 
So, in order to create a secure paper wallet (not just a paper backup) you must make sure you use a key and public address that you can delete once it has been printed out. 
Maybe use a different address generator for that purpose.

I'm a PR professional and we're probably going to disagree in this, but if a double spend goes through, Bitcoin's credibility can seriously be damaged (it doesn't matter if it's later corrected). 
Current headlines are not particularly enthusiastic and there's still a huge amount of skepticism surrounding Bitcoin.
I have no doubt that the Bitcoin community will react if something malicious happens, but there are certain actions that cannot be reversed and losses that are permanent. For example, during the fork that occured a couple of weeks ago an accidental double-spend of $10,000 against OKpay went through (for a limited amount of time, though). Had the owner of those coins not been honest and reported the error it could have caused serious damage. 
The point is, that the fact that a single party holds over 50% of the hashing power could deal a serious blow to our credibility, reputation and our image towards the public opinion, journalists and investors. Not to mention what would happen if a malicious action would actually occur.

**It's easy, you just need at least two dice.**
Now roll them and translate the results to a number following this table: 
The process is much faster if you have more than 2 dice, roll them at the same time and group them into pairs after rolling. 
Anyways, you should end up with 64 dice rolled hexadecimal numbers. This, is a perfectly valid, completely random bitcoin private key. The hexadecimal format is understood by most Bitcoin wallets as well. 
Now, you can use a local copy of bitaddress and go to the "Wallet Details" section or use a bitcoin client on an offline computer, preferably a Live CD. 
Input the private key and you'll be given the public address. Print it or write it down (don't forget to backup the key) and then you can safely send all your money to the address you got. 
**Short version:**
1. Roll 64 numbers. 
2. Input the key on a safe offline computer (live CD) to get the public key. 
While it might take some time, especially the rolling part, for a long term paper wallet super secure fund storage I've found this method to be very effective.

Have you considered the effects of competition?
Even if their R&amp;D cost is going to be lower in a future point, this would set them behind other companies who are competing against them. 
Also, in a successful business the value of the sales made on Px will always be greater than the value invested in making that product. 
As long as the deflation rate is low enough for Apple to invest now and make more money later, they are going to do it. The only requisite is this: Holding must not be the best available investment.

This is what I like most about Bitcoin: Addresses are just made of a public part and a private key. 
You can see this easily at 
As long as you have the private key, you have access to your bitcoins. Write it down, carve it in stone or copy it on an USB pendrive. Your only task is to keep that private key safe and your bitcoins will be 100% safe. 
You can still receive bitcoins to an offline address. Just import the key to a Bitcoin wallet program and all the Bitcoins that were ever sent to that address will be there.

Make sure you backup your wallet.dat file as the private keys for the next 100 transactions are saved in there.

Thank you! :)

Well, this "standard fee" is a bit subjective. I'm already sending out all my transactions with a 0.0001 fee on Electrum. 
Only if the input is too large, then I must pay more. 
Right now it seems that there is a bug in blockchain not allowing you to change the rate to anything lower than 0.0005 despite sending a transaction with a single input. 
It's either 0.0005 or nothing. We should contact blockchain.

1. The seed is used to recreate the WHOLE wallet. If everything goes wrong, you will always be able to regrow your whole wallet with the full balance using the seed. 
2. The passphrase / password is used to encrypt the wallet file so that no authorized person can steal the private keys from your computer (be careful with keyloggers, though). 
3. Once the wallet is encrypted you will not be able to send a transaction or view the seed without the password. You can only see the balance. 
4. You only need to backup your wallet file once, not every time you receive new bitcoins. As a matter of fact you don't need a backup as long as you've got the seed. 
Write down the seed and keep it somewhere safe in your house. That's all you will ever need to recover your wallet.

Just make sure that it's a legit escrow and not a friend of the seller. 
Even so, you could still pull a chargeback in case they tried to scam you. So yeah, the risk is all on their side.

They closed bitcoin. Haven't you read the news?

Bitcoin IS money. So, as long as you've got bitcoins you've got money. 
There is no need to turn it into dollars unless you want more stability or need to buy something you can't buy with BTC.

True! But they need to to pull at least once it order to be included in the pool. Although then people would wager low amounts... such as one satoshi only to have their address included.

Your corporate communication and crisis management leaves much to be desired. I really urge you to hire a PR and communication professional in order to address this issue and be able to maintain a healthy reputation.
And now a shameless plug: You could hire me, as this what I'm specialized in.

Also: It costs nothing to accept bitcoin. Given that it offers some business opportunities, it's definitely on the Plus side of the investment - benefits scale. 
Also, if you use coinbase (or other providers) you can get all orders converted to USD inmediately, making this a riskless opportunity as well.
Don't expect many many bitcoin sales yet, but I would definitely look towards it if I had a business.

Just hold and carry on.
