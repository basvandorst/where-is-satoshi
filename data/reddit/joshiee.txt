Didn't read the article, but it's faster because it's received and in your control before the wire gets to the destination. Sure you need to convert it to fiat but payment is considered received.

Keep a copy of the private key so you aren't throwing your btc away if they don't use it after a few months or something. By then, it's probably in the trash.

While testing is a good idea, trying to move 0.00000001 to test would still have resulted in the remainder sent to a change address. If OP had 'tested' it, would have lost almost all of the btc, rather than all but 12.

For one that would've caused a true fork of two different blockchains being built upon. 
Another reason, mentioned in  The majority of clients are probably not on 0.8, so the 0.8 behavior, although technically correct, is to be considered incorrect behavior since it is the minority behavior.

I assume the way it works is that you rely on the server to get transactions. Server can't re-write your transactions that you send. Server doesn't have your private keys. The trust in the server is negligible.

Fyi, you take the exchange rate uncertainty out of the equation entirely with BitPay. The amount customers pay can be set as the USD equivalent. So with every purchase, you always get $50 deposited. 
Of course you can keep the BTC too, but your concern was cash flow. 
Keep in mind, no chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-02-13 15:15:54
Double check the account number. If that's truly the ACH rejection they got, Chase basically said there's no such account. I'm not entirely sure how this would have happened, considering coinbase supposedly checks that you own the account when you did instant verification (assuming you did instant verification).
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:39:59
No, OP means ACH. From the sounds of it, it isn't as great as SEPA. Its the US's non-wire, free, ~2-day delay transfer system.

@_date: 2013-03-07 18:04:47
Coinbase sent out a tx with an unconfirmed input because that input had an input from one of the btc fountains which underpaid the fee. No one bothered to mine it, so all the subsequent txs were unconfirmed. This is where the bounty came in.

No, blockchain.info processed it correctly.
@_date: 2013-03-18 04:00:22
Ok, the picture painted by the documents is quite clear that the transaction dropped off Coinbase's systems. You sent the transaction to the address that reflects all of your transactions in your exports EXCEPT the 9.63 one. How have you tried to raise this with coinbase? I'd imagine what you need to say is "Here's my Coinbase address. I never got credit for this transaction" or something of the sort.
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:19:34

@_date: 2013-02-01 23:10:54
Transactions reference the output of a preceding transaction, and must use it all so that each output is referenced only once in a subsequent transaction. So say your transaction is transaction N, and you're sending Dice 0.1btc:
[transaction N-1]Someone sends you 0.85btc 
[transaction N] You send Dice 0.1btc, referencing that your coins are coming from Transaction N-1. Of the .85btc from Trans N-1, .75 are coming back to you. The change is part of the transaction. So Transaction N looks like this: 0.1 to Dice, 0.75 to same address, because it referenced N-1 and must disposition all .85btc.
So until Trans N is confirmed, the 0.75btc is unusable.

Just a few quick tips/things to consider:
- CPU mining is absolutely useless
- Unless your laptop has a GPU which ranks decently on this list, you probably aren't competing very well:  
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:30:31
I don't follow your logic at all. To me, to be in the 1% you rank people by how much btc you hold, and if you are in the 1% of that list, you're in the 1%. It'll take far more than 7 btc for that.
Unless you're comparing to the US 1%... and 7 btc isn't even worth comparing to their wealth.
@_date: 2013-03-17 20:22:07
Like 7 gigabytes I think.
@_date: 2013-01-31 16:15:40
Don't bother with Bitinstant. Their ~4% fee is stupid. 
Bitme. Deposit your cash at Chase, email a photo of the receipt, buy bitcoins. After I made my deposit and e-mailed my receipt, I had my btc in minutes. The fee is much smaller. 
If you have days to waste, use Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:29:01
It had unconfirmed inputs which didn't pay a fee.

@_date: 2013-02-25 18:52:48
Do you have a Chase branch near you? Bitme.com sounds good for you. Deposit some cash, email them the receipt, then place an order on their website. Then all of a sudden you have a coin. Time from e-mailing your receipt to your coins could be minutes, it was for me.
 Coinbase is good if you want to wait half a week, but you don't have to visit the bank.
@_date: 2013-03-18 16:19:33
The 0.8.1 rules to protect .7 and below clients will expire on May 15. After which, miners will be allowed to create huge blocks again like the ones that caused the fork. So, yes running .7 will have an ill effect.
@_date: 2013-02-14 04:23:03
I think they do more than that. They seem to check inputs on each transaction, and based on certain criteria process the roll then or after the inputs get some confirmations.
@_date: 2013-03-17 04:29:20
Need more detail as to what you think is wrong. Everything looks fine. Looks like you spent 0.0134 and the rest went to a change address in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:22:44
Did you attach a proper fee? The slow confirmation is most likely due to that than to have anything to do with your client once it has been relayed to network.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:37:03
No, the people holding thousands of coins will be the 1%. If you have around 7, along with all the hypothetical US 1% who buy 6.7 coins each, will all be the BTC 99%.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:18:25
If 10 people throw a bunch of change into a pot, and coins leave out of that pot to other recipients in varying amounts not necessarily whole to what people put in, how is the search engine supposed to map inputs to outputs? That's sort of what's happening. It seems effective enough to me. 
Edit: to your point that the whole thing is trackable through the blockchain, the person who receives the coins I put in probably have nothing to do with me anyway.

as a newb completely obsessed for a week, this was my choice to buy my btc. although, if you want to go even more anonymous, with a little less convenience but more speed, check out bitme (walk into a chase branch and deposit cash, send them receipt).
coinbase was a joy to transact with though.
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:34:24
Geez that's a pretty massive fuckup. Can't believe they decided it would be a good idea to leave an incomplete list of transactions on one page.
Edit: In your screenshot there's a cancel button. Have you tried that?
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:13:07
Can you describe what exactly you are doing to load bitcoin-qt with a specific wallet.dat?
Also, each wallet is a collection of addresses, not any particular one. You don't have one address per wallet. But I understand you need help figuring out how to import your wallet.
One last thing, bits are the 0s and 1s in a binary string. You can use btc for short for bitcoins.

The point isn't so much the unconfirmed part, but the map plot with transactions happening globally.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:06:22
You suggested something sort of different. You suggested another client. Well, that other client also sees the pending transaction and won't let you use those inputs because it doesn't want to invalidate that transaction. That doesn't mean you can't double spend, you just have to use a different method. For example, craft a raw transaction and send it to the network.
@_date: 2013-02-04 06:42:02
Credit reports don't show wealth. They only show what you've borrowed (from a bank or the government(such as student loans)) or have been delinquent on. Being said, no is the answer to your question.

actually, the extension is more secure. On the linked page, it provides for thought a scenario where blockchain.info is hacked, and instead of serving up the actual javascript wallet, it serves up code that passes your password back so they can have it. with the extension, it wouldn't matter because the javascript is already loaded into the extension.

Two thoughts:
1) You can use bitcoind with its JSON-RPC api. Don't have to trust anyone else and can probably have control over those fees.
2) Save up a day's worth of payments (or whatever other interval) and pay them all at once. You can attach one fee to all the transactions instead of paying one for each.

Whether it is allowed or not, eBay is the last place I would want to use my bitcoin. Too many times have I had to open PayPal claims to get my money back because of shady sellers. I've once ordered an item from a user with consistently high ratings only to discover my item was a counterfeit.
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:19:34
In a normal transaction they would give you the coins after a predetermined amount of time from when they submitted the transaction. 
The way I assume ACH to work is that there are no confirmations for a settled transaction, much like how checks work. Instead, they wait to hear for a rejection if the transaction does not go through. Same rationale for check holds.
In your case, it could be that the time to wait for a rejected transaction had expired, so they gave you the coins...then received the rejection later. Hypothetically, you could have made off with the coins before they took them back.
@_date: 2013-02-02 21:06:46
You said no brain wallets, but I'm just going to throw a plug for Electrum anyway. It's my favorite wallet so far. Armory was too bulky for me.

Just wanted to clarify: larger transactions meaning size in bytes (for example, due to number of inputs/outputs), not amount of btc transacted. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:04:26
Each client can figure out the state of the bitcoins that an address has control of, by looking through the blockchain available from the network. Think of  The wallet is simply the keys to those addresses, allowing the client with the private keys to relay transactions to the network to spend the bitcoins. So multiple clients can have the keys to an address at one time, authorizing transactions from the same wallet in different places. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 05:25:53
That sounds like an ACH rejection. It might've been your bank's fault, or coinbase's fault for processing an ACH response wrong. Shrug
@_date: 2013-03-17 19:23:27
As others have said, no you shouldn't have received it back to your original address. Furthermore, sites like coinbase use one giant wallet and the money that you transferred in could be sent out as inputs for someone else's transaction. Completely normal. Think of your btc as being put into the vault, and your coins are the ones taken out to pay someone else, but your account with coinbase should reflect your deposit.
Can you post a screenshot of your Coinbase transaction history? Or at least describe what you instructed coinbase to do with the 9.63? Looking at that address tells us NOTHING if its a coinbase controlled address, as it's just another in their wallet.dat--even though all coins that are sent to it are credited to you. The coins leaving it don't necessarily deduct from your balance.
Edit: So the TX that you linked isn't money leaving the coinbase address? it's you paying into it? And your coinbase reflects 0 deposits? Well then yeah, that's on Coinbase.

That 1JheD8QrvCDa2jFnTysmkPWaUAQdDyqamf is your Coinbase address (verify this for me) and that the transaction was never recognized in your coinbase account. That transaction clearly shows 9.63 being sent to your Coinbase address and you received 0.013 as change. The OPPOSITE of what he's suggesting. When you presented it to us it wasn't clear that the 1JheD... address was your coinbase address. If that is the fact, the transaction itself, along with the exports is your smoking gun and  are the best pieces of evidence you have.
