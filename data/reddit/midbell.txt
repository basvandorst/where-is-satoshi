Nice! You'll soon have 5 BTC :) 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:37:20
Yes, I made this account 3 months ago to troll at this very moment 3 months later
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:23:42
Price will be $34,600 in 2020 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:57:49
Go look at the numbers instead of listening to what you were told
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:01:37
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I'd explain but id get banned 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:46:56
I would go in
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:38:58
Lol this is so sad
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:02:12
You didn’t even use the gif right. You just wanted to talk about BCH. This subreddit can use a bit less talk about it, it’s indirectly pushing people towards it along with lower fees and faster transactions. Less attention the better 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:07:33
And all the issues it fixes that BTC and 2x can't? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:48:16
lol OP please don’t attempt comedy unless your goal is to be cringey 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:17:18
Wow I'm surprised this post hasn't been removed and you haven't been banned. Let's see how long it'll last 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:16:28
The TWIOTA update will have unlimited sizes

I mean I took out a student loan (1.5K) and I'm up 20%. Low risk imo 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:56:40
Did the joke go over your head or am I missing the joke lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:50:06
Lmao what ethereum is 100x better than bitcoin, go do some research 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:14:42

@_date: 2017-11-19 22:30:43
Lmao I’m in full support of BCH but I’ll admit this meme is pretty good 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:13:56
I don't have much knowledge in the subject, but what you said sounds true 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:36:34
You do realize it was $300 before this ‘pump and dump.’
To more than triple is hardly a pump and dump 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:35:36
This is the ultimate scientific paper lmao. Biology, programming, genetics, evolution, blockchain, calculus, probability, AI, all fused together
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:40:03
Just a little
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:53:04
Lol worse than bitcoin cash. The brainwashing of r/bitcoin is insane.
Wonder how long I have until this comment gets me banned here ��
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:15:55
Ah, I was there during that time. Annoying how all these new people think they've been here for a while 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:44:21
If you can get a ratio value working, all you'd have to do to get a change potential working is monitor if the rate of change for the ratio increases. Like if it suddenly goes from 1:1 to 1.3:1, it'll alert that that coin has a high potential to increase
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:14:37
Very close. Specifically I want many alt coin's order books side by side type of thing represented visually. Thank you though!
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:24:51
Spoken in some detail here
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:19:12
Gonna hit 7k before nov 15th
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:42:55
Same, I've heard of bots but idk how they work
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:09:17
Thanks. So coinbase will have 4 available currencies? The usually 3 + the new bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:08:32
So I see that it says 2x has 83.5% mining support, but what is 'emergent consensus' with 33%? 
Does this mean 83% of the miners are going to support 2x? Will it become the dominant BTC by those numbers? Sorry I'm new to all this stuff
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:39:17
Why did her boobs hard fork from each other

Bitfinex is closing to US customers though 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:52:41
It will never be a global currency. It's merely a stepping stone for block chain tech until better currency or technology takes its place, which is inevitable. I love how all bitcoin fanatics ignore the issue of scaling and actually think bitcoin is gonna be global. The more accepted it is, the deeper it digs its own grave. Scaling issues WILL not be resolved since they are inherent to blockchain. DAG systems are superior to block chain but don't say I didn't inform you 
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:09:59
This is so good 
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:15:07
I wouldn't necessarily say it's bitcoin though.. 
I did, however, find this gem the other day. Now I'm not tryna shill or anything buttt the next in line *could* be bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:46:52
Know of IOTA?
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:12:30
+A Upcomment. Shitvote
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:13:00
I'd like to thank God for this free hat
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:58:27
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:14:55
Loling at bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:37:20
Idk about 1M+.. just seems.. too much? Maybe I'm a pessimist? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:00:21
I was thinking of doing it 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:07:18
Wait, does this mean coinbase is only supporting one chain? Cause if so, what will happen to my BTC? 
I have .33 right now on GDAX, will I get another .33 of B2X on top? Or will my old BTC be removed?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:08:33
&lt;_&gt; you am know. Thank
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:31:00
Try IOTA then ��
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:53:57
Alt coins
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:56:34
I just don't know why only my posts were being upvoted. I thought mine were dumb lmao
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:47:05
Trade your BTC into IOTA and pay no fees and get your stuff transferred faster 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:13:14
A shit. + commentvote up
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:39:55
I'm in Chicago.. sadly I didn't hear about this otherwise I would have come. Looking forward to IOTA meet in Chicago on the 18th (I think) though :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:23:23
I know a coin with 0 fees 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:59:15
Ha-ha, it's great watching everyone fight over trying to be me. Funny thing is people will read this comment and think nothing of it. *sips coffee* 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:51:38
GDAX. It's owned by coinbase but more advanced and less fees
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:47:31
Ah that's a step closer too! And lol don't count on it, my coding skills go as far as "hello world" 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:53:42
Unrelated to the text, but just gotta take a second to appreciate the picture. This stuff isn't sci-fi, it's real and happens in the universe. It's pretty amazing when you think about it; our world is more magical than we think. 
You've got a literal, spherical hole in the fabric that we exist in pulling the space around it infinitely inward, and a giant infernoball that's unable to contain the energy from its own core, both swirling together as they both drift around larger holes in space through this thing we call 'time.'
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:48:51
Damn, I'm definitely interested. Any idea when it'll be usable? Sadly I have no coding experience or I would help
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:36:05
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:21:45
Lol get with the times, old man 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:02:28
Oh nice. I would say a 'change potential' function would be useful. Like if the buy side suddenly gets massive volume, it'll notify you or highlight that coin. Same for if sell volume increases. 
Another thing that would be useful is a ratio value for each coin. Like 1 : 1.04 would mean there's 4% more sellers or so. If this ratio updates consistently, we can be ahead of the game for any potential pumps 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:45:31
Super whoosh
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:34:17
Plz pay attention to us
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:36:47
Eh it didn't have a good name to it back then though. Nowadays more and more people know about bitcoin and it isn't seen as a fake drug currency anymore 
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:36:18
Islamically interest IS forbidden. But I'm guessing in Iran since they're mostly Shi'ite, they don't follow the conventional rules. I hope bitcoin gets to them :/
