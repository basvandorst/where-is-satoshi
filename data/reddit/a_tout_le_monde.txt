If SEC actually views Bitcoin as an investment/security/currency, does this mean that the twins can use this to get their ETF approved?

It's pretty simple really (kind of). There isn't enough demand to support the price. Most people in the community seem to be buying and holding hoping that the price will go up. This doesn't encourage trade and ultimately impacts the bitcoin economy. You have to realize that bitcoins are being generated everyday, which means we need an equal or greater demand for the price to be sustained or increase. Want to do something about it? You need to start promoting trade! Unfortunately I've only recently started to read and educate myself into learning how merchants can adopt bitcoin, but this information needs to be disseminated. 
I made a post the other week trying to get everyone together to start addressing how we can get more people to start using bitcoin to purchase goods. There is an advantage already with bitcoin over paypal and credit cards in terms of fees, however I feel bitcoin right now is too complicated for most people to use with respect to the status quo...especially in terms of actually "buying" bitcoins. I think most people don't want the hassle of signing up to an exchange and buying bitcoins...this needs to simplified and made more convenient. Also, I think the whole process of holding bitcoins also needs to be made more convenient and possibly deployed into an online system - similar to how people currently pay their credit card bills.
It's unfortunate that people aren't more techsavvy, but even more challenging than that, people don't like change from their current routine unless they have a big enough incentive - and right now bitcoin isn't offering that.
I would like to change that.
