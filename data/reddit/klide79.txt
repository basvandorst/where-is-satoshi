 Here's the answer  Coinpayments.net to my request for a refund.  
Dear...  
When visiting your deposits page you are provided with the warning message that you must include the Destination Tag/Payment ID/Memo/Message when depositing to your account. We try our best, but not every recovery attempt can be successful due to technical limitations, and exhausting manpower utilization options. Upon successful recovery, a fee of 8% will be deducted before depositing the recovered coins into your account.  
We view protection of users' privacy as a very important principle, but to proceed with a recovery, you must provide additional information to identify yourself.  
If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way, please disregard this request, and do not reply to this ticket to acknowledge the terms and disagree to a coin recovery attempt.  
Otherwise if you agree, proceed to complete KYC at [ 
 Things to keep in mind:  
Make sure the documents you submit are legible and in high resolution, as any pixelated or low resolution submissions will be rejected.  
The recovery process can take up to 15 days, but can be as short as 48 hours. Please be patient with our developers.  
Our support agents will respond to you when there is an update on the status of your recovery.  
Once you submit the requested documents, please do not add any additional response as it may bump your request out of queue and delay your recovery.
