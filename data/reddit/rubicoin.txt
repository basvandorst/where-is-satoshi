No of course not. Why did you buy the bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:54:03
bitaddress is malicious? Do tell? It's the most widely used paper wallet site out there.
(not that I like paper wallets but that's beside the point)

No you shouldn't be worried. Private keys are standardized across wallets so you can always migrate to another wallet if you have to.

Part of the problem over here is that people think public keys and addresses are one and the same.
if you have the private key you can paste it into the wallet details tab on bitaddress.org. It'll tell you what your compressed public key and address are.

My comment was about bitaddress.org not brainwallet.org. You've got the two confused.

Unless you know how to code you will have to trust someone. There *are* alternatives. For example pybitcointools is a set of python scripts by Ethereum and bitcoinmagazine's vbuterin:
You could use the above or bitaddress. Whatever you like. If you can't trust any of these then don't. Surely not knowing the compressed address of your private key isn't such a big deal. You can live without that knowledge.

Bitcoin is dying. Thin wallets are killing it. I love thin wallets but it's true that they're killing the network. Soon we'll be in the hundreds of nodes and then dozens. Dozens of nodes hosted in a few choice datacenters in first world countries. Bitcoin will have been centralized.

Looks like they are building a hardware node device. Hence the tie up with low power ARM chip maker qualcomm.

~~bitcoin core doesn't support bip32.~~ my bad. I think you mean bitpay's js library.
You are asking us to tell you what you did wrong but you haven't told us what you did!
@_date: 2015-03-13 10:08:45
Yeah how come no one noticed before?
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:52:56
They sell right away. They don't accumulate bitcoin. That would be disastrous.

The best part is when you send using your wallet and instantly there is confirmation of receipt on the bitpay web page. Pretty amazing considering it's all p2p!

Yeah, also don't display a stupid ass login page with your company name whenever anyone visits your IP in their browser.

I hear there are more sheep than people in your country. What do you need bitcoin for? Sheperds won't understand bitcoin. Neither will the sheep!

Well I've suggested that site and I've suggested a python script as an alternative. If you can suggest something else then please do so.
