Just the fact that he compares Bitcoin to Enron says it all. Enron was manipulating its’ accounting figures to make the company look healthy. If memory serves correct they had a bunch of offshore corporations that would absorb the losses of the company, thus not appearing as “Enron” losses.
Bitcoin, isn’t falsifying anything. It is purely based on what people perceive it to be worth and it actually is something. Whether the blockchain technology is worth this much and whether it will be adopted for mainstream use is another matter altogether. Not to mention, people are well aware of all the risks upfront with investing in cryptocurrencies and continue to do so at their own risk. So until people are willing to continue investing at the current prices, money will keep flowing.
But to compare it to a company who deliberately falsified its accounting numbers, is a stretch. Bitcoin could turn out to be a bad investment, but that’s the risk everybody is willing to take.

Ok, I've searched for an answer on here and Bitstamp but with no success.
If I were to invest in Bitcoin now through Bitstamp and move my btc to a nano ledger wallet, how would I be affected by the fork? 
Basically after the fork, if I were to transfer the btc back to Bitstamp would it recognize I purchased before fork and thus give me coins of the new alt? I'm not understanding how I would be given new coins? 
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance
