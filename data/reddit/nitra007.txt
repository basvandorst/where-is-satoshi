The whole financing your purchases culture I hope dies along with central banks and fiat money as that only promotes mindless consumption.

It’s exhausting honestly. I’ve learned to stay to myself and let time be the best solution.

Shame it accepts Bcash

You’re delusional if you think government backed fiats will last much longer.
 Time will prove humans always choose the harder money. 
Item A is devaluing at a crazy rate while Item B is gaining value. 
Item A while also loosing value is able to be produced an infinite amount as long as they decide to keep printing.
Item B is a fixed supply that’s scarcity increases over time and no one can change that.
Item A forces you to fund war crime and line the pockets of greedy politicians if  you like it or not.
Item B gives you the power to control your own financial decisions. 
The world is waking up every day in masses to this.
Don’t let your ego and need to be right hinder you.

Who cares the valuation in USD. The USD is laughable when you inspect it. Inspect the USD and root of it.

As of now no. If you’re your normal turkish citizen who saw their currency become worthless you think the little money they do have they are going to want to risk it on BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:07:33
Welcome. Take advantage of the bear season and continue accumulating. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:11:44

Agreed. Do your best to change the narrative in this thread rather than talking about it.

1. Buy Trezor
2. Store copy of private keys in two private different secure locations.
3.  Send BTC from coinbase to trezor. 
They are now yours and it’s your responsibility to store your private keys and handle them.

It’s actually him. I know it’s pretty funny. He’s going to get paid for the rest of his life off his first song that blew up over youtube and myspace circa 2004 2005 I believe.

@_date: 2017-11-02 18:46:22
I have 11k tied up in a 401k.
@_date: 2019-02-19 12:34:00
They dumped 16k bitcoin... blessing in disguise.
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:47:24

If you wanted to leave country A and flee to country B, prior to bitcoin transferring value would mean you’re trying to move bars of gold or fiat money that most likely won’t make it to country B. Now with Bitcoin that’s very doable.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:00:42
Neat work. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:23:47
6.5 for sure double bottom on a strong strong trend line.. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:34:28
Is that really ireland 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:19:38
I agree
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:43:34
If handled properly yes. Although it’s very seizable if you aren’t educated on handling and storing your keys.  
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:58:27
Only send bitcoin to someone you know in person and trust. If you don’t trust this person buy $50 of bitcoin and hold it for 5 years.
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:14:53
My strategy is buy $5 of bitcoin every friday and check in 10 years..
