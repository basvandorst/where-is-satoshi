If people stop mining, profitability would go up. Difficulty adjusts depending on how much hash power the network has. Mining will always be profitable to some degree or the network would fail. Hence the reason for the difficulty adjustment put in place.

Bitcoin generating profit for miners is exactly what keeps it alive. The longevity of bitcoin is directly correlated with mining profitability. Obviously the difficulty will continue to increase, but the ideology is that bitcoin will continue to rise in value to support the difficulty adjustments since mining a smaller fraction of a coin will be worth more.

What the community needs to do, is bug the hell out of shipstation. If they add the channel integration, merchants would hop all over this.
