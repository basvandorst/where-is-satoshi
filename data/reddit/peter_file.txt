Those words will allow you to get in without a password. It would basically re-create your wallet using the same seed, so you’ll automatically get access to the contents it had before. Therefore do not show anyone the words you wrote down on paper!

Yes, I'm a bit worried this will somehow reward karma whores. It would be very difficult to reward users based on the actual contribution they made to reddit. "Based on activity" is very vague.

Odd thing is they actually already have coinbase integrated for the committing. Can't be much more work beyond that to activate it for account payments?
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:52:16
I wonder if they made a similar article last year: "Bitcoin is the best investment of 2013". Guess not.

This sounds like an awesome opportunity. I'm more than happy to help out, assuming global shipping is not an issue (I'm located in The Netherlands).
Edit; considering your latest post. I do have a wide variety of devices available. Mainly use my iPhone and Windows laptop, but also have a HTC One available as well as an iMac.  So I'd definitely plan on trying it out on all of them. 
(I even own a Windows Phone 8, but it's used to being last at support)

Yep, and with SEPA it doesn't even cost us anything. I'm excited about bitcoin, but not because it would make it easier for me to transfer money to a friend. Because it doesn't.

Yes, that spar. But just one of them. In Arnhem. But it's a start ;)

What would be a good reason for apple to want to have this app removed from their store? Is it competing with any of their own products? I can't really think of a good reason.

If you're in Europe you would do a SEPA transfer free of charge.

Hallo Jumbo!
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:58:25
It still makes no sense. Why would you actually transfer the coins out of their account? Why not still leave it as "on their account" but meanwhile actually move the coins into a cold wallet. The account balance is just a representation of the coins somewhere on some wallet, right?
Plus, I agree, notifying a user of an automated action like this is the least you could have done.
@_date: 2013-06-22 19:53:03
Or coinbase should expand to Europe :D

Nope they don't own anything yet. I believe nobody has a knc miner yet. According to the knc topic they start shipping in September if everything goes according to plan. And that's to the first people in line.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:48:32
Yes it's very fast, so i assume they process it even with 0 confirmations. They're using BitPay for processing.

A good idea would be an online form  that allows entering the invoice # to pay, and shows one of those bitcoin checkout forms that calculates the price in BTC automatically for them.But that'll be some work ;)

Yes. The physical contact part.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:35:28
Call me an asshole, but I'm seeing this as an opportunity to get in low, because i do believe it will rise again.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:28:46
Me neither, but the chances of it rising again aren't very high either, are they? It's been stable for a while now. Sure, when you bought it back when it was still cheap you are in luck, but investing in it now is a bit late imo.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:52:38
This actually makes a bit more sense to me. Starbucks themselves accepting bitcoin doesn't sound likely. The tech company that does payments is much more likely.
However, will this be a starbucks announcement, or a square announcement? (although the end result is the same: pay for coffee using bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:47:45
They're using BitPay. I have no experience with them but it wouldn't surprise me if it generated random addresses for each payment. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:01:46
Yes. The fastest way is trough referrals. Smart guy.

How does this work when getting coins off them? Doesn't this have the same issues as paper wallets regarding change addresses. Thus the entire amount has to be withdrawn rendering the original card useless?

Yes.. At the current difficulty. They do NOT own the device yet. This could take a while and most likely difficulty has increased a lot by then.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:53:54
True. But if "some government" would destroy bitcoin it would be a major blow in the confidence people will have in cyber currencies. Thus making it harder for the new currency to be widely adopted.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:35:36
Same here! Also in the Netherlands. I think it helps thuisbezorgd.nl now supports bitcoin. Suddenly people see they can actually buy real things with this imaginary currency. They start asking themselves these questions "why does it have value?" "how do i get some?". Etc. I've also had some casual conversations with my colleagues about it. They are all genuinely interested.
@_date: 2013-06-15 14:39:47
I'm not sure about mobile phone networks in the USA, but here in Holland we also have "virtual providers". The live inside a network from a major provider, but can do their own business (though most are bound to the prices of the network they live on). I think technically this would allow you to start a phone provider and accept customers payment trough bitcoin. I think it will still cost a fortune to start up though.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:03:12
Yep. BitPay.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:48:58
That would also counter the "spoofing" issue. I seriously think this should be priority no. 1 because spoofing could cause lots of trouble.
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:44:55
Ah, mine is *******
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:26:28
Correct. And then you transfer your funds to the new address.. And the transfer is publicly available for everyone to see :)
