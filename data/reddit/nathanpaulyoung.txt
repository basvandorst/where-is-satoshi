Are you serious? Yes, the app is free. But it's a financial app. It handles bitcoins.

That thread was very, very frustrating to read.
Good on you for it, regardless.

I'm dubious. I'm no scientist, but the conservation of energy makes me think that, since the bitcoin miner is producing meaningful data, some of the energy put into it would be lost not as heat but as that data.

HTTP has nothing to do with that. The requirement for the trailing slash is platform-specific. They could change that if they wanted.

That's actually a really interesting assertion. Let's talk about that for a second?
How do you define "public global computer network"? Is it by the physical infrastructure? If so, there really isn't a single "internet", as the infrastructure globally is owned by hundreds of completely independant companies, municipalities, and nations.
If it's by protocol, then what about I2P? Tor? Freenet? Usenet? All of these are completely separate from the standard clear internet, sometimes with bridges to the clear internet. These bridges are very similar to the physical bridges between the segments of physical infrastructure individually owned and run around the world.
In either case, it's interesting to think about how all of these network implementations are inspired by and iterations on the original ARPAnet. Were it not for the US Gov and a collections of Universities in North America pushing for interconnections and data sharing for their mainframes, none of these other technologies would have arisen.
And honestly, that's interesting, because none of the current implementations are all that similar to ARPAnet, though their common origin is evident. All of the current protocols and segments of infrastructure work together, and create the now-ubiquitous (yet ambiguously named) "internet". It's not a single thing, it's a collective whole built on an original and long-since-irrelevant idea.
Similar to how the blockchain and the first currency to use it is a very original idea, yet we already have a variety of implementations building on that starting point.
I expect that bitcoin will continue existing for a while, but to say that the other cryptos don't stand a chance or that the blockchain and Bitcoin are basically the same thing, especially when using the internet as a comparison, is kind of shortsighted.
We as a species of talky, social engineers are bound to iterate and replace any new technology of value. It's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:15:49
Wow, this post.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:41:52


Absolutely. And *that* is the true comparison between the dotcom craze and the current crypto craze. People will go HAM on crypto, some will make beaucoup bucks on it (either through impressive foresight and willpower or insane luck), and the rest of them will get royally fucked by the bandwagon as other better, more stable, and more useable technologies come along to replace the current systems.
But ultimately, diversified implementations and continual iteration will eventually leave the crypto of the future looking quite different from the crypto of today.
Things will *absolutely* be better, but there will be financial casualties along the way.

I mean, sure. I figured out from the blog that this Luka Magnotta guy was some kind of depraved, murderous attention whore. But aside from that, what else? Is there something additional that I am not getting?
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:43:41
True, but if our goal is acceptance, respect, and eventually adoption on a wide scale, then people's preconceived notions about currency (founded in the divisibility of fiat currencies) are going to get in the way.
As a second point, saying "zero point zero zero one bitcoins" [ten syllables!] is a mouthful. Saying "one millibitcoin" [five syllables] or even "one hundred thousand satoshi" [eight syllables] (or even "hundred kay satoshi" [six syllables], since we all know that'd be adopted colloquially) would be preferable.
On those particular two options, mBTC would be preferable due to the flexibility and (ever-increasing) familiarity of SI prefixes, but satoshi would be preferable because it represents the smallest possible division of a BTC and can easily be considered future-proofing as BTC continues to evolve and grow.

Send the BTC to your private wallet. Don't leave them in a MtGox account wallet.
