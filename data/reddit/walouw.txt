For me:
1. Bitcoin is an open source technology that is constantly improving: like linux, android, the web, etc.  It will never be "done".  Now apply the sophistication ramp we've seen on internet tec to bitcoin over the next 5 to 10 years.
2. Apply whatever objection you have to bitcoin (as a metric) to USD, EUR, Gold or whatever you consider to be sane and safe - and then compare your "safe" asset to bitcoin using the same metric.
3. Mainly most people cannot conceive of an economy where we (the bottom 90%) are not dependant on the good will of the top 10%.  It is a paradigm that is very difficult to get used to.  
4. Let's say someone invents the personal teleporter tomorrow and open source the technology.  If a similar black swan event were to occur in trade/fin, how would you recognize it?

If "bitcoin" solves real problems in a better way than USD, EUR, Gold or whatever, then it will eventually replace the inferior technologies - assuming the human race is collectively more sane than not.
So the answer is either all money or none of it.
The question then becomes which technology will win the race.  The answer must be the one that is improved faster than it's competitor.

1) Make up your own mind if technology will win against the establishment. 
2) Decide if this new system (bitcoin) will be better for society than the current system.
3) Act on your conclusions.

If you want to estimate growth, the closest analog I can think of is the growth in Facebook penetration - ie users added to the network over time - or the addoption rate of smart phones during the last 10 years.
Assuming the bitcoin technology can be made to work better than visa/mastercard over the next 5 years, then multiple % points of the world economy that is currently consumed by banking services will move to bitcoin.
From an investment point of view, the S&amp;P 500 P/E average is around 23 - which looks much more like a bubble than bitcoin if you ask me ;-)
