A lot of people lose everything day trading. If you decide to do it, remember that you're swimming with sharks. 
You're most likely best off taking a small amount that you're comfortable losing (all of it) and then trying to trade it into a larger amount. Set a goal and don't stray from that and don't dip into your other funds no matter what. Learn some lessons first before you trade with larger amounts.

After being in crypto for howeverlong, one eventually gets used to thinking in satoshis and cursing when people drop zeros from the proper 8 decimal places that should be displayed! ��
Why not just use satoshis? It's easy enough. 
e.g. 10,000 sat is about $2.10 CAD. 
10,000 KRW is roughly close to $10, and the Koreans seem to do perfectly fine with money. 
Besides, that 10,000 sat will be $10 next year anyways. Satoshis are a better way to count and they're also more "future proof" or "moon proof" if you will. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:35:51

You've poked one of those issues that is a core part of the Bitcoin culture - HODL. 
With fiat debasement and inflation, spending is encouraged because your money will be worth less tomorrow than it is today. 
However, with Bitcoin being deflationary, we're encouraged to save rather than spend. 
When you live in the fiat world, it's harder. 
Once you take the plunge, the Bitcoin world is much better. 
However, it takes sacrifice. I've lived like a pauper and very well know how it is to decide on where to spend the little that I had.

Thanks for that. I've been wondering how Atomic Swaps work for a while, and that's a nice high-level overview. It'll certainly helps me out as now I can see better what I should be looking into when I try to learn how to do Atomic Swaps. (Been wondering about it for a long time, but not had any luck in searches about how to do it.)
I was looking on the jelly.market site, but couldn't find a GitHub link. Is the code open source, and if so, do you have a link for it? I'd like to look into it further. 
Off-topic, but similar... I wrote up a low-level tutorial for how to do Atomic Transactions, which are similar to Atomic Swaps. ATs work on the same chain (Bitcoin-based blockchains). You can find that here:
It's extremely low-level and not for everyone. But, if you like to geek out, I'm sure you'll find it interesting. It's written for the Xaya blockchain, but can easily be adapted to any other Bitcoin-based blockchain. 
I must give credit to domob1812, a Bitcoin Core contributor:
As he's the one that taught me how to write an Atomic Transaction.

There's no good reason for BCH. It doesn't solve anything. It's just a fork for the sake of a fork, just like BTG and 2x. 
The core devs have done extremely well in keeping to solid principles and not going wild with shiny new features that aren't needed. 
It's not all just elitism. Sometimes it's just getting sick of useless forks that achieve nothing. 
Besides, the market has rejected BCH.

There are some decent ICOs out there, but they're not easy to find. Part of the problem is that there's a very high noise to signal ratio.

Borders don't matter. However, the ability of people to purchase in different areas matters. 
Some fiat currencies are basically garbage, and you need to spend more of that to get a bitcoin. 
For example, if you know that your purchasing power with XYZ currency will be less tomorrow, you want to get rid of it, and so does everyone else. So, at the current exchange rate you need to big higher to get that bitcoin than other people. 
What you're saying is that you will forgo the use of that money for a period of time until you recoup the purchasing power with the rise of the bitcoin price, or the lowering value of the fiat currency. 
In the end, it all boils down to time preferences, exchange rates, and inflation/deflation.

@_date: 2017-11-18 03:57:19
That's not it. 
The currency in Zimbabwe is so horribly unstable and its value is going down so badly that people just want to get rid of it ASAP. They'll pay a very high premium for that. 
So, the official value of what they're paying for 1 bitcoin is the same as $13,000 USD. 
This has to do with friction between different currencies and in the banking system. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:35:04
Agreed. 
I think the hostility, at its core, is because bcash is a hostile fork. 
Compare the situation to Bitcoin Gold, and you don't have the same issue, because Bitcoin Gold isn't a hostile fork. With it using a different mining algorithm, there's no competition for miners, and consequently, less of the vitriol that we've seen between the Bitcoin and bcash camps.

[Gratuitous South Park reference.](
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:13:02
Yes - it's relatively easy to arbitrage. 
However, you need to be working with a significant amount of money, and keep it on different exchanges. 
Your trades need to cover any fees, e.g. bank transfers. 
If you're working with something like Tethers (careful with that), then it's a bit easier. 
One of the ways people arbitrage is by using shorts. You can get burned there very badly though. 
A major concern is if you've completed one trade on one exchange, but the other exchange is overwhelmed with volume, and not responding. Again, you can get burned badly.
