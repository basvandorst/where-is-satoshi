US politicians do the same thing but its legal here.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:28:16
i bought a little.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:00:21
this guy makes shit up.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:43:55
dont forget all the wall street guys dumping their hedge after it was clear their shorts were going to come in.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:25
someone needs to repost this to wallstreet.  they need all the reassurance they can get!
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:30:37
Round up
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:01:36
and if it does, that's fine!  nothing horrible happens if it dips a little lower.  its called volatility and this damn market is full of it.  its completely normal to see 1k plus swings every day.  some days it goes up and others go down.  Its above 10k so i'm happy (even if i didn't buy the dip)
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:21:12
now buy it back
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:00:08
anytime btc does a major flex, all the other coins tend to follow suit to some extent.  but if futures are expiring tomorrow then you're going to see a lot of people trying to manipulate things to whatever end they can.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:26:55
i was holding out for 8.  maybe next time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:56:38
everyday?  how about every 8 minutes! lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:17:08
it sounds like it should but who knows.  we live in crazy land now
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:19:39
Alright, we are back to blaming you!!!
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:04:37
you have absolutely no clue what the market is going to do.  facts: we don't have wallstreet pumping shit-tons of money into bitcoin like we did in december so we arent going to hit that ATH for a little while.  we also have no idea if there's going to be another correction.  go ahead and sell then unsubscribe from this sub.  trolls like you post just to be a dick.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:56:52
sure, jump out now, take a bath and pray it doesn't rebound in a week.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:29:09
Great googley moogley!  Look at the volume!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:44:46
unless lightning comes fully online and fees go to nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:21:41
its called day trading.  its actually a good thing when its done right.  people buy it when it dips which slows the dip and sell at the peak which flattens it out.  it helps dampen the volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:48:00
My question is this.  If they're "printing" tether, who is accepting it to buy crypto?  It seems like these people are the chumps.  If this is a big scam, then that company is going to be able to run away with a bunch of btc.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:45:16
i did
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:14:16
have you tried turning it off and back on again?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:06:24
i believe so.  transfer from cryptopia/bittrex/etc to gdax to coinbase to your account
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:49:43
Ya that was demoralizing but we will claw our way back.  Stay strong!
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:45:46
if you're in the US, the IRS is going to screw you over.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:24:01
he's trolling.  
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:26:39
so people need to stay the hell away from exchanges like that if at all possible.  go to the gdax where tether isn't allowed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:02:20
I misread that as twelvetown and went "fuuuuuuuuck" in my head. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:13:47
someone is asia farted?  i have no idea.  i'm going to buy in a little.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:40:35
if you've sold any of it at any time, the IRS says you have to reports gains/losses on it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:09:36
you might have the opportunity to buy back!
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:56:02
please elaborate.  how does this not look good?  
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:40:53
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:06:14
Just saying, be prepared for it
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:47:18
with the market so easily manipulated, who the hell would take on someone wanting to short btc?  much less a bunch of people wanting to?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:13:48
of course they will!  They can't price it accurately if its so easy to manipulate.  Otherwise, who would take that bet?
edit: crypto futures aren't the same as dow futures (or any others).  Don't expect them to be priced accurately.  They're going to be priced so that either side has a reasonable chance of winning.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:35:29
it's not a loss until you sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:32:52
Never said it did but things of value are usually rare. (Kind of like all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs)
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:45:10
which you then have to pay taxes on...
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:21:07
if bitcoin didn't just take such a huge shit, i would buy you gold for this.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:24:46
in a cash society, you'd have the same problem.  But stores and corporations would still have to keep records.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:20:21
don't be hateful.  we don't want anyone having a bad taste r/t bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:23:25
Wallstreet A-holes hate this one easy trick to turn 5 BTC into a puddle of tears overnight!
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:28:39
How are you scanning your id?
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:42:51
yes, weekends are usually slower.  check out the volume on the gdax.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:13:41
a former trader explained this better somewhere else here.  Someone shorts bitcoin but buys some coins to hedge their bet.  Now that they are able to settle up and cash in on their position, they dump their coin because they don't need them anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:55:22
then just wait a little longer
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:10:09
i choose to be optimistic!  To the moon!!
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:20:17
and if you're wrong, it wont.  remember, bitcoin is still a very foreign concept to 98% of the world.  As more people dangle a toe in to these waters, demand will slowly go up.  this is like being the first house in the neighborhood with indoor plumbing.  Sure you get a burst pipe or two but eventually everyone else is going to love this shit too!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:10:07
who the hell lit the fuse on that rocket?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:48:07

when is south korea coming back online?  tonight or tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:12:44
do you really want the bulls back in this?  they made it skyrocket and then sold everything causing (or contributing) to the crash.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:13:34
it didnt
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:16:24
we aren't out of the woods yet.  i sold a little bit before that 10k wall got smashed but we might see some volatility that puts us back down around 10k.  if it does DONT FREAK OUT!
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:21:47
sadly, this isn't the case.  I went and spoke with several accountants about it :(
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:38:33
i took a picture of my id then uploaded it that way and it worked.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:44:58
not a lot of people trading on the gdax right now.  the trade history is so slow you can actually read what it says!  
I think everyone is a little tired/gunshy right now.  Give it a few days and watch things heat back up after people have had a break (myself included)
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:34:17
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:59:18
this isn't about china.  this is about wall street futures coming due tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:21:13
watch, it will dip again now.  We're all gonna blame you!
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:12:55
and it stopped.  calm down.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:22:33
i was waiting for it to dip more.  I'm hoping for all our sakes, I missed the boat and its not coming back.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:44:55
beanie babies were mass produced.  finite number of coins.

Asia wakes up soon.  Hopefully we continue the up swing!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:34
i bought some
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:43:10
and if you buy using "limit" you pay no fees at all
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:20:49
don't freak out when the price drops.  hang on for a wild ride!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:46:38
I just bought my first purchase of Bitcoin because of fomo... Im scared now
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:00
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:21:37
this has been the most boring day on bitcoin in the last month
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:36:08
good.  i plan on buying back in!
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:29:33
wow!!  took me 1 day to verify then a week to move money
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:50:24
It's not.  You would be lucky to cover your ROI within the first year.  But if the price keeps steadily going up...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:25
wallstreet gave gdax their death hug
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:45
i bought half of one, watched it drop (figures) and sold it for $1.50 more than i paid.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:03:22
it's my fault.  i bought back in :/
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:47:39
i noticed some weirdness while watching the gdax.  it didn't interfere with my trading though.  i guess wait it out is all you can really do?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:16:07
where the fuck is all this money slowly pouring in from???
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:53
some people are so good at this that they do it for a living.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:14:24
I buy and sell all the time and i bought some at 19500.  i'm just going to wait a few more days and it will be back there.  don't freak out.  just give it time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:52:37
already did all that.  The wait to transfer through ACH is 5-7 days.  My limit on CC is $750 and it says I have to wait 55 days to increase the limit.  So I don't see any real feesable way to get the $2k I need to bitmain in the 1 hr time frame they gave me.  I'm sure the L3s will sell out quickly with LTC rocket.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:12:19
Gotta figure out where that is on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:54
you really have to wait till your money is in the gdax before trying to trade.  its increadibly frustrating when you miss out on a good dip.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:59:50
which sucks
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:38:59
bought back in too early.  saving my last amount of money for something stupid cheap
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:04:31
congrats!  how much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:13
damn man so close!!!  i feel your pain.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:44
i keep the gdax on all the time now and i'm not even bought in
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:59:42
if you're very active or very good you can day trade with positive results
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:30:28


But that would require using other people's money for the front.  That could get insanely dicey!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:05:43
just because a new better coin exists, doesn't mean people will flock to it.  You could literally create blowjob coin where you get a bj for every coin you buy and it would still take years to be adopted!!  Bitcoin was the first big one to hit the internet and has a huge head start in name recognition.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:13:00
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:53
fuck yes!  i bought one of the dips :D
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:15:41
amen to that.  i missed the big jump over 10k while i was waiting for coinbase.  longest week of my life.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:06:28
i'd use shapeshift
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:05:15
If you sign up on the gdax you can buy in without paying any fees.  Just fyi
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:48:01
I had issues as well.  Turns out my webcam was shit when it came to taking a picture of my ID.  Uploaded a photo with much better results.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:33:12
but you won't get an S9 for under 5k anywhere in the US
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:16
coinbase wont even load for me to buy mroe!!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:24:15
10-11 cents/kwh
Looking for others who want to buy one of these but don't want to buy 5 at once.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:50
this is nuts.  i jumped out at 15k like an idiot.  wallstreet gave gdax their hug of death
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:52:57
you can't you can only sell if there's someone willing to buy.  that's what makes this risky and fun as shit!  Don't invest more than you're prepared to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:21:20
it's been way too steady today.  I'd love to see a nice drop so i can buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:07:54
hell ya!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:50:02
Because they were turning a profit in church
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:37:07
keep in mind, for every person that shorts the bitcoin market, someone else is taking the long position.  I suspect that both will do what ever they can to leverage their position.  Hopefully that will add some volatility and I can make more coin!
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:35:01
that's true!  but i like to day trade so i'll have to adopt the hodl lifestyle which will be hard for me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:32:35
Don't forget your transmission rates on that 0.046 price!

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:04
i just did too
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:57:03
fortune favors the bold!  Buy and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:51:50
was taht the bottom?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:21:04
and it'll bounce back by this time tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:21:04
same here
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:13:36
funds or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:42:13
refresh the page
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:42:36
Agreed.  I just got two guys at work to buy in
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:48
bought the dip!  unfortunately it wasn't the bottom...
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:57:38
wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:39:13
no idea.  im still new
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:08
i think coinbase and gdax are crashing from the craziness
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:26
Good, I'm positioned on the gdax to buy back in if there's a dip
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:44
bought when i could through coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:24
buy high and sell low?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:51:01
the manufacturer's website
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:18:53
19k now!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:21:57
what's the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:09:54
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:36:05
I don't think I can make this go through in a timely manor with coinbase.  Even with a valid CC it's saying it will take a week.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:50:16
you keep getting older.  they keep staying the same age!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:40:06
anyone else notice the volume in the last 24 hours is a fraction of what it was a few days ago?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:55:21
That's rough stuff man.  We're drinking to you tonight
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:36:20
That was because North America got locked out of the gdax for 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:33
aaaaaaaaand its down
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:35:17
no freaking clue!

"Regretful comments" are going to be the title of my autobiography
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:23:10
how the hell did i end up getting left in that dip??
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:53:49
you have to pay taxes on any profits.  The IRS wants theirs!!
Edit:  the irs sees that original investment that you're withdrawing as gains, not as the original investment.  And since their eyes are the only ones that matter, you'd get fucked if they audited you over it.  Everything done on gdax and coinbase is viewable by the irs.  don't think you're lucky or special.  they will find you and they will fuck you.  prison style.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:15:19
I plan on contacting the company and asking for evidence of legitimacy.  If they want that much money, they need to cough up proof that this is all legit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:27
i bought back in at 17 :(  I'll wait for the ride back up... tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:34:16
you'll end up burning out your card over time.  If you start mining bitcoin all you'll do is waste electricity.  You can use it to mine alt coins and then exchange them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:20:45
damn it. my bad
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:04
screw 15's. i'm waiting for 13s.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:24:23
anyone want the market to drop again?  I'm thinking about buying now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:58:03
wtf am i getting into...  i can't wait for my ach deposit to clear coinbase so i can get into the fray
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:03:00
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:01:54
Is it commercial?
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:48:24
fucking bots
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:50:21
its a weekend.  dont expect much.
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:23:32
I was wondering where the huge service connection fee was from
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:08:54
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:40:13
Who ever put that wall up would likely move it
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:46:55
hope you brought something to do because you're likely going to be waiting a looooooooong time for it to hit 6k, unless the feds come out and spread some FUD, I don't think we'll see 9k again.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:46:38
It's the new buzz phrase.  Like bull trap and catch a falling knife.  Bunch of retards here.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:48:49
Maybe, maybe not. No one fucking knows!!
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:17:53
Well sure.  You can't expect a ton of action over the weekend though.  It's mainly bots and non professionals during those times.  I doubt anyone in the banks or Wall Street are doing a lot from home.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:48:20
That's the new buzz phrase in this sub.  It's like millennia overusing 'epic'. Stop it
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:07:20
is this the new buzz phrase for the week?  like "don't try to catch a falling knife" or "bull trap" and lets not forget "dead cat bounce".  Did I miss any?
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:08:07
That's amazing. I never knew the specifics
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:25:50
they were up hours ago (action over there usually starts at 7)
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:27:50
I check the gdax a few times a day from my phone and lately I have a small aneurysm waiting for the page to load and display the current price
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:42:38
If they don't sell, you aren't milking them
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:49:32
no one knows.  take a gamble.  that's what we all did.  could go either way at any time.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:25:21
you're welcome for this rise.  I sold some of my stash.  be nice to me or I'll buy some and wreck these markets!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:43:07
judging by the size of the buy and then the sell.  It looks like one whale who bought a lot then sold it back off.  don't despair bois!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:51
Everything put out yesterday was neutral to positive
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:13:22
It will be ok.  Hang in there
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:21:51
I read the link to imply that today's small progress is a setup and that we will continue the downturn.  If others thought the same, they may call it fud
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:32:45

There are ways of buying through coinbase/gdax that will eliminate all fees but will take you a little while to get your money in

That's like coming to a conference for blind people and asking what they think the color purple looks like.  They have no fucking clue and neither do we
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:29:34
if you have direct evidence and not hearsay, i'm sure there's a DA that would love to hear it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:49:48
Exactly this!!

Fuck bitmain.  You think those antminers you buy are new?  They've been using them for months to mine and now that they have replacement stock or a new model to use upgrade to internally they'll happily sell you their used gear for a pretty coin.  
I won't give them the time of day.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:58:40
A little bit lower and I'm buying moar!!!
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:30:36
not likely.  everything was fine until one dude jumped ship and got everyone like "oh fuck now i'm scared!"
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:33:12
I can't predict the future but I don't think we'll see that again
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:30
did no one inform you of this when you bought in?  A rollercoaster was exactly how it was described to me and I still bought the ticket!
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:26:30
And so are selling driving cars but you don't get into your beater 2007 Honda and get pissed that it can't take you McDonald's by itself.  Shit takes time
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:43:51
Keep talking like that and it will be over 12k by tomorrow
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:07:14
did something just hit the news?  massive sell volume for some reason
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:44:28
still better than the 8 and 9k we were at not too long ago!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:28:57
It hit 7500.  I should have bought but I was really scared that we were going to drop much farther than that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:50:28
Good!  We don't need to grow too fast too quick.  That's one of the reasons we had this crash

@_date: 2018-02-10 19:09:12
its actually a {insert next weeks buzz word here} trap
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:03:12
Of course!
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:25:19
Roughly 7 days
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:37:17
The company manufacturing the miners (bitmain) uses them until they reach the relative end of their usefulness or until the next model comes in stock and they have to move out the old until to make room.  Then they sell them for a significant amount which further increases their profit to the gullible folks here that think they'll make gobs of money with them.  
I almost bought one too until someone helped me connect the dots.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:44:15
There's lots of new buyers.  Robinhood and a lot of other exchanges are seeing tons of new accounts daily.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:45:14
What did I miss?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:44:41
You have no idea
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:50:03
No they don't.  I made plenty day trading.  You just need steely nerves to avoid impulse moves.  I learned it the hard way and lost years off my life.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:14:56
How about BULL TRAP
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:31:25
the only thing i can predict here is that you shouldn't listen to anyone on this site.  no one has any accurate info on the price aside from the fact that it will be between 0 and today's price.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:40:04
Im optimistic today.  I smell a good $500 jump at some point today
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:49:52
Smartest people in the room... Not a terribly high bar here
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:33:40
in all seriousness, turn off the screen.  go do something you like. hit the gym or the neighbor or something.  come back in a solid 7 days and regroup from there.  it'll will either be the same, burned to ashes or the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:42:26
What's all this green shit on the gdax??  It seems strangely familiar
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:49:25
The other side of that though is that by selling miners at equivalent hashing power to their own equipment, they're undercutting their market share which would cut deeply into their coin profits.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:27:21
lord knows.  it will swing back the other way.  this is what it does
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:50:29
If that were true, stocks would be the same way.  Took a bath in 2008 but it didn't stop lots of people from continued investment in retirement funds
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:15:29
key words ----&gt; Right Picks
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:33:39
volume didn't taper at all!  in fact it went through the roof on the gdax since its been cheaper.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:50:38
Pretty sure that was wall streets doing. Not bitcoins fault
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:28:34
BUY NOW BEFORE IT GOES BACK UP!!

I passed fear at 8k.  Ive given in.  No shits given anymore to the Moon or the grave boys!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:50:47
This man speaks his opinion.  No one here knows jack shit
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:31:51
They will but sometimes ignoring a problem seems like the easiest way to deal with it
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:50:31
Those same fudtards said we were going to see 1k priced coins too.  DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU READ IN THIS CESSPOOL!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:52:49
All you sick fuckers are obsessed with dead cats!!
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:38:37
Did that when it hit 11k
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:50:52
Watch him sell it and we keep going higher then he buys back in only to watch it fall again.  Happened to me
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:01:34
Which was surprising
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:57:49
Well since we're just pulling numbers out of our ass, I predict $50 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:17:12
It's always a threat that the exchange could get hacked and your coins could be stolen which would suck.  But to move your coins, it costs which also sucks.  Gotta weigh the pros and cons
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:32:24
we did earlier today.  walls move.  the gdax read your post and said "hold my digital beer"
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:39:07
Stop with the stupid buzz words already!!  No one on this sub knows wtf is going on nor can predict the future (remember all the "it's going to 1k!" BS).  Sundays almost always have a lul in price
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:42:09
because the "experts" here are all 14 years old and have no clue what they're talking about.  The only thing you should take from this sub is not to listen to anything anyone else in here says.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:19:51
It's going to fall some amount eventually.  No one knows how much though even though they make big claims like they do
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:35:21
Everything is speculative early on.  And in the grand scheme of things we are still early on in this process.  More and now businesses are allowing people to pay in btc.  Hell I can pay my dish bill in btc now.

cloud mining is always a bad idea man.  sorry you had to learn that lesson the hard way.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:49:14
It will in a bit.  Hodl on and wait for the dust to settle.  There's a lot of hardcore folks that aren't jumping ship.  We'll recover in time

i need more money in my gdax account.  now is the time to buy moar!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:52:05
That would be a hell of a lot of money to pump and even then you can't just pull that much money out without causing everything to crash in the process.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:39:10
The economy is doing well and everyone is convinced the market is going to crash... I get it.  The stock market is not the economy and vice versa.  I'm curious to see what Monday hodls 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:31:04
this sounds very probable
