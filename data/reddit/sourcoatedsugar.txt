Yah I am no Democrat.  But the sides of the "issues" the republican party takes and legislates around does not represent me whatsoever.

They honestly bought that lie of trump campaigning for their class and jobs and way of life.  That is why insaid trump by name.  MAGA was based around middle class white getting the dues they were deserved and he was going to look out for all rural americans so much so that he was even gunna bring coal bavk to the US!  
People voting for a global cooperation billionaire to represent them.  As usual.

I mean im without a doubt btc.  Just crazy reading the other sub.  I feel like everyone is collectively insane but who knows, maybe we are hah.

All of are the hardest BCH shills i have ever seen.  All of says BCH is the biggest scam ever.  Reading both subs makes my head spin.

It isnt.  They continue to vote against their own interests.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:21:46
Because lower class people are STILL sold on the american dream.  They believe that if they work their fingers to the bone and fight amongst themselves for the scraps the rich leaders spit out that one day a hand will be extended to them and they will be invited to the big boy table to feast on their own big piece of the pie.  
I work in a very blue collar job and the amount of trump supporters I am surround by is astonishing.  Greatest trick ever pulled in human history is somehow getting these hard working, poor people to vote directly against their own interests... I am thoroughly convinced guns are such a massive issue because they know most rurual hard working people own guns.  They build a dialogue that the progressive liberal commies are coming for their guns and that is 95% the reason they vote against 95% of their own interests.

I don't know what it is but there is a website that makes it round on reddit every now and again that allows you to look up unclaimed funds.  I actually got money from Google adsense that I guess got lost in the mail when I moved.  It was a handy site.  That might help in this situation.

I looked up old emails from when I was a broke ass college student.  I sent an email to my father telling him about bitcoin and said "most likely will be the next big thing."  Looked up price history on the date I sent the email and BTC was just under $100.

If anyone has all their funds in a stable coin on an exchange they are playing with fire.  Traders are going to get absolutley mt.gox'd one day and its going to be really bad short-term.

I highly suggest if anyone has time to watch this.  It doesn't have anything to do with crypto but you can see parallels with what happened in history when the gold standard era ended and gave way to the modern fiat era.  I feel like their is currently an uncharted void and Bitcoin could fill a very large hole in creating another "gold" standard, but a 21st century electronic version.  I'd love other people's thoughts on that video, it really was a great presentation.

Its never huge when someone says it is huge

Yah, thats the only thing that makes sense.  I wouldn't pay $80 for that shit either.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:43:08
Something is note worth when the government creates legislation for the taxes on crypto.  Filing websites also added tax help for crypto as well.  This is a big sign of things to come.  Nobody is out there writing legislation about World of Worldcraft gold.

Did you do it?
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:40:50
You are supposed to report crypto you mine.  Exactly the same as farming in-game gold.  
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:10:37
Can someone tel me how if 80% of btc is currently owned by early adopters and whales, how the remaining 20% is enough to bring in everyday people to have mass adoption takes place? Seems like there there is already wealth disparity.

I have an archives email i sent to my dad in 2013 while i was a broke ass college student that just said "you hear about bitcoin?  Sounds like it could be huge, you should look into it and maybe get some."  It was $250 at that time.  Feels bad man.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:15:23
Long story short If you leave your bitcoin on coinbase etc.. they arent really yours.  Millions upon millions have been stolen in this manner.  Best is a Ledger or Trezor Hardware wallet.  And only purchase them directly from their websites.
Now not wanting to scare new people I am all for dabbling with 25-50 bucks.. whatever you want and just purchase bitcoins, see how exchanges work, the purchase process... leaving a minimal amount on an exchange is fine, just accept the risks.  If you want to get your feet wet just purchase and then read about storage and private keys and understand what is actually going on and move a small amount at first incase you screw up.  You and only you are responsible for not losing money, there are no help lines or support.. You never have bitcoins, they don't move from an exchange to you.  All is going on is you own private keys (think a secret password that's assigned to your coins and only your coins) that allows you to access your coins on the blockchain.  So getting a Ledger you are in full control of the private keys.  When left on exchange the exchange itself controls the private keys and your balances are just displayed to you visually.  Exchanges are constant weak points for attacks and hacks and millions have been stolen.  The blockchain itself is virtually impossible to compromise.

Well think about just the fact that in 1940 you needed food.  Now there are TVs, microwaves, computers, cellphones, tablets, cable bills.. to be a participating member in society you are almost required to purchase dozens of stuff that wasn't even around back then.  People can barely make ends meet with dual income now a days.  Where in the past it was mostly the husband being the only source of income and everyone could still own a home and raise their children.

Probbly people making new accounts so their post history about how much BTC they bought at 18k isn't attaches to them.
