Lots of tiny inputs will create a *very* large transaction. Fees are calculated based on transaction size, therefore you could be looking at paying a very steep fee to move these coins, perhaps in the region of 20% if you want fast confirmation.

Yeah you're right, I stand corrected. OP could be looking at a transaction a few hundred KB big though, I guess we won't know until we see his address.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:07:45
I Agree. As long as a transaction is paying a reasonable fee, it's no less legitimate than any other transaction.
I find it ironic that people laud the permissionless nature of Bitcoin, but also cry foul about "spam" transactions. In a permissionless system you don't get to categorize some uses as good and others as bad. Peoples motivations for making transactions are none of your damn business.

It's not at all unusual for a startup who has experienced sudden &amp; massive growth to have "hacked together" software.
It's not a question of competence. In the startup phase, doing something quickly is generally preferable to doing it right. If you spent 10 times longer doing everything "right" then your startup probably wouldn't survive.
On the downside, it creates a lot of technical debt which has to be dealt with sooner or later.
**EDIT** I'm not making excuses for them, just providing some context on silicon valley startup culture.

There is no fixed amount. You can dedicate as much or as little bandwidth to the network as you want/are able to.
There's a common fallacy around here that running a node requires obscene amounts of bandwidth. That's only true for people who don't bother to spend 5 minutes configuring their node properly. There's a [handy guide on bitcoin.org]( explaining how to do it. Bandwidth requirements for a fully validating node can be as little as ~150MB a day.

That's not quite what I said. What I said is that I made an objective observation. The reality is that a lot of non-technical people have been indoctrinated into a narrative where the Core developers are the best developers in the world, they alone are qualified to work on Bitcoin, and other developers are incompetent charlatans. I'm not saying it's true, just that it's a very common misconception in large parts of the Bitcoin community.

Agree with you there, initially at least. I think LN is going to be economically practical in two scenarios:
1. A one-time payment where there already exists a route between existing payment channels
2. A series of smaller payments where a larger amount can be staked up front on a dedicated channel.
(1) depends on relatively widespread adoption of LN. (2) is limited to certain use-cases where it makes sense, eg subscriptions, tipping etc

I agree that the initial block download is the only real hurdle for people who want to run full nodes. But from the moment the genesis block existed, the size of the blockchain was only going in one direction. The blockchain is only getting bigger; was this not obvious to everyone right from the very start?
I don't get people who act like the size of the blockchain is such a big problem. If it's such an issue, why did people get involved in Bitcoin at all, despite knowing this very obvious fact?
Bitcoin is not an efficient system. It never has been, it was not designed as such. The core design of Bitcoin gladly throws away efficiency in favour of more desirable properties - decentralization and censorship resistance.

With the [average transaction fee around $30]( it's a significant expense to move your coins to a Segwit address. If you transact often, you can probably make that money back in reduced future fees. If you don't transact often, you're not really getting much back for your $30.

For people on the outside looking in, Bitcoin has at least two things in common with a Ponzi scheme:
1. Those who got in on it early tend to become much wealthier than those who were late to the party.
2. It tends to attract a lot of *"get rich quick"* people.
That's where the similarities end as far as I'm concerned. There is no pyramid structure in Bitcoin. Money from new participants is not used to pay dividends to old participants.

Agreed the scenario is very different. But it would seem that some of the comments against BIP-102 would also apply to this?






These comments also seem to directly contradict the statement that *"the signaling methodology is widely misinterpreted to mean the hash power is voting on a proposal and it seems difficult to correct this misunderstanding in the wider community."*. But that's an extraneous point.
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:32:26


Spending $20 a month on a VPS for mining would probably yield something in the range of 15 to 20 KH/s hashing power\*.
Even if every single one of the 207,695 subscribers of this sub were to do that, it would yield a collective hash rate of just over 4GH\s. The current hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network is around 3500GH\s.
So, every one of the 200,000 subscribers to this sub renting a server as you suggest, would still only account for a little over 0.1% of the network hash rate.
** EDIT  ** My numbers are off by a factor of a million. The current network hash rate is currently 3,000,000,000 GH\s, not 3500GH\s. Accounting for that, the 200,000 rbitcoin subscribers would actually account for 0.0000007% of the total network hash rate. Thanks for for pointing out my mistake.
\* [Source]( - that's based on 38KH/s for an Amazon EC2 extra large instance, which costs over $100 a month. To get within your $20 budget we'd have to run an EC2 small instance, which would have a smaller hash rate (15 to 20 is a generous estimate).

This is exactly what miners are supposed to do, the whole system depends on it.
Bitcoins incentive structure is supposed to align what's profitable for the miners, and what's good for the network. A miner should find it more profitable to help the network, than to go against it.

I try to look at the Bitcoin community as a singular whole. Like any community it has its fair share of trolls. Unfortunately those trolls have turned on each other, so it looks like the community is split. But we have to remember that the argumentative trolls are only a small (but noisy) minority within a much broader community of rational, respectful and affable bitcoiners.

No worries, Bitcoin is still a new paradigm and a ubiquitous lingo hasn't fully established yet. My interpretation of the terms could be way off as well!
I think payment channels and micro-transactions are related but separate ideas. Buying small, digital items like ebooks and mobile apps is a great use-case of payment channels. For me, micro-transactions are a whole new world where you might, for example, pay a penny for each *page* of an ebook you read, or pay a fraction of a penny for *each second* you spend playing the latest android game, or pay a fraction of a penny each time you visit a web page without being served ads, and so on.
As for larger ad-hoc purchases, like buying the latest playstation game on Amazon, or buying a bulk load of nappies (which is what I tend to buy most often these days), I still think normal on-chain transactions are needed, and Bitcoin certainly can't handle Amazon level volumes of those atm.

Bitcoin was not "based on" HashCash. Don't let the name confused you, HashCash was not a digital currency, it was a proof of work system designed to prevent spam emails. Satoshi's design of proof-of-work mining was influenced by it, but Bitcoin as a whole is way more than just the mining system.

In that scenario I think governments would become obsolete, and be replaced by multinational corporations. Instead of joining a "government clan" as you describe, you'd instead join a corporation.
However I don't think these corporations would run like co-ops and allow people the freedom of choice, ultimately I think people would be born into and "owned" by the corporations. Corporations would trade humans just like any other commodity, a global blockchain where each persons DNA is encoded and ownership agreed. The mining reward is procreation, each birth a new coin in the ledger.

You could argue the same thing about Bitcoin Core alone. Each new version has the potential to be incompatible with previous versions (this has actually happened). Not only that, but the same version running on different operating systems could behave differently and be incompatible. Not only that, the same code running in the same environment, but compiled with different compilers could behave differently and be incompatible. Or different versions of the same compiler, and so on and so on...
There's an almost infinite number of things that could cause clients to behave abnormally. Trying to prevent that from ever happening is a fools errand. Instead, it's much wiser to acknowledge the **inevitability** of such a scenario, and take measures to reduce the effects of it. One of the best ways to do that is to ensure that there is a diverse set of client implementations running on the network, such that a consensus failure in any one of them only has a minimal impact on the network as a whole.
The situation we have today is that around 98% of the nodes on the network run Bitcoin Core or software directly derived from it. If a critical issue is ever discovered in that code, the entire network is vulnerable to catastrophic failure.

If *most* full nodes limited their upload speeds, propagation times would reflect the amount of bandwidth that participants are actually willing to contribute to the network. That's already the case now.

Go or Rust would be awesome. I'd love to see an implementation in Erlang, which has to take the title of best networking language imo. I'd also love to see an implementation in a functional language with formal proofs, OCaml for example would be great.
The only thing I'm really sure about is that C++ is a pretty awful language to use for consensus critical code. The same C++ code can behave very differently on different platforms, or even on the same platform but compiled with different compilers. Hell even the same code on the same platform but compiled with different versions of the same compiler can behave differently.

In what way? A veto is disruptive by definition. If the miners exercise their veto and you overrule it, they never really had a veto to begin with.


I find it interesting that we've come full circle. BIP-102 was criticized for using flag day activation and not miner voting, yet UASF is celebrated for exactly the opposite.


Agreed, that is desirable. Nothing about a block size increase like BIP-102 contradicts that. Miners can still mine 1MB blocks if they want to, just as they used to use soft limits on the way up to 1MB.

One of the arguments that has been used against on-chain scaling is that there is boundless demand for cheap on-chain transactions, and Factom was used, among others, as a typical example of these kind of non-monetary uses which have been somewhat demonized in the community.
I think this kind of hostility from some parts of the Bitcoin community was one of the driving factors which led Factom to switch their operation over to Ethereum.

The Bitcoin network actually relies on them to do this, the incentives are explicitly aligned so that a miner should find it more profitable to play by the rules than to attack the network. If Bitcoin relied to miners acting out of generosity and good-will, it would have failed long ago.
That's the genius of Bitcoin imo, because ultimately the only thing you can **really** rely on is the fact that people are greedy. It's what keeps Bitcoin running.

It's nothing to do with trusting this or that company with Bitcoin.
If the Bitcoin client was written in C it doesn't mean Microsoft control Bitcoin.
If the Bitcoin client was written in Java, it doesn't mean Oracle control Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin client **is** written in C++, but it's not controlled by Nokia (who own Bell Labs).

Just to play devils advocate here and not necessarily fighting BU's corner, it's actually trivial to [limit bandwidth usage]( to whatever is manageable for you. You can limit your upload speed to 5KB/s, if you need to. Hell you don't even *have* to upload anything, you could leave your port closed and only download. Yeah it's kind of a douche move, a lot like downloading a torrent and then not seeding it, but it's surely preferable to knocking nodes offline.


Or spend 30 seconds adjusting your bandwidth settings.

Bitcoin could be written in pretty much any programming language, there's really nothing about a language itself which can tell you anything about how Bitcoin works. Programming languages are only a means to an end.
If you want to get started learning how to program, Javascript is as good a place to start as any. It's relatively quick to pick up, has a low barrier to entry and there is plenty of educational material out there online and in print.
Have realistic expectations about what you can achieve. Programming is difficult and takes 10+ years to master. Plus, it's only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

The whole point is that those two things should be in alignment. If they're not, Bitcoin is fundamentally broken.
**EDIT** For the people downvoting me, what I'm getting at here is the delicate incentive structure that keeps the Bitcoin network going. Miners should find it more profitable to act in the interests in the network than to attack it. Satoshi explicitly mentions this in the whitepaper. This is why it's silly to accuse the miners of being "greedy" or motivated only by profit. Yes of course they're motivated by profit, that's exactly what is required of them. If that were not the case, Bitcoin would have failed a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:21:33
I stand corrected, thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:21:43
I suppose that is another option. A central tenet of Bitcoin is that the majority of miners should act rationally. If that assumption doesn't hold up, it indicates doom for the Bitcoin network. If a minority of miners acting irrationally can harm the network, that indicates catastrophic failure in Bitcoins design.
I'd say this is the worst possible option. Personally I think 1 or 2 are the much more likely reasons. If I suspected 3 or 4, I'd probably cash out most of my Bitcoins.

The incentive structure of Bitcoin is designed to keep the interests of the miners in alignment with the interest of the network as a whole. By *"fighting like crazy"* to defend Bitcoin, you obviously must think that this incentive structure has failed or will fail without your intervention.
Fortunately, I think you're dead wrong. If I believed for one second that Bitcoins future depended on an army of Reddit and Twitter trolls, I would sell all of my coins immediately.

Bitcoin does not make any assumptions about miners actions apart from the fact they will act in their own economic self interest. That is all that is required of them. Bitcoin does not require anyone to act out of altruism. If it did, it would be worthless.
The incentive structure of Bitcoin is supposed to align a miners self interest with the interest of the network as a whole. The way I see it there are 3 possible reasons for any miner not to be signalling SegWit at this point:
1. They do plan to signal SegWit support, but have not done so yet.
2. They have run the numbers, and believe that their economic interests are better served if SegWit does not activate.
3. Bitcoins incentive structure is fundamentally broken, such that the course of action which is obviously best for the network is not in the economic interest of the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:24:09
Completely agree. This sub has become quite unpleasant recently, for all the same reasons I stopped participating in rbtc.
Another frustrating point is the constant vilification of figures from the "opposing" side. What the trolls don't seem to realise is that even if they are 100% right, if Bitcoins survival depends on Reddit keyboard warriors fighting to keep it out of nefarious hands, then it's already a thoroughly uninteresting project and certainly not worth $20bln. All the trolling is ultimately futile, even if it's right.

@_date: 2017-03-15 17:29:08


Completely agree. We **must** assume that somebody, somewhere, has found an equally serious bug in Core, and is just waiting for the right time to bring the Bitcoin network to its knees. It is only responsible and prudent to make this assumption, hope is not a strategy.
The fact that something like 98% of nodes on the network run Core or code directly derived from it scares the shit out of me.
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:00:21


I did pretty much exactly that. I was unhappy with any of the full node options, so [I compiled my own]( which most accurately reflects the direction I want Bitcoin to go in.
It's a fork of Bitcoin Core from 0.14.0-rc1, so it includes all the improvements in Bitcoin Core including SegWit. I also merged in the code from Lukejr's bip-blksize proposal, but redefined it as a simple 2MB hard fork (without the reduction to 300KB nonsense). I did not make any other changes to consensus code whatsoever.
It was really easy to do this. People don't need to rely on Bitcoin Core or BU to express their wishes. Bitcoin is open source, you can run whatever code you like.

I think a bit too much blind faith is being put into LN at this point. Yes it's very promising and very cool technology, but people act like it's a silver bullet which is going to solve all of Bitcoins problems overnight. In my experience it can't possibly live up to the lofty expectations which are being put upon it. 
Wrt nodes in data centres, I do agree with you to an extent. But if you extrapolate Bitcoins current trajectory, where it seems to be heading towards being a settlement layer for large/wealthy institutions making large payments with high fees, I don't see why any "common folks" will want to run a node to facilitate that network. Under those conditions there's nothing wrong with nodes in data centres, operated by the same large institutions that transact on chain. Common folks would have been priced out of Bitcoin far before we ever got to that point.
@_date: 2017-02-18 07:27:14


That's not very reasonable. FLOPS is a measure of a *certain kind* of computing activity (floating point operations), not all activity by any means.

Block A results in the same amount of data travelling over the wire with or without SegWit. Without SegWit, these transactions *may* need to be split across multiple 1MB blocks.


Block B results in the same amount of data travelling over the wire with or without SegWit.
It's true that SegWit does incentivize different *kinds* of transactions, specifically those that aggregate multiple inputs that have the beneficial effect of reducing the UTXO set growth rate. Those transactions don't use any more or less bandwidth than they would have without SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:19:19


I think you've misunderstood. SegWit does not make transactions any bigger, they still occupy the same amount of space. 2MB worth of transactions is still 2MB across the wire under SegWit. 4MB is a theoretical maximum (that will never be reached), but that doesn't mean that 2MB worth of transactions magically double in size and occupy 4MB.

This is the thing that really confuses me. If people honestly think that Bitcoin needs to be "defended" somehow with petty insults on Reddit &amp; Twitter lest it be taken over by some nefarious actors, then it's already doomed. If you have to defend it like this, it's already dead.
The whole point is that it's a self-running system, through an intricate incentive structure. If someone had published a whitepaper in 2009 saying *"Hey guise I made this awesome decentralized, permissionless cryptocurrency! It just needs a bunch of whiny teenagers to defend it on Reddit 24/7 to stop it getting taken over"* then it would have been a pretty uninteresting prospect.

I'm not sure why you would think that? I'm not a "fan" of any sub. I hardly ever visit rbtc, let alone participate in it. I dislike that sub quite a lot actually. I wonder how many other people you have falsely attributed to a "side" in this conflict?


Yes I do think that a lot of the things they've been saying harms Bitcoins image to outsiders. Unfortunately I do think there's a certain amount of validity to what they're saying. That doesn't necessarily mean I support what they're doing. But I think Bitcoins image is harmed just as much by the vitriol flowing in the other direction as well. Ultimately I see all the trolling as utterly pointless. Would you agree with these two assertions?

Witness data is not new data, it always existed in transactions. As I said, SegWit does not make transactions any bigger, nor does it add any new data. It only splits the data that always existed into two logical divisions. The 1/4 discount refers to the maximum *block weight*, **not** the maximum *serialized size* of a block.
In order for your statement *"4MB only provides 2MB of transactions"* to be true, SegWit would have to be conjuring 2MB of new data out of thin air, or maybe transmitting the same transaction data twice? It doesn't make any logical sense.

The same is true for Bitcoin. Both networks are operating on a roughly similar playing field. Both have relatively large blockchains. Both similarly burden node operators in terms of bandwidth and resource usage. Neither of them incentivize running a full node in relation to the other. Yes, some percentage of full nodes are bogus, but there's no reason I'm aware of to assume that percentage is higher on Ethereum than it is on Bitcoin. We could estimate that 20% of Bitcoin nodes and 20% of Ethereum nodes are bogus, but that doesn't change anything.

That's great, good on you :) It's just that your post made it sound like running a node required x amount of bandwidth and that's that. When it reality node operators have a number of options to tune the amount of bandiwth their node uses, including going right down to blocks only mode, which reduces incoming bandwith usage to as little as 150MB per day, and outgoing to only 1MB per day.

You are getting very confused between the number of new transactions being broadcast to the network and the size of the mempool.
Have a look at [this graph]( showing the number of new transactions, you will see no spike that supports your claim that 60k transactions popped up "out of nowhere".
The number of new transactions stayed completely normal immediately before and during the so called "attack". There was no significant spike in new transactions.
However, due to the difficulty increase fewer of those transactions were being confirmed, so the backlog started to fill up. This was an entirely predictable event. We knew that the difficulty adjustment was going to be a huge one, and we also knew that the network had been running *over capacity* in the days immediately preceding the adjustment (blocks were averaging every 7.5-8 minutes... 20% faster than normal).
It frankly amazes me that there are still people calling these "attacks" with absolutely zero supporting evidence, and plenty of evidence to the contrary. And I'm getting really sick of explaining this to people over and over.

Realize the market and the value of your Bitcoins will sometimes drop dramatically.   No worries.  You’ll be holding these Bitcoins for 40-50+ years.  During that time the market will very likely drop dramatically 40 or 50 times.  There will be real and serious problems that cause it.  Each time people will panic.  Each time they will predict this is the end.  Each time you’ll be hearing Sell!  Sell!  Sell! If you are smart, you will ignore this.  If you are very smart you will use these times as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoins at bargain prices.
As I write this in January 2017 Bitcoin is trading around $980.  Two years ago it was at $260 and people were predicting with certainty it would go to zero. Opps. It more than tripled. By the way, there will also be times when the market soars and people will begin to say this is a new age.  Things are different this time.  Things will never go down again.  They, too, are wrong.

Not quite sure where you got that number from? It's 412 according to github. In any case I'm commenting on the current situation, not historical states. The total number of contributors to the project in the history of Bitcoin is hardly relevant.
If you were to count the number of developers who have made **meaningful** alterations to the code within the last 6 months, not just fixing up typos or documentation etc, the number would be worryingly small.
You seem to be taking this as an attack against Core, it is not. My point is only that it would be a far more desirable situation to have multiple independent credible and competent development teams working on the Bitcoin protocol.

I don't think it is because no system has been put in place to ensure consensus in that debate. If a system had been put in place to ensure that any dissenting minority would be incentivized to follow the majority, then yes you would have to say that having a minority holding out with flat earth theory would indicate a flaw in said system.
I think the deeper problem is that the incentive model assumed all nodes would mine. As we all know that is not the case. This means only the miners are incentivized to maintain consensus, whilst there is absolutely nothing in place to prevent disagreement among node operators.

The only possible way to create an 8MB block would be to have the block contain exactly 1 transaction with 7.999MB worth of signature data. I'm not certain that that's even possible, given the limit on sigops.
At the current recommended network fee ([300 satoshis/byte]( at time of writing), such a transaction would require a fee of 25.2 BTC. More than double the reward for finding the block.

The incentive structure of Bitcoin is supposed to get everyone in alignment, such that everyone, by acting in their own self interest, is also acting in the interests of the network as a whole. If the incentives are out of alignment and parties acting in their own self interest are having a detrimental effect on the network, that says to me that there are serious problems with Bitcoins incentive structure. 
You could also argue that the miners reluctance to rock the boat and change anything is in the interests of both themselves and the network.

Transaction fees are a complete red herring imo. Rising fees do not increase the capacity of the network. The standard advice "use a higher fee" is extremely short sighted, and it does not solve the problem in a holistic way. The best case scenario is that your transaction is confirmed while someone else's is sent nearer to the back of the queue. For someone who cares about the state of the network as a whole, this is not a solution.

Before the difficulty adjustment, blocks were being mined roughly every 8 minutes on average. The difficulty adjustment brings the average back to 10 minutes, as it is supposed to. I'm not sure how else I can explain this.

Thanks. My experience with Lightning has only been setting up channels between two peers (pretty much I just followed [this guide]( My understanding is that the routing you describe is still theoretical and [nobody is quite sure]( how that will work yet. Also a couple of questions spring to mind - if a payment has to be routed through an indeterminate number of middlemen in order to reach the intended recipient, can we really consider it peer to peer cash any more? How do we know we can trust all of the middlemen? Also, what's the incentive for the middlemen to route the transaction, will each intermediate node take a small cut?
*I feel like I need to qualify my post by saying that I'm not against Lightning in any way. These are genuine questions. This community is often hyper sensitive to perceived criticism, which this post is not.*

No, it depends on the nature of the transaction. I'm not too sure what the ratio is, but for the typical types of transactions we see on the network today the block size limit ends up being around 2.1MB. In the future that may change, as newer types of signature-heavy transactions become more popular, Segwits effectiveness may improve. I believe (but I'm not certain) that the Lightning Networks channel open/close transactions will fall into this category. Some people, rightly or wrongly, complain that this unfairly favours certain kinds of transactions going forward.


I'm not too sure why the initial block weight was set to 4MB, maybe it's explained in the original Segwit BIPs. To be clear, Segwit only works for Segwit transactions, it offers no throughput increase for traditional\* transactions - something which the miners have been asking for (the wording of the original [HK agreement]( was very specific on this). The reason for setting the block weight limit to 8MB is that it doubles the networks capacity for these older\* transactions. That's the crux of the compromise.
\* I'm using terms like 'traditional' and 'older' here, and some people even refer to them as 'legacy' transactions, but I don't think it's fair to imply that these types of transactions are outdated somehow.
**EDIT:** On second thoughts, it seems quite obvious why the block weight limit was set at 4MB when non-witness transaction data is multiplied by a factor of 4. It has the effect that in the absence of segregated witness data the system carries on working in the exact same way it did before. However the follow on question must surely be, why was the multiplication factor for non-witness data set to 4?

Either Segwit is 4MB and 2x is 8MB, or Segwit is 2MB and 2x is 4MB. Pick one.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:20:50
We don't get 4MB with Segwit unfortunately. The maximum practical block size we get with Segwit is a little over 2MB. You're thinking of block weight - it's confusing because block weight is also measured in bytes, but it's not the same as the size of the actual payload which is transmitted across the network. For example a block which contains 800KB of non-witness data and 800KB of witness data has a block weight of 4MB, although the actual payload size is only 1.6MB.
I agree that off-chain solutions may offer a lifeline to those people in areas where running a full node is impractical. Australia is one such place where connection speeds are surprisingly poor (for a first world country).
Another thing to consider is that sometimes it's demand for services which actually drive improvements in internet infrastructure. For example, I don't think the rollout of domestic fibre connections in the UK would have happened nearly as quickly had it not been for the massive consumer demand for streaming HD video on services such as Netflix.
In the future the same may be true of Bitcoin. Massive consumer demand to run Bitcoin nodes may actually drive improvements in network infrastructure in regions where it is lacking now. But if we limit the network to the lowest-common-denominator of infrastructure available today, that demand may never materialize.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:23:53
Indeed, in fact a 4MB Segwit block could only contain 1 transaction, that transaction having 3.999MB of witness data.

Funny, you're not the only one ["exaggerating"]( in that way.
Bitcoins incentive model requires only that participants act in their own self interest. To the extent that businesses rely on the continued patronage of their users to survive, businesses also serve the interest of their customers.
Nobody in Bitcoin is required to act in the best interest of the network or its users at their own expense. In fact it's explicitly avoided, since if you rely on someone acting altruistically you introduce trust into a trustless system, and the whole experiment fails.

No, 4MB is the maximum block **weight**. Block weight and block size are not the same thing. Block size can only ever be smaller than the block weight.


Not really, since an 8MB attack block can only possibly be composed of a single Segwit transaction, with 7.999MB of segregated signature data. Only 150 bytes or so of the attack block would be non-witness data. The only thing that makes the attack block 8MB instead of 4MB is the doubling of the maximum block weight.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:03:58
I guess I wasn't clear in my wording then. I wasn't denying that the attack vector exists, I was pointing out that you can't lay all the blame on opening up legacy blockspace - since it's a characteristic of segwit that attack blocks can be ~2x bigger than average blocks.

Before the adjustment blocks were being mined on average once every 8 minutes. After the adjustment (one of the biggest difficulty increases we have seen on the network ever), that average moved back closer to 10 minutes. That's a ~20% reduction in the number of blocks being mined, which means fewer transactions being confirmed. At the same time, network [hash rate dropped]( by about 650,000TH/s. Of course a backlog developed. This is not rocket science, it was a completely predictable event (sorry, I cannot link you to the thread where it was predicted).
People are linking to graphs plotting to the number of transactions in the backlog, as if that is indicative of anything. A much more useful graph is the [number of transactions accepted]( - which we can see did not spike at all. If it were truly a "spam attack", we would expect to see inflated volume on that graph.

It's not a spike in new transactions, it's a spike in the number of transactions that haven't been confirmed. The reason they haven't been confirmed is because blocks are not being mined as quickly as they were before. The reason blocks are not being mined as quickly as they were before is because the difficulty adjusted, which it does automatically every 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:48:48


Are they? There are more nodes running on the network today than there have been in well over two years.


But that's what I'm saying, the requirements of running a full node are surprisingly small. You can run a node consuming only 150MB of bandwidth a day, and it is still fully synchronized with the network, and you still don't need to trust anyone.
If people are shutting down their nodes due to bandwidth, maybe it's because they're not aware of their options. Posts which claim running a node requires **terrabytes** of bandwidth monthly certainly aren't helping the situation.

Yeah I did read it, and I explained exactly how that max size could be reached. What's the problem?
Yes miners do have several options available to them to attack the network. This is an attack vector which is incredibly easy to spot, and any honest miner could easily orphan such a block. Meaning the attacker would lose the block reward and all the resources expended to mine the block. As long as 51% or more of the miners are honest, we're golden. As has always been the case.

I just don't see the use-case for payment channels in a retail context. Who is going to tie up sums of money in a payment channel just in case they want to buy something at some point in the future?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against payment channels at all. I can see how they'd be incredibly useful for 2-way payments, or regular recurring small payments. I just don't think they are applicable at all for online retail such as Amazon. If anything people will open a channel, buy the thing they wanted, and then close it again. Which is obviously double the number of on-chain transactions compared to just paying with a regular transaction.

The thing that saddens me most is not the disagreements but the animosity and utter lack of respect for those with differing opinions. We all have a lot in common in this community, anyone who has engaged in this debate on either side is a passionate advocate of Bitcoin and a fellow pioneer in a potentially world changing technology.

So Segwit replaces the simple block size limit with the concept of a block "weight". The maximum block weight is 4MB, but non-signature data is multiplied by a factor of 4 when counted towards the weight limit, whereas signature data is counted 1:1.
This means that a block containing no segregated witness data, but containing 1MB worth of traditional transactions will be counted as 1MB * 4 = 4MB block weight. Although the block weight is calculated as 4MB, the payload is still only 1MB in size.
If a block contains, say 800KB of non-witness data, and 800KB of segregated witness data - the block weight will be calculated as (800KB * 4) + 800KB = 4MB block weight. Although the actual payload size in this case is only 1.6MB.
The ratio between witness data and non-witness data is what gives Segwit it's effective block size limit of ~2MB. Under real world conditions the non-witness data (multiplied by 4) will typically hit the block weight limit long before the witness data.
This is the comment within the Bitcoin Core source code which [explains the forumula](
    static inline int64_t GetBlockWeight(const CBlock&amp; block)
    {
        // This implements the weight = (stripped_size * 4) + witness_size formula,
        // using only serialization with and without witness data. As witness_size
        // is equal to total_size - stripped_size, this formula is identical to:
        // weight = (stripped_size * 3) + total_size.
        return ::GetSerializeSize(block, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION | SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS) * (WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR - 1) + ::GetSerializeSize(block, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
    }
SegWit2x increases the weight limit to 8MB. That means that even a block which contains no segregated witness data can still contain 2MB worth of traditional transactions (2MB * 4 = 8MB weight). It's this part specifically that required a hard fork.
\*Please someone correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.

If counting nodes is an accurate way to measure consensus, why do we need proof-of-work at all? Why do we even need mining?
Counting nodes doesn't prove anything - it's trivial to spin up thousands of nodes, or to make a single node appear to be thousands to the network. If Bitcoin consensus is measured by the number of nodes, then Bitcoin consensus is dictated by whoever can run the most fake nodes, and therefore it's completely centralized.
Proof-of-work exists in Bitcoin for a reason - it cannot be faked. Either you've done the work or you haven't. And when you have, you get to chose which block to build on top of, thereby influencing the direction of the blockchain as you see fit.

Not just in terms of managing the project on Github but also by staying out of the vitriolic debates which are the hallmark of the Bitcoin community.
Personally, I don't think a software project having a [benevolent dictator]( is necessarily a bad thing. The only thing that worries me is that the reference implementation (Bitcoin Core) and the Bitcoin protocol are basically one and the same thing. I think that governance of a software project and governance of an interoperable open protocol should be handled very differently.

I'm guessing Jonas' figure represents the number of accounts which were active on the Bitcoin github pages over the last year, the majority of which would have been commenting on issues &amp; pull requests etc. rather than making code changes. Not that those activities aren't worthwhile, but I think my point stands that the number of people making meaningful changes to Bitcoin is worryingly small. For example the Bitcoin Core roadmap was written entirely by a single individual. Again, I'm not attacking Core, I'm just imagining a better ecosystem.
Ethereum is a great example. Last year there was a serious bug in a prominent Ethereum client - geth - which knocked all nodes running that software offline. Fortunely, Ethereum had an alternative client - parity - which did not exhibit the same bug and continued working. The fact that there were multiple client implementations allowed the network to continue running.
The situation we have with Bitcoin today is that around 98% of network nodes run Bitcoin Core or software directly derived from it. That means if a serious bug or vulnerability were to be discovered the entire network would be at risk.

This is a relatively narrow view of the field of modern software engineering. There are many scenarios where failing fast is not an option - think systems which have to be fault tolerant, such as the software which runs a heart pacemaker. Sure you could fail fast, shut the system down and send an alert to someones pager, but meanwhile someone is dying in the street. Also, consider the software which is running on the Mars Rover, you think they can deploy to that multiple times a day? No, that software was fixed from the second it left Earth.

I think propogation delays leads us towards the natural limit of Block sizes, rather than an arbitrary one. Obviously no miner wants to see their block orphaned, so there's a strong incentive not to build huge blocks. There's an equilibrium to reach between building larger blocks (and getting more fees) and restricting block size (to limit orphan risk). That equilibrium is the natural block size limit.
The problem occurs when most mining occurs within a relatively small region. If most blocks are built inside China (within the great firewall), there's far less chance of Chinese blocks being orphaned than for blocks built outside China. This could lead to an "uneven" natural block size - where blocks from China could be 5MB for an acceptable orphan risk - but blocks outside China would have to be 4MB for a similar orphan risk.
BTW I'm not sure why you're downvoting me. I haven't said anything untrue, or anything derogatory in any way to you or anyone else.

I'm excited about Lightning, it has great potential. But I agree with you that we should not bet the entire network on unproven technology. I don't believe in silver bullets.
If Lightning is the answer, and I hope it is, our having raised the block size will not impede it.

When you say things like "everyone there is a moron", you're over-generalizing, failing to see or wilfully ignoring the nuance of the situation. Things are rarely, if ever, that black &amp; white. Speaking in such absolute terms is misleading, and you open yourself up to obvious counter arguments.

+1 Agree with all of this.
The other thing that's not talked about very often is that Core can even be incompatible with itself. Different versions of Core behave differently, and there's a potential for accidental forks - this actually happened once. If we want to guarantee consensus we definitely shouldn't be letting different versions of Core on the network.
Not only that, but the same version of Core running in different environments could behave differently. If we want to guarantee consensus we definitely shouldn't be letting people run nodes on any of Linux, Windows, or even Rasberry Pi's, we need to pick an "official" environment configuration.
Even then, the same version of Core, running in the same environment, can still behave differently if the code was compiled on a different compiler. Or even a different version of the same compiler.
The list goes on and on and on... This notion that consensus is guaranteed if everyone runs Core is wishful thinking at best.

If the network wants it, is it really a bad change? There seems to be this notion that "the network" needs to be protected against itself. Where if the chosen few don't defend the integrity of Bitcoin then it will descend into madness.
If BU is truly bad, it wont be adopted by the network. I think this is the more likely scenario. However the self-appointed guardians of the network still need an attitude adjustment.
At least, that's how I think a lot of people on the other side see things. They want market forces to be fully empowered, because if Bitcoin has to be shepherded by a small group of people, you might rightly call it a failed experiment.

Apologies for the false accusation!
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:04:36
Yeah there's definitely a trade-off to make. If we build out the network to accomodate people with extremely limited connections - that necessarily involves limiting those who have better connections. Likewise if we build out the network for people with very fast network connections, that necessarily involves excluding those people without them.
But it's worth remembering that the people who are likely to run Bitcoin nodes are the same people who are likely to have above average connections compared to their peers. Another thing to consider is that people in developing economies, such as Africa, have already largely been priced out of Bitcoin by the transaction fees. So whether or not they can run a node is [largely irrelevent](
My personal opinion is that the sweet spot for a good trade-off would be closer to 4MB. That does mean that a small number of node operators would have to consider restricting the bandwidth usage of their nodes. That number is around 5% according to BitFury. A smaller number still might have to shut down their node entirely as the absolute minimum bandwidth requirement increases from ~150MB daily to ~600MB daily.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:53:12
You're both wrong.
SegWit alone has a maximum block size of 4MB. However 4MB blocks will never be seen under real world conditions. In reality the effective block size limit becomes a little over 2MB.
SegWit2x doubles the capacity limits of SegWit. So the maximum block size becomes 8MB. However, again this will never be seen under real world conditions. The effective block size limit of SegWit2x is a little over 4MB.

The difference is that with cloud mining they get that capital right away, and they can use to invest in more/better mining hardware or eficiency gains.
As we know, mining is an arms race and time is a crucial factor. If you had the option of getting $10,000 spread out over the next 6 months, or $7,000 right now to invest in your mining farm - choosing the latter is not necessarily a bad choice.

That's not the case. A typical SegWit block will be around 1.7MB - but only once the entire network has upgraded to SegWit capable clients/services, which could take a long time. My best guess is that we'll be looking at a 1.5x throughput increase at most a year from now.
Not criticizing SegWit in any way, I hope it gets activated ASAP. I just think we need to have realistic expectations for it, and we must be prepared for the  fact that the "scaling debate" will **not** be settled by SegWit.

Classic was **heavily** criticized for its own activation threshold of 75% being "too low". 95% has always been the accepted threshold. If the Core developers were to do a U-turn on that now, it would be seen as extremely hypocritical. To their credit, they have indicated that they will not budge on the 95% threshold.
Personally, I think it's stupid too. A 95% threshold is basically no different to a 5% threshold, since it gives the 5% veto power. The only truly fair threshold is 51%.

Another reason it's contentious is that some people see it as blocking a block size cap increase in the future.
For example, [here's a post]( where someone argues against SegWit on the basis that the worst case scenario block size will be used as an argument against increasing the cap.
And [here's a post]( from a couple of weeks later when someone uses the worst case scenario block size as an argument against increasing the cap.
Whether you agree or not, you have to admit that their concerns are valid.

The great thing about proof-of-work is that if an attacker wants to mount a 51% attack against the network to impose their own rules, they would have to spend literally hundreds of millions of dollars on mining equipment.

It's a shame to see you getting downvoted for these comments. Sometimes people in the Bitcoin community talk about sound money as if the concept never occurred to anyone before Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.
One of the things that really excites me about Blockchain tech in general is that it opens up the possibility of managing debt more effiiciently. One can envisage a network which automatically optimizes chains of debt. In the simplest case Alice owes Bob one dollar, and Bob in turn owes Charlie one dollar. This can be simplified, automatically, to say that Alice owes Charlie one dollar, eliminating Bob from the equation entirely. Scale that up to many millions of debtors and the system would become exponentially more efficient.
To answer you other question "why is debt bad", I'd say it's because it precludes anonymity. When you lend someone money you want to know all about them, their history, and how you can get hold of them if they don't repay the debt. You then have to monitor repayments and take action if it's not being paid. Privacy concerns aside, if nothing else it's an incredibly inefficient process.

Maybe they don't need to be collected. Maybe your car can open up a payment channel with the local highway maintenance agency and automatically send micropayments for every kilometre travelled.
Maybe roads could have floating fees where congested roads charge more, encouraging people (or self driving cars) to find alternative routes and avoid the traffic/high fees.
Imagine your car could automatically pay the toll-booth on a bridge as it drives onto it... or automatically pay a parking meter for every *second* that the car was stationary in a parking bay...

Where the "correct fee" is whatever is required to evict someone else from the next block. It doesn't mean Bitcoin is more reliable, it just means some other poor guy is suffering instead of you...
**EDIT** People are clearly misunderstanding what I'm trying to say here. Lets look at it more simply...
Imagine there are 10,000 people who want to use Bitcoin. However there isn't enough capacity, so only 5,000 are able to, while the other 5,000 are left out.
Now imagine that all of those 10,000 doubled, trebled, even decupled their fees, what happens then, can all 10,000 people use Bitcoin?
No, nothing changed, there are still 5,000 who cannot use Bitcoin. The fee level is irrelevant, except for pricing people out of the market (eg. fees rise until there are only 5,000 people who want to use Bitcoin).

Yes absolutely! In some ways two implementations are worse than one. But twenty implementations, each with 5% market share, that would be very robust.

You have missed the point entirely. It's not about the fee and whether or not one can afford it. It's about the fact that there is not enough capacity to fulfil demand. Regardless of who is paying what fees, there are a bunch of people who are simply unable to use Bitcoin effectively right now.

If it is a "spam attack" (and that is a big IF), for me the most likely suspect would be a cartel of miners. It would be extremely profitable for them to raise transaction fees across the board in this manner.
Such a tactic is only viable because Bitcoin is at capacity (and because mining is relatively centralized).
But personally I don't think it's an "attack" of any kind. Imo it's just an uptick in transactions at the end of November, a well understood and predictable pattern.

There's a subtle but fundamental difference between distributed and decentralized. Things like Hadoop and Cassandra are great examples of distributed databases, but they're still under centralized control.

Because SegWit will either activate or not, based on miner signalling. The activation logic does not account for miners motivations, only their votes.
If SegWit fails to activate, it will either be because more than 5% of the hash power didn't want it, or because more than 5% of the hash power mounted an "attack" on Bitcoin. Either way the result is the same.

Anyway we're arguing definitions here, and while it's valid to point out the ambiguity in my argument, I don't think either interpretation of the word invalidates my argument.

This could simply be because of Coinbase's size. The bigger you are, the bigger blip you make on the feds radar. Smaller companies can generally get away with being less than 100% compliant with the letter of the law. As a company grows, compliance becomes more and more important.

What's the point of freedom to elect your president when your only two choices are *this bad*? I would fully have expected American society to be up in arms about this, literally.

It's no so much the lack of anonymity so much as the ongoing overhead of having to manage debt after the fact.


Not sure why you've chosen to phrase your question like that. No I would not prefer to step in and prevent people entering mutually-beneficial contracts. Why would I? Nothing I said even remotely implied that.


Maybe I didn't explain my point very well. What I'm saying is that debt carries an ongoing overhead, which can be a drain on both the debtor and the creditor. If we're able to optimize chains of debt in the way I described, we potentially save a lot of wasted time and effort\*.

Agreed, it's absurd that one should have to pay higher fees for a UTXO reducing transaction. Although that transaction might be bigger than average, the UTXO set is a far bigger burden on node operators than bandwidth or storage space. Addressing that imbalance is the main thing I like about SegWit.
I'm still not quite understanding your definition of spam. Is it transactions which result in 1 or more small outputs? (small meaning low btc value)

If you honestly believe all those things about BU, it obviously poses no "threat" to Bitcoin or Core. So it is really worth spending so much time debating it?
If you believe that, what you consider to be such a subversive attempt at wresting control, has a chance of succeeding.. do you really have any faith in the robustness of the Bitcoin network?
it seems to me that underneath everything, the fundamental disagreement in the community is between those who believe Bitcoin should be allowed to stand on its own two feet, without interference, and those who believe it's some precious little vulnerable thing that needs to be protected and shepherded to safety.
I'm not interested in the latter.

I'd prefer a solution where the max block size is predictable, such as BIP 101. It'd be helpful to be able to say with reasonable confidence how big blocks would be (and therefore how big the blockchain would be) at some arbitrary point in the future. You can plan for it that way.

It seems that original point *"these people believe that increasing the blocksize is somehow a good idea now, in the face of science, they are no better than flat-earthers"* is wrong, since those people who believe increasing the blocksize are clearly backed up by the best science we have.

I'll tell you what I think. I think if the market decides to adopt the flexibility of the block size cap that BU offers, that rational developers will accept the will of the network and continue working towards Bitcoins future. Either they will start contributing to BU, or more likely, BU features will be ported into Bitcoin Core. I would hope that only a tiny minority of developers, if any, would pick up their ball and go home.

Not necessarily, it's quite possible to build a blockchain which is under the control of a single entity.
Of course a 'permissioned' blockchain has no real benefit over using a standard centralized database, in fact it's a lot less efficient for that purpose.

I'm not blocking it?
If SegWit fails to get 95% consensus, then it's obviously somewhat contentious. If some people don't signal support, that cannot be considered "blocking".
If 94% of people want SegWit, and 6% of people don't signal support, is that blocking? Then why not lower the activation threshold to 90%?
But then what if 11% of people don't signal? There will always be a threshold where a proposal may **nearly** get activated, but not quite. This should not be considered "blocking" in any way.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:56:41
Yeah definitely. Any opinion is only as good as the information that was used to form it. For example, if your opinion of someone is based purely on what you see on Reddit, you're only getting a small part of the picture (and a lot of misinformation from others).

I can certainly see the logic in that. However I do think it would be prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a critical failure in Core, even with all eyes on. Or if we're being meticulously cautious, the inevitability of a failure.
Working under the fatalistic assumption that a critical defect *will* be found in Core sooner or later, what contingency can we prepare for such a scenario? Having alternative implementations is the first that springs to mind, although that has drawbacks of its own.

It remains to be seen whether SegWit is a success or not. If not, Core will have wasted a year of their time, and that will play right into the hands of those who claim they're just "stalling". Of course they will wave their hands wildly and blame others for "blocking" SegWit, but the fact is that they failed to galvanize the community around their vision. Instead they marginalized and ignored a significant segment of it. Not a smart thing to do when you need 95% consensus.

We can imagine that, but it's largely fantasy as far as I can tell.




In open source software development, such established development processes are little more than conventions. Having a rigid process which everyone must adhere to is antithetical to the open source movement. This activity should not bother anyone.


Forking is usually considered a good thing in open source projects. In fact having many forks is a badge of honour for most projects. I've never known it to be considered plagiarism before. If you didn't want people to "take your work", you shouldn't have given it an open source license.


This could not be more subjective. If someone writes software that many people consider to be useful, who's to say that's wrong? And how on earth is it an "attack"? The only people who could possibly consider it an attack are those who want to remain the sole gatekeepers of the system.


I don't think anyone is suggesting "replacing" Core. This is very charged language you're using. If they decide to stop working on Bitcoin, that's their choice, nobody has forced them out or replaced them.


Again, this is a wild exaggeration.
All of the things you have said only apply if there is a "Core club" of esteemed &amp; loyal members, who see themselves as guardians of the code and close themselves off to outside developers. I don't believe that's the case. I think we have a group of developers who spend their time contributing to Bitcoin because they believe in it and want to help. If Bitcoin goes in a direction they don't like, some of them might stop believing in it and stop contributing. That's fine, and happens in a lot of open source projects (there is nearly always developer churn).

Realistically I can't see a Bitcoin hard fork getting any real support. My hope is that the *threat* of the community splintering will be enough to compel people to set aside their differences and come to a compromise, such that nobody feels disenfranchised.
If that fails to happen I'd expect a significant segment of the community to flock to an established altcoin rather than a fork of Bitcoin.

The heat output of heaters is often measured in BTU/hr ([BTU]( per hour).
There's a direct conversion between Watts and BTU (1W == 3.412142 BTU/hr), however that conversion assumes that the heater is 100% efficient in converting electricity into heat, which of course is not the case.
I'd be interested in comparing the BTU/hr specification of an efficient [2600W convection heater]( to that of an [Antminer R4]( to see which is more efficient at producing heat. I'd expect the heater to be more efficient, but perhaps not by a huge margin.
Of course Bitcoin miners can only ever heat through [convection]( and would never be able to compete with an [infrared]( heater in efficiency terms.

Things are still quite tense within the community and there are some fundamental disagreements still. However there is a light at the end of the tunnel imo. The SegWit soft fork is available for signalling in Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, and currently about 25% of miners are signalling support for it.
It's an important update which effectively fixes transaction malleability (I say effectively because there are still holes that pedantic people can poke at), which opens up many more possibilities for scaling in the long term.
In the short term, SegWit offers a modest (very modest imo) but welcome throughput expansion. It's somewhat controversial, and if you read the Bitcoin sub-reddits every day it's easy to get caught up in the politics. However I'd remind anyone reading this that such changes to the protocol **should not be easy to do**. And they're not, which is good.

I'm not saying running a node isn't resource intensive, I'm saying there's actually a large range in terms of resource usage - people can dedicate as much or as little resource to Bitcoin as they want/are able to, and *the absolute bare minimum is actually a lot lower than people often realise*. For example, on each of my nodes I always have at least 2 or 3 connections from bitnodes.21.co. They must be spending a fortune in bandwidth, easily multiple terrabytes per month. On the other end of the scale, one *can* run a fully validating node, prune the blockchain down to about 10GB (I forget the exact minimum figure), enable blocks only mode and expend a relatively small amount of bandwidth monthly, around 4.5GB currently.

8MB is the maximum weight, but that's not the size of the payload which is being transmitted across the network. It's a shame block weight is measured in bytes, it leads to a lot of confusion. Some block exporers are adopting the name WU (weight unit), which I think is far better.
A block which has reached 8 mWU would typically be less than 4MB in actual bytes.

The Segwit2x chains survivial depended on it having the majority of the hash rate. That's why they didn't need to put in a difficulty adjustment on the hard fork, or change the DAA, or implement replay protection.

For those who have no choice, running a node in blocks only mode means they can get the benefits of being able to use Bitcoin, gaining the financial sovereignty and freedom it enables, without having to trust a 3rd party. They are "participating" in that sense. The network still requires relaying nodes to operate (and be decentralized), just as a torrent requires seeders.
I wonder how many people would like to run a node but don't because they think it's too resource intensive, when in reality they could easily run a node with just a few minutes of extra configuration away from the defaults.

He thinks that the only reason anyone could ever disagree with him about anything is if they're ignorant or biased, or if they're paid shills. He simply cannot comprehend that people might genuinely have a different point of view than his own, much less entertain the idea they might actually be right.

I'd be interested to see that. I've seen a lot of evidence to *suggest* spam transactions, but never any evidence as to where/who they came from - it just seems to be a foregone conclusion that they come from Ver or Jihan.
The only thing I can really think of that would implicate a miner directly is if the UTXO from a coinbase transaction was used in a spam transaction. But in any case, I'm very uneasy about this designating some transactions as OK and some transactions as "spam".
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:05:54


Sure, but that's not what you said in your previous post, and it's not what I contested. You implied that people need gigabit ethernet and server farms just to cope with 1MB blocks. That is nonsense. You're arguing for decentralization, which is great, but in doing so you risk making people think they're not able to run full nodes, when they likely easily can. That's counter productive.

In both cases, the node receives a candidate block, validates it, and decides whether to reject it or add it to its ledger. There's really no difference in that process if you're relaying transactions or not.


Good question. So if you ran in blocks only mode, you wouldn't be able to mine, since you wouldn't be receiving any transactions to build a block with.
Also, if nobody relayed transactions, it would be difficult/impossible to broadcast transactions to miners unless you had a direct connection to them. It would also be impossible for *new* nodes to join the network, since they would have no way of syncing forward from the genesis block. So the network does need a healthy number of relaying nodes.

I'm not sure about the specifics in Finland, but here in the UK I'm required to keep track of the cost-basis for every BTC I spend, and declare the gains when I submit my tax self assessment. Tax is not due *only* when the BTC is converted back to fiat, but every time the asset is disposed. I'd guess most countries in Europe are broadly similar, with varying tax rates of course (30% I believe in Finland).
It's quite frightening how many people in the Bitcoin community are not staying on top of their taxes. I think over the next couple of years we're going to see a lot of Bitcoiners falling afoul of tax authorities for evading taxes.

The problem is that often you cannot predict how your system is going to behave under extreme load. It's only *after* you've been flooded that you can see which parts of your system were the weak links in the chain, where the bottlenecks are and where you should focus your improvements in the future.
A huge spike in traffic like this is a painful experience, but also an invaluable learning experience. The trouble is, building software is a slow and difficult task, especially when you're upgrading existing software without downtime. A bit like a mechanic fixing a car whilst it's still running at 70mph along a freeway. Most likely companies like Coinbase and Kraken are still acting on the lessons they learned from 2 or 3 spikes ago. Things are just moving too fast to keep up with.
You may think why don't they just hire more developers so they can respond quicker? Scaling up development teams is not so easy, you can't just throw programmers at the problem. The old adage *"9 women can't make a baby in a month"* applies.

Honestly, no, they don't help the network at all. But ask yourself this - should the Bitcoin network have to rely on people running nodes, essentially out of charity &amp; good will, to survive? It doesn't. People who need to run relaying nodes are incentivized to do so.
If you have a genuine need to run a fully validating node but don't have the bandwidth to spare, don't feel in the least bit bad about running in blocks only mode. I for one would rather you still be able to use and enjoy Bitcoin in a fully trustless way, rather than having to rely on a 3rd party.

Cloud mining does make a certain amount of sense to the miners. People often ask why don't they just mine for themselves? By renting out their equipment they get capital released immediately, rather than drip-fed over the course of months. It might legitimately be preferable for them to receive 80% of the value immediately than have 100% slowly over 6 months. That's their business.
While they're not *all* scams, I'm pretty certain that anyone who ever invested in cloud mining would have been better off by just buying Bitcoin and holding it, so I wouldn't recommend it.
Unless you're a professional, that advice also applies to trading. Most amateurs who attempt to trade end up being worse off than they would have been if they had just bought and held.
Just buy and hold, no need to be any smarter than that.

Such a thing is inevitible when there is such a fundamental disagreement about the direction of the project. In this case it's more damaging to try and maintain the status quo than it is to let the network naturally split on amicable terms.

We could respect others opinions and allow, even encourage them to explore other directions &amp; see how it pans out.

I don't give a damn about the block size debate, to me it's far less worrisome than the communities inability to communicate respectfully and productively with each other - a failing which you continue to exemplify.

You're right it is a very strange thing. Two years ago discussion about block size was very civil - people openly discussed the pros and cons of the various proposals. There never seemed to be any doubt that the block size cap would be expanded. And back then we were a lot further away from network capacity than we are today.
These days people even advocate for *smaller* blocks - which has just totally come out of left field.

Generally agree with the sentiment of your post but this statement is a bit silly. Bitcoin is very **very** far from being the most complex, robust or decentralized software of all time.
For comparison in terms of complexity, Bitcoin Core is around 120 thousand lines of code. The source code for Mac OSX Tiger is around 83 million lines. The code that runs the large hadron collider is around 50 million lines. 
In terms of robustness, there are life critical systems out there where a bug or runtime error will literally cost lives. Imagine the code that runs someones heart pacemaker, or a life support machine. Or the avionics code on a passenger jet, or the operating system of the mars curiosity rover. In terms of robustness Bitcoin is not in the same league.
In terms of decentralization Bitcoin does shine, but it's no more decentralized than say, BitTorrent or Tor.
I'm not criticizing Bitcoin, just pointing out that the statement is absurd. The reason I'm responding this way is because I think it's harmful to see Bitcoin as a super complex software system that only a few elite developers can understand. There's nothing particularly novel about the way the Bitcoin software works. It's not breaking any new ground in terms of peer to peer networking or cryptography. All the techniques it uses already existed and are well understood. The novelty of Bitcoin was bringing together these techniques in a new an interesting way.

However, British politicians felt justified in blaming Russia mere hours after the incident. My only question is, when did politicians become the authority on matters of chemical weapons investigation?
The thing that really annoys me about all of this is that, by going off half-cocked, the British government has put the real investigation into serious jeopardy. If evidence were to come to light which implicated anyone *other* than Russia, the investigators would be put into an impossible position where they would have to either seriously embarrass the British government + ~20 other governments around the world, or bury the evidence to save face.

The misunderstanding here is that "distributed" and "decentralized" are not synonymous. That may be true under one interpretation of the word "decentralized", but if you take "decentralized" to mean 'not under the control of a single entity', then the innovation of the Blockchain is apparent.
So, if you take a decentralized blockchain, and put it into the control of a single entity, it ceases to be decentralized in the Blockchain sense, and becomes merely decentralized in the distributed sense.

Is that necessarily true? Given that the index is very likely longer than the original data, finding the index of the index is harder than finding the original data. Not only that but you'd have to store the length of the index as well. Now your index to the index is longer than the index, which itself is longer than the original data.
One idea I had was differential coding. Eg you store the full index to the first chunk of data, but then for successive chunks you store the offset from the previous index. I didn't get very far down that line of thinking but it might help to reduce the size of indexes.

That's only an issue when you value currency A in terms of currency B. In another post you said *"When I say stable I know that a 10k payment given to me in USD is still worth 10k USD"*. A 10k BTC payment is still worth 10k BTC no matter what the dollar value fluctuation is. My point is that when both your upstream and downstreams are also priced in BTC, you don't really need to care what the dollar value of BTC is. Volatility is only an issue when you need to exchange.

Satoshi sure didn't anticipate a lot of things - ASICS &amp; pool mining for starters. Those things have undoubtedly changed the mechanics of the system. He would have anticipated everyone being able to mine a small amount of Bitcoin on their CPU, making fee rewards less important for longer. At the risk of being labelled a "big blocker", I also don't think he anticipated the block size cap becoming a factor in the growth of fees.

There is no global definition of invalid or invalid - such a thing could only be dictated by a central authority.
Each party in the network has their own understanding of what is valid. Miners express this when they decide which blocks to build upon and which to ignore. This is the mechanism in which consensus is measured - and if mining were sufficiently decentralized among nodes it would also be an effective way to measure consensus among the community of peers. However since the majority of nodes are *non mining*, they are not represented in the consensus mechanism as designed.
We can discuss the drawbacks and issues of miner centralization and how that affects consensus measurement. The fact that Bitcoins consensus mechanism no longer measures the will of the community but only of half a dozen Chinese guys. But we can't pretend there's some other reliable way of measuring consensus.

Satoshi is describing a scenario in which one miner is trying to do something that all other miners consider invalid. He does not touch upon the quite different scenario where the overwhelming majority of miners start to extend a chain with different rules. In Satoshis Bitcoin (where every node was a miner), the latter scenario would have been a non-event in terms of network operation.
I haven't made the claim that "miners decide consensus rules" - I've only said that they decide for themselves which chain to build upon and in doing so expressing their own preference. When we see a single dominant chain we can see that obviously the majority of mining nodes have reached a consensus on which chain to extend, otherwise there would be multiple chains.
We have no such reliable way to observe any such consensus that might exist among non-mining nodes. Because they do not extend their preferred chain, they have no way of expressing what their preferences are.
I'm not saying that Bitcoins consensus model is perfect, secure or even good. All I'm saying is that it's clearly designed to reach consensus among mining nodes - which in Satoshis Bitcoin, was all nodes.

First of all, thank you for engaging in good faith conversation - something I was struggling to get out of &amp; something I find increasingly difficult to find on this sub.
Obviously my standpoint on this is not based solely on one sentence from the whitepaper. But even if it was, I don't see that the point you're making contradicts mine. If a miner is able to 51% attack the network, he's not forcing the other miners to consider his chain valid - they would still refuse to build on top of his blocks (since they are invalid from their point of view) wouldn't they? The 51% attack is a special case where the attacker is able to build the longest chain in spite of the fact that only he consideres his blocks valid. But longest chain is only relevent to those who aren't validating &amp; deciding which chain to extend.

Yes that's right, companies like Coinbase and Bitpay exist and operate in the real world. Not within some utopian libertarian fantasy. It's precisely because they've chosen to comply with the constraints and regulations of the real world that many people have had the confidence to use their services and enter the Bitcoin ecosystem.


A lot of Bitcoins current popularity and value is directly attributable to companies like Coinbase, Bitpay and others. Had these companies never existed, I'm convinced the value of Bitcoin today would be no more than a few hundred dollars. On the plus side, there would be far fewer users and we wouldn't be having this scaling debate, as blocks would be nowhere near full.

There's a lot of variables here so any estimate is going to be very rough, but I would say the absolute theoretical maximum would be somewhere in the range of 392MB. The throughput of a 5Mbps (downstream) connection is roughly 393.22MB every 10 minutes, which is the average frequency of blocks on the Bitcoin network. That's assuming you run your node in [blocks only mode]( so it doesn't relay any transactions, it's just the absolute bare minimum for your node to stay synced with the blockchain.
That would put your monthly download somewhere in the region of 1.7TB - many data plans have caps smaller than this.
It also means your 2TB hard drive would fill up in around 35 days.
That's also not taking into consideration the limitations of the RPi's CPU - which may not be able to validate a 392MB block in under 10 minutes (I have no idea).
Of course most people don't run their nodes in blocks only mode. When relaying transactions the bandwidth requirements would be much higher, and thus the maximum block size would be **far far** lower.
**EDIT** Downvoters please explain, is my math wrong?

My facts are completely consistent. Antpool used to mine more empty blocks than anyone else, until about April 2016. That was "many months" ago, 18 in fact. What is ambiguous about that?


I'm not, I don't give a shit about Antpool. But I am very concerned that the Bitcoin community seems to want to turn important Bitcoin figures and businesses into enemies, and that is especially concerning when it is based on false or outdated information, as it usually is.


Agreed, there was a period in 2015 &amp; early 2016 where it did look like they were using Asicboost.


I don't think so, there has been no discernible change in Antpools behaviour since Segwit activation.


I reject the notion that there are "sides". Many tribalistic people on these forums try to reduce this whole debate down to "good guys vs bad guys" - it's nothing so peurile and simplistic. Also when you say "your futile persistence", it implies I have some sort of agenda. My only agenda is to do whatever I can to help the Bitcoin community debate respectfully based on good information. For that reason I wont join witch hunts against important bitcoin businesses.

Satoshi didn't *mine* the genesis block. It had to be hand crafted, and hard coded into the client. Mining started at block 2.
That pedantic point aside, I think it depends how the pre-mine is done. In the first days of Bitcoin, anyone was *able* to mine, it's just that nobody did besides Satoshi because they hadn't heard about the project. Some altcoins run premines where other people are simply *unable* to mine even if they want to. This is where things get scammy.

This confusion between block weight and payload size continues to be a frustrating source of misinformation.
An 8MB Segwit2x block would actually not represent "max capacity" *at all*, since the only way to build a 8MB block is to include a single transaction with 7.999MB of signature data. Obviously this would drop the network throughput to 1 transaction every 10 minutes - hardly max capacity.
To maximize transaction throughput, given an ideal selection of transactions, the block size would actually be closer to 4-4.5MB. The same is true of Segwit1x obviously with the numbers halved.
In a way it's unfortunate that block weight is measured in bytes, as it's a source of confusion for non-technical people. Although it is a good way to identify people whose technical understanding is lacking.

There can be no doubt that without the likes of Coinbase and Bitpay, Bitcoin would still be little more than a novelty, a toy played with by neckbeards buying 10,000BTC pizzas. Or worse, still primarily used for illicit black market trading. Coinbase were and continue to be instrumental in giving hundreds of thousands of people an on-ramp into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitpay have been instrumental in giving those Bitcoins a real world practical use - and therefore value. Y'know, back when merchant adoption was considered important.

Well that's my whole point - the protocol and the reference implementation should absolutely not be the same thing. No other open protocol I'm aware of is tied so intimately with a single implementation. As I said the governance model of open protocols is completely different to software projects. With software projects it's common and healthy to have a single person or BDFL leading the project. But this cannot be the case for an open protocol. This leaves Core in an awkward position between two well established governance models.
I'm aware of the reasons cited against multiple implementations and frankly I don't buy them. It sounds like people say we shouldn't have multiple implementations because it's a little bit hard. Well yes it is hard, and?

You could even argue that these people are working against the natural spirit of the system\*. The true beauty of Bitcoin, the thing that drew me to it in the first place, is that it takes one of the darker aspects of the human spirit - greed - and turns it into something great.
For that reason I'm immediately suspicious of anyone acting altruistically. Because whilst greedy people are consistently greedy, altruistic people are inconsistently altruistic.
\* *I'm not actually making this argument, as I still believe the core devs are basically acting out of self-interest. It's well known that elite software engineers value prestige and "interesting technology" above the size of their pay packet. It may be that the fundamental design of Bitcoin was wrong to assume that greed would always manifest in terms of money and power.*

That link has nothing to do with Segwit2x. You seem very confused about all this.
Segwit2x is a fork proposal brought forward by Barry Silbert of Digital Currency Group, and agreed to by around 50 Bitcoin companies. The development team is pretty much Jeff Garzik. They're both getting a lot of heat on this sub, rightly or wrongly.
Bitcoin Unlimited is one of 3 main clients for Bitcoin Cash - a fork championed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. They're also getting a lot of heat on this sub, rightly or wrongly.

Did you miss the quote in my post? Here it is again.






Apparently I need to spell it out for you. *"Is it really"*, is present tense, meaning now. When you answered "yes" to the question *"Is it really [owned by Roger Ver]"*, you told a lie. You then tried to cover your lie by claiming you meant Roger Ver owned blockchain.info back in 2012. But that would have been an answer to a different question - *"Was it really [owned by Roger Ver]"* - past tense. More than that, the incident you're talking about wasn't even the context of the conversation.
You are a liar and you got called out on it. Accept it, and be better in the future.


If you think I'm in Roger Vers camp you're sorely mistaken, and a cursory glance over my post history will confirm that to anyone. What I do object to is liars like you spreading bullshit and poisoning the Bitcoin community with your misinformation.

In the design of Ethereum the difficulty adjusts every block. This means that in the event of a hard fork, the minority chain is viable for mining almost immediately. Just one block later the difficulty will adjust and it will be back to its usual block cadence. This resulted in Ethereum Classic.
In the design of Bitcoin, difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks. This means that in the event of a hard fork, the minority chain will have to mine 2016 blocks before the difficulty adjusts. Depending on how little hash rate the minority chain has, that could take literally years, during which time the transactional capacity of the minority chain will be decimated. This gives enough incentive for everyone to acquiesce &amp; abandon the minority chain.
This is the fundamentally important mechanism which ensures there is only one dominant chain. As I said, Bitcoin Cash was only able to survive by circumventing this design with their emergency difficulty adjustments.

Wow, no wonder you troll the place so hard! So if we take that number at face value, it still seems that you can't associate jstolfi with 99% of people on that sub. As you said, their tenet is that they want the price to grow exponentially, and they want to get rich by speculating on greater fools entering the scheme in the future.
Jorge Stolfi on the other hand, actively tries to harm Bitcoin. He wants the price to drop to zero, and he strongly believes that it will. It would be very counter-productive for 99% of the "ponzi schemers" in rbtc to align themselves with his views &amp; actions.
I think you try to associate jstolfi with rbtc in order to damage its reputation. But the fact is that he's an enemy of both sides of the community - both the "enlightened missionaries" in rbitcoin, and the "ponzi schemers" in rbtc.

It makes total sense that they'd both be heavy posters on rbtc - because that's where the battle lines are. rbtc is like the [Château d'Hougoumont]( of the Bitcoin world, the focal point where two opposing forces meet. The conflict is on the other sub because the moderation policy there allows for it, even encourages it. Hell, you yourself are one of the combatants, with 298 posts there and only 77 here.

I'm predicting no more than a 1.5x increase a year from now. I hope I'm proven wrong.

That is not clear *at all*. This happened in Ethereum because the difficulty adjusts so quickly. In Bitcoin the minority chain would be completely unusable for a long period of time, as there wouldn't be enough hash power to mine blocks. Only extremely stubborn people would stick with it, it's extremely likely that the minority chain would disappear very quickly.
I realise people said the same thing about Ethereum, but they were mistaken. They took their knowledge of Bitcoin and applied it to Ethereum, failing to take into account Ethereums much quicker difficulty adjustment.

I could not agree more. A simple block size increase is not a long term solution, but it is a short term solution. A lot of people are of the opinion that we need extra capacity right now, blocks are full and it's having a negative effect on the network now, today. The opportunity cost of waiting months/years for the ultimate solution is huge.
FWIW, I don't think anyone has been arguing in favour of larger blocks just for the sake of larger blocks. It's always been about tx/s.


Again, I completely agree. But if we don't do something in the short term, we might not have a long term to think about.
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:21:58


Can you explain how you worked that out? SegWit will **maybe** give us 1.5x capacity a year from now. When the network was growing unhindered, transaction rate was roughly doubling every year. So SegWit will never "tide the network over". As a scaling solution, SegWit is too little, too late.
That's not to say it isn't worthwhile, I'm totally in favour of it for its other benefits. But it should not be presented as a scaling solution, not even a short term one.

@_date: 2016-10-12 16:53:01
This is completely untrue. The block size limit is **still 1MB**, but there is an **additional 3MB for witness data**. That witness data can be moved into the extra 3MB gives an **effective potential block size of roughly 1.7MB**. But it's worth pointing out that it wont be increased to 1.7MB immediately, it's dependent on virtually every piece of software in the Bitcoin ecosystem to update - a complex &amp; time consuming process. 1.7MB is the best case scenario that will likely never come to fruition. If we're lucky we'll get an effective 1.5MB block size in about a years time.

@_date: 2016-10-24 06:39:51


Precisely, this is where the frustration stems from. I think most reasonable big blockers are not *against* off chain scaling so much as they are against prioritizing it over a short term relieving of the network, which is working at its limits &amp; hindering adoption.
Personally, I want to see SegWit. I want Lightning Network, I want Schnorr signatures. I want to see bigger blocks, like yesterday. I want Bitcoin demand and adoption to be such that we're necessarily talking about 100MB blocks, not squabbling about 1MB vs 2MB - that's loser talk.

Where did you get "a few million" lines from? That sounds like a number plucked out of thin air. I cloned the [Lightning Protocol Reference Implementation]( and it has fewer than 180,000 lines of code. Try it yourself...
    git clone  lightning &amp;&amp; cd lightning
    git ls-files | xargs cat | wc -l
Incidentally that number includes non-code like readme and license files.


I assume you're talking about SegWit. I hope SegWit does get activated on the network, lord knows we could use the extra capacity. Calling it a "massive expansion" is a huge exaggeration though. I think you know this. There is also the issue that it currently doesn't have sufficient miner support to get activated, which I mentioned in my original reply to OP.

My post was *mostly* tongue-in-cheek - apologies if I was unclear.
I agree with you that *"segwit enables is to spend bandwidth rather than RAM"*, that's a nice way of putting it. The cost of an ever increasing UTXO set is [apparent on both sides]( as I'm sure you know.
Still, a lot of the flak that the big blockers got was due in no small part to the increase in bandwidth requirements, and the increased mining centralization that would consequently follow. In hindsight I think most of it was unfair.

There's a lot of mystery regarding that incident. The Russians who were killed were contractors (mercenaries) who worked for a company called Wagner. Most estimates were around 20-30 casualties.
It's interesting that Russia quietly buried that incident. In stark contrast to the pilot who was killed when Turkey downed the Russian jet - he was heralded as a hero. I guess that's the advantage of using contractors to do dirty work - deniability. The US does this too. Anyway, knowing that the Russians would never contest it, Pompeo was free to exaggerate as much as he liked. I guess we'll never know the truth.

Everything is contentious now :(
I think you're mistaken about the split. Bitcoin is not Ethereum. With Bitcoin the difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, unlike Ethereum where it adjusts very quickly. This means that in the event of a Bitcoin hard fork, the minority chain would essentially be crippled for a long, long time, as there wouldn't be enough hash power to mine the 2016 blocks needed to reduce the difficulty.
People talk about Bitcoin splitting into two as though it's an absolutely certainty. That's really not true, and quite unhelpful.

They are both right. In order to transact with a 3rd party, Bitcoin does not require you to trust that party at all.

I completely agree. We know that, once you have a synced node, it's very straightforward to [limit your nodes bandwidth consumption]( to manageable levels. We also know that storage is very cheap, but we also have the option of pruning if necessary. The trouble is getting to the point of having a synced node in the first place, and the biggest barrier to that is the initial block download. UTXO committments would hugely reduce IBD and make it easy to run nodes.
Under those conditions I think a reasonable block limit increase ought to be relatively uncontroversial, having no ill effect other than a small percentage of nodes going into blocks-only mode. It would help to avoid fee spirals like December 2017, at least until LN reaches maturity.
_I realise I'm explaining things you probably already know, but hopefully this is useful for others._

We know for a fact that Trump warned Russia about the location of the airstrikes in April last year. There are communication lines set up specifically for this purpose (they're called "deconfliction channels"). There's no reason to think he wouldn't do it this time. As he said, the purpose was to punish Syria, not start a hot war with Russia.
Interestingly, if Russia wanted a war, all they had to do was leave a dozen Russian servicemen at the strike locations. 12 coffins returning home would have been all the justification they needed for war, if that's what they wanted.
So, we can be reassured that both the US and Russia are actively trying to avoid war, despite what the newspapers would have you believe about either of them.

Good analogy, I think maybe we have some common understanding in that context (web developer for 10+ years here).
So when I think about scaling in a web context two things spring to mind:
* Vertical scaling - increasing the resources on your existing web servers eg. more RAM, bigger CPU, more bandwidth etc. You could say this is similar to the bigger blocks strategy in Bitcoin.
* Horizontal scaling - increasing the *number* of web servers and load balancing between them. You could say this is (roughly) similar to sidechains/off chain solutions in Bitcoin.
Vertical scaling is a quick &amp; easy, but short term solution that will only take you so far. Horizontal scaling is a far better solution but often requires re-architecting the application, so it's a much longer and more difficult process. This also has parallels to what's going on in Bitcoin today.
It sounds like the definition you're using is more a case of optimizing your website code to make better use of the available resources, reducing cost-to-serve and increasing maximum requests/second.
That would be true of Bitcoin if we had found a way to fit *more* transactions into the existing 1MB blocks, but that's not the case afaik? None of the optimizations of the Bitcoin code have resulted in more transactions fitting in a block. Even though the network is running more efficiently than it did a few years ago, the capacity has not changed.
Lets say you had some funky web server which limited you to 100 requests/second, no matter what. It doesn't matter how much you optimize your code, you're never going to serve more than 100 requests/second. It's an arbitrary constraint, not a technical constraint.
I can't help wondering how much these little ambiguities in terminology contribute to the strife in the Bitcoin community.

0-conf has always been risky, but for low value payments like a coffee it was usually an acceptable risk. When blocks weren't full you could be pretty confident that the transaction was going to confirm within the next 10 minutes or so.
With full blocks that's no longer the case, so 0-conf is way more risky than it used to be. You can't be certain that a tx will confirm within the next few *days*, let alone minutes. Hell you can't be certain that a tx will confirm **ever**.

One of those facilities is only 6 miles from the scene of the crime. Bit of a coincidence?
Facts which have been confirmed by the OPCW:
* The agent used was Novichok - a type which was developed in the Soviet Union.

You speak as though that's a foregone conclusion, it is not by any means. You're betting the kingdom on wishful thinking, it's incredibly reckless.
There's really no point continuing this conversation, there's nothing I can say that's going to dissuade you from your dogma. The only point I can make is that if you think you're going to get majority support through the use of threats and coercion you are wrong. Dead wrong.

That's a great write up and I completely agree with your assessment. I would only add that those people who are pushing for BIP148 don't represent the "off chain" camp in its entirety, but only a small subset of it.

I don't see how you can claim that Bitcoin has scaled, unless we have a different definition of scaling. Yes miners self imposed a soft limit - that has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol. The maximum **possible** tx/s of the Bitcoin network has been consistent ever since Satoshi introduced the 1MB hard limit.
The increase in transaction volume *up to* that limit is not scaling, it's increased usage of the available capacity. The capacity itself has not changed.
Anyway, I think maybe we only disagree on semantics. I don't share all of the views of the big block crowd, but I do share their sense of urgency. The blocks are full, the network is at its limits. Therefore it's frustrating for me to see people saying things like "blocks are not full" or "it has scaled".

I don't dispute that. That's not what I said. The point I'm making is that SegWit achieves backward compatibility by means of transaction outputs simply not being validated by nodes which have not upgraded. Do you dispute this on a technical level?

I have to respectfully disagree with you on that point. Bitcoin is a system run *by* and *for* humans, as such socio-economic factors are just as important as technical factors. Bitcoin cleverly supplants those factors where humans fall short - eg. honesty, but it doesn't eliminate the human element altogether. The incentive structure for example imposes upon the human proclivity toward greed, a concept which is alien to machines.


You're right, I can only hope that the people on the receiving end of the vitriol see it the same way.

I do see where you're coming from, but so much has been said about the necessity of miner voting over the years. People who's opinions I trust and respect have made it absolutely clear that making consensus changes without miner support is dangerous ([example]( A number of good proposals have been rejected by prominent Core developers entirely *because* they lacked a miner voting mechanism. By asking me to support UASF, you're asking me to say that those Core developers I respect were wrong all this time. I'm not prepared to do that.
Alternatively you're asking me to believe that the playing field has changed to such an extent that those expert opinions are effectively invalidated. I don't believe that's the case either. Mining today is just as much of an arms race between self-interested, profit-seeking entities as it ever was. The fact that one entity seems to be winning at the moment is neither here nor there.

I want SegWit as much as anyone, and I could get on board with BIP-148 if it were based on reason and sound engineering rationale. But it's not, it's a movement born out of frustration, and all this hysterical zealotry kills it dead in the water for me. August 1st is going to be a disaster, the only thing that will prevent it is if people drop BIP-148 like the primed hand grenade it is.

Ah yes I see what you mean. It's always tempting to throw off the shackles of backward-compatibility, I don't know any dev that prefers brown-field development over green-field. I think that's why it's so important to minimize as much as possible the amount of technical debt accumulating in the software. In traditional software development it's often sales or customers asserting pressure that leads to quick solutions rather than correct solutions, and thus technical debt. In Bitcoin the pressures are quite different but no less real.

Well, that sounds like fundamental issue with Bitcoins security model then. Miners have absolutely no obligation whatsoever to do *"the right thing by the community"*.

Yeah I have started reducing my exposure to Bitcoin. I've been holding since 2013, held steady through Gox, Hearnia, Finex etc. But 170k transactions in the backlog? Time to start thinking.


Nope, not really. Personally I think if Bitcoin fails than all cryptocurreny will go into a dark age which could last 5 years or more. There might be an opportunity to make money on alts as Bitcoin slides, but you'd have to time the market perfectly. Too risky, certainly no less risky than just holding the Bitcoin anyway.

If Bitcoin fees continue to rise, and transaction backlogs continue to get longer, then there **is** a point in the future where it becomes less efficient than WU. There are two ways this can be avoided:
* The community finds a way to end this stupid scaling debate (very unlikely)
* More and more people stop using Bitcoin (already starting to happen).

Yes they're following AML regulations voluntarily, as many exchanges do. There are many good reasons to do this.
If you're going to do something which might look a little bit suspicious (such as a large deposit which is inconsistent with your previous usage patterns), it's usually worthwhile to engage with the exchange beforehand, then they can follow their due diligence procedures before the transaction is flagged up as suspicious.

It's not that simple with SegWit. SegWit segregates blocks into two different segments - the tx data and the witness data. The tx data is still 1MB, the same as block today. But the witness data can be moved into the additional segment. In the best case scenario that gives a transaction increase of about 1.6 to 2.0 times current.

If there's a prolonged chain split, as I suspect there will be, then fees will come down on both chains since neither chain will be running at capacity anymore. That's true with or without SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:56:07
Seems like it's worked pretty well so far. BIP9 dictated that SegWit would not activate until/unless it had support of 95% of the hash rate.
Segwit does not have support of 95% of the hash rate, and so it hasn't activated.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:13:54
So there will be two **competing** chains, and if one of them ever happens to win all the transactions on the losing chain get wiped out. That is nuts, it would be far better to just hard fork and have two entirely different chains with no perpetual threat of a reorg. At least a PoW change has that going for it.

If we had taken Satoshis advice and introduced a flag-day block size increase in 2010 - say 6 years into the future to activate in 2016, would that have been controversial at the time?

Right, you have the option of auditing the code if you so wish. You'd also have the option of validating forward from the genesis block instead of using a rolling snapshot, if you so wished.
Most people don't read the code before running Core. They have the option to, but they don't. I don't see how validating from a rolling snapshot with the option of validation from the genesis block is much different.

I think its inevitible that as Bitcoin grows and matures, it will shed off extreme elements who are not happy with the direction.

The biggest concern is that the inflated requirements in terms of bandwidth and data storage increase the burden on node operators and may force them to shut down their nodes.
This notion is predicated on the false idea that node operators must allow their nodes to consume as much bandwidth and data storage as they possibly can. In fact it's trivial for node operators to set limits on the amount of bandwidth their node uses, and the amount of disk space the blockchain needs. There are even detailed guides on bitcoin.org [explaining how to do it](
Ultimately a node operator can dedicate as much or as little bandwidth &amp; disk space to the Bitcoin network as they are able/willing to\*. So I think the claims that modestly bigger blocks will lead to masses of nodes shutting down is completely untrue.
\* *There is, obviously, a minimum limit to the amount of Bandwidth a Bitcoin node must consume. Currenly this is about 150 megabytes incoming data per day and about 1 megabyte of outgoing data per day.*
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:22:50
You can dedicate as much or as little bandwidth as you like to your Bitcoin node -  - certainly you aren't forced to give it unbounded bandwidth.
Storage space is also an insignificant concern. The real problem with larger blocks for me is the IBD (initial blockchain download) when starting up a new node. It's already problematic to download over 100GB to sync a node, and it's not getting any smaller. Bigger blocks expediate that problem.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:31:08
Even if you were on the mailing list back in 2008 it doesn't mean you would be sitting on a Bitcoin fortune right now.

So your defence of a long running chain split is that *one day* the original chain could be reorged away. However in the process all the transactions that occured on the original chain would be lost, causing people to lose potentially millions of dollars and confidence in Bitcoin as a currency to plummet. I would strongly suggest that a long running split chain eventually wiping out the original chain after a period of weeks/months would be **much more catastrophic** than a hard fork. If a chain split occurs and lasts more than a few blocks, it would be in everyones best interest if a reorg never happens - which essentially makes it a hard fork.

OK lets say for arguments sake that any money people may lose as a result of a reorg is entirely their own fault.
Do you think the headlines in the media will be any different? No, they will still sensationalize it - I can see it now... *"Bitcoin splits in two"*; *"Thousands of Bitcoiners lose $millions in Bitcoin catastrophe"*.

If Jihan commanded that much of the hash power we would have hard forked to BU by now, with the resulting chaos that would have caused.


Yes it is evidence that 'a group' controls 80% of the hashing power. That's a statement which cannot be false. I think you're being quite loose with the word "cartel" here. How big does the 'group' have to be before it's no longer a cartel? Or is it less about the size of the group and more the fact that they appear to be cooperating with eachother?

If I understand your argument right, you're saying that even a modest increase in block size increases the burden on those people running full nodes, in terms of bandwidth and data storage.
What you haven't mentioned is that node operators can contribute as much or as little bandwidth and storage as they can/want. They are in no way forced to allow their node to consume as much bandwidth &amp; disk space as it possibly can. It is trivial to set limits on both - there are even detailed guides on bitcoin.org explaining how to [limit the amount of bandwidth your node uses]( and how to [limit the amount of data storage your node needs](

Yeah this is a very good point, I hadn't considered that. Ethereum could well end up with a community even more at war with itself than Bitcoins. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
I think we all need to remember that cryptocurrencies are experimental. For all we know, it could be that all coins inevitibly self-implode into conflict &amp; strife once they reach a certain point. For a coin to reach past that point, maybe there's a missing part of the puzzle that hasn't been imagined yet. Or maybe it's just blind luck.

Expecting a miner to do something which benefits everyone except themselves is pretty much the opposite of the way mining is supposed to work.

It's not that I'm unwilling, it's that you haven't made a convincing argument.
Yes, transactions which don't pay the minimum relay fee are filtered out and are not included in the mempool. We agree on that. Can you accept that the outcome of that filtering is that such transactions cannot possibly be used to "spam" the network or push any kind of agenda, as OP claims?
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:47:59
I agree with everything you've said there. No doubt that Bitcoin was the first to face these problems. However that doesn't necessarily mean it will be the first to overcome these problems. As you say Ethereum has recently started to touch on its current scaling ceiling, as Bitcoin did a year ago. However while Bitcoin had a years head-start against Ethereum, it also has a divided community which seems to paralyse progress. I don't believe that's true to the same extent for the Ethereum community. The race is now to see which coin can show that it's capable of growing. Bitcoin needs to show that it can make *some kind of* progress, whether that be Segwit, a modest 2MB block size increase, or whatever.

Without miners there is no Blockchain. For better or worse, that reason alone means miners have all the power.
This isn't a problem in an of itself, but the problem arises when that power is concentrated into fewer and fewer hands.
My hope is/was that Bitcoins ever-increasing value would attract new players into mining and counter-balance the natural tendancy toward centralization. For that reason I've been alarmed by Bitcoin reaching its capacity limits, especially given the historical correlation between transaction volume and price.
I sincerely hope that there are companies out there right now looking to enter the mining industry and compete with the likes of Bitmain. I have no ill-feeling toward Bitmain as is common in the sub, but at the same time I hope they get some stiff competition and soon.

I don't necessarily disagree with that. I am not one of the obsessives you speak of. My original post was simply countering the argument that 2MB or 4MB blocks would force hundreds or thousands of nodes to shut down, nothing more.

You can set limits on the amount of bandwidth a node consumes, you don't have to give it unbounded bandwidth. See 
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:26:05
I'm not too sure what you're talking about anymore. It sounds like we're in agreement that transactions with a fee below the minimum relay fee are unreasonable and should be filtered out, which they are.
It follows then that those transactions that remain, which are explicitly allowed into the mempool by paying more than the minimum relay fee, are valid, legitimate transactions. You simply cannot "spam" the network with these transactions.
Are you making the case that the minimum relay fee should be massively increased?
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:27:08
There is a lower bound, obviously. If I was to run a node with just a couple of inbound connections, in blocks only mode, the bandwidth consumed would be relatively minimal. Am I wrong?

I agree with everything you've said there, it's certainly true that decentralization is the main factor that differentiates Bitcoin from existing centralized systems. However I would disagree that Bitcoins decentralization should be preserved at **all costs**. If decentralization comes at the cost of utility, then Bitcoin is useless and it's decentralization is of little relevence. Instead we need to find a balance between utility and decentralization, such that Bitcoin can fulfill the needs which are met by existing centralized systems, without itself becoming centralized.
* 100% utility and 0% decentralization = VISA/MASTERCARD etc
* 100% decentralization and 0% utility = a perfectly pointless Bitcoin network
Of course talking about utility leads us onto another question, utility for who? For whom are we trying to make Bitcoin useful?

Unwanted by who, why? What authority gets to decide which transactions are wanted and which transactions are unwanted?
In reality there is only one kind of "unwanted" transaction\* - those that do not pay the minimum relay fee. And it's impossible to spam the network with those since they are not relayed or added to the mempool.
If you look back at OP's graph, we can say objectively that none of those transactions are spam. Zero, according to the Bitcoin reference client.

That wasn't unforseen by any means. Many people, such as myself, loudly argued that 95% was far too high, for precisely the reason you mention.

The parameters of BIP141 were such that anyone in control of 5% of the hash rate had a "cockblocking" share. There are at least 8 different mining pools who have/had the power to block Segwit alone. I heavily criticized the 95% threshold at the time as it gave a tiny minority veto power.
Under those conditions it was almost inevitible that Segwit would not activate.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:44:48

Too low for what? One cannot be sure what fee is required to get a transaction confirmed. You could broadcast a transaction with a very low fee, then three weeks later the mempool empties and your transaction gets confirmed.
Besides which, I said *reasonable fee*. How do we define "reasonable"? Well, Bitcoin Core defines it for us with its default minimum relay fee (




So, transactions with an unreasonable fee are filtered out and aren't event propogated across the network, therefore it's impossible to "spam" the network with them. Any transaction with a fee greater than or equal to the minimum relay fee has a chance of being confirmed.

Luckily everything points to Segwit2x being a roaring success - 91% hash rate support as of today.
When you take a step back and look at the big picture it all seems kind of obvious:
* One side with ~45% supports Segwit. Extreme fringe elements accuse the other side of attempting to take over the network.
* Another side with ~45% supports EC. Extreme fringe elements accuse the other side of attempting to take over the network.
* A proposed compromise between the two sides has ~90% support. Go figure. Extreme fringe elements from both sides accuse them of attempting to take over the network.

Absolutely agree. Whilst we should do everything possible to prevent a schism right down the middle of Bitcoin, I don't think we should be too worried about a few percent deciding to fork off and do their own thing from time to time.

Utility for whom? A functioning censorship resistent ledger with $1000 transaction fees has little utility for the average Joe, but is just fine as a settlement system between banks.
In the early days of Bitcoin anything and everything seemed possible. But now we're reaching the point where we as a community have to start saying 'no' to things. And every time we say no, some elements of the community will be disappointed and may choose to split away to persue their own ideals. I think that's inevitable and healthy.

@_date: 2017-07-12 11:00:41
BIP148 rejects any blocks that do not *signal* support for Segwit. In order for Segwit to actually activate, 95% of the preceeding 2048 blocks need to be signalling Segwit. This means that the BIP148 chain needs to be extended by at least 1916 blocks before Segwit activates.
Given that the BIP148 chain will have a tiny amount of hash rate, it will likely take a very long time to mine 1916 blocks at the current difficulty - perhaps months. However, Segwit activation times out in November. If the BIP148 chain cannot mine 1916 blocks *before* Segwit times out, it will not activate Segwit - ever.
At the current difficulty, in order to mine 1916 blocks before Segwit times out, the BIP148 chain would need roughly 12-15% of the current network hash rate. Today it has 1.6%.
It's astounding how many BIP148 zealots are not aware of this.

There *are* bugs in Bitcoin Core, discovered and undiscovered. Bugs are an inevitible part of software development, you can take steps to reduce their number, or mitigate their effects, but you cannot eliminate them.
Given that, a homogenous network where something like 98% of the nodes on the network run software derived from the same codebase should be terrifying. A heterogenous network with multiple ground-up implementations of a common protocol would be **far** more resiliant.
Core have done a frankly astounding job of minimizing the occurance of bugs in the reference client up to this point. But be assured - bugs will get through..

Signalling support for SegWit is not the same as signalling support for BIP148.
SegWit proper has a sensible activation method which requires 95% hash rate consensus, which virtually eliminates the risk of a chain split.
BIP148 on the other hand recklessly tries to force the activation of SegWit without any kind of measurable consensus. As things stand it's guaranteed to split the chain. When the chain split occurs, it will be solely the fault of all those idiots who chose to run incompatible software to the rest of the network and forked themselves away from the main chain. That they try to blame everyone else for the chain split is beyond ridiculous. It's time we started calling these people what they are - hostile.

Well, for an objective view we could look at the recipients of the [Turing award]( which is widely regarded as the "Nobel Prize of computing".
* 2016 - Tim Berners-Lee
* 2015 - Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman
* 2014 - Michael Stonebraker
* 2013 - Leslie Lamport
* 2012 - Shafi Goldwasser, Silivo Micali
* 2011 - Judea Pearl
* 2010 - Leslie Valiant
* 2009 - Charles Thacker
* 2008 - Barbara Liskov
* 2007 - Edmunde Clarke, Allan Emerson, Joseph Sifakis
* 2006 - Fran Allen
* 2005 - Peter Naur
* 2004 - Vint Cerf, Bob Khan
* 2003 - Alan Kay
* 2002 - Len Adleman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir
* 2001 - Ole-Johan Dahl, Kristen Nygaard
* 2000 - Andrew Yao
In addition to the Turing Award you could also look at the winners of [other well respected awards]( such as the [Ada Lovelace Award]( [The John Von Neumann Medal]( The [Grace Hopper Award]( or many others.
If you're asking who I personally believe are the best (living) programmers in the world? I would certainly include the following:
* Donald Knuth
* Alan Kay
* Tony Hoare
* Barbara Liskov
If we include deceased people I'd add Grace Hopper in there too.

I know they're very good developers, don't get me wrong I'm not denying that at all. But come on seriously... "world's top developers" is a ridiculous claim.

I'm referring to BIP148 and the chain split it's certainly going to cause on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:57:57


No, SegWit activation expires in November. The BIP148 chain needs at least 15% hash rate to activate SegWit before it times out. At the moment BIP148 has 0.3%.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:24:13


Oh wow, you've really over-played your hand on this one.
From what I've seen the exact opposite is true. Most BIP148 zealots have a very limited understanding of how Bitcoin works, and/or cannot have much/any skin in the game if they're so willing to put the entire network at risk.
As far as I can see most BIP148 supporters are kids who bought hook, line &amp; sinker into ridiculous conspiracy theories and have deluded themselves into thinking they're part of some noble crusade to save Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:52:32


Indeed, this is given from the fact that non-segwit signalling blocks are rejected. As soon as a non-signalling block is mined, the BIP148 chain will split from the main chain.


Thanks for the correction :)

SegWit does not introduce any additional data. If a SegWit block is 3MB in size, it's because it contains 3MB worth of transaction data. The same transactions would have taken 3 1MB blocks.
Because SegWit has limits on weight as well as size, in practice we'll be likely to see maximum 2MB blocks with SegWit. 4MB SegWit blocks will never be seen under real world conditions.
Some people keep repeating this idea that SegWit increases data size by 4x but only increases transaction throughput by 1.7x. If that were true, SegWit would have to be adding a significant amount of extra data. Nobody who repeats this myth can explain what that extra data is - because it doesn't exist.

I know.


Like I said, I'm reducing my exposure to Bitcoin in line with the increasing risk.
I will not be threatened into supporting BIP148 under any circumstances. A bitcoin that can be changed by threats is not valuable to me.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:21:40
Some examples:
**"Roger Vermin"**
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
**"Jihad Wu"**
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
And those are all from just one individual. There are many, many more examples. I'm not singling out rbitcoin, the other sub is much worse, but my point is that the entire Bitcoin community on Reddit is seriously dysfunctional.

On August 1st those people running the BIP148 client will start rejecting blocks that do not **signal** support for Segwit.
Segwit requires 95% of the preceding 2016 blocks to be signalling SegWit in order to activate. Obviously after August 1st all blocks on the BIP148 chain will be signalling SegWit, so actually Segwit should activate after 1916 continuous block (happy to be corrected on this).
The trouble is, the BIP148 chain will have a tiny amount of hash rate (0.3% at the current time). That means it will take a very long time to mine each block. Segwit activation expires in November, if it's not activated by then it will simply not activated.
In order for the Bip148 chain to mine enough blocks to activate Segwit before it expires in November, it needs roughly 12-15% of the current hash rate.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:30:48
In the immediate term I think the transaction backlog would grow and fees would increase as everyone scrambles to move their coins into SegWit capable addresses.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:40:29


Do you know how long it's going to take to reach a difficulty adjustment when you have a tiny fraction of the hash power?
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:17:42
As things stand, there is going to be a chain split, that is an absolute certainty. The only question is how long it lasts.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:02:30
Is it good for the users?

The elephant in the room, and the thing not mentioned in this article, is that altcoin holders will be laughing all the way to the bank throughout this whole calamity.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:28:45
There is already a tx size limit.

Agreed. So then we each find we must make a decision.
Those people who choose to support BIP148 do so for ideological reasons, and I respect their ideology. But it does not alter the reality that their chain will not get significant support.
For me... I am old, I have a family to support, I do not have the luxury of being ideological. I will not play roulette with my family's wealth\* and jeopardize their future. I will choose the less risky option. For this reason I support the NY agreement, and it's also for this reason that I am gradually reducing my Bitcoin holdings leading up to August 1st.
\* at least, not any more than I am already. Holding Bitcoin is a gamble in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:41:22
They account for less than 7% of the hash rate. Still not enough!
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:27:54


The threat is in the inevitable chain split and the damage it will do to Bitcoin as a whole, I think this is obvious.


When UASF was first getting off the ground, UASF supporters used to talk a lot about the "economic majority". Well, the economic majority clearly chose the New York agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:17:44
Completely agree. The great irony about this **user** activated soft fork is that only the miners will determine whether it's a success or not.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:22:43


Leaders in a small field, sure.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:21:20
If you hate miners so much, perhaps Bitcoin isn't for you? Maybe try a proof-of-stake coin?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:30:23
I simply do not see the basis for your certainty. There is absolutely no guarantee that BIP148 coin will be more valuable than the so called "legacy" coin.
I understand the arguments you're making, but I don't understand how you can arrive at such certitude. It seems like wishful thinking.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:54:07
POW change is a different topic. I believe RickC138 was asking if GPU mining would be viable on the BIP148 chain.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:08:49
There isn't one as far as I know, but that doesn't mean the mining pool in question isn't 'ready' for both proposals. They could be ready to flip a switch as soon as one proposal or the other looks like it's about to activate.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:27:01
WU is no longer the only competitor, there are dozens of other crypto's trying to dethrone Bitcoin.

When you attack or insult someone, you may feel like you're undermining them or their position. In reality you're just strengthening their resolve.
Very few people, if any, will change their perspective as a result of being insulted.
