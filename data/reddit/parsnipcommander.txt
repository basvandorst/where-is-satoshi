This is seriously not good. What is the cost of creating fake news? This is a definite threat to adoption if a group of people decided to collaborate on a mass psyop against Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-10 03:21:05
Hmmm, cute, but they are not separated at all - they worked very closely together. For example, look into Andrew Mellon. Also, the few cousins, and business leaders who founded the fed had many of their family members, club associates, and business partners involved in the Treasury department. Congress can do many things to the fed if it so wants - like dissolve it - or change it via law, etc. Also US government monetary policy adversely affects the dollar. It won't be as easy with bitcoin.

This is my simpleton explanation - all opinion of course: Think about it this way. Most of the massive price swings occur with whales. Once the market cap and volume reach a level where the whale swings only move the market like +/-.5% 
Then, the adoption rate needs to be just high enough to support miners selling coins.
My guess is a market cap of $80-100 Billion is a good starting point. being optimist, Id love to see this happen around early 2016

It's a transatlantic forum where people can solve problems, and actually BE THEMSELVES, not having to worry about sound bites, or politics. That is very useful. In a post-WW2 world (Cold War heating up in 1954), these sorts of gatherings helped cement ties. 
Oh yeah, and influential people are obviously frickin invited, because that's the whole point - to work out problems with people who can actually do it.
Do you realize how many times politicians and businessman hangout together? ALL THE TIME. There are sets, clubs, informal gatherings where people stay stuff even more informal than Bilderberg. If shady deals are done, they are far far far more likely are done in these settings, NOT Bilderberg. 
But for some reason people are obsessed by Bilderberg - it's a distraction guys.

Notable members of the Society have included:
United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia (who served as the original faculty advisor to the organization)[15]
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Glover Roberts, Jr.[citation needed]
Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
United States Circuit Court Judge Priscilla Owen
United States Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Griffith
United States Court of Appeals Judge Edith Clement
Former United States Assistant Attorney General Peter Keisler, a co-founder of the Federalist Society

Former United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson
Senator Orrin Hatch
President of Baylor University and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr
Former U.S. Senator and Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham
Congressman Dan Lungren
Former Texas State Representative and Dallas lawyer Bill Keffer[16]
The Society also has many prominent libertarians who are members and frequent speakers at Society events, such as:
Professor Richard Epstein of the New York University School of Law[17]
Professor Randy Barnett of Georgetown University Law Center[18]
Bradley A. Smith, a professor at Capital University Law School who formerly served as Chairman of the Federal Election Commission[19]
Roger Pilon, Director of Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute[20]
Other members include:[citation needed]
Former United States Ambassador to the European Union C. Boyden Gray
Columbia Law School Dean David Schizer
Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff
University of California, Berkeley law professor John Yoo, who received a Bator Award from the Society for "excellence in legal scholarship and teaching"[21]
Former United States Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton
Justice Scalia's son Eugene Scalia
Former general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget and of the Department of Homeland Security Philip Perry
While not necessarily members, several figures in the public eye have written for Federalist Society publications:[22]
Shawn Mitchell, a Republican member of the Colorado state senate
Hans A. von Spakovsky, a commissioner of the Federal Election Commission
Shannen W. Coffin, general counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney
Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts was reported to have been a member of the Society, but Roberts's membership status was never definitively established. Deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino said Roberts "has no recollection of ever being a member."[23] The Washington Post later located the Federalist Society Lawyers' Division Leadership Directory, 1997-1998, which listed Roberts as a member of the Washington chapter steering committee.[24] Membership in the Society is not a necessary condition for being listed in the leadership directory.[24]

Interesting - 
"The Quantum Group of Funds are privately owned hedge funds based in Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles) and Cayman Islands. They are currently advised by George Soros through his company Soros Fund Management. Soros started the fund in 1973 in partnership with Jim Rogers. The shareholders of the funds are not publicly disclosed although it is known that the Rothschild family and other wealthy Europeans put $6 million into the funds in 1969.[1]
In 1992, the lead fund, Soros's Quantum Fund became famous for "breaking" the Bank of England, forcing it to devalue the pound. Soros had bet his entire fund in a short sale on the ultimately fulfilled prediction that the British currency would drop in value, a coup that netted him a profit of $1 billion[2] (see Black Wednesday). In 1997, Soros was blamed for forcing sharp devaluations in Southeast Asian currencies.[3]
In July, 2011, the Quantum Fund announced they would be ending the fund, and will be returning all outside money by the end of 2011. The fund will now exclusively manage Soros's family money."

Whatever you do, do not get cornered by Price arguments, Mt. Gox, or drugs. 
Those are strawman. 
Gox? We've had Great depression, Enron, Lehman Brothers, Madoff, you can own them with those arguments alone. Also look into countries that experienced hyperinflation.
Drugs? Look into the Narco-dollar complex. Dollars are the official drug currency.
If you think you can get a peace angle - Look into the connection between oil, the dollar, and limited wars post 1971 - and the 'petrodollar'
Check this out too: 
Price? Bitcoin is 5 years old, and look into how the November to December 2013 price rise might have been highly manipulated, and doesn't reflect free market principles.
Keep on top of how amazing and revolutionary the bitcoin technology is - don't get cornered by Price arguments, Mt. Gox, or drugs.

Here's a start:
Some experience has Wenceslao Casares, founder of 
Patagon.com online bank to discuss financial ventures online. Besides creating the said bank, in 2000 it was bought in $ 750 million by the Santaner, brought forward other companies in the industry, as Wanako Games; Lemon 
Bank and Lemon.com platform digital wallet that last year bought US public company Lifelock. 
So when he called attention yesterday to expose the 'XII Congress 
Innovation Icare 'questioned spoke of bitcoins as 
Future of Money. the Argentine 
put the issue with an example of childhood when I lived in 
Patagonia. "My dad 
connected to a home computer to a server at a time 
browsers, and there was no one imagined 
Why was the Internet. I said 
that would change the 
world, because one could 
connect with another person in 
elsewhere in the world. With bitcoins felt it was again 
against something that would change everything in the 
next twenty years, "he said. 
The opinion of Casares is striking, 
considering that during 2014 the bit- 
Coins have been questioned. A bankruptcy in February Mt.Gox, house 
exchange that captured the 7096 transaction with this virtual currency, 
amounted to a series of restrictions imposed by China, and questioning the reliability of India, Russia and 
other countries. Casares, however, is played by her. He set up the company Xapo, 
providing secure storage 
for customers using these coins, plus an electronic wallet for trading and a credit card. Basically, developing a bank. 
The businessman ran 
the history of media 
payment in barter 
forward and what are the requirements defined 
to be met 
he called media 
registration. The best example of which 
so far has been gold. 
"They must be scarce, divisibies, transportable, recognizable, durable and expendable. The Bitcoin meets 
with everyone. Lets you manage money 
in a way that has never been seen "
said. 
Casares demystified some beliefs about money, in order to 
clarify the potential of said virtual currency. Money has no intrinsic value 
and does not need gold backing, but it must not be
confusing for people; not been required to be supported by a 
Government, because it existed long 
before, in all places where the 
people interacted, "he said. about her 
future was more optimistic: "Can 
meet basic uses of money. Being a system of saving, using 
which mostly have today; being 
means of payment, which is under development and, to the extent that this concrete 
Finally, serve to define a system 
price ". 
"Today they use 8 million people, but soon reach the 
100. The Bitcoin is not a country, it is 
Internet is global, "he said.

This was a bit lousy in terms of the big picture. 
After watching this, a new person basically thinks Bitcoin is useful for a small amount of things.
For example, all the dudes on the panel said fiat can't be replaced by Bitcoin, yet say bitcoin could pay for anything. 
One of them said governments would die if fiat died. This is all old-school paradigm thinking.

 - What if I told you the price rise last year in November was mostly financially engineered and not a natural rise (a super pump)?
 - Assuming  is true... perhaps we're seeing a slow rise in 'real' price throughout 2014. As the engineered price goes down, it slowly meets with the true 'real' price... and perhaps we're near the intersection point
 - More big names are fanatical about bitcoin than ever before, more VC's are into it, more startups are being funded. 
 - Coincenter in DC was founded with 2 Andreesen Horowitz board members, and funded by big VC names. That's huge. Quite possibly the best team to deal with regulation too. That's Huge. We've got BIG guns in the capital
 - We're slowly seeing the public view bitcoin in a positive light finally. Silk Road and Mt. Gox are almost behind us
 - Real regulation is coming soon - and if it's smart - we'll see some MAJOR players come in. 
 - Paypal has officially taken BTC aboard, as well as Dell, and Dish for example - billion dollar companies. That's HUGE.
I'm sure there are more, but there you go.

Basically you buy some khashes and the payout is good. Then your khashes are worth less and less each day, while the payout generally stays the same. 
So if you to use the service, make sure you are willing to hold.

His company is invested in Coinbase, and Ripple. Andreessen sits on the board of coincenter ("a new voice for Bitcoin") with Balaji (Heads the stanford bitcoin group), and Susan Athey (of Ripple), along with Garzik (bitpay) and others.
He's very much invested in the bitcoin ecosystem - which of course could lead to something else, but still it's mainly Ripple and Bitcoin.

"I emphasized that central banks will continue to be needed in order to manage the unit of account for price stability and for keeping output close to its natural level.

Ah yeah that same Rothschild family that was bankrupted in Austria (Austrian branch), left Italy, kicked out of Frankfurt in WW2 (Frankfurt branch), and in much difficulty kept afloat from defaults, and bad loans in the 1800s (Mainly british branch) to countries which is a risky business, and lost much of their wealth in Paris (French branch) after WW2. Wealthy and well connected, yes... but that powerful? lol no fucking way. Most of the big jewish banking Houses only survived by intermarriage, and closely bonding - aka the 'cousinhood'

Then they merged with Sofort bank:

Now they became the largest. 
Also what's great, is that this might be a green light for Sequoia Capital / Sir Michael Moritz's interest in bitcoin, because Sir Michael Moritz sits on the Board of Klarna.
Just to get an idea how bad ass Moritz is: "His internet company investments include Google, Yahoo!, PayPal, Webvan, YouTube, eToys, and Zappos." He also sat on the board of Google., and runs one of the largest VCs on the planet: Sequoia Capital

More specifics here: 
"We're not really focused on the price. We're focused on the technology that's getting built and the infrastructure that's getting built. I mean, bitcoin is a global payment network. It's bigger than it's ever been," he said.
Bitcoin prices plummeted over the weekend, hitting a new 2014 low of $304, before recovering some of its value.
Read MoreMarc Andreessen in bitcoin for the long run
But Andreessen said he wasn't concerned.
"This is like judging the Internet in 1994 based on the price of domain names," he said. "It's still very early. The world has not yet adopted bitcoin. It's still extremely early."
The technology behind bitcoin was the important factor, Andreessen added.
"The core technology phenomenon, which is what we're interested in, is doing extremely well," he said. "I think the price is going to bounce around. I mean, prices of lots of assets bounce around. Prices of banks bounce around, and yet banks are still standing."

For harddrives:
Use the calculator at  to figure out what $ you want, so you know what harddrive
So let's say you buy a 4TB harddrive and rent the space out via storj, it would net you $40-$300 / month
Now that's if you had 100% rented out. Let's say 25% is rented, that's still like $10-$75 / month which isn't bad\
4TB costs like $100-200, so you'll reap the benefits back in 1-20 months I guess depending on the above

This is a really important idea everyone should know. Basically what he's saying is that with the current technological progress, humans will move past the need for money. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:57:18
Maybe he's marketing for potential Berkshire Hathaway stockholders... old farts who hate technology
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:00:41
1. did he get the money back? looks like he did
2. They have to be overly legit as a bitcoin company. Coinbase is as clean as a new born.
3. Saying that, there could be something to do with his info that denied it, who knows. Also why not just try purchasing a few smaller rounds, and go bigger, that way you gain trust.
4. Clearly shows he bought some and it went through later on, but doesn't say how much. My bet is that it was a smaller amount
Meh... I don't get why this is a rip off. Seems like FUD

Technically it does. Let's say 80% of all bitcoin owners HODL, and spent a tiny amount, and the other 20% is liquid, trading, buying whatever, that 80% impacts the price very much so the more time goes on, because it furthers the scarcity. And as more % of people HODL, it becomes more scarce

I don't agree with the quote. A lot of propaganda out there that says nations are slaves to bankers. If you read the material from the old banking archives, these guys had a heck of time doing business by floating state bonds. The successful ones usually put their own capital (balance sheet) into the loan.
Time and time again bankers lost out: Fugger, Medici, Genoese (to Spain), etc etc. 
These guys usually lived near the people who ran the military, and navy, and the police, so obviously, the bankers could easily be pursued and run off if they ever tried to maliciously fuck over the oligarchy of a nation. Not many instances did a banker have direct control over armed forces.

Basically the guy who made this video had no idea of what a 'Court Jew' is and it was VERY common:

Also, please note that there was a study done in London at several points on wealth (early 1900s), where Christian wealth FAR FAR FAR exceeded that of Jewish wealth. Same went in Germany too.

Yeah there's no way the CPU would be 2 GHs, my cpu is pretty high end and it was (like early 2014) like .3 MH/s, and my video card is roughly 1.
So your calculation should be 18 petahases, and most likely far less as not all people have heavy GPU and cpu, so maybe something like 1-3 PH/s

What you're worried about (If you're thinking what I'm thinking) is absolutely true. The game is lost for the old system, the only thing they can do now is Stall it as long as possible so their institutions maintain stability through their transition, or downfall.
This has been done time and time again in history as new industries take over the old. It's impossible to stop them, but you can stall them for a while. 
Mass Media propaganda operations like Bloomberg are top down centralized institutions where it is very easy to coordinate one group to cater to Bitcoin fans, and another to bash them in a way that can control public perception in a scientific way.

Ah, so this explains how Bitshares people have been pumping their shitcoin: "It's so stable that BTC38, a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange, will accept BitCNY and add regular yuan to your balance."
I notice before every pump there's a huge increase in one of the BitXYZ coins, then BAM, back to bitshares.
Note: Unlike Bitcoin, Bitshares relies on HUMAN POLITICS to create coins, and people vote HUMANS in. Inside the Bitcoin network, there is no human politics, only outside it. THIS IS MASSIVELY IMPORTANT.
We need to move toward trustless systems.

The original english source (1907) basically says this was a legend, and later found out to be wrongly attributed to Baron Rothschild (see the bottom of my post)
Here's the English source from 1907: 






For the backstory, what it sounds like is that the rentes (Government bonds) were cheap because of the calamity of the Franco-Prussian war of 1871 (this would have occurred sometime after the Treaty of Versailles, 1871 when uncertainty ruled the air), and it was a good investment, because France was going to be strong again. 
Your wikipedia article links to a Forbes article, which has no source unfortunately; Looking into it further, it seems there are multiple variations in German and English. Rothschild archives don't have anything on it, but in the French version of 'Why I left Goldman Sachs" by Greg Smith, he was told by Historians that the quotation was extremely doubtful. The English version leaves this footnote out (Further boosting the legend!).


Would be nice to know who Gregg was talking to, but that should answer the question.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:22:38
Not bad, but a few suggestions: The interviews are a bit lacking - they almost start off with a bad tone for bitcoin; not critical enough of Mpesa in the first half; No mention of bitpesa?, or other similar steps forward in Africa; 
It would be MASSIVE if we had a full feature docu, with beautiful infographic animations with lots of stats on how people are fucked by mpesa and corruption in the country... ok will leave it at that

@_date: 2014-11-07 07:44:43
Your're welcome! I know my response wasn't what you wanted, but I really think everyone on this sub should get a bitcoin debit card at least. What's better: living on bitcoin via card, or living on it struggling to find a shop that accepts it? 
I think shiftpayment is the perfect transition honestly...

"Don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
Great idea.
Obviously if you made a lot from BTC so far, you might as well take advantage of that, but leave some. Take like 20% of that some, and diversify with some top Altcoins?

Basically a sell wall blocks the price from going higher, and absorbs coins.
The buy wall blocks the price from going lower. 
You can use those two to control the price - It's all psychology though

"Not buying ~$100 of Bitcoin in 2010. According to Wikipedia, in Feb 2010 Bitcoins were worth roughly 1¢. In May this year they were worth $440 - $630. A $100 investment in 2010 could've been worth $6,000,000 now.
*Edit: Everyone is telling me I couldn't have known. I had $100 to burn, I was going to buy Bitcoins, but then Mass Effect 2 came out and I bought that instead."

The good part: "But then, this weekend, my local bar started accepting bitcoin. I bought beer. Lots of it. I woke up and found I had spent over 0.4 BTC out of my hot wallet. Buying beer. Then I checked my physical wallet and found I had over 150 EUR in it. Seconds later, I remembered what happened: all my friends gave me EUR in cash and in return I gave them bitcoin to buy beer with. Balance has been restored. Credibility regained. They're now asking me how to get more, they're now asking me how it works, they're now asking me what the future is like.

I have had the opposite experience. Big names behind the scenes view BTC as a beta thing... a preview, or an alpha, and are betting softly, while Gavin et al produce the best solutions to the problems.

Most people here on the reddit wouldn't sell their bitcoins for $500... so it's definitely definitely worth much more. Basically a few traders in a few exchanges don't decide the real value

This is just an exchange. Isn't this the same as what Coinbase is doing?
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:12:52
Good points. It's quite complex but overall - the massive rise had nothing to do with the utility, or real value at the time - definitely artificial in my book. In theory, bitcoin is of course priceless... I know, but real life it wasn't as valuable yet. Today bitcoin is far more valuable than in November of 2013 - Expedia, Dell, etc...
@_date: 2014-11-27 01:29:41
It doesn't really seem to help bitcoin. It's not mastercoin / counterparty either.
"powered by bitshares" at the bottom of their website
"Artist Coins will be purchased with BitUSD, a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar. BitUSD shields users from volatility normally present with cryptocurrencies, while still passing the benefit of cryptocurrencies to the user.

Sounds like he's saying that there should be a mechanism to permanently severe the address (such that you can't use a private key with it), and leave some kind of contract in to forward to a new address, (with no way to ever change the contract after that point - as having the private key is useless).

No 0% true. In theory it is... in practice, US fiat is just a digital value on a computer, and there is NO oil in that.

"It doesn't solve any problems" 
You realize that if everyone on earth accepted bitcoin, you could buy anything anywhere? Digital, physical, etc, with lower fees, faster resolution time. 
It's absolutely revolutionary. With Time Inc taking bitcoin today, that's just one more step.

I don't think most VC's are worried about the price for many reasons. Short / medium term investment companies might be worried. Most of these guys like you say are smart enough - and know that the price has historically fluctuated greatly, and are not worried.

A lot of the big Silicon Valley guys are very quiet about some of their investments like this. Like Navant Ravikant said - you could either lose all your money, or make 100,000x your money with bitcoin... so a lot of them are waiting it out. 
It's nice to hear guys like Branson and Theil still strong on Bitcoin as of this month

You can't compare them. This is completely wrong on so many levels. Apple Pay is simply a consumer facing system that utilizes the ancient payment rails. Apple pay could simple swap that out for bitcoin, or utilize bitcoin  as a secondary rail

This might be weak math, but hashrate around nov 28, 2013 was about 6.5 PH/s, and now it's about 168 PH/s, which is a 25.8x increase. So that makes the current network roughly 6,643 times faster than top 500 supercomputers, or a 2,495% increase.

Before they can launch it - they're waiting for OK from EU AML.

I'm really confused here. Why are you comparing Apple Pay to Bitcoin. Apple pay is a consumer facing application that sits on 1970's payment rails. Bitcoin is a peer to peer distributed ledger, and multiple companies utilize this for payments.
Apple Pay could just decide to offer bitcoin use, or via third party.... 
Apple Pay is more a competitor to Circle

* [no] Mining is fairly easy, and practical.

* [True] Limited places to spend: moot point, it's too early, and more merchants / shops will join in.
* [no] Marketing is massive already, and has super huge potential - imagine this - no one owns bitcoin - so thousands of the companies that accept it will market it. It's distributed marketing

Yup, bitcointalk is mostly complete and utter Shite.

Someone else explained it - they ship from USA - which seems to be the main issue. So basically Overstock is great for when there's an item you really really want

Nah, I think all the bitcoin companies should band together and produce something just bitcoin, which would benefit all of us.

Guys, remember he invested in Bitpay, and got Vitalik Buterin the 100k grant... many of his partners are invested in bitcoin companies. He's obviously excited about bitcoin, but is cautious still
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:25:49
lol, he's here in spirit?

Yeah agreed... it's a lot of smoke up our collective asses at this point. Is the smoke good or bad? we'll see

Guys, just use a ShiftPayments debit card. It draws from your coinbase account. You can basically go 100% bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:51:39
Or if you want to support them going mainstream, just buy from Itunes... sounds lame, but it helps get the documentary out for the masses

Check out Counterparty XCP. Bitshares is a not a bitcoin thing.
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:40:12
No it's not, this is so stupid. Snapchat could easily integrate with bitcoin or sit on top of it, or connect to it for funds... 
@_date: 2014-08-22 05:30:45
That's not what I said you moron.
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:56:12
What the hell is this java plugin?
$70 million hasn't even been invested in any bitcoin startup yet. 
This smells of a massive pile of Bullshit
@_date: 2014-11-08 18:59:03
With other items, just use Xapo of ShiftPayments debit card - connects to your coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:11:46

The best way is to start a tipping campaign on the Nicaraguan reddit, and spread the love there.

Nah you gotta say $1, make it really fucking obvious :)
I check almost everyday and anything funny or something interesting I'll tip

Have you guys looked at Mike Dell's twitter? His bitcoin tweets completely blow out of the water all other tweets. Far more RTs, Favs, comments, etc
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:03:06
Ok, so same as usual, but I have to wait longer to get the BTC confirmed in my wallet. Untrusted transactions best done with fee. Thanks :)

Its fine - it'll only be here for a few days. And Apple royally fucked a lot of people's lives when they pulled apps from the app store. Business plans went to shit, some investors freaked out - it was a royally massive douche bag move.

Why do I have a feeling people like you are just jealous. Changetip allows me to easily give bitcoin to others, and I enjoy doing that. If that makes me a paid troll for voluntarily spreading the word that way, then color me that.

The whole point of bitcoin is a truly united global store of value/currency... this would be insanity
@_date: 2014-10-26 08:17:32
The weirdest disinfo I've seen in a while. 
We should follow up on his statements about Marc Andreessen and Patrick Byrnes though - or at least have them make a statement confirming what he says. I suspect he twisted their words. I've talked to Byrnes and he was weirdly pationate about Bitcoin - way more so than it just being a marketing thing. Like he seemed seriously interested in the technology from multiple perspectives.
He definitely timed this books entry... waiting for the price to go down.

Telling people doesn't always interest people. Sending them real bitcoins seems to really perk the interest though :) I noticed this also when I sent bits to some people on Coinbase

It feels sexy to me, like driving a Ferrari of wallets

it's crap, check my info below. A lot of the quotes in this video are from old 19th newspapers by dumb / ignorant journalists, or authors with agendas.
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:17:35
There is a MASSIVE difference here. If bitcoin really is the money of the internet... not any sovereign state, there is a separation here. Yen implies Japan... Bitcoin implies Global / world.
