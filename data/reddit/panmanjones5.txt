So you can audit a figurehead who runs the country but you can’t audit the system that runs the country
@_date: 2019-11-05 08:05:38
If you say so
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:30:58
China has universal healthcare
China doesn’t have corporations running their education system 
China has reduced poverty since the last decade 
China didn’t have Facebook interfering with their elections

A good technical argument is the money velocity of BTC 
@_date: 2019-02-01 11:58:42
A couple points if you calculate the money velocity to Bitcoins, you get something very sexy. The numerical value is better than gold. Second, the numerical value that I gave above is the current gross wealth so I believe there is a little wiggle room for that evaluation either way in a couple years. As a cryptoinvestor, I would like to say that Bitcoin is 100% speculative and the only reason why Bitcoin is worth what it’s worth is because it’s the first blockchain currency created....it just so happens that gold follows the same footsteps, (first precious metal traded). Now I think we have to play how we adopt into the new world very cautiously. Using gold as an example, it was at one point a backing to our fiat currency. I do not believe for a second that Bitcoins will back the dollar bill, because politically and economically it will make China the richest country in the world. That’s a part of the reason why gold isn’t backing most currencies since it would make the United States the richest country in the world. Read about why we changed out of the gold standard. Finite resource levels economic growth. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:19:37
Well here’s the issue. We physically don’t see the devaluing of the physical dollar bill, everything just gets more expensive around us. I think if people were more educated about how our financial system works, it would be a different story. Good book to read is Modern Money Mechanics
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:44:22
Sounds great but I think instead of charging more you should take a loss because eventually BTC &gt; $$$. More customers, more cash flow, etc
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:00:48
I agree with you but look it from an Endgame perspective

@_date: 2019-02-01 12:14:39
Yeah that’s called speculation. See I invested in Bitcoin but I’m a realist. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:34:47
What didn’t I answer? His point is that volatility in Bitcoins is the reason why we can’t have a good medium of exchange. My point was the inflation of the dollar devalues the medium of exchange but we don’t physically see it. I understand with Bitcoin there’s more volatility however at least it has the possibility to go up (Sharpe Ratio), with the Dollar bill it will always inflate &gt;2%.

Bitcoin is a really good idea that’s been fucked up by Financial Institutions, Venture Capitalist and Day Traders. Way too many people trying to make money out of it. I’m glad as soon as people jumped on the bandwagon, it fell. We have to keep shaking the tree of bad apples if we want this thing to work. BTC will get a stable value as soon as people stop day trading and actually use the currency. The second issue that I see is that a physical dollar will always be a physical dollar but with BTC it underlines digital price movement so I think stable coins are the best bet for the physical dollar to be digitalized. Did you know only about 10% of our currency is actually physical. Just think about that, we’re already 90% there. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:00:07
There is a good statistic from sports betting that says if you were to bet against the public 100% of the time, you will win 56% of the time. Everyone here seems to think BTC &lt; 3000 so I guess that’s a good sign 
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:21:18
That’s so wrong in every sense. Okay so if the total wealth is 280 trillion, BTC at best can only be equal to 280 trillion. BTC does get its wealth from world economies mostly from China actually. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:50:20
Individual cryptos does matter. There can only be so many cryptoCURRENCIES. Most countries have one currency, but in blockchain it can be more universal.
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:08:27
No. If you work an average job you will get paid in the currency that you are physically located in. At best they will give you stock options or health care. And that’s at best.

Zcash is not a shitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:59:43
Well If the dollar was out of the equation that’s means 280 trillion dollars of total wealth would be in 21 million bitcoins, which means its about 11 million dollars per BTC. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:15:17
Bitcoin will skyrocket because there are 13.6 million millionaires in North America and that accounts for about 50% of them in the world. So in theory there are about 27.5 million millionaires in the world. Since there are only 21 million BTCs, demand will be driven by scarcity. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:26:03
You’re saying that the price of BTC is not effected by world economies which is so false.
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:42:44
Let’s be realistic while I don’t think 1 bitcoin will go to a million, it definitely won’t be .01. That means 21 million total Bitcoins will have a Market Cap of $210,000. Let’s just think about how realist that would be. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:24:01
My post was more of a valid IF statement argument. But I’m more than happy to defend my position. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:32:46
Okay to be realistic, we will never have a one world currency, but I believe that there a projects such as ZCASH, DGB, DASH, BTC that have the potential to take a chunk of monetary transactions. There are 164 world currencies not including commodities so I don’t see why we can’t have different cryptocurrency. Every dollar has a flaw just like every blockchain. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:52:58
Maybe, maybe not but it’s still based on speculation. That’s like judging a company and thinking it’s a great idea so you invest in it. Lots of great ideas were financial failures such as Pets.com, eventually Tesla.

Whichever one that makes sense and people will bet on that speculation. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:37:20
I couldn’t agree with you more! 
@_date: 2019-02-01 21:06:11
Well it’s better than just letting it sit there and die. If you had two BTCs (currently valued at 6900) would you want to buy something worth 6,900 instead of refreshing the page and watch it go down? I’m saying the only way we have a shot at this whole Bitcoin thing is if we use it
@_date: 2019-02-01 22:41:40
I agree pls read all of my comments defending my position!

What I’m trying to say: 
 
If the endgame is Bitcoin will outsource the dollar bill, 
Then, the dollar bill will = 0

ISIS uses Zcash and many dark markets are starting to explore Zcash. That’s why the price of XMR was very high at one point. The intrinsic value is privacy and people will pay for that. ZEC and XMR are sought by DHS in tracking and so far no luck. As offshore banking becomes harder, I believe people will turn to crypto to privately transfer large sums of money. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:06:04
The total GDP of the world is like 280 Trillion. So you’re saying Bitcoins’ total value will be roughly  7% of the world wealth.....
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:38:02
I read a post the other day here that said, “To those who are buying drugs are the darkweb, you guys are doing more for the sake of Bitcoins than you HODLers out there.” He’s absolutely right. The function of Bitcoin is to outsource the dollar bill, but no currency increases value without transaction.
