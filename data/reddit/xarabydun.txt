I began using CaVirtex back in June of 2011 when they first opened and [posted about it]( I stopped recommending them last year when they increased inactivity fees without notifying customers then retroactively charged those fees going back months in one lump sum. My buddy lost several bitcoins because of it. When he asked them what happened he was told to read the updated terms of service containing the new fees. 
Prior to the change, accounts that were not logged into for one year would have their CAD holdings reduced $50 each month. After the change, BTC was charged in lieu of CAD and you needed to execute a trade to be considered active. No email was sent out informing account holders of these changes. Instead, they retroactively charged accounts going back months/years to the account's last trade. Several people with BTC in their account but no current trades were shocked to find their accounts drained of all funds. 
Lesson to be learned, don't keep funds in an exchange. They may end up stealing it.

September 14, 2013 - They amended the dormant fees to include BTC, not just CAD as it previously stated.






Nobody denies the $50 CAD per month dormant fee. People that were affected are upset that they changed the TOS to include dormant BTC without emailing their customers, then 15 days later [retroactively applied the fee going back months](

@_date: 2014-02-19 20:33:29
I was referring to the project's page doesn't show the Files tab to non project members due to the project not being approved by Curse yet. I guessed the file's link and was asking if it was the latest version. Though now the link gives 403 forbidden. 
When your project's approved, consider using the Curse SVN repo. It automatically generates downloads each time you commit a change to the repo. Saves you from having to zip and upload the download each time. If you [enable localization]( on your project, other Curse users can submit translations for your strings and the site will seamlessly import them into your project upon your next commit. I found it very helpful.

It does seem like a interesting idea but the time needed to verify transactions could hinder the bittorrent client no? Does the sender wait until the transaction is confirmed by x clients before sending the chunk or does it assume it's legit and sends the chunk file. If the latter it could lead to bad BT clients sending fake transactions ruining it for everyone else.
Could anti piracy exploit this to flood networks with garbage and be paid to do it? Sure clients would eventually ban the IP for failing hash checks but if there's enough peers in the swarm it could be worth wile for attackers. 
I'm not attacking the idea of a BitCoin BitTorrent client, I just have worries.

NCIX has 6990 on for [$709.99]( * 4 = $2,839.96.
[Mining Hardware wiki]( shows the 6990 getting about 708Mhash * 4 = 2832Mhash.
At 157426.20628986 difficulty it'll take on average 67.67 hours to get 1 block, or 1.3535 hours per coin. 18.09BTC/day.
At a USD exchange rate of $7.22, You'll make around $5.44/hour, $130.95/day, $915.52/week, $3,973.80/mo. It'll take 21.74 days to pay off the $2,839.96 for the cards.

Buying bitcoins would probably be safer. But here's some numbers.
He says he paid $3,100 for the cards. Each card does around 300M/hash. So about 3600M/hash total. At today's difficulty (567358) it would take on average 188 hours per block, or 3.76 hours per bitcoin. 
At the current USD exchange rate of $11.85, he'd make about $3.15/h, $75.63/day, $529.4/week, $2,300.37/mo. It'll take 40.94 days to pay off the cards. 
But off course these numbers aren't taking difficulty increases, exchange rate changes or offline time into account. It's certainly a risk. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 10:18:56
The network automatically adjusts difficulty so that the total network hash rate can solve a block every 10 minutes or so. 
[1379223.4296725]( * 2^32 = 5,923,719,524,320,343.49056
It would take a hash rate of 5,923,719,524,320,343.49056 to solve a block every 1 second. 
To solve a block every 600 seconds (10 minutes) we need a hash rate of 9,872,865,873,867.2391509333333333333 which is 9,872.8659 Gigahashs/s.
[Bitcoin Watch]( displays the Network Hash rate at 9857.56 Gigahashs/s which is probably more accurate then what I've described.

Move the BitCoin folder from your %appdata% into a TrueCrypt drive. My folder was 400MB, I made a 1GB drive. Then create a shortcut
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe" -datadir=S:\Bitcoin
S: being your mounted bitcoin drive. The BitCoin software will only run so long as the drive is mounted, once you dismount the BitCoin software will crash (from my experience). 
I've since created a new BitCoin folder/wallet which I receive mining proceeds and minor transactions from and send them to my encrypted wallet once I get around 1BTC. If I ever want to send someone money from my encrypted account, I close BitCoin, mount my drive, open BitCoin using that shortcut, send the money then shut it all down again and reopen my unprotected wallet.
If someone ever steals my wallet from the %appdata% location, they won't gain much. And they'll have a narrow window of opportunity to steal the wallet file from inside the drive. 
note, I'm no expert on this. This could very well be the wrong way to protect a bitcoin wallet. /shrug

Seems to me like a counterfeiter will look for an existing address with bitcoins on it, then make a fake BitBill and print that public address on the card's side. So the victim can verify the address has coins on BlockExplorer but probably be unable/unwilling to move those coins during the sale. So by the time the victim does try to move/claim the coins the counterfeiter could be long gone. 
In this dark pool scenario, the traders don't want to move/claim the coins off the BitBill so it seems like a prime target for a counterfeiter.

In the end wouldn't you'd make the same profit holding the BTC vs storing it as gox fiat? 
So, you buy 10x$900 at stamp, you move it over to gox and sell for 10x$1000 for 1k profit. What if by the time stamp reaches $1000 gox is at $1100, do you buyback at $1100 and move your 9btc to stamp? or would you keep waiting until gox and stamp reach parity?

My buddy bought 2 bitcoins from them in 2012 and left them in Cavirtex. On halloween night I mentioned they were at like $200 so he logged into his Cavirtex account to find their inactivity fee had taken them literally the day before. 
Shitty part was Cavirtex's TOS stated only CAD would be taken by their inactivity fee when he signed up. Prior to [July 5th 2013]( their terms made no mention of BTC being converted to CAD to cover the inactivity fee. It wasn't until July 5th that they modified their Terms of Service to state BTC would be converted to CAD to cover the inactivity fee. A change they neglected to email any of their customers of. 
My buddy sent in a ticket asking why 2 full BTC were taken and got a reply stating they were unable to enforce their inactivity fee prior to Oct 30th, and as such they charged inactivity fees going back to Jan 2012.
Also worth noting prior to [July 5th 2013]( the TOS states you only needed to log into your account to be considered active. After July 5th you need to make a trade to be considered active. So anyone even today that logs into their account to check their balance can be hit by their inactive fee if they're unaware of the trade requirement.

Friendly reminder, if you don't make a currency exchange with CaVirtEx in over 1 year, they'll begin taking $50 from you every month until all your remaining funds are gone. Several people were surprised this month to discovered hundreds of dollars worth of BTC were retroactively taken by their inactivity fee. 
Prior to [July 5th 2013]( their TOS stated anyone who didn't log in for 1 year would have their CAD withdrawn to pay their inactivity fee. On July 5th they modified the TOS to state BTC would be converted to CAD to cover the fee and you would need to make a trade to be considered active, simply logging in to check your balance wasn't enough activity to protect you. 
Cavertex neglected to notify their customers most affected by said inactivity fee of the change in terms, or email any sort of warning that the inactivity fee was being activated on october 30th. My friend lost 2 BTC that day, another guy on the [forum]( lost 4 BTC. 
So keep in mind, Cavirtex changes their TOS without notice and will then hold you to those new terms. Strangely enough, their TOS ([12.1e]( states if *your account has remained inactive for a period of six months*, you're in breach of contract. Be wary of leaving any amount of funds with CavirtEx, there's no protection for you when they decide to screw you over.

My only concern would be gox's price going up while you're waiting for stamp to catch up to the rate you sold at. Since it's almost impossible to withdraw fiat, people have no choice but to buyback their coins driving up the price.
In your scenario, simply holding the 10x$900 btc until stamp reached $1000 would net you the same profit wouldn't it?

Only so many transactions can fit in a block, so miners prioritize transactions with the highest fees. By incurring a fee to make a transaction, it discourages attackers from flooding the network bouncing coins back and forth.

On July 5th they modified the TOS to state BTC would be converted to CAD to cover the fee and you would need to make a trade to be considered active, simply logging in to check your balance wasn't enough activity to protect you.
Cavertex neglected to notify their customers most affected by said inactivity fee, or email any sort of warning that the inactivity fee was being activated on october 30th. Instead, they silently changed their TOS and retroactively charged for months of inactivity in one lump sum.

The 1000 was just for reference. I understand it can be anywhere above. 
Alright so in this scenario, you've bought at $900 at stamp and sold at gox for $1000 making a $100 profit. You then wait until they both reach parity, lets say $2000. You then convert your $1000 into .5btc, move it to stamp and convert back into $1000 for withdraw. You then have your guaranteed $100 profit. 
I suppose that would work.

Are you not installing ubuntu to your first stick? Or do you intend on running in liveCD mode off the first stick and installing armory from the second stick each time you boot up?

Great name, site looks very nice, the tutorial boxes are helpful. The battleship ship placement could use a skip timer button. So far so good.

Just need something that can run Ubuntu 10.04 32 or 64 bit. Find a old laptop or build a cheap PC, install Ubuntu 10.04, grab the offline bundle from Armory's website and install it on the offline PC. It's recommended the offline PC never connect to the internet, copy files between your PCs using a USB stick. Once installed you can open Armory and generate an offline wallet and start signing transactions.

It would increase supply and decrease the value of their existing bitcoins. It'll be hard convincing miners to devalue their existing coins.
