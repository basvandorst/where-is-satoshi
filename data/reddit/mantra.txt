Decentralization doesn't care about PR.  PR is a centralized communication technique.  You've completely missed the entire point.

Clearly it hasn't crossed "the chasm" yet.  It's in very early adoption yet.

Quantum Computing is exactly like Nuclear Fusion - "Coming Real Soon Now" for that last few decades.  It's NOT on the horizon realistically.

But that's "paper" (LOL) wealth only.  It DOES NOT EXIST until it is transacted for that potential.  Just like homes are merely assessed for a value but have no such value until they are actually transacted.  It's the transaction that define value; everything is speculation and wishful thinking.

The long term stability is primarily a function of "de-growth" rules.  Bubbles are merely supply and demand rebalancing - variation is inevitable and necessary to the system dynamics (one of the points that Nassim Taleb makes about the foolishness of the Fed trying to "stabilize" the US$).  As prices go up, more miners will enter and the price will go down.  The broader stability comes from the lack of fractional reserve (aka exponential Ponzi expansion).  Instead the larger the total supply the slower the creation rate.  This is an unconditionally stable dynamical system, exactly the opposite to how fiat currency bubbles are unstable because of fractional reserve money creation.

You generally become a "financial journalist" when you can't hack a real job in business or finance or economics.  Those who can't "do" write as if they could.
