My grandma rang me today, she bought $20 worth at $19k AUD. She rang me today when it hit 25k AUD and asked if she should withdraw her profits. I tried explaining to my 70 yr old nanna that she has to sell her coins to AUD before withdrawing anything and in turn she will be left with less coin than she had... about an hour into the phone conversation I resorted to grade 1 maths.. if sally has 4 apples she bought for $1 each but now they are worth $2 each... omg... just don’t do it.

I came to the comments just to see if anyone else noticed that.

Sooo. I watched the video. And am trying to work out if everyone’s just trolling.... 
Also... is it weird I’m slightly disappointed but entirely relieved?

If you own a few whole bitcoins, sell what you need, if you need to, but I would keep some in holding. Or trade some for another alt.
I have a ‘feeling’ after the new year it will be a lot higher.

Hope you’ve told your parents not to expect grandkids.

Nov 30th. Big Bang theory is airing an episode based on bitcoin. Watch how many sheep jump on the wagon.

What about that Aussie Robert or Roger or whatever? Didn’t he publicly claim to be Satoshi?

Set a goal. Everyone has their own ‘moon’. When you reach that goal you can withdraw your profit. You’ve done well leaving it for as long as you did. I haven’t even got one full bitcoin yet lol. But I’ve invested in other coins. It’s probably worth joining a coin exchange, I’m with coinspot (AUS) and can buy over 300 different alt coins. I’ve invested in power, neo, iota, ripple, verge, lite coin, etherum and a few more. I’m in it for the long haul. I do a bit of day trading (using my current coins to buy other coins) and make a bit of profit off that most of the time.. I’ll withdraw whatever I have when my son turns 18.
