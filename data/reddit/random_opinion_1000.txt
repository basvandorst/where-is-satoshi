And this idea goes against the entire theory of bitcoin. Do you also think banks are a good thing? Banks are going to charge insane fees on bitcoin transactions. Also unwatched banks... go read on the financial crisis and what banks did with government supervision... now imagine what type of shit they will do with no authority figure in the picture.

It's interesting watching bitcoin users. Most people hate wall street people but bitcoin has turned into a wall street that everyone could afford type of thing. I know there are true believers of bitcoin but recently it has turned into a stock that people are trying to get rich quick on.

The guy swearing and spamming caps is telling someone else to calm down. Classic reddit.

Read through this thread interesting stuff. It's good to have people presenting different views on Bitcoin. The worst thing to have happen is everyone put blinders on and just praise bitcoin all day long. Group think is a very dangerous thing.

The real question is will you start paying in Bitcoins? The logical answer should be no. Why would you pay in a bitcoin a currency that continues to rise in value over a dollar that is becoming weaker due to inflation? This is the overall problem with Bitcoin. --&gt; MOST &lt;-- people will not spend a currency that is raising in value while they have the option to spend another currency that is decreasing in value. It seems like only a few people on this forum actually buy items with Bitcoins. Those people are usually the people who have already made a massive profit off Bitcoin I have yet to see anyone who purchased Bitcoin at current prices use Bitcoins to buy stuff.

Recently bitcoin has turned into a stock rather than a currency for most people. It will probably be this way for a while until some type of major crash that scares away the gamblers. After that hopefully it becomes stable to the point where it can become a reliable source of currency. Right now the price bounces far too much to be used as a currency. Not sure how long this process will take.

It's hypocritical douchebags like you that make me laugh. Bitcoin is suppose to be a free currency as in DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT WITH IT. Who the fuck are you to tell people what to do with there own money.

Not really. You are saving 10% on a beer tab of 20 bucks? What if the value of bitcoins goes up 10% shortly after buying that tab? 10% of ~1k is greater than 10% of a $20 tab. Like I said no reasonable investor is going to use bitcoins for everyday purchases. Now lets say that someone is buying a luxury item where they take 10% off... then it's probably worth using bitcoins.

What is the point of this thread? You taking subtle digs at people who didn't invest early? Congrats do you feel better about yourself now? Get a life.

I have which is why you're upset. Your pathetic attempt of bragging was called out on.

The answer is no. For all the positives about deregulated currency this is the negative. You will never have a central authority watching over these websites.

You calling someone disrespectful is highly hypocritical to say the least. You could have said what you said in a much nicer way but you decided to be a dick and try to brag about it.
