As a C++ programmer, I would recommend starting with almost any other language. I think C++ takes patience to learn properly. I wouldn't have had the patience to learn it if I hadn't already learned programming in other languages. The PHP/Javascript combo that theymos mentioned is one popular and very useful starting point.

Bitcoin is getting coverage for the first time on normal TV and radio shows. So if there is a "publicity multiplier", that multiplier is about to max out.

That was a major theme of the novel Cryptonomicon. There were (by my count) 3 different and related subplots concerning gold that was concentrated in large amounts but difficult to nearly impossible to access in various ways.

Well yes. How might "regulation" have any teeth? Even the recent minimal US rules have, shall we say, limited reach. If a redditor says "Exchanges should do this..." that is, as the pirates say, a suggestion.

If you generated the voteraddress yourself, you could generate more than one voteraddress to vote multiple times.
But if your voteraddress is issued to you by your state or nation they would be far from anonymous in the blockchain.

The beeping sound was really loud in my headphones. That made it hard to listen.
Here's a trick I learned from people who do a lot of public speaking: Pick up your head. That will open up your throat and make your voice sound clearer over the background while still keeping the tone conversational.
If you have to scrunch down to get in view of the camera, see if you can adjust the camera instead.

Exactly. That would be option 1, making heavy use of the large exchanges with lots of sell orders. It would be something the exchanges would have to adapt to.

Yes join ASAP! I did TM for years and it really taught me how to speak up and get taken seriously. They do lots of 5-7 minute talks which is exactly what you are going for here. They also give you practice with 1-2 minute talks and some other formats. My club wasn't much into video, but some clubs get you up to speed on the video process.

Not Asian, but from a "traditional culture" where extended family is a big thing. I don't do what your dad does, but I make sure my kids know it whenever I give significant money to their grandparents or when another sibling does so. It's a not too subtle hint that giving to your parents is the thing to do.

I confess, I couldn't finish it the first time because of the beeping in my headphones. So my first time comments were just about the style of presentation.
But saw it a second time all the way through, this time with my cheap, low-end speakers and they did a beautiful job of killing the background noise. Who knew my bad speakers would come in handy? :)
I'm going to be a bit harsh on the content because I see so much potential and want to see more.
There were no numbers! The only number I heard in the 5-6 minutes was the year 2009! Since you brought up the idea of appealing to women I have to ask this: *Did you remove all the numbers in an attempt to appeal to women?* If so, you may want to rethink this. For the near future, I think new adopters are going to be either somewhat tech savvy or somewhat finance savvy or both. These groups of people (whether men or women) are comfortable with numbers. There were many places where you could have backed up your assertions with hard examples and it would have been so much better.
For example, if an eBay transaction has a higher transaction fee than a similar bitcoin transaction, you can say what the typical transaction fees are and how they compare. Also, you mentioned exchanges, but not typical exchange fees. This is all new, so every assertion needs some kind of backup.
There was zero mention of security. Leaving out any mention of security in a beginners bitcoin presentation is not a public service. How much security are you comfortable with in your own bitcoin use? What security measures do you consider most important for a beginner? Share that briefly with your audience.
You mentioned having more control over your money and you came close to expressing the idea of distributed control vs. central control. Develop that further. For the tech aware, words like peer to peer and distributed might help.
The part at the the beginning about how the technology works and "making computers" and so forth is probably best done with a few brief and very carefully scripted lines rather than off the top of the head. The technology takes time to explain properly so condensing it has to be done very carefully if you want to get anything meaningful across.
Toward the end you were distinctly dismissive about "hoarding gold and silver". That's fine, but remember some of your audience does invest in gold and silver or is considering doing so. So this is an assertion you have to back up with clear comparisons and numbers if you are going to bring it up at all. How does bitcoin compare with gold and silver in terms of specific advantages and disadvantages? Or consider spinning off this topic into a separate talk.
Obviously adding specifics to the content will make it longer if you don't cut anything. But as you redo you will find some repeating points that can be cut easily or spun off (but don't spin off the security tips). And don't be afraid to do a little scripting at some key points where that results in a tighter presentation.
TL;DR: Would love to see more. Back up assertions with specific examples, facts, and NUMBERS. Don't forget security.

Actually, all the way back to the beginning of time, adults have supported their parents as well as their children. It's something you pay forward, back, and sideways.
Of course that's the ideal and not all families get along well enough for mutual support to happen. OP's parents seem to be doing their best to trash any family bonds, and they are not truly in need anyway. So for now maybe just treat them as trolls and ignore their remarks.

I'm going to throw out the concept of "rebalancing". It's a well known concept in financial circles. Look it up for explanations as to how it works. For example: let's say last month you had X% of your savings in bitcoins, Y% in cash and Z% in other investments. This month your XYZ percentages are very different with X a much higher percent than last month. The idea of rebalancing is to sell some X to put into Y and Z in order to push the XYZ percentages *closer* to what they were last month. This allows you to have peace of mind without cashing out completely. Again, there are good explanations out there for why rebalancing is a good idea for investors. Anyway, this is something you might look into.

Never mind! I just saw this post from 4 days ago 
It indicates that Capital One 360 severed their relationship with bitfloor thus contributing to shutting down bitfloor. And coincident with that, there is some indication that CampBX is no longer using Capitol One 360.

I think the term "silent women" is at issue. It seems to me that "silent women" reads primarily as lurking or silent on every topic as in "women should be silent".
I realize you mean silent (or mostly silent) with regards to gender. I don't know that there is brief way to express that alternate meaning (though on the internet there probably should be).
This thread seems to bring out the gender identification in commenters. Most of doesn't really do that which is fine with me.

If you were writing an essay, you wouldn't leave it at the first draft. This is a first draft. Please incorporate the suggestions (especially from likwidtek) and redo.

No. You only need the public address to verify the collision. Then you have a sparkly perfect copy of the private key. Meanwhile the original encrypted copy of the private key remains uselessly encrypted. Astronomically unlikely but devastating.

If this happens, it has to be a two-way street. If they take bitcoin as a funding instrument, they will accumulate bitcoin and need to do something with it. PayPal isn't going to let any of their funds sit on the shelf. To make this work, they will need a way to sell bitcoins for fiat either by dumping bitcoins onto the exchanges or doing their own exchange.

Well that's nice that life has worked out so well for you. And I agree that this particular family seems like they are not in need, just greedy. But I hope you are not taking it a step further and implying that parents should be ashamed to ask their kids for money if the parents are in need.
