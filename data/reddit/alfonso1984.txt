Not necessarily. The fact that assets can be shorted make them less volatile. It does not mean downward pressure in price by itself. I actually think it makes Bitcoin more liquid so the implications will be positive.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:29:42
They have been saying this for the past years. What did you expect? Most journalist have trouble understanding the basics of finance how do you expect them to u dersta d Bitcoin? Seriously I have seen FT articles and other important media completely clueless about the technology. Any redditer in this forum could write articles 100000 times better
So yeah the media has no idea how Bitcoin works so they are spreading missinformation

I fucking love Switzerland. It is just how I would build a country: freedom, small state, free economy, low taxes, decentralisation. No wonder why is the most successful country in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:16:41
Why should you be? I am seriously astonished that people is scared of the Bitcoin futures going live. It is a positive event and there is no reason to be scared.
I work in the financial industry and maybe that´s why, is it because people don't understand futures or how they work?
I don't know I am completely lost, I would be expecting everyone to be really excited about it and I come here and found the opposite: FUD and people scared of what can happen tomorrow. I will tell you: a very positive development for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:20:11
Maybe, but in the process it has gained adoption and gone mainstream which is good for the long term. Guys stop trying to make money out of Bitcoin in the short term, it is just retarded and you will get burned. Build a stack and hold it until it gets mainstream adoption and stop caring about "dips".
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:24:32
Very sensible plan. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:03:56
Futures are a milestone for Bitcoin it will bring broad acceptance, institutional money, liquidity and legitimacy.
How could this possibly be a negative thing it still does not fit in my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:16:20
Stop trading Bitcoin or trying to decide when to "get in" 
Just keep building your stack and hold for the long term
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:09:47
Makes me cringe every time I see people "oh I am so holding the dip" and Bitcoin is up 30% from previous week
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:28
Precisely this is where bitcoin comes into play. Say if Lightning works you have created an asset good at storing value and making transactions
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:42
Good, we need dem money from rich saudi princes into Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:12:33
No, why? I really don't understand all this FUD about the futures. Is the most positive development that has happened to Bitcoin since its inception. How can the futures be a negative event? Price will rally!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:14
I hold it to see if it becomes the next revolution in money/finance and is worth millions and I will keep holding until then or losing a quantity of money that does not bother me (for now)
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:05:49
Of course there will not be an institutional selloff! Futures will adjust to the price Bitcoin trades at and institutional investors who want to get in will get in and the ones that don't trust Bitcoin will just ignore it. Nobody in is right mind would short Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:21:30
I am not in Bitcoin to make  few thousand dollars. I put some of my savings in Bitcoin, an amount I can afford to lose, in case it becomes a revolution like the Internet.
I will only consider realising the gains in this scenario. I am buying a certain amount every month or so and have never sold and will not sell at 20.000, 30.000 nor 50.000. I will maybe sell when it reaches a point that the quantity is life-changing and would mean that Bitcoin has become a true revolution and gone mainstream like I think will happen.
I honestly cringe everytime I see "oh i bought the dip 10% profit..." Guys to trade like this there are better options with lower fees than Bitcoin (I am thinking Forex or stocks)
Since I follow this approach I really don't care about the price but about big developments like futures accepted or so.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:20
Well right now there is. I am talking about a future where it would have got mass adoption and stabilised like Gold for example
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:57:25
Can we keep the panic price threads for when there is a sustained downtrend and not just volatility?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:13
Bitcoin can be both
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:53:05
It is not, if at some point you can pay in Bitcoins almost everywhere why go back to fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:23
Well obviously by definition, I am just poking at people panicking when is still up 30% from a week ago and more than 1000% this year
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:00:06
I think that most of those Bitcoins are in inactive addresses and just lost
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:10:28
People come for the price but some discover the technology and engage in the community. More price means more wealth to the community including develolers, and means also more funding and research in new technologies.

Fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:20:58
I don't care of the VAT tax, but I do care about the capital gains tax, because for having gains I have had to risk my capital when others chose maybe to keep it safe. If it plays out good for me what right does the government have to take from my gains? And all this after they just took a big chunk of my salary! 
I Switzerland, government regulates all those things without capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:42
Yes and please if you are not able to deal with the price swings don't shitpost about the "dip" when in fact is up 30% this week
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:40:20
Can it be considered a dip something up 30% last 7 days?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:02:51
Price crashing?
What the fuck guys last week we were making memes about 9000 and considering it a milestone and now it goes down to 14.000 and it is a dip and we should be worried?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:11:53
I want to live in Bitcoin and never pay it. We didnt invent Bitcoin to pay more taxes. Fuck them 20% of my gains? Are they going to bail me out if I lose?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:42:23
September 10th less difficulty and slowly more adoption of Segwit. It will start to get better. If it weren't for the stupid fork in November Bitcoin would be slowly appreciating.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:17:47
If Jihan is the only one staying when difficulty adjusts he is basically subsidising the rest of the miners right? That come there when difficulty is low, cash in, then switch to Bitcoin. And if Jihan leaves Bcash dies so he has no choice.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:00:08
If we had Segwit activated a year ago like Core was proposing, we wouldn't have high fees by now
If Bcash was never created we wouldn't have hash swings so we wouldn't have such high fees
To me it looks clear that the ones spreading FUD about high fees are the same ones that created this situation.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:11:32
Segwit already allows for big blocks up to 4MB.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:38:05
For me, Bcash changed the whole scene. It is the exact thing NYA was trying to avoid. So I don't know if a block increase will be needed next year, but we should at least postpone this madness fork on November and discuss the best strategy. And also let Segwit some time for adoption and see how Lightning network works.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:34:49
The problem is that the value of both chains combined may be way less than what it is now.
I don't think this is going to happen. Some miners are clearly bluffing, they won't want to blow up all their possible profits for what? For increasing the blocksize to 2X? When Segwit will already be mining blocks equivalent to 2MB-4MB?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:33:02
I am really sorry.
Not pointing at you but asking in general: why do you guys keep trying to secure the seed words in your computer?
Just write them down for god's sake and you will decrease the chances of being robbed by millions.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:49:15
Yes but it is terribly harmful to Bitcoin brand.
Seriously normies have enough by trying to understand how Bitcoin works, then go explain them that there is the original Bitcoin, then Bitcoin Cash and then Bitcoin 2X and that if they buy any it could be their coins will get split in the future and to collect them they will need to do complicated things which they don't want to talk about.
Don't you see that this will kill Bitcoin's credibility? We should avoid this at all cost.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:35:28
Exactly, but with the room provided by Segwit as it is adopted there is just no need to rush it now
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:54:26
Open an account in Coinbase to buy it.
My advice is not to hold it into the exchange (Coinbase) but move it to your own wallet.
You could also look for a Bitcoin ATM at your city.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:41:37
Well we saw Litecoin skyrocket when it approved Segwit, I think we can safely say there is a market pattern
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:36:06
Yes you just need to look at the volume. The volume spike today clearly points to big players pumping it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:22:58
I don't really trust those "experts" but it is good publicity for Bitcoin, the average Joe reads the article and gets more interested.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:00:19
Since they want to appropriate of Bitcoin brand and to it without replay protection
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:35:54
BCH is down 5% to $604 people are starting to realise. If it keeps falling not even the difficulty adjustment will make it more profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:32:35
Well may increase unless the dumpening continues and the price is so low it is not profitable to mine it
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:09:26
I think at least it will get postponed.
2MB blocks are not a bad idea but we need to do it properly and not rushing
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:44:22
Thank you!
For now the second one is the most useful
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:10:52
Not with a rushed hard fork, ideally I would like everyone to take a breath, given the fact that SegWit will alleviate some of the pressure with an already increased capacity, and then think of the best way of increasing block size. 
But I just think it is inevitable. Lightning network is not going to solve the scaling issue in the short term and if we don't increase capacity the other altcoins will keep eating on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:34:55
Let him make his own decision.
If he wants to join, tell him not to keep his Bitcoins in an exchange. So he should use the exchange as a means to acquire Bitcoin with fiat money but then transfer it to his own wallet. 
Ideally a hardware wallet Trezor or Ledger.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:39:54
Also now I was thinking: we could also solve the anonymity if it were possible to do atomic swaps with Monero. You just convert to Monero and back to Bitcoin and your bitcoins would be untraceable.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:10:47
It is plainly obvious that they created this coin to continue exploiting Asicboost. Otherwise what is the point? They could have supported 2X
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:07:06
Bcash is disrupting miner hash to Bitcoin with their faulty difficulty adjustment. It was born to annoy Bicoin and that's what's happening
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:49:10
I honestly think it is positive if we implement Segwit and then increase the block size to 2MB. I hope the NYA agreement holds.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:51:46
The point is: all users agree that decentralisation is beneficial.
However, here we are not talking the preferences of users because the whole debate is because other players (miners) have complete different preferences than users: they don't give a shit about decentralisation and even though off chain transactions would be the best choice for user experience and scalability they don't give a shit either because all they want is lots of transactions on the main chain to make money. If it needs to be centralised and work worse than off chain solutions so be it, because when governments shut it down or it dies or another coin is better they will already be rich and have amortised their investment in hardware which is all they care about.
So stop trying to convince users that decentralisation is desirable, start telling people that there are two interests: users vs miners and that we need to win the battle.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:37:10
Which confirms that most of the problems were coming from hash swings because of Bcash
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:14:35
I actually did and until now it has been a good decision.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:14:59
Opportunity cost if it is frictionless it can be considered a loss.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:32:58
Thank you again, all clear now.
I will leave here a useful link I found if it is useful to people reading this thread:
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:23:51
If things don't change yes it is likely to stop when Bcash halves the rewards per block. But I would say the price won't sustain long enough forthat to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:09:53
They can keep celebrating it to zero
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:49:03
The thing is most people who hold BCH can't sell so for now it is cheap to prop up the price.
If Jihan is willing to mine BCH at loss he is also willing to buy some every once in a while. If you watch the price vs volume ( you will see it is correlated. This means somebody is pumping up the currency with big payments.
Since most people have their coins stuck at Coinbase and other exchanges the market cap is not real. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:25:34
Thank you.
When I downloaded Bitcoin Core's software for the full node it downloaded the entire block chain.
Does the new download act as a patch to this software or the new version downloads again all the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:31:34
It will be really difficult to support that once Segwit is implemented, because it will prove it is a great improvement.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:11:46
It depends. If people stick to the original Bitcoin because they like the Core programmers or the decentralised philosophy then miners will follow because it will still be the most crowded and valued chain.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:17:13
The agreement was trying to avoid a fork, which happened because of Bcash.
In Bitcoin we will have Segwit which will alleviate the pressure.
So why rush a solution, provoke a fork that can break Bitcoin apart and kick the most talented developers in the arse?
All that for what? For increasing the blocksize 2x which we won't need immediately when Segwit activates?
The only ones pushing it are the ones that want to see Bitcoin in chaos to profit in their altcoin Bcash.
But I expect the economic actors that have high stakes put in Bitcoin mostly come to the point where they agree 2X is not necessary and the NYA has been violated in so many ways it does not make sense anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:43:14
Once exchanges allow to sell, it's over
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:43:51
Well it wouldn't surprise me given their technical illiteracy 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:07:13
Nobody wants the shit Bcash because everyone knows is going to be worthless.
So yeah it would make sense for the Bitcoin Unlimited crew to just joint Bcash and stop moaning, but they won't because everyone wants to take over Bitcoin.
Personally, I think 2MB is not that bad and that we can't expect Lightning Network to flourish in two days. 
I think SegWit gives a bit of breathing space and that we should all pause and rethink, I think we will need to update the block size but with a good plan not rushing it with SegWit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:00:56
I find lots of "normies" talking about it at work, way more than I would ever expect.
It was when my boss, completely negligent in technologies, was talking about investing, that I bought more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:44:48
BCH accomplished nothing but to attack Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:02:48
My advice would be to dump your Bcash as soon as you can.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:41:41
Not only because of what it means in terms of works an achievement, but also because it will alleviate the pressure on transactions and fees, and also allow for off chain scalability solutions. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:22:41
Who told you they are not secure?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:29:14
The problem is that some of them will not be happy with Bitcoin and Bcash competing freely, what they want is to attack Bitcoin for the benefit of Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:41:18
No because it will cease to exist
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:20:07
To me, the whole point about hashrate seems pointless. The important thing is that there is no real demand for BCH. Except for the occasional pumps the price can't sustain and the volume drops rapidly.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:10:57
Segwit is enough to give Bitcoin some breathing time. Even if the 2x fork does not happen miners won't blow up all their business.
By the time we get to the forc BCH will be worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:15:39
2MB blocks will not be necessary at least temporarily after Segwit.
Segwit2x is the code written in a rushed manner by a team of programmers characterised by doing poor work.
2MB may be necessary but the ideal thing to do would be to take a step back and evaluate.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:48:24
If it is not legally binding the only thing that holds it is honour, and in doing questionable things like splitting Bitcoin with BCH and now mining on the other chain this honour that is supposed to hold the agreement is already broken.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:42:19
But why rushing it? I don't know if increasing the blocksize will be necessary. But I don't see the point in doing it in a rushed manner like B2X.
Segwit will provide some breathing space, why don't we take a step back and analyse the next steps?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:43:16
On Coinbase you'll need to wait until January 2018
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:42:12
Well and it is not even implemented yet.
Imagine when confirmation times are reduced, when blocksize is incremented effectively 1.7, when fees get lower...
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:11:45
Well but if I own Monero and suddently somebody creates an altcoin called Monero cash I may hate them for trying to confuse people and steal the work my community has done.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:56:43
Today Bcash it fell -11% against the dollar and -16% against Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:18:59
Great! The faster Segwit adoption goes, the less chances for the 2X fork to succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:04:13
Honestly if Segwit already increases blocksize effectively and Bcash exists what is the point of 2x?
And if there is a point because we will need more capacity in the end that's ok, but what is the point of rushing it now?
Won't Segwit provide some breathing space? Why does the increase need to happen now in a rushed manner and with a poor code?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:57:47
I am really proud to have brought in a colleague recently who is now a Bitcoin enthusiast, shares all Reddit posts with me before I have even seen them and has built a Raspberry Pi node he has plugged in 24/7.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:46:37
It is increasing exponentially so in a few months we could expect some relieve to the capacity of the blockchain, we just need to let Segwit play out. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:57:59
In the meantime Segwit adoption will bring enough relief.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:13:15
We need to understand that the interests of miners may not be the interest of users.
Users prioritise a decentralised network and want instant payments and low fees and they don't care if it is on a second layer.
Miners don't care about centralisation neither about the user experience, they just want the highest profit possible, and some of them also have hidden agendas like Asicboost. 
So it is not rare that they are butthurt at something that improves user experience
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:41:41
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:41:29
Means instant swap of Bitcoin for Litecoin (or any other currency that supports Lightning) without the need for an exchange and with lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:17:57
Well the whole point of the NYA was not to fork Bitcoin, which they did anyway so the agreement ceases to have a point
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:31:59
It is important to point out how a failure Bcash is (and will be) to make sure we avoid stupid decisions on Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:57:43
Encourage it because taxation is theft
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:59:13
Great technology that should have been implemented ages ago.
When we start seeing it implemented with increased capacity on the chain the price will go to the Moon.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:28:25
Getting really excited, Lignthing Network, even if it is 1% of what it promises to be, is going to be huge. If they can actually deliver on what they promised, sky is the limit.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:19:06
If this happens, the capacity of the blockchain will be 4 times the actual one. It means 4 more people have acquired Bitcoin. It could take some years yet, by then we hope 2nd layer solutions will be available.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:14:38
I am a newbie: so the price you get is not the one at the moment of the transaction but the one when gets 20 confirmations for certain exchanges?

@_date: 2017-08-31 20:14:04
Very good publicity, things are going well
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:28:04
Well Lightning network is a good start since it will be layered like Tor. Massive increase in fungibility and privacy.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:25:58
It is a Soft fork, so it needs some time for adoption.
Here you can track Segwit transactions:
We expect some relief when the percentage starts growing
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:21:37
The problem is that now BCH is likely to fall in price, which could leverage this profitability. So who is going to take the burden?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:50:33
Patience... Eventually market forces will come into play and nobody will want to be the last one to have Segwit because competitors will be offering it so they will have lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:50:56
Well because Bcash didn't exist when it was signed and a contentious hard fork worse than Bcash was approaching so the NYA singers tried to avoid a huge hard fork by bringing consensus which was Segwit but also 2X.
But right now, Bcash has already happened, the big blockers have their toy already, so pushing ahead with 2X is madness, is making yet another split in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:33:53
I agree, Segwit2x needs to be postponed, the circumstances have changed with Bcash
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:55:57
Segwit BCHes
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:00:31
Not technically speaking but it certainly is an insult to call their shitcoin "bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:39:20
Because if Lightning is what it promises to be we won't need to increase blocksize.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:40:54
Well fine, I meant "start synchronising" then
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:38:44
Most anonymous ways are ATMs that don't ask for identification and exchanging it directly for cash with somebody who has Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:12:57
No there isn't and you don't understand how Bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:34:07
I'm sitting there with popcorn just watching the dumpening
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:51:50
The key is "people to buy it".
So far if you look at the volume, there are the pumps which coincide with peaks in volume and then it suddently dries up
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:05:03
Yes but some things delay adoption, slow things down and benefit other altcoins.
Where would we be if Segwit was activated a year ago and now had broad adoption with the increase capacity in the network? 
And if Bcash was never created? We would not have the swings in hashpower.
So yeah definetely Bitcoin survived Bcash and survived the FUD against Segwit, but at a price. In the same manner it will survive 2X but it will also come at a price.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:12:41
it is not when is all that miners care
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:14:33
Well they know they have bet everything in a doomed coin, so they need to keep it functioning and exit slowly, this is precisely what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:44:26
Ok thanks, that's what I was missing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:54:04
I think the same, but why do it in a rushed manner? It made sense when the NYA but after Bitcoin Cash?
I just think we need to see how Segwit plays out and then if we still need it we can do 2MB increase...
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:13:06
It is not a cool experiment. It is irresponsible, stupid, and damages bitcoin brand, scares normies away and confuses people in general.
Do you think the average Joe has the same knowledge/expertise or time to spend as you probably do?
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:26:27
Anonymous way of dealing with Bitcoin, I still believe is to good to be true that they let those things exist
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:19:44
Probably has decided is too expensive to maintain the price of Bcash and has stopped pumping money.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:18:27
The chain will have mos of nodes and userbase, the best developers and with Segwit enough capacity to implement a good solution (which could be at some point increasing block size) instead of rushing it.
If it keeps being the best chain with the best developers, the decentralised ideology and security of transactions above all, it will still be Bitcoin and eventually the miners will want to be where the users are.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:06:44
Step 1: Create altcoin
Step 2: Call it Bitcoin to create confusion
Step 3: Set an algorithm that ensures death long term but is enough to keep it living short term
Step 4: When major wallets and exchanges haven't updated yet pump the price (with selling capacity being limited should be possible)
Step 5: Spread false rumours that you are buying it
Step 6: Wait for Koreans to be confused by name "Bitcoin" and pump the price to $700
Step 7: Sell.
Step 8: Laugh at people who has their Bcash trapped at coinbase that will get to sell on January below $10

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:16:01
This doesn't work because they are the ones pumping it to keep the price up, and it is becoming extremely expensive because of the inflation they are creating, because other mines come, mine, and sell and they need to keep pumping money to keep it up.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:36:57
If we get to do atomic Swaps isn't the whole problem about scalability solved?
I mean we can build a coin with Segwit and no limit blocks. Everyone should know that it is more centralised and could be taken down and people should keep their Bitcoins safe as if it was their savings account and then transfer small quantities to the newly created coin for everyday spending.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:07:19
And didn't you witness what Litecoin's price did when implementing this formula?
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:22:55
I don't see how.
If there is consensus and Segwit2x gets implemented without a fork Bcash gets obliterated and is completely useless.
If Segwit2x results in another fork most of the miners won't go to Bcash but they will try to win on the original Bitcoin.
It is really unlikely that if Segwit2x is not about to be implemented miners give up on Bitcoin and start mining Bcash. Instead they would try to take over Bitcoin.
So I don't see how this could play out well for Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:06:45
There will be no split now. The potential fork is in November.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:51:51
The problem will fix itself. If there are many Segwit transactions they will start giving out profits.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:14:40
It has been implemented perfectly and it is working as expected.
The only thing is that it needs adoption and time for wallets/exchanges to adapt.
But with lower fees market forces will quickly force Segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:43:30
That was the objective of Bcash promoters all the way. But in my opinion the weaker currency (Bcash) will not be able to stand it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:48:29
If every transaction were Segwit it would already be 4MB aprox. without 2X.
With 2x could be as high as 8
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:22:19
More Segwit transactions ---&gt; More room in blocks ---&gt; lower fees ---&gt; lower need of 2X

Simplest or most intuitive way to buy:
1. Download MyCelium app for Android
2. Select "create backup" and write down the 12 words
3. Find local Bitcoin ATM
4. Put cash on ATM
5. Click "receive" on MyCelium app and scan the code
Cograts you just bought your first bitcoin and are part of the revolution.
Then find better ways to store it and just hodl.

Seriously? A coin that depends on a chinese guy oversleeping to set its algorithm? Don't insult Bitcoin please.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:07:32
Guys you forget the most important. Pumps aside, BCH has very low volume and some people are just holding because they can't sell (which allows the pumps).
What happens if in 2 days Segwit activates driving people into Bitcoin and difficulty adjustment in BCH multiplies 4x.
You get Bitcoin price raising, BCH price sliding and difficulty rising 4x for BCH. That means the miner who is going to stay has to bear a huge burden.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:07:28
But if you sell them and buy Bitcoin then you have a larger share of the appreciation
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:19:34
They may not be against it in the medium-long term, they are against doing it now.
Especially since when Segwit activates we will potentialy have 2-4MB blocks, so there is no need at all for this rushed increase.
The only reason behind this agreement was to try to avoid a fork, which already happened in Bcash, but it does not have sense as it is staged now.
So Core devs may come to the point in 6 months that an increase in block size is necessary, just there is no need to do it rushed and without studying well the situation.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:42:03
Which means Bitcoin over $5.000 granted when Bcash disappears.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:58:54
Has Mycelium given any explanation at all?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:53:07

New high of $3.934
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:44:06
pumpers still have their money there. If there is a sudden decrease they will not be able to get it all out
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:37:53
Well in 8 hours Segwit will be implemented, in the following weeks the blocksize will go from 1MB to 2-4MB.
For some months until the chain feels the pressure again, we will be fine. So no need to rush 2X.
And besides, if it weren't because some actors were blocking it, Segwit would already be activated for more than a year and we wouldn't have got to such fees
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:28:44
For me, doubling the block size could be contemplated in say 8-9 months if Segwit is not playing out as expected.
But in a few months Segwit will have broad adoption and this doubling of the blocksize will already be a thing.
Then we can let Lightning and other solutions play out. If they don't in the end we will need to double the block size.
But we don't want to do it irreversibly if we can avoid it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:17:21
And it will only get worse, if we assume demand is somewhat constant there can only be more supply as people get the possibility of selling.
So there are lots of reasons to believe there will be more people willing (or with the ability of) selling but no reasons to think there will be more demand.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:11:42
Or one miner or two could stay in a higly demanded market and take all the profit for themselves, which is likely to happen in an open market.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:39:01
But there is a small volume in Bcash, if he does so he would move the price so much that he would sell most of its Bcash for nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:30:56
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:04:04
To this day, I still don't understand why Nodes don't get at least a small reward.
It does not need to be a huge reward like miners, but to incentivise the max decentralisation it could be a small reward, that at least pays for the electricity and a bit more.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:23:51
For me, Core could easily kill the agreement with the following statement:
"If Segwit deployment and off-scaling solutions have not improved the capacity of Bitcoin by August 2018 we will agree to a blocksize increase"
Segwit just needs time for adoption and Lightning is very promising. So we just need time, the fork can not happen in November because it would mean ruining Bitcoin forever when we are so close to solve scalability by other means. And if we fail, then we would need to increase blocksize at some point anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:07:26
Poor guys they truly think bcash is going to become the true bitcoin xD
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:46:00
The proof of ownership are the keys. When you open a wallet (download mycelium for Android for example) you will do a backup. Write down those 12 words, those 12 words are your Bitcoin because are the private keys.
As long as you hold the keys the bitcoin is yours. If you hold it into an exchange is not really yours.
You can spend it, or you can open an account at anytime and put them on the brokerage and exchange for fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:59:56
That's what Andreas Antonopoulos said: bitcoin screws up everyone but each country will think "yes but it screws up more the dominance of this other country than me"
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:03:41
You should keep your coins in a wallet where you hold your private keys, not in an exchange.
A hardware wallet is more secure than any other wallet, look up Trezor and Ledger hard wallets.
So in terms of security hardware wallet &gt; wallet where you hold your keys &gt; exchange
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:58:06
But we need widespread adoption first
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:47:46
Useful, I am also checking it
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:02:57
Nothing went wrong. There has been a solution on the table for over a year, called Segwit. Had it been activated a year before, the capacity of the network would be the double now.
Instead Segwit was blocked by miners for oposed interests as to those of users: namely because some of them wanted to keep using Asicboost and because they don't want off-chain transactions to be a thing.
So instead of complaining about high fees, why don't you complain to the ones that blocked a solution that was on the table for more than a year and well tested?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:22:16
This all will lead to a death spiral: if it keeps working like that price will go down, if price goes down even more volatile swings are needed to convince miners to switch, once they do they will need to mine more Bcash to be able to match Bitcoin's profitability, if they do so there is more Bcash issued and if demand does not keep up the price sinks further.
All this leads us to January when Coinbase accounts will be able to sell Bcash and tons of people will sell.
If you hold Bcash if I were you I would sell it right now (if you can).
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:36:33
That's why there is no way to enforce it which leads us to conclude that simply men and women are two different groups which pursue different interests, and that the whole gender gap thing is bullshit because closing it means tying the hand to the back of one of the groups.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:48:07
I agree with you 100%. I don't understand why we can't give some more time to Segwit to play out and when we are about to hit another burden approach the situation without rushing it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:53:37
It is clear at this point that only big corporation miners support 2X, not the users.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:57:36
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:43:15
But the same ones that want to rush 2X were blocking Segwit for more than a year.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:39:31
But if users don't switch and the price keeps strong, eventually they will come back.
Ok we may experience 24h or 48h of slow blocks, but what is this compared to Bitcoin history? Once the dust settles Bitcoin will be stronger than ever.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:26:37
Thanks, I see why it makes sense now.
Anyway as I understand v0.14.2 (the one I just downloaded now) is already compatible with Segwit so in the short term I shouldn't worry right?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:40:20
This is going to be huge
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:24:48
Why not create an altcoin and use it?
Because the market that its built around a coin is what matters. If that person would like to have Litecoin he surely would have it and for lower fees.
But if Bitcoin has higher fees is because right now is the most demanded currency. Probably because it is the most widely accepted one so there must be some other benefits that weight more than fees. Otherwise the coin with lowest fees would have all the market cap of all altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:29:40
"but also recognize that being locked into a 1mb blocksize is a bad idea."
But even if you think so, at least we know Segwit will alleviate the pressure until we can figure out the best way and do it properly. Why do it in a rushed manner like 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:11:59
Probably with Lightning you can make that happen with a Smart contract that could be executed before the end of the trip only?
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:41:24
If it had been activated instead of blocked for over a year we would already be in the relief of Segwit adoption. It is miner's fault for blocking Segwit that we are in such situation. Plus creating Bcash for doing the hashrate attaks on Bitcoin. You realise the damage they have done so far?
If they had not blocked Segwit we would already have broad adoption with 2-4MB blocks and Lightning starting to alleviate more pressure.
You can't shit on the table and complain there is a shit.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:08:45
Big miners are not retarded, what do you do if you switch but there is no actual demand for this coin?
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:35:55
But that leads to 2 blocks per minute for 12h then no mining at all for 12h or blocks every 6h. 
It is not sustainable and leads to higher inflation and if it goes on like that in 3 months there will be the halvening of miner reward... All that if the price does not go down, which could accelerate things.
So the video is a perfect analogy, BCash is slowly being eroded because of the same mechanism that is supposed to save it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:40:48
I agree, but still is no good faith to try to steal Bitcoin's brand and misguide people
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:31:09
The NYA was created to avoid what already happened which is Bcash.
It was a way to bring big blockers and Segwit to consensus. Right now, after Bcash happened, there are both coins so 2X doesn't make a lot of sense.
But yeah I agree, if we get fast Segwit adoption and we start mining 2MB blocks the 2X hard fork will seem even less necessary (at least now)
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:57:35
I just bought a used laptop for under $200 to have it running 24/7 with a Bitcoin Core node. I just want to help the network and Core.
However, I think the system is a bit flawed in that the nodes don't get any reward at all. Even if it were really small amounts I think nodes should be rewarded. It would incentivise more nodes and more decentralisation.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:00:55
I bought more bitcoin when my boss (working in a financial institution but in his 50s and completely "normie") asked me about it and how could he invest.
It is going mainstream really fast.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:42:22
But it can not permanently scale on chain without becoming a completely different thing, less decentralised and censorship resistant.
So the long term solution is off chain transactions based on Lightning.
If we come to agree to this point, then it is useless to do a hard fork to increase the block size, it is a temporal patch that can't be undone, it is very irresponsible.
I don't know if we will need to increase the blocksize eventually, all we are asking for is 6-8 months to see how Segwit adoption relieves the pressure and Lightning network starts to play a role.
If those don't work, we can all then happily increase the block size because is the only way.
Miners want to block off chain solutions. Otherwise why were they boycotting Segwit? They could have defended blocksize increases but approving Segwit a year ago.
So is not that miners want the best for users and the ecosystem, they want the best for them, which is not the same as for users.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:57:30
Even if it is a store of value there will be trading. Eventually you will want to use it and even if you remove small quantities it is enough for miners to survive.
Also if it is only store of value less miners will be needed.
For me the ideal situation is that it becomes both a store of value and a valid method for payments. That way you won't have to pay taxes to convert your "store of value" to fiat because you will be able to buy a house with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:00:08
Can it buy the same houses only 2% less per year?
They trick you into believing that CPI is inflation, when in fact it is just a basket of goods like food which keep getting cheaper because of productivity.
Ask yourself if you can buy the same house with the $ equivalent of 70 years ago discounting by CPI inflation and you will see the trick.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:27:33
To this day I still don't understand how Big Blockers made the error of allowing BCash. I don't know if they thought it would thrive and now they face reality or what, but it was a big mistake from their side.
Something the message does not take into account is that Segwit will activate in 15 days and then we still have 3 months until 2x activates. During those 3 months people will see the pressure alleviated thanks to Segwit so there will be also less understanding as to why we would rush big blocks and take Core from the lead when all this success is thanks to them and everyone knows they are the most capable programmers.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:46:47
We really need for this situation to normalise. We need mining to be spread out all over the world in different countries, not in the cartel there is right now.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:35:23
The most complete article about what's going on in Bcash so far
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:08:15
He wants to avoid inflation because it is becoming too expensive for him to keep pumping $ to keep the BCH price from falling
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:19:48
Well failure in terms of creating a serious coin that could compete against BTC.
It may be a success of their own pyramid scheme though.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:21:25
It really makes me cringe when they are like "yay Bitcoin is going up, guyz also hold Bcash it is a good buying opportunity he he"
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:44:04
If they do it is questionable that the chain survives, because right now it mainly has hashpower because of this. If they don't do something it is going to die anyway because this is not sustainable.
But I guess it is destiny, there can only be one bitcoin and the big fish eats the small one.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:38:03
Bitcoin is a brand. Ok a not registered brand but still a brand.
There can only be one and here there is one with the highest market cap, with stable mining, most proof of work and where most users and economic actors (as well as miners) agree that this is bitcoin.
Calling the other thing "Bitcoin" is just meant to confuse people
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:18:16
What consensus? Most of miners support it, but those are the same miners blocking Segwit for over a year.
They do not seek community consensus, they do not care about user experience. They wanted to block second layer solutions only because it was in their own interest, no matter if it was an interesting solution for users.
So no, of course I am not going to trust those miners, because essentially they defend miner's interests only and I am not a miner, I am a user of Bitcoin and I really care for its success, not my short term gains.
Besides: maybe you don't like their way to communicate, but Core is the most capable team there is and have been demonstrating that for a long time.
Who are you going to trust the same ones that put a random algorithm on BCH and now it's broke?
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:57:54
Well what if your girlfriend comes regularly to your house and scratches your car? Because that's what Bcash does with the hashpower.
Then there is no need to be neutral anymore. Their doom is our success.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:18:43
This guy gets it, the problem is BCH adoption and its price. As long as most of users stay with Bitcoin and decide it is worth almost 7 times more, BCH will have to sell itself cheap to miners to attract them, but this doesn't change the fact that it is Bitcoin the one with widespread adoption. If BCH's price starts to decrease there will be no EDA which can save it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:28:08
So you admit the hard fork is rushed and unsafe.
Segwit will start being adopted alleviating the pressure. So why do a rushed and unsafe fork?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:20:51
Not if price goes down. If miners mine more, there is more inflation, who is going to buy it? And if they sell, even worse
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:33:37
I wonder what is the explanation feminists would give to justify that 90% of bitcoin holders are male.
I mean it is completely free to join, nobody is pressured to do it, it was not in our education...
It may be simply that males are more of risk takers by nature which means we are not equal in behaviour and qualities.
Which makes the whole thing about companies hiring 50-50% scary.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:13:14
I just saw it? WTF is going on? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:40:15
But the main chain will be almost impossible to shut down, so will be Lightning Network because anyone will be able to run a node. So I don't see the centralisation.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:16:53
This is why we need Lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:29:43
Clearly the market is discounting the fact that SegWit is a superior technology.
Litecoin went from $4 to $44 with Segwit.
Not saying that Bitcoin will multiply its value, this is unlikely, but clearly the market loves Segwit
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:02:15
In the end it matters to which chain the users stick. If you have the userbase the miners will follow. And all the hashpower in the world will be useless if you don't have demand.
So the users are in power and I would say the majority are against 2x. At least doing it this way, in a rushed manner and kicking out Core from the lead team.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:11:31
This would make 2X even more insane
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:51:46
Why would we want to remove it? Segwit has no negatives
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:56:45
I bought more Bitcoin a month ago when my boss asked me about it (he is over 50 and has to ask his children to configure the Iphone for him, couldn't be more "normie") 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:27:24
That's what I thought: it only makes sense if you want to destroy Bitcoin or create chaos to profit if you hold BCash. Otherwise there is no reason for 2X. I am not saying that block size doesn't need to increase at some point, I am saying it does not make sense to do it now and in this way.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:30:25
Well that is precisely an argument against block size increase. What if 8MB is not enough? Then 16MB? 32MB? Until you have a blockchain that can't be run by decentralised individual nodes...
It is clear that the only solution long term are side chains like Lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:47:25
Except that if users stay in the main chain and price keeps strong, miners will come back.
Ok we may experience extremely low transactions for 24-48h but what is this compared to screwing up Bitcoin forever?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:01:04
Well they can surely consider, but not now. Why should Core consider it in a rushed manner?
Segwit will be activating, this will give some breathing room, it will take some time until blocks are full again. Why don't we take some time to think then and do it properly if we need to? What is the rush behind 2MB blocks if when Segwit activates we won't be at maximum capacity??
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:33:56
Yes but it was just activated 3 days ago, it needs at least some weeks for the major wallets/exchanges to allow transactions and then market forces will drive Segwit adoption because it allows cheaper fees.
Trezor just activated Segwit today.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:27:43
We have Segwit so there is no excuse to upgrade and pay lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:18:35
You should invest in Trezor or Ledger. Better than Mycelium and infinitely more secure.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:51:59
Is it possible at all to day trade with such fees from exchanges and miners?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:57:51
Does running a Core Node help?
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:19:40
If they already have Bcash why don't they go play with their new toy and leave Bitcoin alone?
What point does 2x accomplish? If they think bigger blocks are better why don't they just switch to Bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:26:06
So does Litecoin and every other Coin, maybe that's because they don't have $70 billion market cap and the volume that Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:35:12
you can also buy that and put your Ledger inside:
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:18:45
Unless there is a hard development such as a fork in the original Bitcoin or something because of a disagreement, Bcash is just going to be forgotten as another altcoin.
The problem is that Bcash gave up from the beginning on being the "true Bitcoin". 
It is with the true Bitcoin that lays the brand, the acceptance and everything.
Otherwise what does Bcash have that Litecoin doesn't?
Litecoin has 4MB blocks if I'm not mistaken SegWit which fixes several bugs such as malleability and has more decentralised mining.
So why would Bcash be so special if it has given up on being "the true bitcoin" for becoming a simple altcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:45:31
I don't agree, by forking Bcash they declared war. The doom of Bcash is bullish for Bitcoin (and even more after the hash swings), therefore informing people that Bcash is doomed and fighting them is necessary and positive for Bitcoin. Keep it up guys.
Welcome to the real world. We are not all holding hands below the rainbow.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:03:03
Poor people are pretending they cheer the dumping of Bcash because "they will be able to buy cheap"
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:26:10
Step 1: Block Segwit for over a year
Step 2: Create an altcoin (Bcash) with a weird algorithm that ensures swings in Bitcoin's hashpower
Step 3: Complain about the fees you created by blocking Segwit and creating Bcash, propose as a solution Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:06:44
They want to kidnap Bitcoin, they don't want the stinky Bcash that nobody wants
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:45:49
But we want wider adoption when we find a promising solution, like Lightning Network, that can escalate to infinity without breaking Bitcoin. Blocks can't increase until infinity.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:13:36
That means only more selling is coming.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:53:37
Why is it so hard to understand?
And if we need to increase the blocksize, fine, we will do it, when we have let Segwit play out and off chain scalability play out, if there is no other way.
But why would we increase it when it is not necessary yet? It is like shooting our own foot.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:32:07
If you trust them and trust Segwit like I do, it is not a foolish statement.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:55:57
But if we keep scaling exponentially maybe we are there in a few years. We need to be cautious, that's what OP says.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:02:13
Well you have Bitcoin 2800 and up, you have Bcash 250 and down, it is just a joke to call it "bitcoin" and only confuses normies.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:04:35
$313 now, clearly the dump has started. Lucky bastards those who have sold until now.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:41:40
Do we know that for sure? Why is there people that says this is not true?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:21:55
But Segwit blocks Asicboost and it is good to avoid centralisation in mining
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:32:39
Good, it will cause less confusion
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:38:19
Well they can't afford it because their money keeps inflating.
If you have bitcoin, which has an equivalence to dollars you could either buy directly in bitcoins from someone selling in the black market or you could sell your bitcoin for bolivares.
1 dollar is currently 16.800 bolívares
So 1 bitcoin is 75 million bolivares aprox. if you echange it for the quantity you need you can then afford toilet paper.
You will not be able to afford toilet paper if you keep bolivar fiat because it loses its value, but bitcoin or the dollar doesn't.
The price of toilet paper is not prohibitive in dollars or bitcoins but in bolivares.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:58:04
If only they would stop with Bcash I wouldn't even care.
But the 2X fork can be more damaging for Bitcoin and they want to do it even without replay protection...
Bcash is a joke, what is coming now is not
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:30:14
The gif is missing Bcash falling
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:20:30
Sure but there will be other altcoins trading for almost no fee and Bitcoin is going to start getting eaten by them.
If a second layer solution was around the corner it could be an option
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:48:24
Well the evidence most people didn't understand the concept of a "soft fork"
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:12:57
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:07:32
I can understand your frustration. However, things are how they are and besides all the FUD Bitcoin keeps growing and pumping every 10 minutes and does so in a secure way and in the end it is true, the average Joe may think "too hard for me" but that is what he thought 4 years ago and now he realises Bitcoin is still around and kicking harder than ever.
And the ones not getting in now because of the FUD, they will regret it in 4 years time because the important thing is Bitcoin keeps working and keeps pumping.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:45:35
We are not conscious of the power we have. We should show our teeth more often to whomever thinks can threaten Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:19:49
Mate we went from 2700 to 4200 in 2 weeks previous to Segwit. Was it rocket science to acknowledge it was priced in?
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:11:22
And because everyone is waiting on confirmations to dump, the more mining power the faster the dumping, so leads to lower price and less profitability.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:32:22
But it was signed before the Bcash split, and also before we have actually seen Segwit in action.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:08:35
Best thing they can do is call it Bcash and stop copying Bitcoin's logo so people don't get confused with this altcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:28:02
If there is no intervention against it (like the governments banning it) expect it to skyrocket, just like gold.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:36:30
I am running one already, but how will this help? Our problem will be hashpower if most of miners leave the main chain for B2X, so how does running a Core node help?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:37:42
3900 recently
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:09:04
If the users stay, and the nodes stay, enough miners are going to stay. No one gives up easy profits.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:04:14
Exactly, exchanges are meant to trade, not to keep your Bitcoin there.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:30:03
I just bougt an Asus used laptop for like $175 and hopefully tomorrow I will have it ready and running 24/7 Core node.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:14:26
Imagine what the transaction fees would be if:
- We had activated Segwit a year ago and use of Segwit was say 70% of the transactions
- Bcash didn't exist and so neither the swings in hashrate
What I mean is that the same people who complain about fees and confirmation time are the ones to blame for this situation.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:19:18
Well nice try to re-brand Bitcoin, but no matter what, the survivor of the main chain will still be Bitcoin and Bcash will be an altcoin forever.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:26:18
Only 0.5% of transactions are Segwit, to see the effects a majority of the transactions need to become Segwit. That is why we will see the effects of the relief in the coming months. And that's why I pointed at people who have been blocking Segwit (miners) for over a year for their own political reasons. Had segwit activated a year before, most of transactions would be Segwit now, effectively increasing the capacity of the network two times.
Now we will have to wait for adoption in the coming months. But relief of fees and capacity is slowly coming.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:35:00
Each side actually has exactly what they wanted (in 2 days):
There will be a coin with 8MB blocks no Segwit
There will be a coin with 1MB (2-4MB real) with Segwit
Why have a fork that can risk everything? I would only support this fork if I wanted Bitcoin to crash to profit because I would be holding Bcash...
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:01:56
Nice! Thank you guys
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:22:22
Except for a difficulty adjustment algorithm that is broke
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:46:07
Yes but the market moves with economic incentives, and I was asking for what has been answered above: Segwit transactions pay less fees. Now I understand the whole picture. Eventually market forces will bring everyone to use such transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:43:54
Only because its proposition convinced most users, exchanges, wallets and miners.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:09:56
But by then the price may have got so low that it is not profitable to mine anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:09:02
Made the meme to early is falling -11% now
-16% against Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:25:35
I didn't know ATMs had a camera.
Too good to be true.
However wearing a cap or something you could easily disguise it.
I think the next invention in Bitcoin needs to be a way of anonymously buying it. Some sort of decentralised app.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:59:52
It could actually be both.
Gold was a standard for coins and also a store of value.
Right now the price is too volatile but in the end it could resemble the price of Gold, and it would be enough stable to be used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:12:46
Very good news.
If we just have enough hashpower to keep going and not disrupt the chain they can do whatever they will only create another Bcash even with less support.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:43:39
I have a Trezor wallet where I have my investments in Bitcoin in large quantities. Then I have some in MyCelium app in my phone which I use for spending it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:49:07
Not more control but there is more centralisation. If we keep increasing the blocksize nodes will not be individuals but data server companies, easy to shut down.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:39:16
$3,227 now in Coindesk Bcash just 0.07 the value of a Bitcoin haha
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:12:34
Well there was Segwit waiting for more than a year and it didn't get implemented because it bans AsicBoost...
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:41:36
You guys keep focusing in mining hashpower and forget the main drivers of price in markets.
Ok maybe because I come from finance and not computer engineering and I am no geek, but for me the most important thing is that BCH has no real demand, no real use. Right now the price is inflated because most of the people who hold it can't sell, o there is not the real volume out there...
What will happen when some things happen at the same time: people realise those swings in volume are exploitable by miners and not stable for a currency, then they realise miners are dumping everything they make at the same time they create inflation and then suddently in January Coinbase allows everyone to sell...
What happens when the difficulty adjustment is not enough to compensate for profitability because the price of BCH is under $100? That the coin is DEAD
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:58:00
I am having so much fun... Segwit bitches!
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:40:06
So then by increasing it to 2MB which seems acceptable to me, we have the scaling debate pushed away for some years at least. In the meantime we can work on Lightning Network and other real solutions to the scalability.
The only part where I am not confident is on increasing it 2x in a rushed manner. I think after SegWit we should pause.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:45:08
Thanks, I was looking for this:
Wallets will use segwit because users will demand it, and user will demand it because they want to pay lower fees (block space only increases if you're using segwit).
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:57
Please do it!
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:03:28
That's why we don't really give a shit what Bcash does, it is doomed from the beginning.
We should care about B2X thouhg, because it is a serious attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:15:21
I want it to live enough so the "big blockers" have they toy and they stop shitting around in the true bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:12:49
Wow if this is true, next station is the moon
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:58:44
Well if there are coins that are already anonymous and there is a huge consensus in Bitcoin around anonymity, I think once the scaling debate colds down there will be good solutions to implement.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:41:27
They have been trying to pump it many times. With the result always being that the volume dries up and the price too. And it will happen the same this time. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:17:27
The hash swings in Dogecoin don't affect Bitcoin so it would make no sense to talk about Dogecoin in this sub. But the hash swings from Bcash do affect Bitcoin and Bcash is an attempt to hurt and take over Bitcoin. I think it is reasonable to talk about Bcash when it relates to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:32:46
More dump possibilities. Will it hit $150 by tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:23:53
Thanks mate! Exactly what I wanted, does not matter if it is not fancy
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:20:35
While we need to admit that the scale of Litecoin is not the same than that of Bitcoin, we can assume that the market considers Segwit as a positive event. So even though I am not expecting Bitcoin to go up as much as Litecoin (I wish) I think it is reasonable to expect more positive momentum when Segwit gets active in 9 days.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:59:22
Even if hashrate moves, they will soon discover that it is not enough to promp it up with sudden volumes, that the price and the market mechanism depends on people really wanting to hold it. They will soon discover they threw away milions trying to promp it up.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:22
Yes we must wait but the wait could be better if just exchanges and wallets implemented Segwit. Also schnorr signatures which are also in the roadmap bring 25% extra capacity,without increasing block size. This added together with Segwit would mean potentially 3 to 5 times more transactions in every block
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:49:43
Not yet, will come with the next release as all the work went to building replay protection
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:17:31
What you guys are not taking into account is that the last attack was extremly expensive for the pumpers. There was somebody (or a group of powerful actors) pumping Bcash all the way up to $2400 who now lost a lot of money. I think they will think twice since if they don't succeed they are going to keep losing money. And succeeding to replace BTC is nearly impossible so is just a way of throwing money away.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:49:08
Forget all the FUD and back to work and the real value behind the technology and the developers
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:53:48
Well will see how it plays out. Even if it does an adjustment every block it will be at a disadvantage vs Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:40:18
What a fucking shitshow. And CEOs of major exchanges and companies were pushing for this? They should be ashamed
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:36:48
Bough another Litecoin just in case
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:20:17
To be honest I don't know what you guys are worried about. BTC tomorrow starts being 2 times more profitable than BCH to mine, so BCH gets blocks every 2 hours. Is a broken currency and no threat
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:50:57
I totally agree, we need to remember and we need to point at the bad actors that would have brought doom to Bitcoin if we hadn't stopped them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:42:29
You just need to look at the graph: price volume for BCH. It has happened the same every single time there is a volume spike
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:30:18
Obviously not even him believes it can succeed. And we don't know what he does exactly. Did he sell at +2000?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:27:07
No because they would have already left if they ever were to leave. What we are seeing is just the fluctuations that happened before whenever Bcash was more profitable to mine. And it switches in 2.5h to Bitcoin being more profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:26:29
It just takes time, still Core has not even updated its software (were busy creating replay protection for B2X). But don't worry: Segwit tx are cheaper so market forces will force adoption sooner or later
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:51:47
Well it depends, if they were pumping all the way through they lost quite a lot of money
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:02:42
In Bitcoin vs Bcash it will be a fight until death. One coin will eventually go to zero if is consistently below in price always. Because with each swing it inflates more than the other (has very low difficulty in comparison so small switch in hash makes it issue coins every minute) if this continues it gets to the halvening of the reward first, and then needs to lower its difficulty by a half. Each time difficulty adjusts in its favor hyperinflates at double the speed, getting to the other halvening first and so on...
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:32:18
SlushPool there is something we need you to do:
In 4 hours Bcash adjusts its difficulty and Bitcoin will become 2.6 times more profitable to mine. Bcash eliminates emergency difficulty adjustment this Monday with a hard fork. We need you to put some hashpower to Bcash until Monday to prevent an emergency difficulty adjustment. That way Bcash will be stuck for a while being 2.6 times less profitable than Bitcoin to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:14:31
Yes is pure unluck. Do you see the transaction in the other address? (pending confirmation) if so, nothing to worry. Will get confirmed soon.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:21:51
Same happens with stocks, people discount their future possibilities. Each day there are new promising technologies, Bitcoin just got rid of a chaotic hard fork... To me it seems like is 20% better off
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:13:07
It is cancelled. If you read carefully the email says they will be monitoring just in case. It is their job to be prepared but is not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:51:22
Could be, but they are not doing it for now
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:18:31
Mate are we looking at the same chart? Spike in August from $297 to 894 volume 4.2 bn, falls conrinuously with volume drying up until October to  314. 
All this happened to a lower scale if we check July.
Now volume artificially high at 5,3bn, don't you guess what comes when volume goes back to normal?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:30:27
Sooner or later
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:00:09
That then miners will go to whatever coin they think will survive in the long run so whenever there is a new technology implemented to Bitcoin which BCH can't use because no Segwit is going to get obliterated and no EDA can save it this time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:17:21
There was a coordinated attack prepared for when B2X would sink Bitcoin into chaos. Now that B2X has been avoided they launched the attack anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:58:29
But we need to keep the first layer as decentralised as possible.
Antonopoulos explains here why: 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:00:08
He forgot to mention that with second layers you can have it all but the article is actually ok
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:32:06
Bye bye Bcash
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:45
First they create the problem and then they propose their solution that only benefits them
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:27:13
It was actually due to release a week ago, but the stupid B2X fork without replay protection forced developers to work on building replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:44:50
I'll tell you why Bcash (or the currency that has less market cap) can not survive long term:
Currently Bcash difficulty is 10% of Bitcoin's. This means whenever Bcash is a bit more profitable to mine, some miners switch to Bcash. That makes Bcash issue blocks every 1-2 minutes and then adjust back difficulty and be less profitable to mine than Bitcoin. 
Whenever is the opposite, miners switch to Bitcoin but since Bitcoin's difficulty is greater the result is not blocks every 2 minutes.
Now, Bcash issues way more new currency than Bitcoin which decreases its fundamental value, but the problem is it will also get to the halvening of the miner reward first and during this period fi now needs 10% difficulty to be as attractive to mine as Bitcoin then it will need to lower it to 5%.
This means only if a small part of Bitcoin miners switch to mining Bcash whenever it becomes more profitable to mine than Bitcoin it will hyperinflate and create 2 blocks per minute or so.
This will also generate swings so bad that impair Bcash´s usefulness as a currency, decreasing its price.
What happens if price gets lower (or BTC price higher)? That it will need to adjust difficulty downwards again to be able to attract hashpower so difficulty 3% let´s say. And with this it will eventually get to the other block halvening first. And you can see how the downward spiral continues. That's why it either surpasses Bitcoin in market cap or dies slowly. And the further we go the harder it will be for it to surpass BTC´s market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:14:16
Well same as when they buy gold or other commodities but there is a fundamental reason behind as well. When you buy and store gold you do so because you believe the others will give it value. Same happens with Bitcoin, the more people acknowledges it has value the more people you will be able to sell it to, so that"s a value feature for me.
I understand your concerns but there is a reason why some coins keep adding value and some go down and is the quality of the technology and the broad acceptance. Even if price tanks you will still be able to sell it at some value. Get my point?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:35:42
I think the difficulty adjustment is slightly earlier. And then if they stop EDA Bcash will be stuck for a while being 2,5 times less profitable to.mine
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:42:59
It does not work that way. You dont have to open a channel with everyone you want to do a transaction with. You open a Lightning wallet and then you are set to transact with everyone (once the network is spread and up and running)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:49:32
No, because it already happened in August and went back to 300
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:08:53
And they are free to do so, time will tell
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:07
Yes it is true that this term would "sell" a lot to the average Joe. Let´s use it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:43:51
Lookup xapo for instance
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:34:03
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:49:51
However, he has taken a position in favour of Segwit and Lightning on the scaling debate and he argues here why is not possible to scale just by increasing the blocksize: 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:32:09
And today you will fuck up again if you don't buy
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:55:14
In London I went to an ATM that required nothing. I just put there 400 worth of cash and it sent me the Bitcoin without any sort of identification. In this case I do think is worth to pay higher fees and remain anonymous.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:19:20
With 40% of the hashpower (and others have yet to issue official statements) Bitcoin can easily keep going. There will be some slow confirmations and high fees for a couple of weeks but B2X coin will be obliterated 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:17:16
As I understand BCH is going to implement a hard fork tomorrow which has as objective to stop the hash swings that make BCH go from 1 min blocks to 2 h blocks. Basically I think they will now adjust difficulty every block, to make it be as close to 10min block as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:11:29
No worries is because Bcash is being annoying with oscillation of hashrate. In 1 day Bitcoin will be 2X times profitable to mine and transactions will be cleared
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:28:16
Is being tested, but still quite a few time until is ready for "user friendly use"
I think right now we should focus on putting pressure on exchanges and wallets to implement Segwit, that would buy us quite a lot of time since if we get 80-100% usage size of the block will be 3-4MB which is a huge change, could buy us years until fees are that high again, and Lightning Network could be ready in approx a year
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:21:35
But with this algorithm BCash would just adjust the difficulty up progressively every block. If they wanted to do so then this new algorithm is not a good plan
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:56:39
Old news already, I will stop opening those threads
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:37:56
In hash equilibrium regardig price and difficulty. However BCH gets first to the halvening so will have to lower difficulty from 14% to 7% or even less depending on price. At those levels at every small swing due to price even if only 10% of BTC hashrate goes to BCH it will hyperinflate. If it hyperinflates you know who will get to the next halvening of mining reward? Exactly. 
Also if it inflates faster it depreciates in value so needs to lower difficulty. In the end difficulty in Bcash will be so low in comparison that somebody will do a 51% attack and end its misery
Having the same POW is always bad for the cheaper currency
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:58:23
Most people don't save because actually in fiat does not make sense. (unless you know how to invest but that means risk) the currency in itself depreciates every year so indebted governments can pay their bills. Housing prices are going up.. No shit because people is looking for a safe haven on where tk store their value. Bitcoin is something new because it id liquid and fungible and actually stores value since no government can alter its inflation.
If governments actually had to pay in Bitcoin they would not go into so much debt
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:26:00
Short term the best solution is at our reach: Segwit. We just need to push for more adoption.
Long term, great technologies are coming like Lightning. But let´s let those technologies develop. Short term we have enough space if everyone adopts Segwit, so if you want to help BTC you know what you need to do!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:29:25
Means less fees if you send BTC from a Segwit address
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:26:09
Is happening in 3 hours
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:26:34
They have yet to explain why they were blocking Segwit. All the FUD and stuff they said about Segwit has proven COMPLETELY FALSE (remember they were calling Segwit "anyone can spend coin"?)
How can people trust this crew after lying deliberately as they did?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:06:41
Well it is clear that the long term solution are second layer networks. For now, Segwit adoption will already increase blocksize to 2-4mb. Enough for now, and second layer solutions will start to be implemented.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:31:14
I am not insulting other cryptos just Bcash and it is because its project is based on atracking and disrupting my favourite cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:12:43
Yes nothing to worry about then
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:16:13
That's the way to go now, a bit more Segwit adoption would mean 1.5mb blocks, enough to keep the mempool empty and fees low
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:34:22
No, not by itself and to be honest I don't care if we call it an atrack or not, but when it also comes with FUD (i.e. false news like Core developers abandoning BTC or most of hashpower abandoning BTC which hasn't happened) then I don't know how you want tp label it, to me is a hostile attack
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:21:52
Yes they currently have way more coins already in circulation
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:28:49
No, it will kind of even up and Bcash's difficulty will always be the % that makes its blocks be every 10mins. Miners will decide which one to mine based on future prospects of each coin. Or at least they will decide which one to hold.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:02:17
Well if you depend on an ecosystem and thete are bad actors conspiring to disrupt it why wouldn't you retaliate?
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:36:23
I would recommend Trezor
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:55:03
Because now is only 25% and it won't last long because of new Bcash's algorithm. So most miners didn't even bother to switch
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:39:25
All drama ends in 1 day when Bcash adjusts difficulty and BTC is 2 times more profitable to mine
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:16
And Samourai has always been on the right side of things: against Bcash, against B2X and in favour of Segwit (were one of the first ones to implement). We love you guys!
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:30:32
The volume is quite low, you would be surprised the quantity of people buying without doing their homework
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:01:46
I don't know in which kind of environment you are but my colleagues would never ask me anything just because I had gains where I was bearing all the risk. It just does not make sense. Do they also have a call on your portfolio of stocks or your house if it appreciates in value?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:24:25
In 50mins the hashrate will come back to Bitcoin as it will become 3 times more profitable to mine than Bcash.
Then it will take some time for the pending transactions to clear.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:21:19
For several reasons:
As of now although 85% of miners are signaling, some of them have already dropped officialy like ViaBTC and will continue to mine BTC.
Coinbase has said it will list BTC as the main coin for at least 2 weeks and then decide according to longest chain, market cap, etc.
B2X futures trading at 13-20% of Bitcoin.
Long story short there is no way B2X can survive. It will start trading at 13-20% range and there is no way miners can keep losing 80% of profits forever.
Bitcoin will start at least with 40% hashing power + other miners that don't want to lose money. It will be slow but it will survive.
Then there is no way on earth B2X can turn that around, even worse if it has 2 weeks with Bitcoin being labelled the main coin with the average joe buying it without knowing B2X exists.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:27:08
Well yes but the tradeoff is between doing things for the short term or having a long-term vision. Segwit will get gradually adopted (Electrum, Trezor and many more already support it) and this gives enough leeway until second layer networks come. If we need to increase the block size we will, whenever there is consensus and is within the long term plan, not just as a "patch solution" because this is not how things should be done.
Fees are high, right, but most of the problem comes from BCH interference. If BCH didn't exist fees right now would not be so high. So part of the problem is not block capacity. And the other part can be solved with more Segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:44:42
Definetely 2X does not make any sense right now. It is just meant to harm bitcoin and orchestrated by those who support Bcash or other alts
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:10:13
There was a battle over Segwit because it killed Asicboost basically. And maybe because it allowed for 2nd layer solutions. I don't see why anyone would oppose such an optimisation.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:01:18
There is no other reason to block Segwit and all of the reasons they provided have proven absolutely false
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:35:41
Yes but that change won't happen overnight and has already happened BCH being 2.5 times more profitable, simply some miners switch, make BCH issue blocks every minute for 1 day and it adjusts back to normal, and that happens because BCH is more profitable at expense of lower difficulty which means if 30% of miners leave BTC for 1 day is enough to make it issue blocks every 1 minute and adjust back
 This does not happen the opposite way because when BTC is more profitable is genuine, if 30% miners switch from BCH to BTC when that happens BTC does not go 1block every 1 min but 1 every 7 or 8 and can last for days
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:39:45
Which proves that if it weren't for Bcash interference if Segwit adoption slowly plays out Bitcoin is not at the moment under a huge fee problem.
It is under a fee problem only because Bcash is making hashrate oscillate between BTC and BCH and because miners have blocked Segwit implementation for over a year. Had we implemented Segwit a year ago adoption now would be 80% and we woudn't have any problem for the time being.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:16:46
Mate if you want to invest in Bitcoin don't trade or speculate short term. Just buy them and hold them for years. It is possible for somebody to have lost constantly money trading BTC through say last 5 years. But somebody who bought and held is probably retired now. If you enter in Bitcoin hoping to exit +20% you will probably exit if it is down 20%. Instead, you need to be willing to hold, maybe invest some amount you can afford to invest and forget about it. That's the right approach if you start by asking for the price short term you will get burned.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:39:43
It is clear that there is an influx of commenters spreading FUD, they are furious at the drop.of S2X and counterattacking
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:59:44
Market forces will do it since Segwit transactions already have lower fees. When everybody know, the platform not updating to Segwit will start losing clients.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:08:00
This, do we know when the official announcement is expected?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:23:32
Difficulty adjustment in 50 min which means BTC 3 times more profitable to mine.
Where do you guys check the hashrate?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:59
It is not a crazy drop guys, stop talking like that. Bitcoin is at all time high of 9 days ago and has avoided one of the major risks. Yes there are attacks and people with obscure interests pumping the other currency. But just wait and see, they can't artificially pump it forever. Will happen just like in August.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:22:50
No because if BTC dies there is no more store of value, you have a coin centralised where a chinese guy does whatever he pleases and could decide to do any upgrade (including increase miner reward) this is not a store of value anymore so if you want a store of value you shouldn't be neutral.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:56:24
It will become more decentralised even if we don't take acction. As Antonopoulos explained, the big jumps in Asics chip capacities will get smaller and smaller year on year and eventually it will be relatively easy to compete for other businesses outside of China. And there are many places with cheap electricity. I don't think taking action would benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:08:19
In this case he totally deserves it I am sorry
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:27:52
At least they won't be able to pull this shitshow again, now everyone knows the risks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:49:47
I bought at $7.200 and I am not worried at all. 2X was a big risk that has been avoided. Thinking Bcash is going to kill BTC is ridiculous. Segwit will start to get more and more adoption. And there are great technologies coming.
I am glad I bought at 7.200 I am fairly confident we will hit 10.000 when futures are announced
 Oh and BTC will be trading in futures, not Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:05:48
The technology puts at your disposition thousands of computers that agree on a protocol that allows you to safely store value and being able to transact anonymously.
There is no fundamental value really but the value is determined by its demand like a commodity. What is thre fundamental value of gold?
If Bitcoin becomes a widespread way to transact and store value securely and privately there will be way more demand than supply for this token, so there is room for appreciation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:29:13
It is just ridiculous to pretend Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin when it has 7-9% of its market cap and the Bitcoin blockchain has grown +12 GB more and Bitcoin Cash has 8% of BTC's difficulty
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:10:26
The market has still not realised how bullish this is:
- Major short term risk avoided
- Resilience in Bitcoin increased, is not so easy to take it over without incurring huge losses (which is why they abandoned)
- Community reunited (at least the big blockers will flee to Bcash so the remaining community in BTC will be stronger than ever)
- Core's conservative roadmap gains strength, meaning institutional money more likely to come
- Developers can now spend time on useful stuff instead of wasting their time building replay protection. We can discuss Schnorr signatures, Lightning network and upgrades to fungibility and anonimity 
- Segwit will get more attention from exchanges and wallets and once it gets more adoption fees will be relieved
- A threat to possible Bitcoin Futures removed, they will now become a reality and is HUGE
So yeah I just bought some more Bitcoin and I have never been so sure price will go up.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:34:14
In about 2 days they will be much lower
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:00:19
Also the scalability debate long term is one thing but right now fees are high because Bcash was messing up with hashrate from miners
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:17:02
I still don't understand why some pools like ViaBTC that have publicly stated they won't mine B2X continue to signal for it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:38:09
But so are other cryptos. The key is that block size can not scale forever, whereas second layers can.
You can build a payments system on top of the secure "gold vault" layer, but you can't build a gold vault layer on top of a more centralised payments system
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:06:45
But the spike I am talking is the August one, not the June one which is the fork. The companies will be holding as long as BCH price shows reliability. But the problem is that even if market cap is at 20% of Bitcoin it can not survive long term with the same PoW. Because the swings in hash are always bad for the currency with less market cap. Long story short because when there is a swing BCH hyperinflates lowering its fundamental value. Also it will get to the halvening of the miner reward faster, and this means difficulty will need to adjust further down, so when there is a hash swing will be worse and is a down spiral.
Either BCH overtakes BTC (and this is far far from happening) or it will not survive. And no, the hard fork is undergoing does not solve this problem.
That is why if somebody genuinely thinks BTC is in a long term problem of scalability they better place a bet on Litecoin or other currencies. I thin BTC is just fine. For now there is leeway for Segwit adoption and schnorr signatures can provide 25% extra capacity. Lightning network is the long term solution, but if in the meantime the situation got unbearable we would do an orderly and consensus based upgrade to 2x blocks. So yes, all my bets are on BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:09:57
Good stuff, miners will be coming back and transactions cleared.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:08
Of course is quite evident that this whole thing is a plot.
And it could have been really harmful for Bitcoin had they executed their plan when Segwit2x hit, but fortunately it didn't and their attack was futile.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:16:33
No shit so is Litecoin and Dash and all currencies with lower market cap, and they are more decentralised than Bcash
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:47:19
Well same as Zuckeberg or Gates yet when they measure they wealth they do it this way
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:30:07
It is not bad and anyone who thinks so does not understand how this works. Jus as with cattle the trading of futures will not be completely disconnected from trading in Bitcoin, because there will be arbitrage. Each time there is more demand for futures than Bitcoin and the price is slightly higher anybody could sell a futures contract and buy Bitcoin and vice-versa. So the volume of trade and the liquidity in Bitcoin will increase substantially and this will mean reduced volatility and higher price, making Bitcoin better as a currency. It will mean lots of institutional money poured into Bitcoin.  And it does not affect you if you hold Bitcoin. If there is any fraud or something in futures you will continue having your BTC if you hold the keys.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:58:24
Do whatever, if I thought BTC is not going to succeed I would bet on Litecoin or other coins not so centralised and controlled by a bunch of chinese miners
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:28:10
Other important stuff:
- Bcash can adjust difficulty down by not issuing more than 6 blocks every 12 hours
- On Monday there is a fork scheduled precisely to eliminate this feature
- If there is any loyal miner that wants to protect Bitcoin, they can strike a blow at Bcash by putting some hashpower on there temporarily and not allowing Bcash to trigger emergency difficulty adjustment
- If that happens and Bcash does not trigger the emergency difficulty adjustment it will be stuck with 2.63 times less profitability for a while and hashpower will come back to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:41:27
With Segwit, when it gets broad adoption, we can get enough relief for 1-2 years. Schnorr signatures provide extra 25% without increasing block size. During all this time Lightnining network will play out
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:26:01
But fees could stay as low as $2-$3 if there weren't those hash swings and that's entirely Bcash's fault. I mean $2 is not ideal but we can deal with it, the extremely high fees are not normal and not a problem of scalability but swings provoqued by Bcash's faulty difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:32:09
And the attack is pretty much avoided.
What do you guys think would have happened if this attack from Bcash happened in the middle of the chaos unleashed by Segwit2X?
Because that was the plan all along, and that was why Bcash proponents were supporting S2X.
Fortunately it all played out quite well for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:53:38
That´s why the real flippening comes when we use Bitcoin not Bitcoin backed by fiat or shops instantly transfering Bitcoin to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:24:51
But that is the key, if the difficulty is so low then BCH issues blocks every 2min making more inflation and provoking an adjustment upwards. Whatever currency has to have a fraction of difficulty to compete is at a disadvantage, there has only been stability when BCH miners chose to mine BCH at a reasonable loss. Otherwise there are adjustments ant the lower priced currency always loses
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:03:09
You don't feel the ups and downs if you are holding for the long term because you are convinced that Bitcoin will be massively adopted and will be worth hundreds of thousands at least.
Makes me cringe all the time when people talk about buying the dip or selling at highs. I just try to buy as much as my savings allow me at any price.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:10:06
Well, we will see then if this volume level is sustainable. I say no.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:44:00
I know, but even if it adjusts more fluently, all yesterday was the case of 1h blocks, when the price suddenty moves the other way awill be the case of inflation. EDA aggravated the problem, true, but the problem still exists because is based on the difference in difficulties which is not EDA's fault.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:46:09
It will take probably 2 days to clear enough the mempool, what people need to realise is that this is not the normal, this is because of BCH interference
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:34:34
But we need to be wary, increasing the block size is forever.
In the meanime we have Segwit which if it gets adopted it buys us a lot of time, and also improvements like Schnorr signatures that provide 25% relief of space, which combined with Segwit provides a huge relief for the short-medium term.
In that space of time we can start implementing off-chain solutions.
If then and only then there is no way of scaling, we can then talk a block size increase, but it should be the last resource as it comes with more centralisation which we need to avoid at all cost.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:52:11
Because then it serves all the purposes. If we just scale onchain then all the nodes will be run by big companies and easy to shut down by governments.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:13:28
I've been just linking this video whenever somebody asked why not simply keep increasing the blocksize
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:32:55
I think this will be a good event for the community, the most toxic big blockers will just care about Bcash so they will have their coin and we have Bitcoin, there should be no reason at all to discuss.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:55
In 10h there is a difficulty adjustment and BTC will be 2x times more profitable to mine. Most hashpower will be back to BTC and everything back to normal for a while.
If BCH can't get an emergency difficulty adjustment before the hard fork that is scheduled to take on Monday (which eliminates emergency difficulty adjustment precisely) it will get stuck there for a while.
I wish people would take that more into account than just price speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:28:45
Because they have been busy implementing replay protection for B2X. Segwit support was supposed to come in the previous version
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:21:30
"they" themselves cancelled the fork
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:20:54
But they would need to make BCH price higher than BTC to make it work and is not going to happen 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:27:54
It is more of an artificial pump like it happened in August. BCH won't keep trading at those volumes, which means is likely big players rigging the market as is trading is normally thin and they can do so
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:32:07
True compromised miners, thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:55:57
This proves the fact that most of the fee drama is provoked by Bcash and hash swings. They make a problem and then propose their solution.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:59:36
More opportunities to buy. Clearly this movements are done by big whales and there is no real demand for BCH. So just thank them for this opportunity to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:20:16
Just because fiat sucks as a store of value doesn't mean a currency can't be a store of value. Gold was both for many centuries
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:13:51
It was the same whales believing the same and being wrong again
By the way, Lightning network and 2nd layer solutions which allow technically for Bitcoin to handle as many transactions as Visa some day is a superior technology.
8Mb Bitcoin is not, is boring and many other currencies have it, at the expense of decentralisation and being a patch or a solution that can't scale and maintain BTC decentralised, like Lightning can do
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:16:15
Honestly it starts feeling a bit cringey-worthy all those threads panicking and talking like it is the end of the world because Bitcoin is at the all time high of 9 days ago... Seriously guys...
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:31:27
Like in August when BCH went from 300 to 1000 and back to 300? Casually there was also a spike in volume and is also coming from the same exchange. History repeats itself. That's the market but doesnt mean is not rigged
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:48:05
I support them because I am a user of Bitcoin and Core interests are the most aligned with mine.
BCH and B2X have other agendas which favour Miners interests.
I can understand why some people want bigger blocks. But ask yourself this question: Why were Miners and other big blocker parties eager to block Segwit? Why they don't want second layer solutions that are the only way to really scale Bitcoin?
As a user Segwit gives me lower fees, a soft fork which means less risks and the door to second layer solutions which can potentially increase Bitcoin capacity to billions of transactions per day with really low fees. Also Core developers are interested in keeping Bitcoin decentralised, which for me as a user is important.
Now take miner's interests: If I am a miner I don't want second layer solutions because I want the maximum of transactions and fees to come through my mining because I have made an investment. I don't want Segwit to open up this possibility and I want to continue using my Asicboost which Segwit makes useless. Those would be my interests as a miner. Do I care that long term the decision to increase the block makes Bitcoin unscalable at some point and more cenralised? No, I don't care because I will have already amortised my investment and will be retired at a Caribean beach.
So I don't support Core just because I like them or I think they are the best developers but because their interests are aligned with my interests as a user. I don't know what I would do if I were a miner. What I can't understand is people who are users yet support the interests of miners and not their own.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:11:14
Isn't it adjusting for every block then? Had I understood it wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:20:44
I have all time in the world for privacy. Whereas we need scaling solutions in the mid-term (I would say before 3 years) if privacy takes 5 but it is done correctly then so be it
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:13:37
They are, but we have in place a temporary solution that would bring us to lower fees for at least 2 years until we implement 2 layer definitive solutions. This temporary solution is called Segwit and if everyone used it we would have close to 4Mb blocks so 4 times more capacity.
Those already using Segwit have lower fees already. So convince exchanges and wallets to implement Segwit if you want lower fees.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:20:20
Well could seem like a ridiculous meme but that's exactly what they did in 2008
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:00:10
100 TPS would be huge. And if we talk about scaling it to 1000 TPS thats roughly half of what Visa does. Now good fucking luck implementing this capacity on chain like Big Blocker proponents want to do. It is simply impossible or can only be done with complete centralisation.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:53:56

Guys who cares? I bought at 7200 and I wasn't whining all the way. Would you buy Bitcoin at $200 or would you wait until maybe goes to $180? Would you be complaining that you can buy the dip if I offer you Bitcoin at $200? This is how you will be seeing this post many years from now.
Stop trading Bitcoin, it is stupid. Keep buying and hold, and when the true widespread acceptance of crypto happens you will be massively rich. 
Keep buying and selling and you will lose money one day and win the following and lose the day after. It is possible for a trader to have been gambling in Bitcoin since 2009 and have lost money. What about somebody who bought and hold? Does it really matter if it bought at a dip or a peak somebody who bought it in 2011?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:15:18
Is a soft fork so adoption is slowly progressing, at 12% now
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:24

Good news, the stocks that can be shorted have morr liquidity and less volatility. I know what you think and it is a bit counterintuitive but is really good news if BTC can be shorted
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:25:05
It is pretty clear: once S2X was called off BTC shoot to 7.800, then the attack started, together with the pumping in BCH and the FUD. 
They were preparing this for months, it is being commented on for months the need to pump BCH when B2X unleashed chaos in BTC.
Only now the attack is futile because S2X did not happen, but they launched it anyway.
Look at the volume of BCH bought and is coming 48% from the same exchange, exactly the same that happened in August and we all know the result (fell from 1000 to 350)
Just be patient, BTC is holding the attack quite well and tomorrow is over because there is a difficulty adjustment and BTC will be 2,5 times more profitable to mine than BTC
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:01:11
I think it will be improving now that we have some wallets like Electrum and Samurai. It is really important that Core can upgrade as well (got delayed because they had to work on building replay protection for B2X). But the multiplier effect of more people adopting Segwit shoud be enough in the short term
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:27:47
Part of the problem is scalability (which for now could be solved by increasing Segwit adoption) but most of the problem comes from Bcash and bad actors attacking Bitcoin.
If Bcash didn't exist rightn now we would have moderately low fees. Not yet as low as they need to be, but certainly not as they are now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:29:43
Yes, what you need to do is first send your BTC to another address, then take the seed for the address where BTC was stored before the fork and input in a Bitcoin Cash wallet, then your Bcash balance should show. Then sell and buy more BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:23:48

Is bad for Bcash that does not have miners out of China lol and is just alive because a single miner subsidises it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:04:17
Finally, Bitcoin will be able to clear the transactions and go back to normal.
And those difficulty swings should not happen anymore after BCH´s new difficulty adjustment algorithm (hard fork happening tomorrow)

There are debit cards like xapo that work with Bitcoin (you don't have fiat but Bitcoin deposit, the card auromatically converts the payment to fiat)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:15
Yes but BTC does not show those swings in volume that come and go, and it sustains the price historically
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:23:29
It will be over in 4h aprox. when BCH has a difficulty adjustment and Bitcoin will be 2.8 times more profitable to mine.
And if miners pro-Bitcoin play it well, by not allowing BCH to go under 6 blocks per 12h, the fork that is scheduled on Monday, to eliminate emergency difficulty adjustment, will leave BCH for a while stuck with 2.8 times less profitability in mining.

Guys everything is speculative nobody has any idea where the price of Facebook is going to go, not even the people who professionally work in establishing a price, remember the IPO? So of course Bitcoin is speculative like buying shares or a house, but you got to think about the utility it has which generates demand which justifies certain price. Which price is right tomorrow or in 1 year is impossible to know, you just need to do an educated assessment and choose if you want to own Bitcoin or not. Whichever decision you choose it will be a "speculative" decision.

Allows more space in a block because transactions weight less. Benefits you with lower fees if you use a Segwit address.

2nd layer solution.
Essentially a second layer blocks first some amount of Bitcoin through smart contracts and then you can transact with other parties with that. This second layer can potentially scale to hold as many transactions per second as Visa does (2000tps). You will never be able to do so onchain, or the blockchain blocks would need to be huge and the broadband you would need to verify those every 10 minutes would also need to be huge, in other words just a few companies with really powerful servers would be able to do it.
Instead, Lightning network and 2nd layer solutions continue to be decentralised.

Which confirms most of the problems were due to Bcash provoking hash swings.
And the same proponents of Bcash were the ones spreading FUD telling everyone Bitcoin was broken
And Segwit has not even started to play out (adoption still at 0.84%), when a majority people adopts Segwit the capacity of the network will more than double.

Segwit is getting adopted and 2X less likely to happen. Those are the big drivers, the rest is volatility.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:12:08
Like 3 centuries ago?
Catalans have been always forced to belong to Spain since they lost their sovereignty in 1714.
During Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) learning Catalan language was forbidden and Catalan books as well.
Right now Catalan separatists hold a majority of seats in the Parliament and the Government, they are trying to push ahead with a referendum but Spain is literally sending the military police to chase on ballot boxes and to try to threaten the population who want to vote.

Bcash was the guilty of the hash swings and problems Bitcoin was experiencing lately.
After they discovered the algorithm was actually harming them more than us, they started preventing the EDA from happening.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:02:50
I think ATMs are one of the most important parts of the BTC ecosystem.
Some of them are anonymous so you don't need to go through an exchange and reveal your identity. I think this is a really important point.
The only problem is that the fees are really high, more than 5% if you are lucky as compared to 1.9% in Coinbase through bank account.
But probably if they become more mainstream the fees will go down as well.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:11:41
Well if in 3 days we go from 4500 to 5000 then back to 4700 is really a dip? More like volatility

It goes through a phase of inflation with blocks created every 2 minutes average. Then in 15 hours a difficulty adjustment and BTC will be 3.27 times more profitable to mine and Bcash blocks only coming every 2-6 hours.
Then BCash will go through an emergency difficulty adjustment and start again.
Most retarded coin ever. It is only still worth something because there are miners with €13m accumulated losses that don't sell their holdings after mining because they have a political agenda.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:38:23
It is clear right now that most of people supporting 2X actually want to harm Bitcoin. 
It is not necessary now, it is a rushed solution, bad code, hard fork splitting the currency...
Clearly only someone who has other interest (Bcash) would support such a thing.

Many people moving currencies from old addresses ahead of the fork may be the most reasonable explanation
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:34:37
It is obvious that it will follow an exponential trend, since the more people adopt it the more people are likely to adopt it
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:28:49
Yes but we need the major wallets and exchanges to start using Segwit for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:31:01
What's the point of mining Bcash if what you want is for 2x to succeed?

The long term success of Bitcoin depends on the techology.
Certainly short term Governments can make the value go down by prohibitions. But if Lightning works, for example, that is more massive long term than what the Chinese government does.
So no need to disregard the fiat price of Bitcoin, just to keep a long term perspective.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:44:52
Wow this goes faster than expected!
I really have faith in Lightning, if it works, could mean definitive broad adoption.

Guys are you seriously talking about a "correction"?
3 days ago we were at 4500, we are now at 4750

BCash worth 5% of BTC
Feel sorry for the ones who sold BTC for Bcash
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:36:36
Bcash does not have Segwit thus not the potential to implement 2nd layer transactions that are the future.
But the problem with Bcash is that it was coded in a few weeks and they introduced what is called a "emergency difficulty adjustment" which means if there are no enough blocks mined every 12 hours it automatically adjusts difficulty.
This is being rigged by miners who mine nothing or very little in 12 hours (blocks coming every 3-6 hours) and then once drops in difficulty they go and mine blocks every minute.
Obviously this creates inflation in the currency because those miners get Bcash as rewards for blocks mined every minute. So the thing that was supposed to save the currency is actually slowly destroying it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:51:00
Thank you really useful, that´s all I wanted to know
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:56:29
The value of a cryptocurrency is a sum of its properties like security, anonimity and associated platforms like in the case of Ethereum.
But is also the userbase, the developing team and the network.
Bitcoin´s network will always attract more interest and more people which sets the value of a cryptocurrency in the end.
It makes much more sense to own Bitcoin. Unless you have a very specific reason to own other currencies.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:34:41
Proves B2X is totally rushed and unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:08:58
Well guys this is ridiculous, I understand opening a thread when we pass certain watermarks but Bitcoin is volatile, do we need to open 3 threads if we go from 5000 to 4600 back to 5000?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:18:34
As a Catalan I can tell you a few things:
Pro-Catalan separatist private entities have been seized €800.000 by the Spanish Government for no apparent reason, like they invented a judicial cause and froze their assets until it is resolved (probably will be resolved against but the assets are frozen when needed to campaign for Yes in the referendum).
They are cracking down on printing companies to confiscate pro-referendum boards: 
And they are threatening now to basically ban the democratically Government of Catalonia from office by cracking down on their finances. All this repression is still more outrageous when you consider that Catalonia is subsidising Spain, that is Catalans pay more money in taxes to Spain than it comes back. Yet they want to seize the already insufficient money that is coming back.
Which brings us to the conclusion: you want to have freedom? You'll have to control your finances.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:44:39
Best solution is hardware wallet, I just bought Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:29:05
Is because of Bcash. It has dumped the difficulty so some miners switch to mining it. For 24h or so (which will finish in 10mins) it gets blocks every minute.
Then Bitcoin will be 2.4x profitable to mine so all miners flee from Bcash and it gets one block every 6 hours or so.
In the process it gets hyperinflated and then miners sell their proceeds thus prompting a fall in price.
But in the process it harms Bitcoin because whenever is so easy to mine Bitcoin loses some hashpower
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:48:11
I have Mycelium and waiting for the upgrade.
However I just use it to have some hot coins, for the rest I have them in Trezor which already supports Segwit
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:28:43
Because their coin is Bcash, B2X is just a matter of hurting Bitcoin, they already know is going nowhere.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:32:45
First thing I will do when it becomes available. My node will piss on Segwit2X
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:28:18
If we are hitting those figures before the fork, if B2X gets obliterated like it will likely happen, this goes straight to the moon.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:20:22
Buy Bitcoin from an exchange, like Coinbase.
Then purchase a hard wallet (I own Trezor) and transfer it there.
During the fork and immediately after, don't move the coins and wait to see how things develop.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:18:07

@_date: 2017-10-29 20:29:48

Funny part is that when monetary policy stops being so accomodative (if they can at all) holding cash will beat the market year after year
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:30:13
If they try to switch to a coin that nobody uses and is worth 1/4 and they are losing money they will switch back to BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:27:39
It will be exponential because the more Segwit addresses there are the more incentive for wallets to include it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:34:24
Latest 24h Bitcoin is slow because Bcash lowers the difficulty so much that it is more profitable to mine, then for 24h it gets 1 block per minute and right now the difficulty has adjusted and Bitcoin is 2.4x more profitable to mine. So now Bitcoin will get the hashpower back and get back to normal.
Bcash is thus harming Bitcoin. It certainly is destroying itself in the process, since it gets hyperinflation on every swing like this, so it will be worthless as a currency in the long term but as a tool to make things harder for Bitcoin is pretty efficient.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:20:06

We will win without the need of PoW change, the market has already decided that BTC is the true bitcoin (S2X trading at 13% price).
Make no mistake, this is what will win the battle, which one is more expensive.
How long do you think miners can whithstand a loss?
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:31:37
Why nobody talks about the price?
If B2X starts at 13% BTC and everyone sells, but because it  has 70% miners transactions go through first and has more accumulated difficulty it means that a coin that is maybe worth then 10% or 5% of BTC becomes BTC??
I think one of the most important things will be market price, the true Bitcoin will be the one with the highest market price and everyone will continue to consider it the real Bitcoin.
Bcash has a longer chain, BTC has more proof of work, ok, but what if it were the opposite, would it really matter if Bcash value is 6% of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:50:49

Stupid Bcash does nothing but slow down Bitcoin what a worthless retarded currency.
Funny part is that with every swing Bcash hyperinflates and loses value. Long term there is no way for Bcash to survive other than getting close to Bitcoin´s price which is not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:48:34
No, this is not fucking games. We all have money at stake and Bcash was an attempt to harm Bitcoin and the finances of all of us. Had it succeeded it would have eliminated Bitcoin and its principles for a more centralised currency. There is no mercy, this is not fun and games, at least not for me that I have a big stake on Bitcoin.
