I'm also new to the futures thing, but there's one aspect I know is incorrect.  The futures traders are not actually buying coins.  They are cash settled contracts ([investopedia definition]( meaning that the contract is for "the cash equivalent of X,XXX BTC at $20k each in 90 days" not for "X,XXX BTC in 90 days" itself.
So they aren't dumping the coins on the market.  They are not directly affecting the BTC market as much as they are affected by the market.

FUD stands for "Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt" but what it means is an intentional disinformation strategy, used to manipulate a buyer/seller into doing something that you want.  
An example might be "I've heard BTC is used by drug dealers, so I'm sticking to AltcoinNameHere"   By suggesting that BTC might be a risky investment due to links to illegal activity, the person is trying to make their alternative look better.  This is disinformation, because all currencies are used by drug dealers.

This is like saying "Uncle Bob is going to Canada. Sure he knows not to carry around $11k in USD, but does he know you shouldn't carry around $13,692 CAD??? There's a lot to learn!!!"
Yes, people can be stupid with currency.  That's why most people don't use currency directly anymore, preferring to go through a bank.  This is some second rate FUD similar to what people say about buying online with a credit card.

It's just wishful thinking.  However, I'm seeing +9% on GDAX in the past 24 hours.  In any other investment, a nearly 10% increase in one day would excite me, so I can see how those with a very short term view are getting hyped.

It could somehow be related to the [January Effect]( in stocks.  Maybe people selling off BTC to raise money for stock purchases, or something like that.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:01:23
The problem with your comparison is that you're comparing currency to other financial tools like debit and credit cards.  Bitcoin is not a credit card.  If you want the protections of those types of instruments, you should use them.  It's cryptoCURRENCY and should be treated with the same protection as any other currency.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:35:09
Liqudating your position is basically abandoning your bet at where the price will go.  
So if today the price of BTC is 15k and you have a futures contract saying it will go up to 17k by a certain date, you're betting it will go up 2k by the time the contract is due.  If the price falls to 12k suddenly, it now needs to recover 5k to make your 17k price.  You might think that's unlikely and pull out.  That's the big picture of what a liquidation means.
With shorts, you're betting the price goes down.  So when the price spikes up, people liquidate when they think the price is going to stay up (rather than just bounce back down in an hour).
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:09:29
If you can get another for 9.3k, I would.  In that quantity the difference between 9300 and 8300 is only $125, so I wouldn't hold out waiting for that.  May have missed that chance, looking at the current price.

No actual bitcoins are being purchased for these futures.  They are all [cash settled]( meaning that you're buying a contract for the USD equivalent of the BTC price.  If any bitcoin is being purchased by anyone involved in futures trading, it's for market manipulation.

It's as risky as doing everything in person with cash.  I'd rather use a credit card that lets me pay the balance in BTC than pay with cryptocurrency directly.  That's how I use my dollars now, so why not?

I don't know how it works in Canada, but in the US, structuring multiple transfers to avoid the $10k limit is illegal. :/

To point 4: Anyone can get a six month extension, just by asking for one.  The taxes are still due, but the late penalty is small enough that it might be worth waiting, rather than selling off now.  If I was a noob who day traded my way into a bunch of taxes, I'd probably just file for an automatic extension and then hope to get lucky before the deadline.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:17:54
Laws vary, but at least in the US that is incorrect.  When you sell BTC for USD, even if you keep the money on the exchange, you've made a profit and owe capital gains taxes.  Following the strategy above of buying on Friday and selling back on Sunday for 23% more, you'd owe taxes on that increase.
Example:  If is in the US and buys 1 BTC for $10,000 on Friday, then sells it for 12,300 USD on Sunday (a 23% increase), they now have made a short term capital gain of $2,300.  For tax purposes, short term gains like this are considered ordinary income.  Depending on the tax bracket, they would owe $230-$851 in taxes on that gain.
Usually this is no problem, if you plan ahead.  Just set aside X% of your profits when you rebuy.  The problem comes when someone tries to do this over and over, and doesn't set aside taxes.

That post is someone who wants BTC to have a high price saying, effectively, "Haha someone who shorted $3,032,719 USD worth of BTC at the price 1 BTC = $16,031 USD just had to abandon their position" [because the price went up, not down].  They are happy the people betting against the BTC price are being forced out.

It makes sense, because people see litecoin as a safe place to go when BTC prices are going crazy.  
You're seeing some combination of this:
"BTC is going up! Better grab those funds stashed in LTC to buy some."
"BTC is going down!  Better park some of these funds in LTC so I don't lose too much."

The up side is the unconfirmed transactions in the blockchain is down about 25% from where it was this time yesterday too.

It depends on where you live, but in the US if you make money from the sale of something, you owe capital gains taxes. 
For example: If he bought $100 of BTC every 4 weeks for a year, that's $1300.  When he sells that BTC for $6800 he would need to pay capital gains taxes on the $5500 profit he made.  Now compare that to buying $25 worth of BTC every week for a year.  52 x $25 is also $1300, so the amounts will be the same.  It's just that now he has 52 transactions to keep track of instead of 13.

They are the same company, so why not move to GDAX and save on fees?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:29:21
If you're buying the same amount over time, monthly will be a lot fewer transactions, which will make things like taxes easier to keep track of.  Otherwise, they are probably about the same.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:03:56
I don't know enough about the details of the market to be able to answer that.  I just know it gets worse for them the higher the price goes, so you want to get out fast when it goes against you.
They are offering to sell roughly 189 BTC at that price, so if the price goes to 20k when the contract is due, they'd lose $750k.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:02:53
Just to add to this, if you've taken any microeconomics lessons before you may have seen a supply/demand graph.  ([here's one](
Think of the green part as the demand for BTC in USD.  On the left side of the graph, the price is low, so people want to buy lots of BTC.  As the price goes up (toward the right) there are fewer people wanting to buy it at that price.   Eventually the price gets too high, so the number of people wanting to buy is zero.
The red is the supply.  Along the right side of the graph, the price is high so tons of people want to sell.  As you move toward the left, the price lowers, so fewer people are interested in selling.  Eventually the price gets too low for sellers, so nobody wants to sell any, making the supply zero.
Where the two lines intersect is the point of equilibrium, where there is a buyer happy with the price paid and a seller happy with the price received.  Here is where a trade happens.  This intersection is the current market price.

Here's another link that worked yesterday when the CBOE system crashed.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:24
I think your question is something like this:
I paid $10,000 for 1 BTC and now the price is $15,000 for 1 BTC. Can I just sell 0.5 BTC for $7,500, which is less than the $10,000 I initially paid, and avoid taxes?   
The answer is no.  Your gain would be $7500 minus the cost of 0.5 BTC, in this case $5000.  So you would owe taxes on that $2500 of income.  You would not owe taxes on the remaining 0.5 BTC that you have, until you sell it.

Right, but if Disney started referring to Disney Dollars as "the Dollar" and USD as something like "Uncle Sam Dollars" you wouldn't say "hmm, very contentious. Maybe..."  
You're right that it's important to know which currency you are talking about.  There's the famous one, and then there's the one that was created with a name similar to the famous one so that people would assume it's just as good.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:51:29
I don't think there's a way to do it, but since you can buy LTC with BTC directly, it would be nice if you could set it up to skip the USD step, and just auto-buy LTC based on the price of BTC.  Basically a stop order that cashed out in LTC instead of USD.  You can manually do this, but setting limit/stop orders for LTC is based on the LTC price, not the BTC price.

Just to be clear, I'm not advising that someone try to time the market and buy the dips and sell the peaks. Trying to time the market like that is a good way to lose money when you're wrong.  I was just using the numbers provided to demonstrate that avoiding taxes at the expense of gains isn't always the best strategy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:57:43
The moving of something between markets to take advantage of the local price differences is called arbitrage, and in some cases it's a way to make money.  Probably at the scale you or I are trading, moving BTC between exchanges fast enough to take advantage of the price differences would be difficult.  
But to answer your question: Yes.  You can move BTC into and out of exchanges if you'd like.  Some, like GDAX for example, even pay the transfer fee for you.

Okay let's say you were really lucky and got in at $250/BTC.  Then the price hits $18k.  Then the price falls and you buy back in at $10k.  Six months in the future comes and now you sell at $40k.  You're suggesting it would have been better to hold from $250 to $40k instead of selling and rebuying along the way.
Let's do the math...
Using 10 BTC as an example, you buy at $250 over a year ago.  That's $2500 in dirty fiat money, gaining you 10 beautiful bitcoins.  
Now bitcoin is worth $18k, and you decide to sell.  You trade in your riches for a filthy $180,000 USD.  You pay $26,625 in long term capital gains taxes, leaving you $153,375.  
Now the price has fallen to $10k/BTC and you buy 15.3375 BTC.  It feels good to be back.  Then six months later the price rises to $40k and you decide to sell your BTC so you can buy some moon boots.  You get $613,500 USD.  But oh no! Now you owe some taxes at the 33% short term capital gains rate. That's $153,375 in taxes, oof.   Your final balance is $**460,125** USD and 0 BTC.
Alternatively, you bought 10 BTC at $250 in the year 200X and hold them until you sell six months from now at $40k.  You get $400,000 and owe $59,625 in long term capital gains taxes.  Your final balance is $**340,375** and 0 BTC.
Avoiding taxes isn't everything.

Let's use the current GDAX order book and do the math.  
You have 10 million and you want to buy.  As of when I'm writing this, the market price says 8815, but there aren't enough sellers at that price, so you'd have to buy up to 9000 and would be buying 1117.6 BTC.  So you've spent 10 million and raised the price $200.  This would be noticed, but probably wouldn't greatly affect the market.  Also factored in to that was a 0.25% taker fee, which was $25,000.
At 1117.6 BTC per $10 million, your average price is about $8947.75. To make 1% profit you need to sell for an average of 9059.60 BTC/USD.  
Now let's assume you already have the BTC on hand.  What would selling 1117.6 BTC do to the market right now?  Well again, you'd have to take a little less for each of them to fill enough orders to offload them all at once.  If you did that right now, you'd tank the price from 8815 to 8249.13, which is about a 600 drop in price.   Assuming the same levels, that means you'd need to wait until the price of bitcoin raised to nearly 9660 to sell your coins at a 1% profit.  You'd have to do it quickly, because this would definitely be noticed.
Edit: fixed a couple of typos
