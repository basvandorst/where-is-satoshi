Woohoo! Merry Xmas from Aus! (my 1st tip!) Now how do I copy that goddam wallet address on my phone....

Aha! (I was just tooling around to get something similar) I started with the month as a year of this data doesn't seem to tell me squat (which is fine as there's been some secular/fundamental happenings for bitcoin in the past 2 months or so that give me the sense the current average of $40 for the year is goneburgers...)
I fancied some (arbitrary) support @ $110-120 (aaaaand... it's gone) but it seems the intensity of the bearish candles is waning and we're toying with oversold country
Personally I'm looking for a decent uptick in the 20day (coupled with a bit more blue RSI) before calling shenanigans

Hmmmm...can I enquire as to which moving averages are in the dotcom chart? 
I'm a bit of a technical noob and have been trying to make head or tail (or shoulders) of all this...
I've had a stab at [the current weeks hourly action with 20 &amp; 200 day weighted moving averages]( you can't have 3 MAs in this chart.
I included the relative strength index (which isn't screaming 'oversold' yet) but with the 200MA now declining it does look similar...

Well that's a hell of a lot easier! ;-)

That's on behalf of my mum this xmas (hopefully this goes thru as  for my 2nd tip I just gave the tipbot a rather generous donation for its hard work...by missing a decimal point)

I saw a tech talk recently where the guys were wondering if people were already brute forcing hashes on the blockchain for brain wallets...they put up 1BTC with the hash 'hello world' as a test...said it was empty in an hour :-s

The latest version of the client runs around 3GB of ram and gives me random C++ errors...I've got my paper wallets and am investigating other options until they release a new version

Me a few other BTC wielding reddittors are off to the Old Fitzroy in Sydney (accepts BTC) for ales after work! Not sure what's for dinner though....
@_date: 2013-06-17 04:10:37
What time?
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:57:53
No problem! You keep up that good work! (imma go tip beers until I drain the account ;-)

the fact that it gains value over time and promotes hoarding (is deflationary) has to be tempered by the fact you can't pay your rent, buy food to eat or put petrol in your car 'later cos bitcoins grow in value' you need to pay for it now. The caveat being Gresham's Law but I'd bet that would show the flaws in fiat in the long term compared to BTC

I've had that nagging feeling for the past two months :-( wait a week...price went up, buy some...wait a week, price still went up, buy some more :-p
