And people don't have legitimate control over their own labor?
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:44:19
So you're saying you don't expect people to pay their taxes?
@_date: 2013-09-19 14:16:56
Define these words as well, as they seem to make poor contextual sense.
(If a person does not have proper control over his labor, does he then have an improper control?
If a person does not have the right control over his labor, does he have the wrong control? 
If a person does not have good control over his labor, does he have bad control over it?=

No it isn't. Norwegians still pay for both medicine and doctor visits.


Education is mandatory. And paid for.


Noone is literally forced to live on the streets and starve anywhere. You *will* lose your house if you can't pay your taxes, though, which means you're out on the street, worrying just as much as any american.

Yeah, sure, society would be waaaay better off carrying your lazy ass with us...

Except you 'expect' me to 'pay' my taxes, which is really not anarchist at all. So you're not an anarchist.

No. That would imply that you shared the basic philosophy of anarchism but disagreed on the fringe.
In your case you agree on the fringe, but disagree with the basic philosophy.

Actually we're evaluation *your* theory of ownership, atm.
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:41:54
Define legitimate.
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:19:39
Define ownership.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:17:40
It is exactly that plain and simple, but I get the feeling that there is little point debating it with most people who benefit from that very theft.
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:40:03


So you're not anarchist at all.
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:37:09
Yeah, those dirty greedy egoistic assholes who run away from muggers and robbers just don't want to give anything back.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:44:29
Not at all. You're simply not an anarchist because you expect other people to pay taxes.
It's like claiming to be a filatelist while steadfastly refusing to own any stamps.

You heard it here first, folks. fratwhore thinks gang-rape is legal and fair.

Realestate is a bubble only if you think the rise of houses is a bubble.

I'm still trying to figure out what *you* mean by legitimate, and this post I'm afraid didn't do much to make that clear. 


No, it's your definition of ownership, so it's your job to figure it out.
Basically, your definition of ownership is some words you say are nonsensical in front of the word control which, based on the rest of your post, is an idea that is just as abstract, fictional and nonsensical as the descriptors you pre-pended it.

No, norway has or at least had a particular kind of solution for doctors where you can be assigned to a specific doctor, but if you need a consultation, you still need to pay for that, as well for any medicine you need to purchase. 


Uh, that's the exact opposite of free. Also, public hospitals are not free if you're there for a consultation. Ie, if you've taken a bad fall and you feel as if you may have cracked a rib, you pay for the consultation, if you've taken a bad fall and broken your back, you don't get charged. 


Which of course is not at all what you said in your earlier comment, so I commend you for walking that statement down.


It was pretty easy when I did it.
