The only complaints I ever had were wait times for a GP.  Certainly o never thought that NI was all that high considering what you get if you are ever ill (my dad had a kidney transplant etc all for 'free')

Weird that its always Americans arguing against social healthcare - never people from countries that actually have it.  Why is that?  If it's a bad thing you'd think there would be Brits and Canadians bitching about it..  yet they seem to think it's a good thing.

And it doesn't work fine in the UK? UK, France, Germany and Canada all have similar % levels of immigrants to the USA (Canada % is actually way higher than the USA) so that's no reason or couldn't work there.

Will these same regulations apply to bank notes?

If I understand correctly you are saying that they have a 360 degree, multi-platform offering that leverages a holistic approach to create an enterprise level turn-key solution?

Seems a weird one as it wasn't officially bought in $ so theoretically you could offer the price on your site as $1 but only accept BTC

Interested to know what you put down as the price for import tax.  I've always wondered if you could put the price in BTC and if so whether they would bother to try and collect the import duty?

Really?  The tory party (and new labour) don't get along with the City?  They seem to do everything they can to keep them all solvent.

For this?

Dunno. Here we just use RMB, yuan or kuai

After we have brought in laws banning encryption?

I won't argue that the proposal it is useless for its stated aims.  But as a way of keeping the population in check and stopping people from using cryptocurrency i think it would be perfect.  I know that the transactions aren't encrypted but if you think that a country that bans encryption is likely to be the leader in cryptocurrency then I suspect you are wrong.

Yeah it's pretty much the first rule of ux design.  If the user struggles to use something you built it's your fault not theirs.  If the aim is adoption then it's all about making something more accessable not bemoaning the general public's inability to administer things properly.

Unless they live in Shenzhen.  Shenzhen is Tencent country.  You better have Weixin too down there as a lot of places have been persuaded not to take Alipay.

About 6 months before that even Bill Gates said that the internet was a just a novelty and wouldn't be useful for business.

"2022 - Launch of Psyche spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center, Florida  
2023 - Mars Flyby of Psyche spacecraft  
2026 - Psyche spacecraft arrives in asteroid's orbit  
2026-2027 - Psyche spacecraft orbits the Psyche asteroid"  
I'm no scientist but surely orbiting an asteroid that is thought to have a nickel-iron core isn't quite the same as bringing back $92 billion of gold (per person in the word?) from outer space?
