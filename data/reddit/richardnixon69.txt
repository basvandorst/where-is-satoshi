I very much suspect that is the only thing propping it up. You're a fool if you think DHS is going to stop at their Dwolla account.
It may not know it yet, but BTC/USD on MtGox is dead for all practical purposes. This is huge. We need to move to another exchange.

80% of trades in the last 6 months on the exchanges that bitcoinity tracks have been done with American dollars.
I admire your edginess, but I don't think is out of bounds by having a US-centric discussion, at least until other countries start pulling their weight.

Yeah, I mean just because the Flying Spaghetti Monster has not blessed us with his noodly appendage descending from the sky to bring peace on earth doesn't mean he *won't*.
I haven't considered all possible worlds that have Flying Spaghetti Monsters so I shouldn't count him out yet.

Ultimately, I believe it will try to strongarm Japan into doing something. But for now I think we'll see funding options for USD knocked out one by one. US banks likely will be told shortly to block wires to MtGox.
Something else to watch out for is how MtGox responds to the DHS statement, and they've been worryingly silent so far.

OKPay is pretty shady and has higher fees. With several banks there have been reports of your entire account being frozen for trying to wire to OKPay. Also, they recently said they would only accept passports from US citizens for some verification, which most people don't have and takes a long time to get.

So you're saying all I have to do if I don't like regulations is just keep starting new companies and break whatever rules I like until it's shut down? No harm done to my other companies? I can just start a new law-breaking company?
I suspect the law is not as simple as you claim.

I wish some of the readers on would stop downvoting facts they don't like.

Their entire Dwolla account has been disabled.
