Please do more research before buying in because of your FOMO

This is the guy who taught newbies to buy XRP at $3. LMAO
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:08
Its up on the month?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:02
Where are you getting your numbers from?
Bitcoin long term trend has always been up
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:31
So who bought at 19k?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:20:14
Well, there is your answer. Faith in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:05:06
So you want someone with years of engineering experience to help you code an entire blockchain protocol for ~$1,500?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:39
You do what you want. But the best advice I’ve ever had was HODL.
This is from a guy who bought at 5k when it dropped to 4K and buying more at 4K before it dropped to 3k. 
You can never predict what the floor is and by selling now you might miss the floor completely.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:58
Yes. Sell all your BTC to me
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:55:01
Recommend r/PersonalFinance for this

With hardware wallets you can send portions of your hodling while with paper wallets you will have to send all your hodlings
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:18
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:24:26
Yes. No. No.

Cutest moon I’ve ever seen
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:54
Find the guy who bought at 19
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:18
I would recommend you save the money you plan on spending on hardware wallets and invest it in Bitcoin. 
An exchange is perfectly fine for a small amount and that $80 you would've spent on a hardware wallet could be used to grow your holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:10:26
Very cool. Unsure how many people will use it though
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:24:33
Higher likelihood that institutional money will Short bitcoin until a price they are comfortable with, before buying it up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:51
If you are on the reddit app. Click the three dots in the right hand corner. And click breaking r/Bitcoin rules
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:07
You didn’t expect to lose money? Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset.
Remember there is no such thing as free money only a balance of risk and reward.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:22
Brain Wallet (Memorizing your private keys) is technically the best way to store your Bitcoins.
But a hardware/paper wallet can be just as safe
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:42
Do you care about Bitcoin as a decentralized protocol or Bitcoin as an investment?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:14
Post your address?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:01:01
Well you can see it this way. Hardware wallet have:
- The security of paper wallets.
- The convenience of online wallets (Coinbase, Gdax)
- The ability to carry multiple altcoins, without having to manage multiple wallets.
Of course depending on your habit (I.e do you move your hodlings a lot) paper wallet might be better for you. 
If you want to send your friend BTC for his bike you can set your fees on Hwardware wallets that can allow to theoretically send it cheaper.

Stop looking at this day to day and start looking at it in decades
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:14
Coinbase does not support Bitcoin Gold or Diamond. If you want it move your Bitcoin onto a wallet that supports it
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:24:22
You can’t be serious

Satoshi died with Hal Finney. I don't think Time will allow that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:13
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:50:52
There is no such thing as a sure thing. Your investment could crash just as low as it could rise.
I would not recommend Bitcoin for you, but you've likely already made your choice
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:26
Look at this guys account. Created 22 days ago. No posts on crypto until now. Sock Puppet

Exchanges: Cash App, Gemini, Bisq (decentralized)
Wallets: Electrum (Desktop), GreenAddress (mobile), Ledger/Trezor (Hardware)
Education: [ [
Strategy: HODL
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:34:55
This is the next eye to decentralized exchanges. Instead of going through centralized exchanges like Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:27:29
The value of the house could be speculative.

If bitcoin dips 50% it would be valued at what is was 2 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:14:28
Yeah that makes sense.
Guess there is no way to avoid the transaction fees. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:40
This is why you have to own your wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:34:49
Coinbase is a very user-friendly exchange/wallet.
I recommend Lopp.net to learn more about Bitcoin's ecosystem

Damnit misspelled :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:39
When you use an exchange you are putting your BTC in their "wallet" because they own your "private keys". 
This means you have no control over your BTC.
You can move your BTC into a wallet you control (whether it is an desktop wallet, hardware wallet, or paper wallet)
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:59:01
This is the reason why some people have a negative view of the Bitcoin community. 
- See Bitcoin, the color green, and the word cash.
- Does no research.
- Gets triggered
- Initiates BTrash.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:54:47
I HODL because it lets me focus on the tech.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:42:56
1 week later: "Why is bitcoin still dropping? I am going to miss my rent payment"
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:07:58
You are confusing Bitcoin with exchanges. The Bitcoin protocol has never been hacked. It is as of now the most secure network in the world
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:18
You should sell if $300 is enough to make you even think about selling.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:15:35
It is all about trust. 
Do you trust the banks to keep YOUR money safe for you? Has their track record proven their reliability?
Do you trust that your government won't over-print their fiat currency and highly inflate its value?
Bitcoin is trustless and deflationary.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:57:48
ELI5: It "removes" unnecessary data from Bitcoin transactions thus leaving more room for transactions, which lowers transactions fees.
